non-Abelian electric charges manifests itself as a perturbative quantum effect
for the dual magnetic charges. Motivated by this possibility, we study vacuum
fluctuations around a non-Abelian monopole-antimonopole pair treated as point
objects with charges g=\pm n/2 (n=1,2,...), and placed on the antipodes of a
three sphere of radius R. We explicitly find all the fluctuation modes by
linearizing and solving the Yang-Mills equations about this background field on
a three sphere. We recover, generalize and extend earlier results, including
those on the stability analysis of non-Abelian magnetic monopoles. We find that
for g \ge 1 monopoles there is an unstable mode that tends to squeeze magnetic
flux in the angular directions. We sum the vacuum energy contributions of the
fluctuation modes for the g=1/2 case and find oscillatory dependence on the
cutoff scale. Subject to certain assumptions, we find that the contribution of
the fluctuation modes to the quantum zero point energy behaves as -R^{-2/3} and
hence decays more slowly than the classical -R^{-1} Coulomb potential for large
R. However, this correction to the zero point energy does not agree with the
linear growth expected if the monopoles are confined.

indicator relations calibrated with the Cardassian cosmology. This model has a
major interesting feature: despite of being matter-dominated and flat, it can
explain the present accelerate expansion of the universe. This is the first
study of this class of models using high redshift GRBs. We have performed a
$\chi$-square statistical analysis of the GRBs calibrated with the Cardassian
model, and also combined them with both the current Cosmic Microwave Background
and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation data. Our results show consistency between
the current observational data and the model predictions. In particular, the
best-fit parameters obtained from the $\chi^2$-analysis are in agreement with
those obtained from the Concordance Cosmology ($\Lambda$-CDM). We determine the
redshift at which the universe would start to follow the Cardassian expansion,
i. e., \zc, and both the redshift at which the universe had started to
accelerate, i. e., \zac, and the age-redshift relation $H_0t_0$. Our results
also show that the universe, from the point of view of GRBs, had undergo a
transition to acceleration at a redshift $z \approx 0.2-0.7$, which agrees with
the SNIa results. Hence, after confronting the Cardassian scenario with the
GRBs HD and proving its consistency with it, we conclude that GRBs should
indeed be considered a complementary tool to several other astronomical

whose decays are consistent with those of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson.
The Higgs interpretation of such a discovery is not the only possibility. For
example, electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) could be triggered by a
spontaneously broken, nearly conformal sector. The spectrum of states at the
electroweak scale would then contain a narrow scalar resonance, the
pseudo-Goldstone boson of conformal symmetry breaking, with Higgs-like
properties. If the conformal sector is strongly coupled, this pseudo-dilaton
may be the only new state accessible at high energy colliders. We discuss the
prospects for distinguishing this mode from a minimal Higgs boson at the LHC
and ILC. The main discriminants between the two scenarios are (1) cubic
self-interactions and (2) a potential enhancement of couplings to massless SM
gauge bosons. A particularly interesting situation arises when the scale f of
conformal symmetry breaking is approximately the electroweak scale v~246 GeV.
Although in this case the LHC may not be able to tell apart a pseudo-dilaton
from the Higgs boson, the self-interactions differ in a way that depends only
on the scaling dimension of certain operators in the conformal sector. This
opens the possibility of using dilaton pair production at future colliders as a
probe of EWSB induced by nearly conformal new physics.

of conduction electrons with only up-spin. We consider a situation in which
up-spin electrons are sequentially injected from the left electrode into the
dot through the QW and an exchange interaction acts between the electrons and
the localized spin. To describe the sequentially injected electrons, we propose
a simple method based on approximate solutions from the time-dependent
Schr$\ddot{\rm o}$dinger equation. Using this method, it is shown that the spin
reversal occurs when the right QW has energy levels of conduction electrons
with only down-spin. In particular, the expression of the reversal time of a
localized spin is derived and the upper and lower limits of the time are
clearly expressed. This expression is expected to be useful for a rough
estimation of the minimum relaxation time of the localized spin to achieve the
reversal. We also obtain analytic expressions for the expectation value of the
localized spin and the electrical current as a function of time. In addition,
we found that a system with the non-magnetic right QW exhibits spin reversal or
non-reversal depending on the exchange interaction.

lower bound on the classical channel capacity C(A<--B) in terms of the capacity
C(A-->B) for the case that the bipartite unitary operation consists of

C(A-->B)-C(A<--B) between the forward and the backward capacity depends on the

between backward and forward capacities cannot be smaller than 1/2. The

outflow located behind the leading blast-wave may produce an X-ray emission
brighter than that coming directly from the forward-shock and may explain four
features displayed by Swift X-ray afterglows: flares, plateaus (slow decays),
chromatic light-curve breaks, and fast post-plateau decays. For a cold
scattering outflow, the reflected flux overshines the primary one if the
scattering outflow is nearly baryon-free and highly relativistic. These two
requirements can be relaxed if the scattering outflow is energized by weak
internal shocks, so that the incident forward-shock photons are also
inverse-Compton scattered, in addition to bulk-scattering. Sweeping-up of the
photons left behind by the forward shock naturally yields short X-ray flares.
Owing to the boost in photon energy produced by bulk-scattering scattering, the
reflected emission is more likely to overshine that coming directly from the
forward shock at higher photon energies, yielding light-curve plateaus and
breaks that appear only in the X-ray. The brightness, shape, and decay of the
X-ray light-curve plateau depend on the radial distribution of the scatterer's
Lorentz factor and mass-flux. Chromatic X-ray light-curve breaks and sharp
post-plateau decays cannot be accommodated by the direct forward-shock emission
and argue in favour of the scattering-outflow model proposed here. On the other
hand, the X-ray afterglows without plateaus, those with achromatic breaks, and
those with very long-lived power-law decays are more naturally accommodated by
the standard forward-shock model. Thus the diversity of X-ray light-curves
arises from the interplay of the scattered and direct forward-shock emissions.

therefore, be rare, the possibility must be considered when examining
individual GRB/host galaxy examples. It is also tempting to use the large and
uniform collection of X-ray afterglow positions to search for GRB-associated
galaxies. However, we find that approximately half of the 14 superpositions in

duration of 9 hours. These observations are part of a program to study the
origin of magnetic activity in ultracool dwarfs, and its impact on
chromospheric and coronal emission. Here we detect steady quiescent radio
emission superposed with multiple short-duration, highly polarized flares;
there is no evidence for periodic bursts previously reported for this object,
indicating their transient nature. We also detect soft X-ray emission, with
L_X/L_bol~10^-4.9, the faintest to date for any object later than M5, and a
possible weak X-ray flare. TVLM513-46546 continues the trend of severe
violation of the radio/X-ray correlation in ultracool dwarfs, by nearly 4
orders of magnitude. From the optical spectroscopy we find that the Balmer line
luminosity exceeds the X-ray luminosity by a factor of a few, suggesting that,
unlike in early M dwarfs, chromospheric heating may not be due to coronal X-ray
emission. More importantly, we detect a sinusoidal H-alpha light curve with a
period of 2 hr, matching the rotation period of TVLM513-46546. This is the
first known example of such Balmer line behavior, which points to a co-rotating
chromospheric hot spot or an extended magnetic structure, with a covering
fraction of about 50%. This feature may be transitory based on the apparent
decline in light curve peak during the four observed maxima. From the radio
data we infer a large scale steady magnetic field of ~100 G, in good agreement
with the value required for confinement of the X-ray emitting plasma. The radio
flares, on the other hand, are produced in a component of the field with a
strength of ~3 kG and a likely multi-polar configuration.

images of H-alpha, [S II] and [O III] emission, we study the morphology of the
remnant and calculate the rms electron densities in different regions. We
detect an offset of [O III] and H-alpha emission of about 0.5 arcsec, and
discuss possible scenarios that could give rise to such high values. The
kinematics of the remnant is analyzed by matching individual filaments to the
echelle spectra obtained at CTIO. We detect narrow H-alpha emission component
which we identify as the diffuse post-shock recombination radiation, and
discrete broad emission features that correspond to the shocked gas in
filaments. The overall expansion of the remnant is about 250 km/s. The dense
clouds are shocked up to line-of-sight velocities of 250 km/s and the less
dense gas up to 300 km/s. A few cloudlets have even higher radial velocities,
reaching up to 350 km/s. We confirm the presence of the cavity in the remnant,
and identify the center of explosion. Using archival Chandra and XMM-Newton
data, we observe the same trends in surface brightness distribution for the
optical and X-ray images. We carry out the spectral analysis of three regions
that represent the most significant optical features.

employ and compare two observationally motivated structure measures: power
ratios and centroid shift. Overall, the structure of our simulated clusters
compares remarkably well to low-redshift observations, although some
differences remain that may point to incomplete gas physics. We find no
dependence on cluster structure in the mass-observable scaling relations, T_X-M
and Y_X-M, when using the true cluster masses. However, estimates of the total
mass based on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, as assumed in
observational studies, are systematically low. We show that the hydrostatic
mass bias strongly correlates with cluster structure and, more weakly, with
cluster mass. When the hydrostatic masses are used, the mass-observable scaling
relations and gas mass fractions depend significantly on cluster morphology,
and the true relations are not recovered even if the most relaxed clusters are
used. We show that cluster structure, via the power ratios, can be used to
effectively correct the hydrostatic mass estimates and mass-scaling relations,
suggesting that we can calibrate for this systematic effect in cosmological
studies. Similar to observational studies, we find that cluster structure,
particularly centroid shift, evolves with redshift. This evolution is mild but
will lead to additional errors at high redshift. Projection along the line of
sight leads to significant uncertainty in the structure of individual clusters:
less than 50% of clusters which appear relaxed in projection based on our
structure measures are truly relaxed.

expectations for cooler stars (Teff<15000 K). The calculated color excess is
systematically lower than literature values, pointing towards a possible
underestimation of effective temperatures. Moreover, we find two groups of
stars at Teff=14000 K and at Teff=27000$ K that present anomalies with respect
to the general trend and expectations. We suppose that the three peculiar
bright stars at Teff=14000 K are probably affected by an enhanced stellar wind.
For the eight Extreme Horizontal Branch stars at Teff=27000 K which show
unusually high masses we find no plausible explanation. While most of our
results agree well with the predictions of standard horizontal branch
evolution, we still have problems with the low masses we derive in certain
temperature ranges. We believe that Kurucz ATLAS9 LTE model atmospheres with
solar-scaled abundances are probably inadequate for these temperature ranges.
Concerning the group of anomalous stars at Teff=27000 K, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov

randomly drawn from the general distribution in the color-magnitude diagram.

  1. Proofs operating with depth-3 multilinear formulas polynomially simulate a
certain, considerably strong, fragment of resolution over linear equations.
  2. Proofs operating with depth-3 multilinear formulas admit polynomial-size
refutations of the pigeonhole principle and Tseitin graph tautologies. The
former improve over a previous result that established small multilinear proofs
only for the \emph{functional} pigeonhole principle. The latter are different

reveals a global asymmetry with a more diffuse and almost two times larger
extension to the north than to the south. The radio polarized intensity is even
more asymmetric, showing a strange bright ridge in the southern disk edge,
displaced to the downstream side of the local density wave. Magnetic arms can
be also seen in other disk portions, mostly avoiding nearby optical spiral
arms. Spatially resolved emission of hot X-ray gas from the whole galactic
disk, with its soft component closely tracing star-forming regions, is
detected. The slope of the local radio nonthermal-infrared relation is <1, thus
smaller than for the radio thermal-infrared one (>1). Using the radio thermal
emission-based star formation rate (SFR) we find higher extinction in more
Halpha luminous star-forming regions with a power-law slope of 0.83. The
galaxy's estimated mean SFR of 0.026 M_sun/yr/kpc^2 is three times larger than
in other spirals of similar Hubble type. NGC4254 seems to belong to the class

encounter at the cluster's periphery, which perturbed its spiral arms by tidal
forces and triggered a burst of star-formation which still maintains strong
radio and infrared emissions. Tidal forces could also sheared the magnetic

is evaluated among many electrons; that energy is linearly dependent on 1/nu.
The residual binding energies are also evaluated. The electron pair in nearest
Landau-orbitals is more affected via Coulomb transition than an electron pair
in non-nearest orbitals. Each nearest electron pair can transfer to some empty
orbital pair, but it cannot transfer to the other empty orbital pair because of
conservation of momentum. Counting the numbers of the allowed and forbidden
transitions, the binding energies are evaluated for filling factors of 126
fraction numbers. Gathering the classical Coulomb energy and the pair
transition energy, we obtain the spectrum of energy versus nu. This energy
spectrum elucidates the precise confinement of Hall resistance at specific
fractional filling factors.

insulating for x = 0.16-0.2 and show a metal/insulator transition for x = 0.22.
All samples are ferromagnetic although the saturation magnetization for the 16%
Ca sample is only ~ 70% of the expected value at 0.4T. We find that the FMI
samples have similar correlations between changes in the local Mn-O distortions
and the magnetization as observed previously for the colossal magnetoresistance
(CMR) samples (0.2 < x < 0.5) - except that the FMI samples never become fully
magnetized. The data show that there are at least two distinct types of
distortions. The initial distortions removed as the insulating sample becomes
magnetized are small and provides direct evidence that roughly 50% of the Mn
sites have a small distortion/site and are magnetized first. The large
remaining Mn-O distortions at low T are attributed to a small fraction of
Jahn-Teller-distorted Mn sites that are either antiferromagnetically ordered or
unmagnetized. Thus the insulating samples are very similar to the behavior of
the CMR samples up to the point at which the M/I transition occurs for the CMR
materials. The lack of metallic conductivity for x <= 0.2, when 50% or more of
the sample is magnetic, implies that there must be preferred magnetized Mn
sites and that such sites do not percolate at these concentrations.

parak\""ahler Lie algebra or a phase space of a Lie algebra in mathematical

study leads to what we call ""$S$-equation"", which is an analogue of the

to a left-symmetric algebra reveals the left-symmetry of the products. We show
that a symmetric solution of the $S$-equation gives a parak\""ahler Lie algebra.

solution of the classical Yang-Baxter equation corresponds to the
skew-symmetric part of an ${\cal O}$-operator. Thus a method to construct
symmetric solutions of the $S$-equation (hence parak\""ahler Lie algebras) from
${\cal O}$-operators is provided. Moreover, by comparing left-symmetric
bialgebras and Lie bialgebras, we observe that there is a clear analogue
between them and, in particular, parak\""ahler Lie groups correspond to
Poisson-Lie groups in this sense.

Bayesian theory within Markov Chain theory have enhanced its application
possibilities. However, the application possibility can be furthered to range
over wider scales of application (perhaps from nano- to macro-) by considering
the developments in Physics (in particular Quantum Physics). This paper tries
to present the results of quantum physics that would help in interpretation of
transition probability matrix. However, care has to be taken in the choice of
densities in computing the transition probability matrix. The paper is based on
available literature, and the aim is only to make an attempt to show how Markov
Chain can be used to model systems at various scales.

B 77, 125409 (2008)","10.1103/PhysRevB.77.125409",,"cond-mat.str-el",,"  Using the self-consistent Born approximation to the Dirac fermions under
finite-range impurity scatterings, we show that the current-current correlation
function is determined by four-coupled integral equations. This is very
different from the case for impurities with short-range potentials. As a test
of the present approach, we calculate the electric conductivity in graphene for
charged impurities with screened Coulomb potentials. The obtained conductivity
at zero temperature varies linearly with the carrier concentration, and the
minimum conductivity at zero doping is larger than the existing theoretical
predictions, but still smaller than that of the experimental measurement. The
overall behavior of the conductivity obtained by the present calculation at
room temperature is similar to that at zero temperature except the minimum
conductivity is slightly larger.

with integer coefficients is solved introducing a special partition of the de
Sitter world, where the coefficients of the forms lie, into separate domains.
Every class of indefinite forms, under the action of the special linear group
acting on the integer plane lattice, has a finite and well defined number of
representatives inside each one of such domains. This property belongs
exclusively to rational points on the one-sheeted hyperboloid. In the second
part we will show how to obtain the symmetry type of a class as well as its
number of points in all domains from a sole representative of that class.

presence of antiferromagnetic (AF) superexchange, strong Jahn-Teller coupling,
and substitutional disorder. At hole doping x=0.5 we explore the `bicritical'
regime where the energy of a ferromagnetic metal and a charge and orbital
ordered (CO-OO) CE state are closely balanced, and compare the impact of weak
homogeneous disorder to that of a low density of strong scatterers. Even
moderate homogeneous disorder suppresses the CE-CO-OO phase and leads to a
glass with nanoscale correlations. Dilute strong scatterers of comparable
strength, however, convert the CE-CO-OO phase to a phase separated state with
ferromagnetic and AF-CO-OO clusters. We provide the first spatial description
of these phenomena and compare our results in detail to experiments on the
half-doped manganites.
