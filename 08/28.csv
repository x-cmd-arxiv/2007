(appropriately defined) unbounded derived categories of modules over algebras

equivalence between the exotic derived categories of semimodules and
semicontramodules.
  Certain (co)flatness and/or (co)projectivity conditions have to be imposed on
the coring and semialgebra to make the module categories abelian (and the
cotensor product associative). Besides, for a number of technical reasons we
mostly have to assume that the basic ring has a finite homological dimension
(no such assumptions about the coring and semialgebra are made).
  In the final sections we construct model category structures on the
categories of complexes of semi(contra)modules, and develop relative
nonhomogeneous Koszul duality theory for filtered semialgebras and
quasi-differential corings.
  Our motivating examples come from the semi-infinite cohomology theory.
Comparison with the semi-infinite (co)homology of Tate Lie algebras and graded
associative algebras is established in appendices, and the semi-infinite
homology of a locally compact topological group relative to an open profinite
subgroup is defined. An application to the correspondence between complexes of
representations of an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra on the complementary
central charge levels ($c$ and $26-c$ for the Virasoro) is worked out.

Brownian motion density, $\KBtxy$, on the space-time-white-noise-driven
stochastic integral equation we call BTBM SIE, which we recently introduced. In
sharp contrast to second order heat-based SPDEs--whose real-valued mild
solutions are confined to $d=1$--we prove the existence of solutions to the
BTBM SIE in $d=1,2,3$ with dimension-dependent and striking Holder regularity,
under both less than Lipschitz and Lipschitz conditions. In space, we show an
unprecedented nearly local Lipschitz regularity for $d=1,2$--roughly, the SIE
is spatially twice as regular as the Brownian sheet in these dimensions--and
nearly local H\""older 1/2 regularity in d=3. In time, our solutions are locally
H\""older continuous with exponent $\gamma\in(0,(4-d)/(8))$ for $1\le d\le3$. To
investigate our SIE, we (a) introduce the Brownian-time random walk and we use
it to formulate the spatial lattice version of the BTBM SIE; and (b) develop a
delicate variant of Stroock-Varadhan martingale approach, the K-martingale
approach, tailor-made for a wide variety of kernel SIEs including BTBM SIEs and
the mild forms of many SPDEs of different orders on the lattice. Here,
solutions types to our SIE are both direct and limits of their lattice version.
The BTBM SIE is intimately connected to intriguing fourth order SPDEs in two
ways. First, we show that it is connected to the diagonals of a new
unconventional fourth order SPDE we call parametrized BTBM SPDE. Second,
replacing $\KBtxy$ by the intimately connected kernel of our recently
introduced imaginary-Brownian time-Brownian-angle process (IBTBAP), our SIE
becomes the mild form of a Kuramoto-Sivashinsky SPDE with linear PDE part.
Ideas developed here are adapted in separate papers to give a new approach, via
our explicit IBTBAP representation, to many KS-type SPDEs in multi spatial
dimensions.

observations. The model implies that the knots D, E, F, A, B, and C1 are
unlikely to be the candidate for the TeV emission recently detected in M87.

epoch-dependent G-contrary to his prediction- does not necessarily produce a

tests of GR in first approximation, the cosmological redshift is described by a
shortening of measuring rods rather than an expansion of space. Since the

consider players in cells of one-dimensional cellular automata. Each player
interacts with other z players. This geometry allows us to vary, in a simple

to implement numerically and we are able to retrieve all the previous results

stationary values. More remarkable, it permits us to keep track of the

criticality occurs, we calculate the critical exponent $\eta$ for the decay of

the system is required to be expressed as a sum of products of functions of the

of density is in turn a sum of products of functions of the energy and of the
magnitude of the angular momentum about the axis of symmetry. The product of
the density and its radial velocity dispersion can be also expressed as a sum
of products of functions of the potential and of the radial coordinate. It can
be further known that the density multipied by its rotational velocity
dispersion is equal to a sum of products of functions of the potential and of
the radial coordinate minus the product of the density and the square of its
mean rotational velocity. These formulae can be applied to the Binney and the
Lynden-Bell models. An infinity of the odd DFs for the Binney model can be also
found under the assumption of the laws of the rotational velocity.

wing. The asymmetric shape of the line is well described with the laor and
diskline models in XSPEC and strongly supports an inner accretion disk origin
of the line. To our knowledge this is the first strong evidence of a
relativistic line in a neutron star LMXB. This finding suggests that the broad

well. Detailed study of such lines opens up a new way to probe neutron star
parameters and their strong gravitational fields. The red wing of the iron line
from Ser X-1 is not as broad as that observed from some black hole systems.
This is not unreasonable for a neutron star system, as the accretion disk has
to terminate at or before the hard stellar surface. Finally, the inferred

thermonuclear X-ray bursts are likely caused by an azimuthally asymmetric,
expanding burning region on the stellar surface. The time evolution of the
oscillation amplitude during the intensity rise encodes information on how the
thermonuclear flames spread across the stellar surface. This process depends on
properties of the accreted burning layer, surface fluid motions, and the
surface magnetic field structure, and thus can provide insight into these
stellar properties. We present two examples of bursts from different sources
that show a decrease in oscillation amplitude during the intensity rise. Using
theoretical modeling, we demonstrate that the observed amplitude evolution of
these bursts is not well described by a uniformly expanding circular burning
region. We further show that by including in our model the salient aspects of
the Coriolis force (as described by Spitkovsky, Levin, and Ushomirsky) we can
qualitatively reproduce the observed evolution curves. Our modeling shows that
the evolutionary structure of burst oscillation amplitude is sensitive to the
nature of flame spreading, while the actual amplitude values can be very useful
to constrain some source parameters.

< T_k < 17 K. Compared to C18O, we find the NH3 linewidths are systematically
narrower, implying that the NH3 is tracing the dense component of the gas and
that these cores are relatively quiescent. We find no correlation between core
linewidth and size. The derived properties of the Pipe cores are similar to
cores within other low-mass star-forming regions: the only differences are that
the Pipe cores have weaker NH3 emision and most show no current star formation
as evidenced by the lack of embedded infrared sources. Such weak NH3 emission
could arise due to low column densities and abundances or reduced excitation
due to relatively low core volume densities. Either alternative implies that
the cores are relatively young. Thus, the Pipe cores represent an excellent
sample of dense cores in which to study the initial conditions for star
formation and the earliest stages of core formation and evolution.

the effective mode approximation (EMA) which yields the linear t_{1u} x H_g
Jahn-Teller problem whereas the Coulomb interaction gives rise to Hund's rule
coupling for N=2,3,4. The Hamiltonian has accidental SO(3) symmetry which
allows an elegant formulation in terms of angular momenta. Trial states are
constructed from coherent states and using projection operators onto angular
momentum subspaces which results in good variational states for the complete
parameter range. The evaluation of the corresponding energies is to a large
extent analytical. We use the approach for a detailed analysis of the
competition between Jahn-Teller effect and Hund's rule coupling, which
determines the spin state for N=2,3,4. We calculate the low-spin/high-spin gap
for N=2,3,4 as a function of the Hund's rule coupling constant J. We find that
the experimentally measured gaps suggest a coupling constant in the range
J=60-80meV. Using a finite value for J, we recalculate the ground state
energies of the C60N- ions and find that the Jahn-Teller energy gain is partly
counterbalanced by the Hund's rule coupling. In particular, the ground state

within R(2500) (362 h(70)^(-1) kpc) results in an integrated cluster
temperature of 5.1 (+0.9,-0.5) keV. The surface brightness profile of
RCS022434-0002.5 indicates the presence of a slight excess of emission in the
core. A hardness ratio image of this object reveals that this central emission
is primarily produced by soft X-rays. Further investigation yields a cluster
cooling time of 3.3 times 10^9 years, which is less than half of the age of the
universe at this redshift given the current LCDM cosmology. A weak lensing
analysis is performed using HST images, and our weak lensing mass estimate is
found to be in good agreement with the X-ray determined mass of the cluster.
Spectroscopic analysis reveals that RCS022434-0002.5 has a velocity dispersion
of 900 +/- 180 km/s, consistent with its X-ray temperature. The core gas mass
fraction of RCS022434-0002.5 is, however, found to be three times lower than

explicitly expressed in terms of a small number of columns and/or rows of the

original data. Our main algorithmic results are two randomized algorithms which
take as input an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ and a rank parameter $k$. In our first
algorithm, $C$ is chosen, and we let $A'=CC^+A$, where $C^+$ is the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of $C$. In our second algorithm $C$, $U$, $R$
are chosen, and we let $A'=CUR$. ($C$ and $R$ are matrices that consist of
actual columns and rows, respectively, of $A$, and $U$ is a generalized inverse
of their intersection.) For each algorithm, we show that with probability at

algorithms are the first polynomial time algorithms for such low-rank matrix
approximations that come with relative-error guarantees; previously, in some

exploited for the normal Type Ia SN 2006X, leading for the first time to the
direct detection of material which escaped the progenitor system. In this paper
we apply the same analysis to the peculiar Type Ia SN 2000cx, with the aim of
constraining the properties of its progenitor system. Using multi-epoch,
high-resolution spectroscopy we have studied the spectral region where narrow,
time-variable NaID absorption features are expected in case circumstellar
material is present along the line of sight. No NaID absorption is detected in
the rest-frame of the host galaxy to a level of a few mA, setting a stringent
upper limit to the column density of the absorbing material (N(NaI)<=2 x 10^10

the experimental observations reported for the Josephson circuits.
Specifically, we demonstrate that Rabi-oscillations, Ramsey-fringes, and

In fact, they are natural consequences of transients to phase-locking in
classical nonlinear dynamics and can be observed in a purely classical model of
a Josephson junction when the experimental recipe for the application of

therefore conclude that classical nonlinear dynamics can contribute to the

the internal C/O profile, which describes the relative abundances of carbon and
oxygen from the core of the star to its surface. Different evolutionary
channels lead to the generation of different C/O profiles, and these affect the
pulsation periods. We used C/O profiles associated with white dwarfs that
evolved through binary evolution channels where the progenitor experienced one
or two episodes of mass loss during one or two common envelope (CE) phases, and
two profiles from single star evolution. We computed models using these
different profiles and used a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the search in
the parameter space in order to find the best-fit to the observed pulsation
periods. We used three-parameter models, adjusting the stellar mass, the
effective temperature, and the helium mass of the external layer. Our results
suggest that binary evolution profiles may provide a better match to the
pulsation periods of GD 358. The best-fit to the observations is obtained using
a profile related to an evolutionary history where two episodes of mass loss
happen during two CE phases. The best-fit model has a mass close to the mean
mass for DB white dwarfs found in various works, and a temperature consistent
with UV spectra obtained with the IUE satellite.

In order to cover all self-adjoint boundary conditions for the associated
metric graph Laplacian, we develop systematically a new type of discrete graph
operators acting on a decorated graph. The decoration at each vertex of
degree-d is given by a subspace of $\C^d$, generalising the fact that a
function on the standard vertex space has only a scalar value.
  We develop the notion of exterior derivative, differential forms, Dirac and
Laplace operators in the discrete and metric case, using a supersymmetric
framework. We calculate the (supersymmetric) index of the discrete Dirac
operator generalising the standard index formula involving the Euler
characteristic of a graph. Finally, we show that the corresponding index for
the metric Dirac operator agrees with the discrete one.

restricts the variational function to a Poisson distribution. Hence, one has

regions surrounding luminous high redshift quasars using planned low frequency
radio telescopes. Our approach is to implement a semi-numerical scheme to
calculate the 3-dimensional structure of ionized regions surrounding a massive
halo at high redshift, including the ionizing influence of a luminous quasar.
As part of our analysis we briefly contrast our scheme with published
semi-numerical models. We calculate mock 21cm spectra along the line of sight
towards high redshift quasars, and estimate the ability of the planned
Murchison Widefield Array to detect the presence of HII regions. The
signal-to-noise for detection will drop as the characteristic bubble size grows
during reionization because the quasar's influence becomes less prominent.
However, quasars will imprint a detectable signature on observed 21cm spectra
that is distinct from a region of typical IGM. At epochs where the mean
hydrogen neutral fraction is ~30% or greater we find that neutral gas in the
IGM surrounding a single quasar will be detectable (at a significance of 5
sigma) within 100 hour integrations in more than 50% of cases. 1000 hour
integrations will be required to detect a smaller neutral fraction of 15% in
more than 50% of cases. A highly significant detection will be possible in only
100 hours for a stack of 10 smaller 3 proper Mpc HII regions. The accurate
measurement of the global average neutral fraction (<x_HI>) will be limited by
systematic fluctuations between lines of sight for single HII regions. We
estimate the accuracy with which the global neutral fraction could be measured
from a single HII region to be 50%, 30% and 20% for <x_HI> ~ 0.15, 0.3 and 0.5
respectively.

observed by spectroscopic techniques really represent the SG. Here, we report
spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) studies of
nearly-optimally-doped Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2 (Na-CCOC) with Tc = 25 ~ 28 K. They
enable us to observe the quasi-particle interference (QPI) effect in this
material, through which unambiguous new information on the SG is obtained. The
analysis of QPI in Na-CCOC reveals that the SG dispersion near the gap node is
almost identical to that of Bi2Sr2CaCu2Oy (Bi2212) at the same doping level,
while Tc of Bi2212 is 3 times higher than that of Na-CCOC. We also find that SG
in Na-CCOC is confined in narrower energy and momentum ranges than Bi2212. This
explains at least in part the remarkable material dependence of Tc

disrupt within the quasi-constant density cores of their host galaxies and
develop turbulent lobes of type FRI. With this model we recover the slopes of

a weak damping of this neutral mode will be present, and we study the influence

transition to the usual Eckhaus instability as the damping of the large-scale

The latter is accomplished using asymptotically consistent systems of coupled

following a Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach. These techniques are tested
against a set of cosmological simulations of clusters, with and without
instrumental noise. We project each cluster along the three orthogonal
directions defined by the principal axes of the momentum of inertia tensor.
This enables us to check any bias in the deprojection associated to the cluster
elongation along the line of sight. After averaging over all the three
projection directions, we find an overall good reconstruction, with a small
(<~10 per cent) overestimate of the gas density profile. This turns into a
comparable overestimate of the gas mass within the virial radius, which we
ascribe to the presence of residual gas clumping. Apart from this small bias
the reconstruction has an intrinsic scatter of about 5 per cent, which is
dominated by gas clumpiness. Cluster elongation along the line of sight biases
the deprojected temperature profile upwards at r<~0.2r_vir and downwards at
larger radii. A comparable bias is also found in the deprojected temperature
profile. Overall, this turns into a systematic underestimate of the gas mass,
up to 10 percent. (Abridged)

considered system includes two modes of perturbations: vortex and (spiral
density) wave. It is shown that self-gravity considerably alters the vortex
mode dynamics -- its transient (swing) growth may be several orders of
magnitude stronger than in the non-self-gravitating case and 2-3 times larger
than the transient growth of the wave mode. Based on this finding, we comment
on the role of vortex mode perturbations in a gravitoturbulent state. Also
described is the linear coupling of the perturbation modes, caused by the
differential character of disc rotation. The coupling is asymmetric -- vortex
mode perturbations are able to excite wave mode ones, but not vice versa. This
asymmetric coupling lends additional significance to the vortex mode as a
participant in spiral density waves and shocks manifestations in astrophysical

have been extensively studied in the past at leading order and also at
next-to-leading order of perturbative QCD. The radiative corrections include
large logarithms which have to be resummed to all orders in the strong coupling
constant in order to get reliable perturbative results. In this work, we
perform a first and extensive study of the resummation effects for
supersymmetric particle pair production at hadron colliders. We focus on
Drell-Yan like slepton-pair and slepton-sneutrino associated production in
minimal supergravity and gauge-mediated supersymmetry-breaking scenarios, and
present accurate transverse-momentum and invariant-mass distributions, as well
as total cross sections.
  In non-minimal supersymmetric models, novel effects of flavour violation may
occur. In this case, the flavour structure in the squark sector cannot be
directly deduced from the trilinear Yukawa couplings of the fermion and Higgs
supermultiplets. We perform a precise numerical analysis of the experimentally
allowed parameter space in the case of minimal supergravity scenarios with
non-minimal flavour violation, looking for regions allowed by low-energy,
electroweak precision, and cosmological data. Leading order cross sections for
the production of squarks and gauginos at hadron colliders are implemented in a
flexible computer program, allowing us to study in detail the dependence of
these cross sections on flavour violation.

molecular and atomic hydrogen. These models are the first that well reproduce
the UV colors and spectral energy distributions of cool white dwarfs with

equivalent to an $n$-component Luttinger liquid with central charge $c=n$. When
$q=n$, the charge and spin modes are decoupled, the umklapp processes open a
charge gap for finite $U>0$, whereas the spin modes remain gapless and the
central charge $c=n-1$. The translational symmetry is not broken in the ground
state for any $n$. On the other hand, when $q<n$, the charge and spin modes are
coupled, the umklapp processes open gaps in all excitation branches, and a
spatially nonuniform ground state develops. Bond-ordered dimerized, trimerized
or tetramerized phases are found depending on the filling.

On this line we close a gap in the literature deriving the Kaehler potential
dependence on vector bundle moduli and charged matter. Crucial in this
derivation is our superspace formulation of 5d heterotic M-theory taking into
account the Bianchi identities modified by brane terms. Likewise, we obtain the
Fayet-Iliopolous terms due to brane localised anomalous U(1)'s. After
assembling perturbative and non-perturbative contributions to the
superpotential, we study supersymmetric (adS) vacua. It is found that the susy
condition decouples the bundle moduli from the geometric moduli. We show that
M-theory supersymmetric vacua without five-branes can be found, albeit not at
phenomenologically interesting values of the geometric moduli. This result is
fairly independent of the choice of vector bundle at the observable brane.

spin glass phase, magnetic ordered phases and a Kondo phase, as the heavy

galaxy, NGC 5529, finding an extensive MIR halo around NGC 5529. The emission
is dominated by PAHs in this band. The PAH halo has an exponential scale height
of 3.7 kpc but can still be detected as far as $\approx 10$ kpc from the plane
to the limits of the high dynamic range (1770/1) data. This is the most
extensive PAH halo yet detected in a normal galaxy. This halo shows
substructure and the PAHs likely originate from some type of disk outflow. PAHs
are long-lived in a halo environment and therefore continuous replenishment
from the disk is not required (unless halo PAHs are also being destroyed or
removed), consistent with the current low SFR of the galaxy. The PAHs correlate
spatially with halo H$\alpha$ emission, previously observed by Miller &
Veilleux (2003); both components are likely excited/ionized by in-disk photons
that are leaking into the halo. The presence of halo gas may be related to the
environment of NGC 5529 which contains at least 17 galaxies in a small group of
which NGC 5529 is the dominant member. Of these, we have identified two new
companions from the SDSS.

  Mechanisms",,"Journal of Mechanism and Machine Theory 40, 8 (2005) 907-930",,,"cs.RO",,"  The paper addresses the geometric synthesis of Orthoglide-type mechanism, a
family of 3-DOF parallel manipulators for rapid machining applications, which
combine advantages of both serial mechanisms and parallel kinematic
architectures. These manipulators possess quasi-isotropic kinematic
performances and are made up of three actuated fixed prismatic joints, which
are mutually orthogonal and connected to a mobile platform via three
parallelogram chains. The platform moves in the Cartesian space with fixed
orientation, similar to conventional XYZ-machine. Three strategies have been
proposed to define the Orthoglide geometric parameters (manipulator link
lengths and actuated joint limits) as functions of a cubic workspace size and
dextrous properties expressed by bounds on the velocity transmission factors,
manipulability or the Jacobian condition number. Low inertia and intrinsic
stiffness have been set as additional design goals expressed by the minimal
link length requirement. For each design strategy, analytical expressions for
computing the Orthoglide parameters are proposed. It is showed that the
proposed strategies yield Pareto-optimal solutions, which differ by the
kinematic performances outside the prescribed Cartesian cube (but within the
workspace bounded by the actuated joint limits). The proposed technique is
illustrated with numerical examples for the Orthoglide prototype design.

similar kinematic properties. Each type is evaluated according to interesting
kinematic properties such as, whether the workspace is fully reachable with
four inverse kinematic solutions or not, the existence of voids, and the
feasibility of continuous trajectories in the workspace. It is found that
several orthogonal manipulators have a ""well-connected"" workspace, that is,
their workspace is fully accessible with four inverse kinematic solutions and
any continuous trajectory is feasible. This result is of interest for the
design of alternative manipulator geometries.
