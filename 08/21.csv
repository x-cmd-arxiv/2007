corresponding low-frequency 21-cm signal associated with the neutral hydrogen
distribution, using a large volume, high resolution simulation of cosmic
reionization. The brightness temperature of the 21-cm signal is derived by
post-processing this numerical simulation with a semi-analytical prescription.
Our study extends to high redshifts (z ~ 25) where, in addition to collisional
coupling, our post-processed simulations take into account the inhomogeneities
in the heating of the neutral gas by X-rays and the effect of an inhomogeneous
Lya radiation field. Unlike the well-studied case where spin temperature is
assumed to be significantly greater than the temperature of the cosmic
microwave background due to uniform heating of the gas by X-rays, spatial
fluctuations in both the Lya radiation field and X-ray intensity impact
predictions related to the brightness temperature at z > 10, during the early
stages of reionization and gas heating. The statistics of the 21-cm signal from
our simulation are then compared to existing analytical models in the
literature and we find that these analytical models provide a reasonably
accurate description of the 21-cm power spectrum at z < 10. Such an agreement
is useful since analytical models are better suited to quickly explore the full
astrophysical and cosmological parameter space relevant for future 21-cm
surveys. We find, nevertheless, non-negligible differences that can be
attributed to differences in the inhomogeneous X-ray heating and Lya coupling
at z > 10 and, with upcoming interferometric data, these differences in return
can provide a way to better understand the astrophysical processes during
reionization.

cooling at the relevant redshifts and simultaneously performs radiative
transfer and dynamical evolution of structure formation. Our major conclusions
include: (1) for significant HII bubbles, the number distribution is peaked at
a volume of $\sim 0.6 {\rm Mpc^{3}/h^{3}}$ at all redshifts. But, at $z\le 10$,
one large, connected network of bubbles dominates the entire HII volume. (2)
HII bubbles are highly non-spherical. (3) The HII regions are highly biased
with respect to the underlying matter distribution with the bias decreasing
with time. (4) The non-gaussianity of the HII region is small when the universe
becomes 50% ionized. The non-gaussianity reaches its maximal near the end of
the reionization epoch $z\sim 6$. But at all redshifts of interest there is a
significant non-gaussianity in the HII field. (5) Population III galaxies may
play a significant role in the reionization process. Small bubbles are
initially largely produced by Pop III stars. At $z\ge 10$ even the largest HII
bubbles have a balanced ionizing photon contribution from Pop II and Pop III
stars, while at $z\le 8$ Pop II stars start to dominate the overall ionizing
photon production for large bubbles, although Pop III stars continue to make a
non-negligible contribution. (6) The relationship between halo number density
and bubble size is complicated but a strong correlation is found between halo
number density and bubble size for large bubbles.

Poisson structure. The emergent gravity is intimately related to
noncommutativity, encoding those degrees of freedom which are usually
interpreted as U(1) gauge fields. This leads to a class of metrics which
contains the physical degrees of freedom of gravitational waves, and allows to
recover e.g. the Newtonian limit with arbitrary mass distribution. It also
suggests a consistent picture of UV/IR mixing in terms of an induced gravity
action. This should provide a suitable framework for quantizing gravity.

regions. There are four distinct topological phases: (1) Pre-reionization at z
~ 15, when the genus curve is consistent with a Gaussian density distribution.
(2) Pre-overlap at 10 < z < 15, during which the number of HII bubbles
increases gradually with time, until percolation of HII bubbles starts to take

trend for the nuclei in the sequence to become more luminous, within an
aperture of fixed physical size and after correcting for dust extinction, with
advancing merger stage. We derive K-band surface brightness profiles for those

the profiles with a ``Nuker law'' for comparison with other samples of galaxies

and fade for several Gyrs, it is possible that the properties of the Toomre
sequence nuclei would resemble theproperties of the nuclei of normal E/S0
galaxies. Our results therefore support the view that mergers of spiral
galaxies can lead to the formation of early-type galaxies (Abridged).

piezoelectric and electromagnetic engines are powerless over this size range.
Such engines could play the role of external actuators for the NEMS, being,

several works appeared demonstrating high sensitivity of the sizes3,4 and form5

on whiskers of the quasi one-dimensional conductor with CDW, TaS3. The driving
force for the torsional deformation is peculiar to the CDW systems and reflects
the transmission of the CDW deformation to the crystalline lattice. In
comparison with the piezoelectrics, the effect of electric field on the crystal

provide also a torsion-induced electrical feed-back (output signal) from the

starbursting galaxies were selected using criteria similar to that used to
define LCBGs at higher redshifts. The surveys were undertaken to study the
nature and evolutionary possibilities of LCBGs, using dynamical masses and gas
depletion time scales as constraints. Here we present nearly resolved VLA H I
maps of four LCBGs, as well as results from the literature for a fifth LCBG. In
addition, we present OVRO-MMA maps of CO(J=1-0) in two of these LCBGs. We have
used the resolved H I maps to separate the H I emission from target galaxies
and their companions to improve the accuracy of our gas and dynamical mass
estimates. For this sub-sample of LCBGs, we find that the dynamical masses
measured with the single-dish telescope and interferometer are in agreement.
However, we find that we have overestimated the mass of H I in two galaxies by
a significant amount, possibly as much as 75%, when compared to the single-dish
estimates. These two galaxies have companions within a few arc minutes; we find
that our single-dish and interferometric measurements of H I masses are in
reasonable agreement for galaxies with more distant companions. The H I
velocity fields indicate that all five galaxies are clearly rotating yet
distorted, likely due to recent interactions. Our measurements of the gas and
dynamical masses of LCBGs point towards evolution into low mass galaxies such
as dwarf ellipticals, irregulars, and low mass spirals, consistent with studies
of LCBGs at higher redshifts.

low level of noise (as a model of innovation) to the strategy adoption rules

independent paths connecting them, so that the failure of no single node in the

to consider bicomponents, subnetworks in which every node has a robust
connection of this kind to every other. Here we study bicomponents in both real
and model networks using a combination of exact analytic techniques and
numerical methods. We show that standard network models predict there to be
essentially no small bicomponents in most networks, but there may be a giant
bicomponent, whose presence coincides with the presence of the ordinary giant
component, and we find that real networks seem by and large to follow this
pattern, although there are some interesting exceptions. We study the size of
the giant bicomponent as nodes in the network fail, using a specially developed
computer algorithm based on data trees, and find in some cases that our
networks are quite robust to failure, with large bicomponents persisting until

  accepted by ApJ",,"10.1086/526511",,"astro-ph",,"  The collapsar model is the most promising scenario to explain the huge
release of energy associated with long duration gamma-ray-bursts (GRBs). Within
this scenario GRBs are believed to be powered by accretion through a
rotationally support torus or by fast rotation of a compact object. In both
cases then, rotation of the progenitor star is one of the key properties
because it must be high enough for the torus to form, the compact object to
rotate very fast, or both. Here, we check what rotational properties a
progenitor star must have in order to sustain torus accretion over relatively
long activity periods as observed in most GRBs. We show that simple, often
cited, estimates of the total mass available for torus formation and
consequently the duration of a GRB are only upper limits. We revise these
estimates by taking into account the long term effect that as the compact
object accretes the minimum specific angular momentum needed for torus
formation increases. This in turn leads to a smaller fraction of the stellar
envelope that can form a torus. We demostrate that this effect can lead to a
significant, an order of magnidute, reduction of the total energy and overall
duration of a GRB event. This of course can be mitigated by assuming that the
progenitor star rotates faster then we assumed. However, our assumed rotation
is already high compared to observational and theoretical constraints. We also
discuss implications of our result.

stars in Praesepe and 98 stars in Coma Ber are identified as candidate members

also investigated the stellar mass dependence of each cluster's mass and radius
in order to quantify the role of mass segregation and tidal stripping in
shaping the present-day mass function and spatial distribution of stars.
Praesepe shows clear evidence of mass segregation across the full stellar mass
range; Coma Ber does not show any clear trend, but low number statistics would
mask a trend of the same magnitude as in Praesepe. The mass function for
Praesepe (t~600 Myr; M~500 Msun) follows a power law consistent with that of
the field present-day mass function, suggesting that any mass-dependent tidal
stripping could have removed only the lowest-mass members (<0.15 Msun). Coma
Ber, which is younger but much less massive (t~400 Myr; M~100 Msun), follows a
significantly shallower power law. This suggests that some tidal stripping has
occurred, but the low-mass stellar population has not been strongly depleted
down to the survey completeness limit (~0.12 Msun).

background (SGWB), either of cosmological or astrophysical origin, bears a
strong semblance to the analysis of CMB anisotropy and polarization. The basic
statistic we use is the cross-correlation between the data from a pair of
detectors. In order to `point' the pair of detectors at different locations one
must suitably delay the signal by the amount it takes for the gravitational
waves (GW) to travel to both detectors corresponding to a source direction.
Then the raw (observed) sky map of the SGWB is the signal convolved with a beam
response function that varies with location in the sky. We first present a
thorough analytic understanding of the structure of the beam response function
using an analytic approach employing the stationary phase approximation. The
true sky map is obtained by numerically deconvolving the beam function in the
integral (convolution) equation. We adopt the maximum likelihood framework to
estimate the true sky map that has been successfully used in the broadly
similar, well-studied CMB map making problem. We numerically implement and
demonstrate the method on simulated (unpolarized) SGWB for the radiometer
consisting of the LIGO pair of detectors at Hanford and Livingston. We include
`realistic' additive Gaussian noise in each data stream based on the LIGO-I
noise power spectral density. The extension of the method to multiple baselines
and polarized GWB is outlined. In the near future the network of GW detectors,
including the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors that will be sensitive to
sources within a thousand times larger spatial volume, could provide promising
data sets for GW radiometry.

passage of energy and angular momentum through the horizon results in a change
in area $\frac{\kappa}{8 \pi} \Delta A = \Delta E - \Omega \Delta J$, so long
as this passage is quasi-stationary. A similar physical process first law can
be derived for any bifurcate Killing horizon in any spacetime dimension $d \ge
3$ using much the same argument. However, to make this law non-trivial, one
must show that sufficiently quasi-stationary processes do in fact occur. In
particular, one must show that processes exist for which the shear and
expansion remain small, and in which no new generators are added to the
horizon. Thorne, MacDonald, and Price considered related issues when an object
falls across a d=4 black hole horizon. By generalizing their argument to
arbitrary $d \ge 3$ and to any bifurcate Killing horizon, we derive a condition
under which these effects are controlled and the first law applies. In
particular, by providing a non-trivial first law for Rindler horizons, our work
completes the parallel between the mechanics of such horizons and those of
black holes for $d \ge 3$. We also comment on the situation for d=2.

invariant theories results in great ambiguities about the actual laws of
physics described by a given theory. A theory set up to describe one set of
physical laws can equally well be interpreted as describing any other laws of
physics by making a different choice of time variable or ``clock''. In this
article we demonstrate how this ``clock ambiguity'' arises and then discuss how
one might still hope to extract specific predictions about the laws of physics
even when the clock ambiguity is present. We argue that a requirement of
quasi-separability should play a critical role in such an analysis. As a step
in this direction, we compare the Hamiltonian of a local quantum field theory
with a completely random Hamiltonian. We find that any random Hamiltonian
(constructed in a sufficiently large space) can yield a ``good enough''
approximation to a local field theory. Based on this result we argue that
theories that suffer from the clock ambiguity may in the end provide a viable
fundamental framework for physics in which locality can be seen as a strongly
favored (or predicted) emergent behavior. We also speculate on how other key
aspects of known physics such as gauge symmetries and Poincare invariance might
be predicted to emerge in this framework.

imaging surveys that discover and obtain photometry for large numbers of
supernovae; so many that it would be difficult to obtain a spectroscopic
redshift for each. Using available supernova-analysis tools we find that there
are several conditions in which a viable distance-redshift can be determined.
Uncertainties in the effective distance at z~0.3 are dominated by redshift
uncertainties coupled with the steepness of the Hubble law. By z~0.5 the Hubble
law flattens out and distance-modulus uncertainties dominate. Observations that
give S/N=50 at peak brightness and a four-day observer cadence in each of
griz-bands are necessary to match the intrinsic supernova magnitude dispersion
out to z=1.0. Lower S/N can be tolerated with the addition of redshift priors
(e.g. from a host-galaxy photometric redshift), observations in an additional
redder band, or by focusing on supernova redshifts that have particular
leverage for this measurement. More stringent S/N requirements are anticipated
as improved systematics control over intrinsic color, metallicity, and dust is
attempted to be drawn from light curves.

system objects, Galactic variable stars, active galactic nuclei, supernovae

extensive spectroscopic follow-up program to identify SNe, measure their
redshifts, and study the physical conditions of the explosions and their
environment through spectroscopic diagnostics. During the survey, light curves
are rapidly evaluated to provide an initial photometric type of the SNe, and a
selected sample of sources are targeted for spectroscopic observations. In the
first two seasons, 476 sources were selected for spectroscopic observations, of
which 403 were identified as SNe. For the Type Ia SNe, the main driver for the
Survey, our photometric typing and targeting efficiency is 90%. Only 6% of the
photometric SN Ia candidates were spectroscopically classified as non-SN Ia
instead, and the remaining 4% resulted in low signal-to-noise, unclassified
spectra. This paper describes the search algorithm and the software, and the
real-time processing of the SDSS imaging data. We also present the details of
the supernova candidate selection procedures and strategies for follow-up

become more sinusoidal and the pulsed fraction increased with time. These
results confirm those derived using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and expand
the observed evolution to energies below 2 keV. The XMM-Newton total flux in
the 0.5-10 keV band is observed to be nearly constant in observations taken
before 2006, while an increase of ~10% is seen afterwards and coincides with
the burst activity detected from the source in 2006-2007. After these bursts,
the evolution towards more sinusoidal pulse profiles ceased while the pulsed
fraction showed a further increase. No evidence for large-scale, long-term
changes in the emission as a result of the bursts is seen. The data also
suggest a correlation between the flux and hardness of the spectrum, with
brighter observations on average having a harder spectrum. As pointed out by

massive starless clumps that might be gravitationally bound. Since our sample
is derived from a single molecular complex and covers every embedded phase of
high-mass star formation, it gives the first statistical estimates of their
lifetime. In contrast to what is found for low-mass class 0 and class I phases,
the IR-quiet protostellar phase of high-mass stars may last as long as their
better-known high-luminosity IR phase. The statistical lifetimes of high-mass
protostars and pre-stellar cores (~ 3 x 10^4 yr and < 10^3 yr) in Cygnus X are
one and two order(s) of magnitude smaller, respectively, than what is found in
nearby, low-mass star-forming regions. We therefore propose that high-mass

the rate of flow of information, problems of storage and management. The
difficulty which arises is no longer the existence of information but rather
the access to this information. When designing multimedia information retrieval
system, it is appropriate to bear in mind the potential users and their
information needs. We assumed that multimedia information representation which
takes into account explicitly the users' needs and the cases of use could
contribute to the adaptation potentials of the system for the end-users. We
believe also that responses of multimedia information system would be more
relevant to the users' needs if the types of results to be used from the system
were identified before the design and development of the system. We propose the
integration of the users' information needs. More precisely integrating usage
contexts of resulting information in an information system (during creation and
feedback) should enhance more pertinent users' need. The first section of this
study is dedicated to traditional multimedia information systems and
specifically the approaches of representing multimedia information. Taking into
account the dynamism of users, these approaches do not permit the explicit
integration of the users' information needs. In this paper, we will present our

cover the wavelength range 300-1340nm at a resolution of FWHM=1AA, for
metallicities in the range 0.005<=Z<=0.048 and stellar population ages 3 to 14
Gyr. These models are based on a recent library of synthetic stellar spectra
and a new library of stellar evolutionary tracks, both computed for three
different [Fe/H] (-0.5,0.0 and 0.2) and two different [alpha/Fe] (0.0 and 0.4).
We expect our fully synthetic models to be primarily useful for evaluating the
differential effect of changes in the alpha/Fe ratio on spectral properties
such as broad-band colours and narrow spectral features. In addition, we assess
the accuracy of absolute model predictions in two ways: first, by comparing the
predictions of models for scaled-solar metal abundances [alpha/Fe]=0.0) to
those of existing models based on libraries of observed stellar spectra; and
secondly, by comparing the predictions of models for alpha-enhanced metal
abundances ([alpha/Fe]=0.4) to observed spectra of massive early-type galaxies
in the SDSS-DR4. We find that our models predict accurate strengths for those
spectral indices that are strongly sensitive to the abundances of Fe and alpha
elements. The predictions are less reliable for the strengths of other spectral
features, such as those dominated by the abundances of C and N, as expected
from the fact that the models do not yet allow one to explore the influence of
these elements in an independent way. We conclude that our models are a
powerful tool for extracting new information about the chemical properties of
galaxies for which high-quality spectra have been gathered by modern surveys.

flows of at least 6-7 km/s. In sunspots closer to disk center, dark-cored
penumbral filaments exhibit regular Stokes profiles with little asymmetries due
to the vanishing line-of-sight component of the horizontal Evershed flow. An
inversion of the observed spectra indicates that the magnetic field is weaker
and more inclined in the dark cores as compared with the surrounding bright
structures. This is compatible with the idea that dark-cored filaments are the

study the multiwavelength emission in the post-outburst phase. XMM-Newton
observations on July and December 2006 added information on the X-ray and UV
fluxes. The source was in a faint state. The radio flux at the higher
frequencies showed a fast decreasing trend, which represents the tail of the
big radio outburst. It was followed by a quiescent state, common at all radio
frequencies. In contrast, moderate activity characterized the NIR and optical
light curves, with a progressive increase of the variability amplitude with
increasing wavelength. We ascribe this redder-when-brighter behaviour to the
presence of a ""little blue bump"" due to line emission from the broad line
region, which is clearly visible in the source SED during faint states.
Moreover, the data from the XMM-Newton OM reveal a rise of the SED in the UV,
suggesting the existence of a ""big blue bump"" due to thermal emission from the
accretion disc. The X-ray spectra are well fitted with a power-law model with
photoelectric absorption, possibly larger than the Galactic one. However, the
comparison with previous X-ray observations would imply that the amount of
absorbing matter is variable. Alternatively, the intrinsic X-ray spectrum
presents a curvature, which may depend on the X-ray brightness. In this case,
two scenarios are possible.

for objects of higher luminosity, with Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs,
L_IR>10^11 L_sun) reaching r_0~5.1 h^-1 Mpc. This would imply that galaxies
with larger SFRs are hosted in progressively more massive halos, reaching
minimum halo masses of ~3 x 10^12 M_sun for LIRGs. We compare our measurements
with the predictions from semi-analytic models based on the Millennium

GOODS clustering measurements, which are dominated by cosmic variance. The
measurements from the two GOODS fields are found to be consistent within the
errors. On scales of the GOODS fields, the real sources appear more strongly
clustered than objects in the Millennium-simulation based catalogs, if the

at z~0.5-1 is being hosted in more massive halos and denser environments than
currently predicted by galaxy formation models.[truncated]

hole potential in terms of this entangled state amounts to either supressing
bit flip errors (BPS-case) or allowing very special types of flips transforming
the states between different classes of non-BPS solutions. We are illustrating
our results for the example of the D2-D6 system. In this case the bit flip
errors are corresponding to sign flip errors of the charges originating from
the number of D2 branes. After moduli stabilization the states depending
entirely on the charges are maximally entangled graph states (of the triangle

investor is supposed to preferentially distribute capital to pools in its
portfolio based on the knowledge of pool sizes. The extent that investors
prefer larger pools is determined by investment strategy denoted by a tunable
parameter $\alpha$, with larger $\alpha$ corresponding to more preference to
larger pools. As comparison, we also study this interaction model on square
lattice, and find that the heterogeneity contacts favors cooperation.
Additionally, the influence of local topology to the game dynamics under

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12369.x",,"astro-ph",,"  We study the location of massive disk galaxies on the Tully-Fisher relation.
Using a combination of K-band photometry and high-quality rotation curves, we
show that in traditional formulations of the TF relation (using the width of
the global HI profile or the maximum rotation velocity), galaxies with rotation
velocities larger than 200 km/s lie systematically to the right of the relation
defined by less massive systems, causing a characteristic `kink' in the
relations. Massive, early-type disk galaxies in particular have a large offset,
up to 1.5 magnitudes, from the main relation defined by less massive and
later-type spirals.
  The presence of a change in slope at the high-mass end of the Tully-Fisher
relation has important consequences for the use of the Tully-Fisher relation as
a tool for estimating distances to galaxies or for probing galaxy evolution. In
particular, the luminosity evolution of massive galaxies since z = 1 may have
been significantly larger than estimated in several recent studies.
  We also show that many of the galaxies with the largest offsets have
declining rotation curves and that the change in slope largely disappears when
we use the asymptotic rotation velocity as kinematic parameter. The remaining
deviations from linearity can be removed when we simultaneously use the total
baryonic mass (stars + gas) instead of the optical or near-infrared luminosity.
Our results strengthen the view that the Tully-Fisher relation fundamentally
links the mass of dark matter haloes with the total baryonic mass embedded in
them.

Reynolds averaged calculation of the turbulent flow over a topography. We
perform a weakly non-linear expansion of the velocity field, sufficiently
accurate to recover the separation of streamlines and the formation of a
recirculation bubble above some aspect ratio. The basal stresses are
investigated in details; in particular, we show that the phase shift of the
shear stress with respect to the topography, responsible for the formation of
bedforms, appears in an inner boundary layer where shear stress and pressure
gradients balance. We study the sensitivity of the calculation with respect to
(i) the choice of the turbulence closure, (ii) the motion of the bottom (growth
or propagation), (iii) the physics at work in the surface layer, responsible
for the hydrodynamic roughness of the bottom, (iv) the aspect ratio of the
bedform and (v) the effect of the free surface, which can be interpreted in
terms of standing gravity waves excited by topography. The most important
effects are those of points (iii) to (v). We show that the dynamical mechanisms
controlling the hydrodynamical roughness (mixing due to roughness elements,
viscosity, sediment transport, etc) have an influence on the basal shear stress
when the thickness of the surface layer is comparable to that of the inner
layer. We evidence that non-linear effects tend to oppose linear ones and are
of the same order for bedform aspect ratios of the order of 1/10. We show that
the influence of the free surface on the basal shear stress is dominant when
the wavelength is large compared to the flow depth, so that the inner layer
extends throughout the flow and in the resonant conditions, and when the
downstream material velocity balances the upstream wave propagation.

density of dark and baryonic matter imprints important scales on the
fluctuations of matter and thus the clustering of galaxies, e.g., the particle
horizon at matter--radiation equality and the sound horizon at recombination.
Precision measurements of these scales from the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations
(BAO) and the large scale shape of the power spectrum of galaxy clustering
provide constraints on Omega_m h^2. Recent measurements from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) and 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) strongly suggest that
Omega_m < 0.3. This forms the basic evidence for a flat Universe dominated by a
Cosmological Constant (Lambda) today (when combined with results from the CMB
and supernova surveys). Further evidence for this cosmological model is
provided by the late-time Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, which has now
been detected using a variety of tracers of the large scale structure in the
Universe out to redshifts of z>1. The ISW effect also provides an opportunity
to discriminate between Lambda, dynamical dark energy models and the

interested in the metallic ferromagnetic phase of the FKLM. This model could
describe either a quantum dot coupled to one-dimensional ferromagnetic leads
made with manganites or a substitutional transition metal impurity in a MnO
chain. We determined the region in parameter space where the impurity is empty,
half-filled or doubly-occupied and hence where it is magnetic or nonmagnetic.
The most important result is that we found, for a wide range of impurity
parameters and electron densities where the impurity is magnetic, a singlet
phase located between two saturated ferromagnetic phases which correspond
approximately to the empty and double-occupied impurity states. Transport
properties behave in general as expected as a function of the impurity
occupancy and they provide a test for a recently developed numerical approach
to compute the conductance. The results obtained could be in principle
reproduced experimentally in already existent related nanoscopic devices or in

low-mass companions: principally brown dwarfs (BDs), but also very low-mass
hydrogen-burning stars and planetary-mass objects. A few of the BDs formed in
this way remain attached to the primary star, orbiting at large radii. The
majority are released into the field, by interactions amongst themselves; in so
doing they acquire only a low velocity dispersion (<2 km/s), and therefore they
usually retain small discs, capable of registering an infrared excess and
sustaining accretion. Some BDs form close BD/BD binaries, and these binaries
can survive ejection into the field. This BD formation mechanism appears to
avoid some of the problems associated with the `embryo ejection' scenario, and
to answer some of the questions not yet answered by the `turbulent

  mass","5 pages, 7 figures, accpeted by AA",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20078251",,"astro-ph",,"  CONTEXT: The masses previously obtained for the X-ray binary 2S0921-630
inferred a compact object that was either a high-mass neutron star or low-mass
black-hole, but used a previously published value for the rotational broadening
(vsini) with large uncertainties. AIMS: We aim to determine an accurate mass
for the compact object through an improved measurement of the secondary star's
projected equatorial rotational velocity. METHODS: We have used UVES echelle
spectroscopy to determine the vsini of the secondary star (V395 Car) in the
low-mass X-ray binary 2S0921-630 by comparison to an artificially broadened
spectral-type template star. In addition, we have also measured vsini from a
single high signal-to-noise ratio absorption line profile calculated using the
method of Least-Squares Deconvolution (LSD). RESULTS: We determine vsini to lie
between 31.3+/-0.5km/s to 34.7+/-0.5km/s (assuming zero and continuum limb
darkening, respectively) in disagreement with revious results based on
intermediate resolution spectroscopy obtained with the 3.6m NTT. Using our
revised vsini value in combination with the secondary star's radial velocity
gives a binary mass ratio of 0.281+/-0.034. Furthermore, assuming a binary
inclination angle of 75 degrees gives a compact object mass of 1.37+/-0.13Mo.
CONCLUSIONS: We find that using relatively low-resolution spectroscopy can
result in systemic uncertainties in the measured vsini values obtained using
standard methods. We suggest the use of LSD as a secondary, reliable check of
the results as LSD allows one to directly discern the shape of the absorption
line profile. In the light of the new vsini measurement, we have revised down
the compact object's mass, such that it is now compatible with a canonical
neutron star mass.

described by very different perturbative formalisms, each relying on its own

formalism that avoids approximations on final-state momenta, and thus has a
very general domain of applicability. The use of exact kinematics introduces a
number of significant conceptual shifts already at leading order, and tightly
constrains the formalism. We show how to define parton correlation functions
that generalize the concepts of parton density, fragmentation function, and
soft factor. After setting up a general subtraction formalism, we obtain a
factorization theorem. To avoid complications with Ward identities the full
derivation is restricted to abelian gauge theories; even so the resulting
structure is highly suggestive of a similar treatment for non-abelian gauge
theories.

The bistable region is characterized by a coexistence of the hexagonal and

at (T_c ~680 K, p_CO ~10 Torr). Due to increasing fluctuations, the behavior at
high temperatures and pressures in the vicinity of this cusp point should be
qualitatively different from the hysteresis-type behavior which is typically
observed in the experiments under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. On the
inhomogeneous surface, we find a regime of nonuniform oscillations

to what extent can we trust image decomposition when the physical spatial
resolution is relatively poor? With this aim, I performed multi-component
(bar/bulge/disc/AGN) image decomposition of a sample of very nearby galaxies
and their artificially redshifted images, and verified the effects of removing
the bar and AGN components from the models. Neglecting bars can result in a
overestimation of the bulge-to-total luminosity ratio of a factor of two, even
if the resolution is low. Similar effects result when bright AGN are not
considered in the models, but only when the resolution is high. I also show
that the structural parameters of more distant galaxies can in general be
reliably retrieved, at least up to the point where the physical spatial
resolution is about 1.5 Kpc, but bulge parameters are prone to errors if its
effective radius is small compared to the seeing radius, and might suffer from
systematic effects. I briefly discuss the consequences of these results to our

acceleration [Nature (London) 431, p.535, p.538, p.541 (2004)] demonstrated
generation of ultra-short (with a duration of a few femtoseconds) relativistic
electron bunches with relatively low energy spread of the order of a few
percent. We have studied the dynamics of such bunches in vacuum and in laser
wakefield. The results show strong bunch dynamics already on a few millimeters
propagation distance in both cases. In vacuum, the bunch radius and emittance
quickly grow. The latter worsens the focusability of the bunch. We found that
when a femtosecond bunch is accelerated in a channel-guided laser wakefield,
for realistic bunch lengths, the bunch length is approximately conserved.
However, the spread in betatron frequencies leads to fast betatron phase mixing
in the bunch envelope for on-axis injection. When bunch is injected in a laser
wakefield off-axis, the bunch decoherence results in considerable increase in
the normalized bunch emittance, and, in some cases, in increase in the energy
spread, after acceleration. We also discuss a possible two-stage laser
wakefield accelerator.

PKS1932-46. VIMOS IFU spectroscopy is used to study the morphology, kinematics
and ionisation state of the EELR surrounding this source, and also a companion
galaxy at a similar redshift. Near- and far-IR imaging observations obtained
using the NTT and SPITZER are used to analyse the underlying galaxy
morphologies and the nature of the AGN. The host galaxy is identified as an ~M*
elliptical. Combining Spitzer mid-IR with X-ray, optical and near-IR imaging
observations of this source, we conclude that its AGN is underluminous for a
radio source of this type, despite its status as a BLRG. However, given its
relatively large [OIII] luminosity it is likely that the AGN was substantially
more luminous in the recent past (<10^4 years ago). The EELR is remarkably
extensive and complex, reminiscent of the systems observed around sources at
higher redshifts/radio powers, and the gas is predominantly ionised by a
mixture of AGN photoionisation and emission from young stars. We confirm the
presence of a series of star-forming knots extending N-S from the host galaxy,
with more prodigious star formation occuring in the merging companion galaxy to
the northeast, which has sufficient luminosity at mid- to far-IR wavelengths to
be classified as a LIRG. The most plausible explanation of our observations is
that PKS1932-46 is a member of an interacting galaxy group, and that the
impressive EELR is populated by star-forming, tidal debris. We suggest that the
AGN itself may currently be fuelled by material associated either with the
current interaction, or with a previous merger event. Surprisingly, it is the
companion object, rather than the radio source host galaxy, which is undergoing
the bulk of the star formation activity within the group.

the a-b plane, the anomalous Hall resistivity in the limit of zero applied
field is negative for all temperatures T less than Tc= 53 K. In this direction,
the anomalous Hall effect behaves in a manner similar to that observed in other
ferromagnets such as Fe, Co, Mn5Ge3, and EuFe4Sb12. However, with I in the a-b
plane and H along the c direction, the anomalous Hall behavior is completely
different. The anomalous Hall resistivity data are positive for all T less than
Tc and a similar analysis of these data fails. In this direction, the anomalous
response is not a simple linear function of the magnetization order parameter,
and for a fixed temperature (T less than Tc) does not depend on the magnitude
of the magnetization perpendicular to the current in the a-b plane. That is,
when the magnetization and applied field are rotated away from the c direction,
the anomalous Hall resistivity does not change. In all other soft ferromagnets
that we have examined (including La doped crystals of Yb14MnSb11, i.e.
Yb13.3La0.7MnSb11) rotation of the magnetization and magnetic field by an angle
theta away from a direction perpendicular to I results in a decrease in both
the anomalous and normal portions of the Hall resistivity that approximately
scales as cos(theta). We suggest that the unique response exhibited by
Yb14MnSb11 is a direct reflection of the delicate balance between
ferromagnetism and Kondo screening.

V$_n$(C$_6$H$_6$)$_{n+1}$ has been studied by first-principles calculation and
model analysis. It is found that each of the three types of bonds between V and
benzene (Bz) plays different roles. V 3d$_{z^2}$ orbital, extending along the
molecular axis, is weakly hybridized with Bz's HOMO-1 orbital to form the
$\sigma$-bond. It is quite localized and singly occupied, which contributes
1$\mu_B$ to the magnetic moment but little to the magnetic coupling of
neighboring V magnetic moments. The in-plane d$_{x^2-y^2}$, d$_{xy}$ orbitals
are hybridized with the LUMO of Bz and constitute the $\delta$-bond. This
hybridization is medium and crucial to the magnetic coupling though the
$\delta$ states have no net contribution to the total magnetic moment.
d$_{xz}$, d$_{yz}$ and HOMO of Bz form a quite strong $\pi$-bond to hold the
molecular structure but they are inactive in magnetism because their energy
levels are far away from the Fermi level. Based on the results of
first-principles calculation, we point out that the ferromagnetism stability is
closely related with the mechanism proposed by Kanamori and Terakura [J.
Kanamori and K. Terakura, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 70, 1433 (2001)]. However, the
presence of edge Bz's in the cluster introduces an important modification. A
simple model is constructed to explain the essence of the physical picture.

relativistic mean field approximation using density dependent coupling
constants. A parameterization for these coupling constants is presented, which
reproduces the properties of the nucleon self-energy obtained in Dirac
Brueckner Hartree Fock calculations of asymmetric nuclear matter but also
provides a good description for bulk properties of finite nuclei. The
inhomogeneous infinite matter is described in terms of cubic Wigner-Seitz
cells, which allows for a microscopic description of the structures in the
so-called ``pasta-phase'' of nuclear configurations and provides a smooth
transition to the limit of homogeneous matter. The effects of pairing
properties and finite temperature are considered. A comparison is made to
corresponding results employing the phenomenological Skyrme Hartree-Fock
approach and the consequences for the Thomas-Fermi approximation are discussed.

spherical shell of matter in general relativity, becomes singular when dealing
with two or more intersecting shells. We introduce here a more general class of
gauges which is apt for dealing with intersecting shells. As an application we
give the hamiltonian treatment of two intersecting shells, both massive and
massless. Such a formulation is applied to the computation of the semiclassical
tunneling probability of two shells. The probability for the emission of two
shells is simply the product of the separate probabilities thus showing no
correlation in the emission probabilities in this model.

secondary vertex reconstruction and thus enhancing the tagging capabilities for
short lived particles, the ZEUS experiment at the HERA Collider at DESY
installed a silicon strip vertex detector. The barrel part of the detector is a
63 cm long cylinder with silicon sensors arranged around an elliptical
beampipe. The forward part consists of four circular shaped disks. In total
just over 200k channels are read out using $2.9 {\rm m^2}$ of silicon. In this
report a detailed overview of the design and construction of the detector is
given and the performance of the completed system is reviewed.
