  typo in the abstract has been corrected",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20077953",,"astro-ph",,"  Context: The Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, a rotational effect in
eclipsing systems, provides unique insight into the relative orientation of
stellar spin axes and orbital axes of eclipsing binary systems.
  Aims: Our aim is to develop a robust method to analyze the RM effect in an
eclipsing system with two nearly equally bright components. This gives access
to the orientation of the stellar rotation axes and may shed light on questions
of binary formation and evolution.
  Methods: High-resolution spectra have been obtained both out of eclipse and
during the primary and secondary eclipses in the V1143Cyg system, using the
high-resolution Hamilton Echelle Spectrograph at the Lick Observatory. The
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect is analyzed in two ways: (1) by measuring the shift
of the line center of gravity during different phases of the eclipses and (2)
by analysis of the line shape change of the rotational broadening function
during eclipses.
  Results: The projected axes of both stars are aligned with the orbital spin
within the observational uncertainties, with the angle of the primary rotation
axis beta_p=0.3+-1.5 deg, and the angle of the secondary rotation axis
beta_s=-1.2+-1.6 deg, thereby showing that the remaining difference between the
theoretical and observed apsidal motion for this system is not due to a
misalignment of the stellar rotation axes. Both methods utilized in this paper
work very well, even at times when the broadening profiles of the two stars
overlap.[abridged]

The exact formation
mechanism is unclear, but it is possible that some massive stars are formed by
processes similar to those that produce the low-mass stars, with
accretion/ejection phenomena occurring at some point of the evolution of the
protostar. This picture seems to be supported by the detection of a collimated
stellar wind emanating from the massive protostar IRAS 16547-4247. A triple
radio source is associated with the protostar: a compact core and two radio
lobes. The emission of the southern lobe is clearly non-thermal. Such emission
is interpreted as synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons
locally accelerated at the termination point of a thermal jet. Since the
ambient medium is determined by the properties of the molecular cloud in which
the whole system is embedded, we can expect high densities of particles and
infrared photons. Because of the confirmed presence of relativistic electrons,
inverse Compton and relativistic Bremsstrahlung interactions are unavoidable.
Proton-proton collision should also occur, producing an injection of neutral
pions. In this paper we aim at making quantitative predictions of the spectral
energy distribution of the non-thermal spots generated by massive young stellar
objects, with emphasis on the particular case of IRAS 16547-4247. We present
spectral energy distributions for the southern lobe of this source, for a
variety of conditions. We show that high-energy emission might be detectable
from this object in the gamma-ray domain (MeV to TeV). The source may also be
detectable at X-rays through long exposures with current X-ray instruments.

occuring ~ 25 Myr ago, during which the star-forming-rate reached >= 25

the spacetime fluctuations induced by quantum fields in an evaporating black

the noise kernel, which is the symmetrized two-point quantum correlation
function of the stress tensor operator. As a concrete example we apply it to
the study of the spherically-symmetric sector of metric perturbations around an
evaporating black hole background geometry. For macroscopic black holes we find
that those fluctuations grow and eventually become important when considering
sufficiently long periods of time (of the order of the evaporation time), but
well before the Planckian regime is reached. In addition, the assumption of a
simple correlation between the fluctuations of the energy flux crossing the
horizon and far from it, which was made in earlier work on
spherically-symmetric induced fluctuations, is carefully scrutinized and found
to be invalid. Our analysis suggests the existence of an infinite amplitude for
the fluctuations when trying to localize the horizon as a three-dimensional
hypersurface, as in the classical case, and, as a consequence, a more accurate
picture of the horizon as possessing a finite effective width due to quantum
fluctuations. This is supported by a systematic analysis of the noise kernel in
curved spacetime smeared with different functions under different conditions,
the details are collected in the appendices. This case study shows a pathway
for probing quantum metric fluctuations near the horizon and understanding

on the shape and visibility of the jet. If the flux is very high, it causes a
strong evaporation of the neutral clump, producing a photoevaporated wind
traveling in the direction opposite to the incident flow. The interaction of
the two flows creates a double shock ``working surface'' around the clump
protecting it and the jet from the external flow. The jet only starts to curve
when it penetrates through the working surface.

define here the (generalized) Fourier transform and the inverse Fourier

xi^i G in concatenation of correlations. The Schwinger-Dyson operator S^i is
built from the left annihilation operator, which does not satisfy the Leibnitz
rule with respect to concatenation. So the loop equations are not differential
equations. We show that left annihilation is a derivation of the graded shuffle
product of gluon and ghost correlations. The shuffle product is the point-wise
product of Wilson loops, expressed in terms of correlations. So in the limit
where concatenation is approximated by shuffle products, the loop equations
become differential equations. Remarkably, the Schwinger-Dyson operator as a
whole is also a derivation of the graded shuffle product. This allows us to
turn the loop equations into linear equations for the shuffle reciprocal, which
might serve as a starting point for an approximation scheme.

bosonic systems, from determining the critical velocity of superfluid helium to
generating resistance in thin superconducting wires. This subject has also
inspired much technological interest, largely motivated by applications
involving nanoscale superconducting circuit elements, e.g., standards based on
quantum phase-slip junctions. While phase slips caused by thermal fluctuations
at high temperatures are well understood, controversy remains over the role of
phase slips in small-scale superconductors. In solids, problems such as
uncontrolled noise sources and disorder complicate the study and application of
phase slips. Here we show that phase slips can lead to dissipation for a clean
and well-characterized Bose-Hubbard (BH) system by experimentally studying
transport using ultra-cold atoms trapped in an optical lattice. In contrast to
previous work, we explore a low velocity regime described by the 3D BH model
which is not affected by instabilities, and we measure the effect of
temperature on the dissipation strength. We show that the damping rate of
atomic motion-the analogue of electrical resistance in a solid-in the confining
parabolic potential fits well to a model that includes finite damping at zero
temperature. The low-temperature behaviour is consistent with the theory of
quantum tunnelling of phase slips, while at higher temperatures a cross-over
consistent with the transition to thermal activation of phase slips is evident.
Motion-induced features reminiscent of vortices and vortex rings associated
with phase slips are also observed in time-of-flight imaging.

to a 0.5-8 keV luminosity limit of ~10^35 ergs/s. We estimate the remaining
stellar contribution from fainter X-ray sources (primarily cataclysmic
variables and coronally active binaries), assuming that they spatially follow
the stellar distribution. Indeed, the near-IR K-band light of the galaxy
closely traces the 2-8 keV unresolved X-rays, indicating a collective stellar
X-ray emissivity consistent with those determined for the Galactic ridge and
M32, whereas the amount of the 0.5-2 keV unresolved emission is significantly
greater than the expected stellar contribution, especially within a
galactocentric radius of ~2 kpc. Morphologically, this soft X-ray excess
appears substantially rounder than the bulge as seen in K-band and is elongated
approximately along the minor-axis at large radii. The excess thus most likely
represents the emission of diffuse hot gas in and around the galactic bulge.
Furthermore, the near side of the M31 disk casts an apparent shadow against the
soft X-ray excess, indicating that the hot gas extends to at least 2.5 kpc from
the galactic plane. We briefly discuss the implications of these results on the

cooling dilute granular gases. We focus on the regime where the sound travel
time through the channel is much shorter than the characteristic cooling time
of the gas. As a result, the gas pressure rapidly becomes almost homogeneous,
while the typical Mach number of the flow drops well below unity. Eliminating
the acoustic modes, we reduce the hydrodynamic equations to a single nonlinear
and nonlocal equation of a reaction-diffusion type in Lagrangian coordinates.
This equation describes a broad class of channel flows and, in particular, can
follow the development of the clustering instability from a weakly perturbed
homogeneous cooling state to strongly nonlinear states. If the heat diffusion
is neglected, the reduced equation is exactly soluble, and the solution
develops a finite-time density blowup. The heat diffusion, however, becomes
important near the attempted singularity. It arrests the density blowup and
brings about novel inhomogeneous cooling states (ICSs) of the gas, where the
pressure continues to decay with time, while the density profile becomes
time-independent. Both the density profile of an ICS, and the characteristic
relaxation time towards it are determined by a single dimensionless parameter
that describes the relative role of the inelastic energy loss and heat
diffusion. At large values of this parameter, the intermediate cooling dynamics
proceeds as a competition between low-density regions of the gas. This
competition resembles Ostwald ripening: only one hole survives at the end.

exhibit near-IR excesses compared to Kurucz model flux; while recent work
suggests classical T Tauri stars evince similar {\it JHK} excesses presumably

are more reliable than temperatures based on spectral standards for the cooler

describes the dynamics of a wide variety of astrophysical systems, including
the inner portions of dark matter halos, the central regions of galactic
bulges, and young embedded star clusters. Specifically, this potential results
from a density profile of the form $\rho (m) \propto m^{-1}$, where the radial
coordinate is generalized to triaxial form so that $m^2 = x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 +
z^2/c^2 $. Using the resulting analytic form of the potential, and the
corresponding force laws, we construct orbit solutions and show that a robust
orbit instability exists in these systems. For orbits initially confined to any
of the three principal planes, the motion in the perpendicular direction can be
unstable. We discuss the range of parameter space for which these orbits are
unstable, find the growth rates and saturation levels of the instability, and
develop a set of analytic model equations that elucidate the essential physics

blazars due to the extragalactic background light (EBL) density falling off

1 TeV could arise from a rapid or slow drop in the EBL density above ~1 micron.
This effect is mediated by the ratio of the near to mid-IR density of EBL. A
detection of such a spectral feature could become a clear signature of EBL
absorption. A non-detection would give a strong observational constraint to the
shape of the EBL spectrum. We present calculations estimating the sensitivity

$v$ of $I$. The ideal $I_>$ plays an important role in conditions from

Survey and 2MASS we have discovered 24 type-1 quasars about a third of which
are too red to be discriminated by optical/UV search techniques. Here we report
on a detailed case study of the reddest type-1 quasar of our sample (J2341) at
redshift z=0.236 with M_K=-25.8 and J-K=1.95. We performed spectroscopy in the
optical with VLT/FORS1 and in the MIR with Spitzer as well as NIR imaging with
ISPI at CTIO. The optical and NIR observations reveal a star forming
emission-line galaxy at the same redshift as the quasar with a projected linear
separation of 1.8 arcsec (6.7 kpc). The quasar and its companion are embedded
in diffuse extended continuum emission. Compared with its companion the quasar
exhibits redder optical-NIR colours, which we attribute to hot nuclear dust.
The MIR spectrum shows only few emission lines superimposed on a power-law
spectral energy distribution. However, the lack of strong FIR emission suggests
that our potentially interacting object contains much less gas and dust and is
in a stage different from dust reddened ULIRG-AGN like Mrk 231. The optical
spectrum shows signatures for reddening in the emission-lines and no
post-starburst stellar population is detected in the host galaxy of the quasar.
The optical continuum emission of the active nucleus appears absorbed and
diluted. Even the combination of absorption and host dilution is not able to
match J2341 with standard quasar templates. While the BLR shows only a rather
moderate absorption of E_(B-V)=0.3, the continuum shorter than 4500 AA requires
strong obscuration with E_(B-V)=0.7, exceeding the constraints from the low
upper limit on the 9.7 mu silicate absorption. This leads us to conclude that
the continuum of J2341 is intrinsically redder than that of typical quasars.

then it is shown that $\Delta_\mathcal{C}$ is pure if and only if
$\Delta_\mathcal{C}$ is pure shellable (in this case $e_i$ has a free vertex
for all $i$), and that $\Delta_\mathcal{C}$ is pure if and only if for any two

that this ordering condition implies that $\Delta_\mathcal{C}$ is pure

that complete admissible uniform clutters and their Alexander duals are
unmixed. In addition, the edge ideals of complete admissible uniform clutters
are facet ideals of shellable simplicial complexes, they are Cohen-Macaulay,
and they have linear resolutions. Furthermore if $ \mathcal{C}$ is admissible

symmetry is reached and (3) fluctuating around the Fermi liquid fixed point at
n_0. They all share one common theoretical basis, ""hidden local symmetry."" We
argue that when the critical density n_c < n_chi is reached in a neutron star,
the electrons turn into K^- mesons, which go into an S-wave Bose condensate.
This reduces the pressure substantially and the neutron star goes into a black
hole. Next we develop the argument that the collapse of a neutron star into a
black hole takes place for a star of M = 1.5 M_sun. This means that Supernova
1987A had a black hole as result. We also show that two neutron stars in a
binary have to be within 4% of each other in mass, for neutron stars
sufficiently massive that they escape helium shell burning. For those that are
so light that they do have helium shell burning, after a small correction for
this they must be within 4% of each other in mass. Observations support the
proximity in mass inside of a neutron star binary. The result of strangeness
condensation is that there are 5 times more low-mass black-hole, neutron-star
binaries than double neutron-star binaries although the former are difficult to
observe.

colours R-L15>5, which cannot be explained by the spectral energy distribution

redshifted (z>1) starburst or ultraluminous infrared galaxies. This result
indicates that the fraction of the ultraluminous infrared galaxies in our faint

consistent with the evolving mid-infrared luminosity function derived by recent

constitutes the main axis of the first part of the thesis. The formalism is
developed as a self-consistent theory but is inspired by earlier works, mainly
by cohomological results, covariant phase space methods and by the Hamiltonian
formalism. The thermodynamical properties of black holes, especially the first
law, are studied in a general geometrical setting and are worked out for
several black objects: black holes, strings and rings. Also, the geometrical
and thermodynamical properties of a new family of black holes with closed
timelike curves in three dimensions are described.
  The second part of the thesis is the natural generalization of the first part
to asymptotic analyses. We start with a general construction of covariant phase
spaces admitting asymptotically conserved charges. The representation of the
asymptotic symmetry algebra by a covariant Poisson bracket among the conserved
charges is then defined and is shown to admit generically central extensions.
The asymptotic structures of three three-dimensional spacetimes are then
studied in detail and the consequences for quantum gravity in three dimensions
are discussed.

leads to a shielding of the interaction like for a Yukawa potential. Finally,
our hydrodynamic model involves a friction force which quantifies the

gravitons can attain mass by spontaneous local symmetry breaking. The question
is whether this can happen in a Lorentz-invariant way. We consider the use of
four scalar fields that break coordinate reparametrization invariance, by
playing the role of preferred flat coordinates x, y, z, and t. In the unbroken
representation, the theory has a (negative) cosmological constant, which is
tuned to zero by the scalars in the broken phase. Massive spin 2 bosons and a
single massive scalar survive. The theory is not renormalizable, so at best it
can be viewed as an effective field theory for massive spin 2 particles. One
may think of applications in cosmology, but a more tantalizing idea is to apply
it to string theory approaches to QCD: if the gluon sector is to be described
by a compactified 26 or 10 dimensional bosonic string theory, then the ideas
considered here could be used to describe the mechanism that removes a massless
or tachyonic scalar and provides mass to the spin 2 glueball states. The
delicate problem of removing indefinite metric and/or negative energy states is
addressed. The scalar particle has negative metric, so that unitarity demands
that only states with an even number of them are allowed. Various ways are
considered to adapt the matter section of the theory such that matter only
couples to positive metric states, and we succeed in suppressing the main
contributions to unitarity-violating amplitudes, but the exact restoration of
unitarity in the spinless sector will continue to be a delicate issue in
theories of this sort.

metallicities. We discuss various indications supporting the view that very
metal poor stars had their evolution strongly affected by rotational mixing.
Many features, like the origin of primary nitrogen at low metallicity, that of
the C-rich extremely metal poor halo stars, of He-rich stars in massive
globular clusters, of the O-Na anticorrelation in globular clusters may be
related to the existence of a population of very fast rotating metal poor stars
that we tentatively call the {\it spinstars}. A fraction of these {\it
spinstars} may also be the progenitors of GRB in very metal poor regions. They
may avoid pair instability explosion due to the heavy mass loss undergone
during their early evolutionary phases and be, dependent on their frequency,
important sources of ionising photons in the early Universe.

parallel to the trigonal axis one obtains quasi two dimensional kagome ice

any finite critical value of any map $g \in G$. In general, the Julia set of
such a semigroup $G$ may be disconnected, and each Fatou component of such $G$
is either simply connected or doubly connected (\cite{Su01,Su9}). In this
paper, we show that for any two distinct Fatou components of certain types
(e.g., two doubly connected components of the Fatou set), the boundaries are
separated by a Cantor set of quasicircles (with uniform dilatation) inside the
Julia set of $G.$ Important in this theory is the understanding of various
situations which can and cannot occur with respect to how the Julia sets of the
maps $g \in G$ are distributed within the Julia set of the entire semigroup
$G$. We give several results in this direction and show how such results are
used to generate (semi) hyperbolic semigroups possessing this postcritically
