electrons is confined to one dimension (1D). In these so-called quantum wires
electron-electron interaction effects play an important role because the
restricted dimensions enhance the scattering between the electrons and
completely destroy the quasi-particle picture. New density wave excitations
appear that are described by bosonic operators. Here, we will develop this
bosonic description, following a pedestrian approach which does not require any
previous knowledge in field theory methods. These notes therefore serve as a
detailed introduction into bosonization by carefully deriving the most
fundamental formulas.

faint QSO Q2343-BX415 (R = 20.2, z_em = 2.57393). Follow-up observations at
intermediate spectral resolution reveal that the metal lines associated with
this 'proximate' DLA consist of two sets of absorption components. One set is
moving towards the quasar with velocities of ~ 150-600 km/s; this gas is highly
ionized and does not fully cover the continuum source, suggesting that it is
physically close to the active nucleus. The other, which accounts for most of
the neutral gas, is blueshifted relative to the QSO, with the strongest
component at ~ -160 km/s. We consider the possibility that the PDLA arises in
the outflowing interstellar medium of the host galaxy of Q2343-BX415, an
interpretation supported by strong C IV and N V absorption at nearby
velocities, and by the intense radiation field longward of the Lyman limit
implied by the high C II*/H I ratio. If Q2343-BX415 is the main source of these
UV photons, then the PDLA is located at either ~ 8 or ~ 37 kpc from the active
nucleus. Alternatively, the absorber may be a foreground star-forming galaxy
unrelated to the quasar and coincidentally at the same redshift, but our deep
imaging and follow-up spectroscopy of the field of Q2343-BX415 has not yet
produced a likely candidate. We measure the abundances of 14 elements in the
PDLA, finding an overall metallicity of ~ 1/5 solar and a normal pattern of
relative element abundances for this metallicity. Thus, in this PDLA there is
no evidence for the super-solar metallicities that have been claimed for some
proximate, high ionization, systems.

the simplest question of whether the equation of state of dark energy is equal

transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Three doses of nimesulide (3, 6 and
12 mg/kg; i.p.) or vehicle were administered immediately after stroke and
additional doses were given at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after ischemia. In other
set of experiments, the effect of nimesulide was studied in a situation in
which its first administration was delayed for 3-24 h after ischemia. Total,
cortical and subcortical infarct volumes and functional outcome (assessed by
neurological deficit score and rotarod performance) were determined 3 days
after ischemia. The effect of nimesulide on prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) levels
in the injured brain was also investigated. Nimesulide dose-dependently reduced
infarct volume and improved functional recovery when compared to vehicle. Of
interest is the finding that neuroprotection conferred by nimesulide (reduction
of infarct size and neurological deficits and improvement of rotarod
performance) was also observed when treatment was delayed until 24 h after
ischemia. Further, administration of nimesulide in a delayed treatment paradigm
completely abolished PGE(2) accumulation in the postischemic brain, suggesting
that COX-2 inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for cerebral ischemia

estimate the ground-layer seeing. The absolute accuracy of both methods is
studied here using analytical theory, numerical simulation, and experiments. A
modification of the MASS data processing to compensate for partially saturated
scintillation is developed. We find that the DIMM can be severely biased by
optical aberrations (e.g. defocus) and propagation. Seeing measurements with
DIMM and MASS can reach absolute accuracy of ~10% when their biases are
carefully controlled. Pushing this limit to 1% appears unrealistic because the
seeing itself is just a model-dependent parameter of a non-stationary random
process.

junction limit, i.e. superconducting loops interrupted by two normal metal

dc squid-like geometry leads to an almost complete periodic modulation of the
critical current through the device by a magnetic flux, with a flux periodicity
of a flux quantum h/2e through the SNS loop. In addition, we examine the entire
field dependence, notably the low and high field dependence of the maximum
switching current. In contrast with the well-known Fraunhoffer-type
oscillations typical of short wide junctions, we find a monotonous gaussian
extinction of the critical current at high field. As shown in [15], this
monotonous dependence is typical of long and narrow diffusive junctions. We
also find in some cases a puzzling reentrance at low field. In contrast, the
temperature dependence of the critical current is well described by the
proximity effect theory, as found by Dubos {\it et al.} [16] on SNS wires in
the long junction limit. The switching current distributions and hysteretic IV
curves also suggest interesting dynamics of long SNS junctions with an
important role played by the diffusion time across the junction.

an X-ray transient with a recurrence time of ~2 yr, using data from the Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer covering 4 transient outbursts (1998-2005). We verify
that the 401 Hz pulsation traces the spin frequency fundamental and not a
harmonic. Substantial pulse shape variability, both stochastic and systematic,
was observed during each outburst. Analysis of the systematic pulse shape
changes suggests that, as an outburst dims, the X-ray ""hot spot"" on the pulsar
surface drifts longitudinally and a second hot spot may appear. The overall
pulse shape variability limits the ability to measure spin frequency evolution
within a given X-ray outburst (and calls previous nudot measurements of this
source into question), with typical upper limits of |nudot| < 2.5x10^{-14} Hz/s
(2 sigma). However, combining data from all the outbursts shows with high (6
sigma) significance that the pulsar is undergoing long-term spin down at a rate
nudot = (-5.6+/-2.0)x10^{-16} Hz/s, with most of the spin evolution occurring
during X-ray quiescence. We discuss the possible contributions of magnetic
propeller torques, magnetic dipole radiation, and gravitational radiation to
the measured spin down, setting an upper limit of B < 1.5x10^8 G for the
pulsar's surface dipole magnetic field and and Q/I < 5x10^{-9} for the

derivative of Pdot = (3.5+/-0.2)x10^{-12} s/s. This surprising large Pdot is
reminiscent of the large and quasi-cyclic orbital period variation observed in
the so-called ""black widow"" millisecond radio pulsars, supporting speculation
that SAX J1808.4-3658 may turn on as a radio pulsar during quiescence. In an

by measuring multiplicities of gamma-ray cascades following neutron capture.
Using this technique, we were able to determine J values for all but 14 of the
140 known resonances below En = 1 keV, including 41 firm J assignments for
resonances whose spins previously were either unknown or tentative. These new
spin assignments, together with previously determined resonance parameters,
allowed us to extract separate level spacings and neutron strength functions
for J = 3 and 4 resonances. Furthermore, several statistical test of the data
indicate that very few resonances of either spin have been missed below En =
700eV. Because a non-statistical effect recently was reported near En = 350 eV
from an analysis of 147Sm(n,alpha) data, we divided the data into two regions;
0 < En < 350 eV and 350 < En < 700 eV. Using neutron widths from a previous
measurement and published techniques for correcting for missed resonances and
for testing whether data are consistent with a Porter-Thomas distribution, we
found that the reduced-neutron-width distribution for resonances below 350 eV
is consistent with the expected Porter-Thomas distribution. On the other hand,
we found that reduced-neutron-width data in the 350 < En < 700 eV region are
inconsistent with a Porter-Thomas distribution, but in good agreement with a
chi-squared distribution having two or more degrees of freedom. We discuss
possible explanations for these observed non-statistical effects and their
possible relation to similar effects previously observed in other nuclides.

CVn systems formed through the WD channel coupled to the binary's evolution.
Contrary to assumptions made in prior modelling, these donors are not fully
convective over much of the AM CVn phase and do not evolve adiabatically under
mass loss indefinitely. Instead, we identify three distinct phases of
evolution: a mass transfer turn-on phase (during which the orbital period
continues to decrease even after contact, the donor contracts, and the mass
transfer rate accelerates to its maximum), a phase in which the donor expands
adiabatically in response to mass loss, and a cooling phase beginning at
orbital periods of approximately 45--55 minutes during which the donor
contracts. The physics that determines the behaviour in the first and third
phases, both of which are new outcomes of this study, are discussed in some
detail. We find the overall duration of the turn-on phase to be between $\sim
10^4$-$10^6$ yrs, significantly longer than prior estimates. We predict the
donor's luminosity and effective temperature. During the adiabatic expansion
phase (ignoring irradiation effects), the luminosity is approximately
$10^{-6}$--$10^{-4} L_\odot$ and the effective temperature is approximately
1000--1800 K. However, the flux generated in the accretion flow dominates the
donor's intrinsic light at all times. The impact of irradiation on the donor
extends the phase of adiabatic expansion to longer orbital periods and alters
the donor's observational characteristics. Irradiated donors during the
adiabatic phase can attain a surface luminosity of up to $\approx10^{-2}
L_\odot$. We argue that the turn-on and cooling phases both will leave
significant imprints on the AM CVn population's orbital period distribution.

promptness and accuracy of detection rules improve greatly if multiple

situations in which several marked count data and continuously changing signals

first into a sequence of optimal stopping problems for a pure diffusion by
means of a jump operator. This method is new and can be very useful in other
applications as well, because it allows the use of the powerful optimal

as a result the gas in dark matter halos below a certain mass is too hot to
cool within a Hubble time. The UVB effectively suppresses the formation of
dwarf galaxies. Using high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations
we show that photo heating leads to small baryon fractions in halos below ~
6x10^9 h^{-1}M_sun, independent of the cosmic environment. The simulations are
carried out assuming a homogeneous UVB with flux densities as given by Haardt &
Madau (1996). A halo may stop to condense gas significantly after the universe
is reionised, namely when its mass falls below the characteristic mass scale
set by the photo heating. Assuming a spherical halo model we derive this
characteristic mass analytically and identify the main mechanisms that prevent
the gas from cooling in small halos. The theoretically derived characteristic
mass is smaller than the one obtained from observations. Increasing the energy
per ionising photon by a factor between four and eight would be sufficient to
reconcile both. This is equivalent to an average temperature of the IGM of ~
10^4 K. In this sense the faint end of the luminosity function may serve as a
calorimeter for the IGM.

respectively. In addition, average star formation efficiency and evolutionary
age appear to be anticorrelated for the sample, suggesting that the star
formation efficiency in a typical DLA decreases with age. At the same time,
N/Si in DLAs is directly linked to an object's age. There is an apparent
bimodality in the distribution of N/Si values which could be the result of a
statistical accident or an effect produced by a truncated or flattened IMF. We
find that the mean and small dispersion of Si/Fe values is related to the
generally young ages of DLAs, wherein not all Fe has yet been expelled by Type
Ia supernovae. Finally, the large scatter and generally lower values of N/Si of
DLAs with respect to blue compact galaxies, despite their partially overlapping

connected, large-scale, $n-$dimensional, dynamical system monitored by a
network of $N$ sensors. Local Kalman filters are implemented on the
($n_l-$dimensional, where $n_l\ll n$) sub-systems that are obtained after
spatially decomposing the large-scale system. The resulting sub-systems
overlap, which along with an assimilation procedure on the local Kalman
filters, preserve an $L$th order Gauss-Markovian structure of the centralized
error processes. The information loss due to the $L$th order Gauss-Markovian
approximation is controllable as it can be characterized by a divergence that
decreases as $L\uparrow$. The order of the approximation, $L$, leads to a lower
bound on the dimension of the sub-systems, hence, providing a criterion for
sub-system selection. The assimilation procedure is carried out on the local
error covariances with a distributed iterate collapse inversion (DICI)
algorithm that we introduce. The DICI algorithm computes the (approximated)
centralized Riccati and Lyapunov equations iteratively with only local
communication and low-order computation. We fuse the observations that are
common among the local Kalman filters using bipartite fusion graphs and
consensus averaging algorithms. The proposed algorithm achieves full
distribution of the Kalman filter that is coherent with the centralized Kalman
filter with an $L$th order Gaussian-Markovian structure on the centralized
error processes. Nowhere storage, communication, or computation of
$n-$dimensional vectors and matrices is needed; only $n_l \ll n$ dimensional
vectors and matrices are communicated or used in the computation at the
sensors.

  and Lightcurves","8 pages, 6 figures, to appear in PASP 2007 September",,"10.1086/522039",,"astro-ph",,"  It is shown herein that planets with eccentric orbits are more likely to
transit than circularly orbiting planets with the same semimajor axis by a
factor of (1-e^2)^{-1}. If the orbital parameters of discovered transiting
planets are known, as from follow-up radial velocity observations, then the
transit-detected planet population is easily debiased of this effect. The
duration of a planet's transit depends upon of its eccentricity and longitude
of periastron; transits near periastron are shorter, and those near apoastron
last longer, for a given impact parameter. If fitting for the stellar radius
with the other transit parameters, this effect causes a systematic error in the
resulting measurements. If the stellar radius is instead held fixed at a value
measured independently, then it is possible to place a lower limit on the
planet's eccentricity using photometry alone. Orbital accelerations cause a
difference in the planet's ingress and egress durations that lead to an
asymmetry in the transit lightcurve that could be used along with the transit
velocity measurement to uniquely measure the planet's eccentricity and
longitude of periapsis. However, the effect is too small to be measured with
current technology. The habitability of transiting terrestrial planets found by
Kepler depends on those planets' orbital eccentricities. While Kepler will be
able to place lower limits on those planets' orbital eccentricity, the actual
value for any given planet will likely remain unknown.

mid-infrared photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope, supplemented by
findings from ground-based high-resolution optical spectroscopy and adaptive
optics imaging. We derive disk fractions of 52 (+/-6) % and 58 (+6/-7) % based
on 8-micron and 24-micron colour excesses, respectively, consistent with those
reported for other clusters of similar age. Within the uncertainties, the disk
frequency in our sample of K3-M8 objects in Cha I does not depend on stellar
mass. Diskless and disk-bearing objects have similar spatial distributions.
There are no obvious transition disks in our sample, implying a rapid timescale
for the inner disk clearing process; however, we find two objects with weak
excess at 3-8 microns and substantial excess at 24 microns, which may indicate
grain growth and dust settling in the inner disk. For a sub-sample of 35
objects with high-resolution spectra, we investigate the connection between
accretion signatures and dusty disks: in the vast majority of cases (29/35) the
two are well correlated, suggesting that, on average, the timescale for gas
dissipation is similar to that for clearing the inner dust disk. The exceptions
are six objects for which dust disks appear to persist even though accretion
has ceased or dropped below measurable levels. Adaptive optics images of 65 of
our targets reveal that 17 have companions at (projected) separations of 10-80
AU. Of the five <20 AU binaries, four lack infrared excess, possibly indicating
that a close companion leads to faster disk dispersal. The closest binary with
excess is separated by ~20 AU, which sets an upper limit of ~8 AU for the outer
disk radius. (abridged)

the latitude) constituted 3% of all CMEs and mainly occurred during the time
when the polar magnetic fields reversed sign. The latitudinal drift of the
high-latitude CMEs was correlated with that of the heliospheric current sheet.
(2) 4% of all CMEs occurred in the range $45^{\circ}\leq\theta\leq60^{\circ}$.
These mid-latitude CMEs occurred primarily in 2000, near the middle of 2002 and
in 2005, respectively, forming a prominent three-peak structure; (3) The

  Though `multi-letter' in general, our results yield explicit conclusions when

  - Identify a large class of FS-MACs, that includes the additive mod-2 noise
MAC where the noise may have memory, for which feedback does not enlarge the
capacity region.
  - Deduce that, for a general FS-MAC with states that are not affected by the
input, if the capacity (region) without feedback is zero, then so is the
capacity (region) with feedback.
  - Deduce that the capacity region of a MAC that can be decomposed into a
`multiplexer' concatenated by a point-to-point channel (with, without, or with
partial feedback), the capacity region is given by $\sum_{m} R_m \leq C$, where
C is the capacity of the point to point channel and m indexes the encoders.

2-dimensional area of the apparent horizon of a black hole remains invariant
regardless of the motion of the observer, and in fact is independent of the $
t=constant $ slice, which can be quite arbitrary in general relativity.
Nonetheless the explicit computation of horizon area is often substantially
more difficult in some frames (complicated by the coordinate form of the
metric), than in other frames. Here we give an explicit demonstration for very
restricted metric forms of (Schwarzschild and Kerr) vacuum black holes. In the
Kerr-Schild coordinate expression for these spacetimes they have an explicit
Lorentz-invariant form. We consider {\it boosted} versions with the black hole
moving through the coordinate system. Since these are stationary black hole
spacetimes, the apparent horizons are two dimensional cross sections of their
event horizons, so we compute the areas of apparent horizons in the boosted
space with (boosted) $ t = constant $, and obtain the same result as in the
unboosted case. Note that while the invariance of area is generic, we deal only
with black holes in the Kerr-Schild form, and consider only one particularly
simple change of slicing which amounts to a boost. Even with these restrictions
we find that the results illuminate the physics of the horizon as a null
surface and provide a useful pedagogical tool. As far as we can determine, this
is the first explicit calculation of this type demonstrating the area
invariance of horizons. Further, these calculations are directly relevant to
transformations that arise in computational representation of moving black
holes. We present an application of this result to initial data for boosted
black holes.

interaction is quenched at a slow but uniform rate. The two quenching schemes
are called transverse and anisotropic quenching respectively. Our emphasis in
this paper is on the anisotropic quenching scheme and we compare the results
with those of the other scheme. In the process of anisotropic quenching, the
system crosses all the quantum critical lines of the phase diagram where the
relaxation time diverges. The evolution is non-adiabatic in the time interval
when the parameters are close to their critical values, and is adiabatic
otherwise. The density of defects produced due to non-adiabatic transitions is
calculated by mapping the many-particle system to an equivalent Landau-Zener
problem and is generally found to vary as $1/\sqrt{\tau}$, where $\tau$ is the
characteristic time scale of quenching, a scenario that supports the
Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Interestingly, in the case of anisotropic quenching,
there exists an additional non-adiabatic transition, in comparison to the
transverse quenching case, with the corresponding probability peaking at an
incommensurate value of the wave vector. In the special case in which the
system passes through a multi-critical point, the defect density is found to
vary as $1/\tau^{1/6}$. The von Neumann entropy of the final state is shown to
maximize at a quenching rate around which the ordering of the final state

requirements is concerned, the whole design process is more akin to a
statistical control process than to a straightforward statistical problem of
assessing an unknown distribution. This leads to features of the expert
judgement problem in the design context which are substantially different from
those seen, for example, in risk assessment. In particular, the role of experts
in problem structuring and in developing failure mitigation options is much
more prominent, and there is a need to take into account the reliability
potential for future mitigation measures downstream in the system life cycle.
An overview is given of the stakeholders typically involved in large scale
systems engineering design projects, and this is used to argue the need for
methods that expose potential judgemental biases in order to generate analyses
that can be said to provide rational consensus about uncertainties. Finally, a
number of key points are developed with the aim of moving toward a framework

  0709.1654",,,,"math.OA math.FA math.KT",,"  We formally introduce the concept of localizing the Elliott conjecture at a
given strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra $D$; we also explain how the known
classification theorems for nuclear C*-algebras fit into this concept. As a new
result in this direction, we employ recent results of Lin to show that (under a
mild K-theoretic condition) the class of separable, unital, simple C*-algebras
with locally finite decomposition rank and UCT, and for which projections
separate traces, satisfies the Elliott conjecture localized at the Jiang-Su
algebra Z.
  Our main result is formulated in a more general way; this allows us to
outline a strategy to possibly remove the trace space condition as well as the
K-theory restriction entirely. When regarding both our result and the recent
classification theorem of Elliott, Gong and Li as generalizations of the real
rank zero case, the two approaches are perpendicular in a certain sense. The
strategy to attack the general case aims at combining these two approaches.
  Our classification theorem covers simple ASH algebras for which projections
separate traces (and the K-groups of which have finitely generated torsion
part); it does, however, not at all depend on an inductive limit structure.
Also, in the monotracial case it does not rely on the existence or absence of
projections in any way. In fact, it is the first such result which, in a
natural way, covers all known unital, separable, simple, nuclear and stably
finite C*-algebras of real rank zero (the K-groups of which have finitely
generated torsion part) as well as the (projectionless) Jiang-Su algebra
itself.

ten rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) stars based on spectroscopic time-series
observations. The aim of this analysis is to derive from observations a
complete picture of how the amplitude and phase of magnetoacoustic waves depend
on depth. We find common features in the pulsational behaviour of roAp stars.
Within a sample of representative elements the lowest amplitudes are detected
for Eu II (and Fe in 33 Lib and in HD 19918), then pulsations go through the
layers where Halpha core, Nd, and Pr lines are formed. There RV amplitude
reaches its maximum, and after that decreases in most stars. The maximum RV of
the second REE ions is always delayed relative to the first ions. The largest
phase shifts are detected in Tb III and Th III lines. Pulsational variability
of the Th III lines is detected here for the first time. The Y II lines deviate
from this picture, showing even lower amplitudes than Eu II lines but half a
period phase shift relative to other weakly pulsating lines. The roAp stars
exhibit similarity in the depth-dependence of pulsation phase and amplitude,
indicating similar chemical stratification and comparable vertical mode
cross-sections. In general, pulsations waves are represented by a superposition
of the running and standing wave components. In the atmospheres of roAp stars
with the pulsation frequency below the acoustic cut-off frequency, pulsations
have a standing-wave character in the deeper layers and behave like a running
wave in the outer layers. Cooler roAp stars develop a running wave higher in
the atmosphere. In stars with pulsation frequency close to the acoustic cut-off
one, pulsation waves have a running character starting from deep layers.

result from many-body electron interactions. The spin degeneracy in zero
magnetic field appears to be spontaneously lifted due to the so-called 0.7
anomaly. Further, the g-factor for electrons in the QPC is enhanced, and a
zero-bias peak in the conductance points to similarities with transport through
a Kondo impurity. We report here how these many-body effects depend on QPC
geometry. We find a clear relation between the enhanced g-factor and the
subband spacing in our QPCs, and can relate this to the device geometry with
electrostatic modeling of the QPC potential. We also measured the zero-field
energy splitting related to the 0.7 anomaly, and studied how it evolves into a
splitting that is the sum of the Zeeman effect and a field-independent exchange
contribution when applying a magnetic field. While this exchange contribution
shows sample-to-sample fluctuations and no clear dependence on QPC geometry, it
is for all QPCs correlated with the zero-field splitting of the 0.7 anomaly.
This provides evidence that the splitting of the 0.7 anomaly is dominated by
this field-independent exchange splitting. Signatures of the Kondo effect also
show no regular dependence on QPC geometry, but are possibly correlated with
splitting of the 0.7 anomaly.

and stimulates the behavioral activity near partition as a reaction to the
receptive female in naive males. In many studies this behavioral activity is
considered as sexual motivation, arising in this experimental context in male

of males on receptive female, uninterconnected changes of these two parameters
as well as the lack of sexual behavior between naive male and female when

supposed that in naive males behavioral reaction to a receptive female is
induced by positive incentive - odor of the female associated with nursing and
warmth from mother and other females which look after posterity. Short-term
increase of the level of testosterone (possessing rewarding properties) is
innate stimulus-response reaction which stimulates and prolongs behavioral
interest of male to receptive female. It has been supposed that after sexual
experience female odor is associated in experienced males with sexual behavior
directed to the sexual partner and resulted in the formation of sexual
motivation. The data are considered also in the light of the theory of

time spectropolarimetric observations of the FeH F^4 Delta-X^4 Delta system
measured in sunspots to investigate their diagnostic capabilities for probing
solar and stellar magnetic fields. We investigate whether the current
theoretical model of FeH can reproduce the observed Stokes profiles including
their magnetic properties. The polarimetric observations are compared with
synthetic Stokes profiles modeled with radiative transfer calculations. This
allows us to infer the temperature and the magnetic field strength of the
observed sunspots. We find that the current theory successfully reproduces the
magnetic properties of a large number of lines in the FeH F^4 Delta-X^4 Delta

that the asymptotic order (called ""pitch"" p) of the end determines the limiting
shape, even when the singular set does accumulate at the end. If the singular
set is bounded away from the end, we have -1<p<=0. If the singular set
accumulates at the end, the pitch p is a positive rational number not equal to
1. Choosing appropriate positive integers n and m so that p=n/m, suitable
slices of the end by horospheres are asymptotic to d-coverings (d-times wrapped

  the dynamical evolution of clump cluster and chain galaxies","ApJ Accepted, 13 pages, 9 figures",,"10.1086/522077",,"astro-ph",,"  Many galaxies at high redshift have peculiar morphologies dominated by
10^8-10^9 Mo kpc-sized clumps. Using numerical simulations, we show that these
""clump clusters"" can result from fragmentation in gravitationally unstable
primordial disks. They appear as ""chain galaxies"" when observed edge-on. In
less than 1 Gyr, clump formation, migration, disruption, and interaction with
the disk cause these systems to evolve from initially uniform disks into
regular spiral galaxies with an exponential or double-exponential disk profile
and a central bulge. The inner exponential is the initial disk size and the
outer exponential is from material flung out by spiral arms and clump torques.
A nuclear black hole may form at the same time as the bulge from smaller black
holes that grow inside the dense cores of each clump. The properties and
lifetimes of the clumps in our models are consistent with observations of the
clumps in high redshift galaxies, and the stellar motions in our models are
consistent with the observed velocity dispersions and lack of organized
rotation in chain galaxies. We suggest that violently unstable disks are the
first step in spiral galaxy formation. The associated starburst activity gives
a short timescale for the initial stellar disk to form.

  torques","24 pages including 13 figures; accepted to ICARUS",,"10.1016/j.icarus.2007.07.009",,"astro-ph",,"  The extrasolar planets discovered to date possess unexpected orbital
elements. Most orbit their host stars with larger eccentricities and smaller
semi-major axes than similarly sized planets in our own solar system do. It is
generally agreed that the interaction between giant planets and circumstellar
disks (Type II migration) drives these planets inward to small radii, but the
effect of these same disks on orbital eccentricity, e, is controversial.
Several recent analytic calculations suggest that disk-planet interactions can
excite eccentricity, while numerical studies generally produce eccentricity
damping. This paper addresses this controversy using a quasi-analytic approach,
drawing on several preceding analytic studies. This work refines the current
treatment of eccentricity evolution by removing several approximations from the
calculation of disk torques. We encounter neither uniform damping nor uniform
excitation of orbital eccentricity, but rather a function de/dt that varies in
both sign and magnitude depending on eccentricity and other solar system
properties. Most significantly, we find that for every combination of disk and
planet properties investigated herein, corotation torques produce negative
values of de/dt for some range in e within the interval [0.1, 0.5]. If
corotation torques are saturated, this region of eccentricity damping
disappears, and excitation occurs on a short timescale of less than 0.08 Myr.
Thus, our study does not produce eccentricity excitation on a timescale of a
few Myr -- we obtain either eccentricity excitation on a short time scale, or
eccentricity damping on a longer time scale. Finally, we discuss the
implications of this result for producing the observed range in extrasolar
planet eccentricity.

Density Functional Theory (DFT) is introduced within the Multiple Scattering
Theory formalism for dealing with, ordered or disordered, metallic alloys. All
GCPA theories are based on a common ansatz for the kinetic part of the
Hohenberg-Kohn functional and each theory of the class is specified by an
external model concerning the potential reconstruction. The GCPA density
functional consists of marginally coupled local contributions, does not depend
on the details of the charge density and can be exactly rewritten as a function
of the appropriate charge multipole moments associated with each lattice site.
A general procedure based on the integration of the 'qV' laws is described that
allows for the explicit construction the same function. The coarse grained
nature of the GCPA density functional implies great computational advantages
and is connected with the O(N) scalability of GCPA algorithms. Moreover, it is
shown that a convenient truncated series expansion of the GCPA functional leads
to the Charge Excess Functional (CEF) theory [E. Bruno, L. Zingales and Y.
Wang, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 91}, 166401 (2003)] which here is offered in a

numerical results are compared with status of art LAPW full-potential density
functional calculations for 62, bcc- and fcc-based, ordered CuZn alloys, in all
the range of concentrations. These extensive tests show that the discrepancies
between GCPA and CEF are always within the numerical accuracy of the
calculations, both for the site charges and the total energies. Furthermore,
GCPA and CEF very carefully reproduce the LAPW site charges and the total
energy trends.

that the SAOP results for C_{6} and static polarizability are quite accurate

stochastic approach for analyzing the dynamics and effect of negative feedback

identify a bimodal activity depending of the strength of self-repression
coupling D. In the strong coupling region D>>1, the variance of the
transcriptional noise is found to be reduced a 28 % more than described
earlier. Secondly, the contribution of the noise effect to the abundance of
regulating protein becomes manifest when the coefficient of variation is
computed. In the strong coupling region, this coefficient is found to be
independent of all parameters and in fair agreement with the experimentally
observed values. Finally, our analysis reveals that the regulating protein is
significantly induced by the intrinsic and external noise in the strong
coupling region. In short, it indicates that the existence of inherent noise in
FBL makes it possible to produce a basal amount of proteins even though the
repression level D is very strong.

among the lowest 45 para and 45 ortho rotational levels of H2O colliding with

infrastructure networks, supercomputer codes and munitions, have become
increasingly complex. It is often costly to conduct full system tests. As such,
we present a review of methodology that has been proposed for addressing system
reliability with limited full system testing. The first approaches presented in
this paper are concerned with the combination of multiple sources of
information to assess the reliability of a single component. The second general
set of methodology addresses the combination of multiple levels of data to
determine system reliability. We then present developments for complex systems
beyond traditional series/parallel representations through the use of Bayesian
networks and flowgraph models. We also include methodological contributions to
resource allocation considerations for system relability assessment. We
illustrate each method with applications primarily encountered at Los Alamos
National Laboratory.

dynamical eikonal approximation using a single description of 8B. We obtain a
good agreement with experiment for different observables measured between 40
and 80 MeV per nucleon. A simple 7Be-p potential model description of 8B seems
sufficient to describe all observables. In particular, the asymmetry in
parallel-momentum distributions due to E1-E2 interferences is well reproduced
without any scaling. The projectile-target nuclear interactions seem negligible
if data are selected at forward angles. On the contrary, like in previous
analyzes we observe a significant influence of higher-order effects. The
accuracy of astrophysical S factors for the 7Be(p,gamma)8B reaction at stellar
energies extracted from breakup measurements therefore seems difficult to
evaluate.

  systems",,,"10.1140/epjst/e2008-00717-8",,"quant-ph",,"  A system of two interacting photon modes, without constraints on the photon
number, in the presence of a Kerr nonlinearity, exhibits BEC if the transfer
amplitude is greater than the mode frequency. A symmetry-breaking field (SBF)
can be introduced by taking into account a classical electron current. The
ground state, in the limit of small nonlinearity, becomes a squeezed state, and
thus the modes become entangled. The smaller is the SBF, the greater is
entanglement. Superfluid-like behavior is observed in the study of entanglement
growth from an initial coherent state, since in the short-time range the growth
does not depend on the SBF amplitude, and on the initial state amplitude. On
the other hand, the latter is the only parameter which determines entanglement
in the absence of the SBF.

repairable systems. In particular we consider imperfect repair models, defined
in terms of virtual age processes, and the trend-renewal process which extends
the nonhomogeneous Poisson process and the renewal process. In the case where
several systems of the same kind are observed, we show how observed covariates
and unobserved heterogeneity can be included in the models. We also consider
various approaches to trend testing. Modern reliability data bases usually
contain information on the type of failure, the type of maintenance and so
forth in addition to the failure times themselves. Basing our work on recent
literature we present a framework where the observed events are modeled as
marked point processes, with marks labeling the types of events. Throughout the
paper the emphasis is more on modeling than on statistical inference.

theory (OSFT and BSFT, respectively), in the bosonic and supersymmetric (susy)

a family of time-dependent BSFT solutions for the bosonic and susy string.
These are parametrized by an arbitrary constant r involved in solving the Green
equation of the target fields. When r=0 we recover previous results in BSFT,
whereas for r attaining the value predicted by OSFT it is shown that the
bosonic OSFT solution is the derivative of the boundary one; in the
supersymmetric case the relation between the two solutions is more complicated.
This technical correspondence sheds some light on the nature of wild
oscillations, which appear in both theories whenever r>0.

  Observation from Radio to Gamma Ray.' (21-24 May 2007, Alaska)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Several multi-frequency polarization studies have shown the presence of
systematic Faraday Rotation gradients across the parsec-scale jets of Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN), taken to be due to the systematic variation of the
line-of-sight component of a helical magnetic field across the jet. Other
studies have confirmed the presence and sense of these gradients in several
sources, thus providing evidence that these gradients persist over time and
over large distances from the core. However, we find surprising new evidence
for a reversal in the direction of the Faraday Rotation gradient across the jet
of 1803+784, for which multi-wavelength polarization observations are available
at four epochs. At all four epochs, we observe transverse Rotation Measure (RM)
gradients across the jet, consistent with the presence of a helical magnetic
field wrapped around the jet. However, we also observe a ''flip'' in the
direction of the gradient between June 2000 and August 2002. Although the
origins of this phenomena are not understood, one way to interpret this change
is if the sense of rotation of the central supermassive black hole and
accretion disc has remained the same, but the dominant magnetic pole facing the
Earth has changed from North to South.

interoccurrence time or the waiting time, i.e., the time interval between
successive earthquakes, based on the two-dimensional (2-D) spring-block
(Burridge-Knopoff) model, selecting the velocity-weakening property as the
constitutive friction law. The statistical properties of frequency distribution
and the cumulative distribution of the interoccurrence time are discussed by
tuning the dynamical parameters, namely, a stiffness and frictional property of
a fault. We optimize these model parameters to reproduce the interoccurrence
time statistics in nature; the frequency and cumulative distribution can be
described by the power law and Zipf-Mandelbrot type power law, respectively. In
an optimal case, the b-value of the Gutenberg-Richter law and the ratio of wave
propagation velocity are in agreement with those derived from real earthquakes.
As the threshold of magnitude is increased, the interoccurrence time
distribution tends to follow an exponential distribution. Hence it is suggested
that a temporal sequence of earthquakes, aside from small-magnitude events, is
a Poisson process, which is observed in nature. We found that the
interoccurrence time statistics derived from the 2-D BK (original) model can
efficiently reproduce that of real earthquakes, so that the model can be
recognized as a realistic one in view of interoccurrence time statistics.
