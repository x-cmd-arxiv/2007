Seyfert 1 galaxy, NGC 4151. We analyze ground-based spectroscopy as well as
imaging data from the ground and space, and we construct 3-integral
axisymmetric models in order to constrain the BH mass and mass-to-light ratio.
The dynamical models depend on the assumed inclination of the kinematic
symmetry axis of the stellar bulge. In the case where the bulge is assumed to
be viewed edge-on, the kinematical data give only an upper limit to the mass of
the BH of ~4e7 M_sun (1 sigma). If the bulge kinematic axis is assumed to have
the same inclination as the symmetry axis of the large-scale galaxy disk (i.e.,
23 degrees relative to the line of sight), a best-fit dynamical mass between
4-5e7 M_sun is obtained. However, because of the poor quality of the fit when
the bulge is assumed to be inclined (as determined by the noisiness of the
chi^2 surface and its minimum value), and because we lack spectroscopic data
that clearly resolves the BH sphere of influence, we consider our measurements
to be tentative estimates of the dynamical BH mass. With this preliminary
result, NGC 4151 is now among the small sample of galaxies in which the BH mass
has been constrained from two independent techniques, and the mass values we
find for both bulge inclinations are in reasonable agreement with the recent
estimate from reverberation mapping (4.57[+0.57/-0.47]e7 M_sun) published by
Bentz et al.

root-reductive Lie algebra is by definition a maximal locally solvable
subalgebra. The main general result of this paper is that a Borel subalgebra of
an infinite-dimensional indecomposable root-reductive Lie algebra is the
simultaneous stabilizer of a certain type of generalized flag in each of the
standard representations. For the three infinite-dimensional simple
root-reductive Lie algebras more precise results are obtained. The map sending
a maximal closed (isotropic) generalized flag in the standard representation to
its stabilizer hits Borel subalgebras, yielding a bijection in the cases of
sl_infty and sp_infty; in the case of so_infty the fibers are of size one and
two. A description is given of a nice class of toral subalgebras contained in

dominance. The Yukawa and soft trilinear and scalar mass squared matrices and
kinetic terms are expanded in powers of the flavons used to spontaneously break
the SU(3) family symmetry, and the canonically normalized versions of these
matrices are constructed. The soft mass matrices are then expressed in the
Super-CKM basis, and the leading order mass insertion parameters are
calculated, and are shown to satisfy the experimental constraints from flavour
changing neutral current processes. Assuming that CP is spontaneously broken by
the flavons, the next-to-leading order effects responsible for CP violation are
then estimated, and the predictions for electric dipole moments are shown to be
an order of magnitude more suppressed than those predicted from the constrained
minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM), and may be further suppressed if
the high energy trilinear soft parameter is assumed to be relatively small. We
also predict that, unlike in the CMSSM, epsilon_K'/epsilon_K may be dominated
by the SUSY operator O_8. We also discuss the additional constraints from

symmetric, has a power-law radial dependence, and drops discontinuously to zero
at the outer radius of the cluster. We carry out comparisons between an
analytic model (in which the stars are considered in terms of a spatially
continuous injection of mass and energy) and 3D gasdynamic simulations (in
which we include 100 stars with identical winds, located in 3D space by
statistically sampling the stellar distribution function). From the analytic
model, we find that for stellar distributions with steep enough radial
dependencies the cluster wind flow develops a very high central density and a
non-zero central velocity, and for steeper dependencies it becomes fully
supersonic throughout the volume of the cluster (these properties are partially
reproduced by the 3D numerical simulations). Therefore, the wind solutions
obtained for stratified clusters can differ dramatically from the case of a
homogeneous stellar distribution (which produces a cluster wind with zero
central velocity, and a fully subsonic flow within the cluster radius).
Finally, from our numerical simulations we compute predictions of X-ray
emission maps and luminosities, which can be directly compared with
observations of cluster wind flows.

investigated theoretically by analyzing simple discrete stochastic models. The
translocation dynamics is viewed as a sequence of two events: motion of the
folded segment through the channel followed by the linear part of the polymer.
The transition rates vary for the folded and linear segments because of
different interactions between the polymer molecule and the pore. It is shown
that the translocation time depends non-monotonously on the length of the
folded segment for short polymers and weak external fields, while it becomes
monotonous for long molecules and large fields. Also, there is a critical
interaction between the polymers and the pore that separates two dynamic
regimes. For stronger interactions the folded polymer moves slower, while for
weaker interactions the linear chain translocation is the fastest. In addition,
our calculations show that the folding does not change the translocation
scaling properties of the polymer. These phenomena can be explained by the
interplay between the translocation distances and transition rates for the
folded and linear segments of the polymer. Theoretical results are applied for
analysis of experimental translocations through solid-state nanopores.

element abundances in planetary nebulae (PNe). This survey was motivated by the
fact that a PN may be enriched in n-capture elements if its progenitor star
experienced s-process nucleosynthesis during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
phase. [Kr III] 2.199 and/or [Se IV] 2.287 $\mu$m were detected in 81 PNe out
of 120 PNe, for a detection rate of nearly 70%. We derive Se and Kr abundances
or upper limits using ionization correction factors derived from
photoionization models. A significant range is found in the Se and Kr
abundances, from near solar (no enrichment), to enriched by a factor of ten.
Our survey has increased the number of PNe with known n-capture element
abundances by an order of magnitude, enabling us to explore correlations
between s-process enrichments and other nebular and central star properties. In
particular, the Se and Kr enrichments display a positive correlation with
nebular C/O ratios, as theoretically expected. Peimbert Type I PNe and bipolar
PNe, whose progenitors are believed to be intermediate-mass stars (>3-4 M_sun),
exhibit little or no s-process enrichment. Interestingly, PNe with H-deficient
[WC] central stars do not exhibit systematically larger s-process enrichments
than other PNe, despite the fact that their central stars are enriched in C and
probably n-capture elements. Finally, the few PNe in our sample with known or
probable binary central star systems exhibit little s-process enrichment, which
may be explained if binary interactions truncated their AGB phases. We also
briefly discuss a new observational program to detect optical emission lines of
n-capture elements, and new atomic data calculations that will greatly improve
the accuracy of n-capture element abundance determinations in PNe.

subject. Very recently, however, meaningful experimental studies of the problem
have finally become possible, stimulating theoretical interest as well.
Progress in this field is perhaps most urgently needed in the foundations of
quantum statistical mechanics. This is so because in generic isolated systems,
one expects nonequilibrium dynamics on its own to result in thermalization: a
relaxation to states where the values of macroscopic quantities are stationary,
universal with respect to widely differing initial conditions, and predictable
through the time-tested recipe of statistical mechanics. However, it is not
obvious what feature of many-body quantum mechanics makes quantum
thermalization possible, in a sense analogous to that in which dynamical chaos
makes classical thermalization possible. For example, dynamical chaos itself
cannot occur in an isolated quantum system, where time evolution is linear and
the spectrum is discrete. Underscoring that new rules could apply in this case,
some recent studies even suggested that statistical mechanics may give wrong
predictions for the outcomes of relaxation in such systems. Here we demonstrate
that an isolated generic quantum many-body system does in fact relax to a state
well-described by the standard statistical mechanical prescription. Moreover,
we show that time evolution itself plays a merely auxiliary role in relaxation
and that thermalization happens instead at the level of individual eigenstates,
as first proposed by J.M. Deutsch and M. Srednicki. A striking consequence of
this eigenstate thermalization scenario is that the knowledge of a single
many-body eigenstate suffices to compute thermal averages-any eigenstate in the
microcanonical energy window will do, as they all give the same result.

mixture that leads to a high neutrino flux and the spin-dependent neutralino
capture rate in the Sun is enhanced by 10^3 over the spin-independent rate. For

  http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~gould/contam.ps.gz",,,,"astro-ph",,"  A recent astroph posting argued that the Gould (2003a) halo sample is
substantially contaminated with thick-disk stars, which would then ``wash out''
any signature of granularity in the halo velocity distribution due to streams.
If correct, this would imply that the limits placed by Gould (2003b) on streams
are not valid. Here I investigate such contamination using six different
indicators: (1) morphology of the underlying reduced proper motion diagram used
to select halo stars; (2) comparison of kinematic and parallax-based distance
scales; (3) comparison of derived halo parameters for the Gould (2003a) sample
with other determinations; (4) a precision color-color diagram for a random
subsample; (5) the 3-dimensional velocity distribution of a random subsample;
(6) metallicity distribution versus kinematic cuts on a random subsample. I
estimate that the contamination is of order 2%. Thus, the upper limits on the
density of nearby streams derived by Gould (2003b) remain valid. In particular,
at 95% confidence, no more than 5% of local halo stars (within about 300 pc)
are in any one coherent stream. Determining whether or not this local
measurement is consistent with CDM remains an outstanding question.

near Leo I based on spectra obtained with the MMT's Hectochelle spectrograph
near the MgI/Mgb lines. We estimate the mean velocity error of our sample to be
2.4 km/s, with a systematic error of < 1 km/s. We produce a final sample of 328
Leo I red giant members, from which we measure a mean heliocentric radial
velocity of 282.9 +/- 0.5 km/s, and a mean radial velocity dispersion of 9.2
+/- 0.4 km/s for Leo I. The dispersion profile of Leo I is flat out to beyond
its classical `tidal' radius. We fit the profile to a variety of equilibrium
dynamical models and can strongly rule out models where mass follows light.
Two-component Sersic+NFW models with tangentially anisotropic velocity
distributions fit the dispersion profile well, with isotropic models ruled out
at a 95% confidence level. The mass and V-band mass-to-light ratio of Leo I
estimated from equilibrium models are in the ranges 5-7 x 10^7 M_sun and 9-14
(solar units), respectively, out to 1 kpc from the galaxy center. Leo I members
located outside a `break radius' (about 400 arcsec = 500 pc) exhibit
significant velocity anisotropy, whereas stars interior appear to have
isotropic kinematics. We propose the break radius represents the location of
the tidal radius of Leo I at perigalacticon of a highly elliptical orbit. Our
scenario can account for the complex star formation history of Leo I, the
presence of population segregation within the galaxy, and Leo I's large outward
velocity from the Milky Way. The lack of extended tidal arms in Leo I suggests
the galaxy has experienced only one perigalactic passage with the Milky Way,
implying that Leo I may have been injected into its present orbit by a third
body a few Gyr before perigalacticon.

BATSE has enough sensitivity to see them and GRBs are expected out to the
redshift of the first star formation. To improve results we used five

error bars. Combining these relations, we calculated the redshifts of 36 BATSE
GRBs with claimed z>8. Our results include 13 bursts with our derived best
redshift z_best>8, which looks promising at first. But the calculated redshift
uncertainties are significantly large in these selected cases. With only one
exception, all of our bursts have z_1siglow<9. The one exception (BATSE trigger
2035) is likely a short duration burst at z>~4. Our best case for a very high

afunction of the distance between them, measured from the
hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface of one of the two nearest, cis, leaves to the
other. The two leaves of each bilayer are of equal composition; 0.6 volume
fraction of a lamellar-forming amphiphile, such as dioleoylphosphatidylcholine,
and 0.4 volume fraction of a hexagonal-forming amphiphile, such as
dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Self-consistent field theory is employed to
solve the model. We find that the largest barrier to fusion is that to create
the metastable stalk. This barrier is the smallest, about 14.6 $k_BT$, when the
bilayers are at a distance about 20 percent greater than the thickness of a
single leaf, a distance which would correspond to between two and three
nanometers for typical bilayers. The very size of the protein machinery which
brings the membranes together can prevent them from reaching this optimum
separation. For even modestly larger separations, we find a linear rate of
increase of the free energy with distance between bilayers for the metastable
stalk itself and for the barrier to the creation of this stalk. We estimate
these rates for biological membranes to be about 7.1 $k_BT$/nm and 16.7
$k_BT$/nm respectively. The major contribution to this rate comes from the
increased packing energy associated with the hydrophobic tails. From this we
estimate, for the case of hemagglutinin, a free energy of 38 k_BT for the
metastable stalk itself, and a barrier to create it of 73 k_BT. Such a large
barrier would require that more than a single hemagglutinin molecule be
involved in the fusion process, as is observed.

barrier and reduce its energy further. This intermediate site makes the
adsorption (and desorption) of W atoms a two-step process in the presence of Fe

also provide a surface for W atoms to adsorb facilitating the diffusion of W

pulses peaking 80 and 140 s after the peak of the gamma-ray burst and possibly
accompanied by a faint gamma-ray tail. Remarkably, the late optical and X-ray
afterglow underwent a major rebrightening between 3x10^4 and 2x10^5 s after the
burst with an X-ray fluence comparable with that of the prompt emission
extrapolated in the same band. Notably, the time profile of the late
rebrightening can be described as the combination of a time-rescaled version of
the prompt gamma-ray pulse and an underlying power law. This result supports a
common origin for both prompt and late X-ray/optical afterglow rebrightening of

responsible for the prompt emission, while a second shell would produce the
rebrightening when impacting the leading blastwave in a refreshed shock

In this peculiar cyclic model, the mechanism of solving the black hole problem
is through tearing up black holes by phantom. However, using the theory of
fluid accretion onto black holes, we show in this paper that there exists
another possibility: that black holes cannot be torn up by phantom in this
cyclic model. We discussed this possibility and showed that the masses of black
holes might first decrease and then increase, through phantom accretion onto
black holes in the expanding stage of the cyclic universe.

agrees with the recent extraction at JLab, but that in the Landau gauge shows
infrared suppression. The suppression is expected to be due to the color
anti-symmetric ghost propagator which in the unquenched configurations has
stronger infrared singularity than the color diagonal ghost propagator. The
Coulomb form factor in the infrared depends on the kind of the fermion
incorporated in the system and the temperature. The quark has the effect of

propagator is reduced in the unquenched configuration, and the Kugo-Ojima

density and velocity fields. The adaptivity to the local density and geometry
preserves three key characteristics of the cosmic matter distribution: 1) its
hierarchical nature,2) its anisotropic weblike morphology, 3) the presence and
structure of voids. The lecture notes discuss the mathematical context and
background of the DTFE method, in essence a first order version of Natural
Neighbour methods, smooth and higher order spatial interpolation techniques.
This is followed by an outline of the DTFE procedure. A series of tests on
spatially complex point distributions provides quantitative information on its
performance and noise characteristics. We conclude with a few cosmological
applications. The reconstruction of the spatial weblike patterns in N-body
simulations and in the 2dFGRS provide a visual impression of DTFE's
performance. The analysis of the velocity divergence pdf and maps obtained of

which might energize few thermal particles to sufficient acceleration and
furthermore this precursor region may act as confining large angle scatterer

smoothing of the shock front could lower the acceleration efficiency. These
controversies motivated us to investigate numerically by Monte Carlo
simulations the particle acceleration efficiency in oblique modified shocks.
The results show flatter spectra compared to the spectra of the pressumed sharp

longitudinal optic phonons via dominant Frolic coupling. Thus, energy supplied
to the carriers by high electric fields goes into phonon generation. As the
phonon life time is long enough, phonon distribution is disturbed and a non

their re-absorption by the carriers. In the present work the high frequency

dimensions in light of basic principles of quantum mechanics and general
relativity and consider some of its phenomenological consequences. The quantum
gravitational fluctuations of the background metric that comes through the
operational definition of space-time are controlled by the Planck scale and are
therefore strongly suppressed. Then we extend our analysis to the braneworld
setup with low fundamental scale of gravity. It is observed that in this case
the quantum gravitational fluctuations on the brane may become unacceptably
large. The magnification of fluctuations is not linked directly to the low
quantum gravity scale but rather to the higher-dimensional modification of
Newton's inverse square law at relatively large distances. For models with
compact extra dimensions the shape modulus of extra space can be used as a most
natural and safe stabilization mechanism against these fluctuations.

radial symmetry of the aperture geometry. Remarkably, the transmission
properties can be described by a classical waveguide model even for thicknesses
of the silver film as thin as a quarter of a wavelength.

in an atomic gas in an optical lattice confined in a power-law potential. The
transition can be made more pronounced by increasing the power law, but at the
same time, experimental uncertainty in the number of particles will induce
corresponding fluctuations in the measured condensate fraction. Calculations in
two dimensions indicate that a potential slightly more flat-bottomed than a
quadratic one is to be preferred for a wide range of particle number
fluctuation size.

  excitation by core convection and the Coriolis effect","9 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication by A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20078078",,"astro-ph",,"  This is the third in a series of papers that deal with angular momentum
transport by internal gravity waves. We concentrate on the waves excited by
core convection in a 3Msun, Pop I main sequence star. Here, we want to examine
the role of the Coriolis acceleration in the equations of motion that describe
the behavior of waves and to evaluate its impact on angular momentum transport.
We use the so-called traditional approximation of geophysics, which allows
variable separation in radial and horizontal components. In the presence of
rotation, the horizontal structure is described by Hough functions instead of
spherical harmonics. The Coriolis acceleration has two main effects on waves.
It transforms pure gravity waves into gravito-inertial waves that have a larger
amplitude closer to the equator, and it introduces new waves whose restoring
force is mainly the conservation of vorticity. Taking the Coriolis acceleration
into account changes the subtle balance between prograde and retrograde waves
in non-rotating stars. It also introduces new types of waves that are either
purely prograde or retrograde. We show in this paper where the local deposition
of angular momentum by such waves is important.
