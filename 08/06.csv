the ``No Parallel Crossing'' requirement can be used to evaluate the provable

the interaction process between an electron and a positron and for much more
complicated interaction processes. Other candidates for virtual photons are
evanescent modes known from optics. Evanescent modes have a purely imaginary

staggeredsuperposition of two eigenvalue sequences. For a large number of
channels, the statistics for a system with a lead-transposing symmetry
approaches that of a superposition of two uncorrelated sets of eigenvalues as
in systems with a lead-preserving symmetry (which can be desymmetrized). These
predictions are confirmed by numerical computations of the
transmission-eigenvalue spacing distribution for quantum billiards and for the
open kicked rotator.

related to the Arnold kinematic fast dynamo. In this solution it is shown that
the conformal effect on the fast dynamo metric only enhances the Zeldovich

mapping is performed in Arnold fast dynamo line element a uniform stretch is
obtained in the original line element.

time decreases but variance increases as the amplitude of channel noise
increases. In the case of single pulse detection, we show that channel noise
enables one neuron to detect the subthreshold signals and an optimal membrane

performance. However, the detection ability of a single neuron is limited by
large errors. Here, we test a simple neuronal network that can enhance the
pulse detecting abilities of neurons and find dozens of neurons can perfectly
detect subthreshold pulses. The phenomenon of intrinsic stochastic resonance is
also found both at the level of single neurons and at the level of networks. At

systems. These are difference analogues of the quasi exactly solvable
multi-particle systems, the quantum Inozemtsev systems obtained by deforming
the well-known exactly solvable Calogero-Sutherland systems. They have a finite
number of exactly calculable eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. This paper is a
multi-particle extension of the recent paper by one of the authors on deriving
quasi exactly solvable difference equations of single degree of freedom.

though some quantitative discrepancies exist near Tc2. The behavior of the
phonons has been studied using inelastic x-ray scattering with ~2 meV energy
resolution. For the first time, a zone boundary phonon which softens at the
spin-Peierls temperature Tsp has been observed. Our results show reasonably
good quantitative agreement with the Cross-Fisher theory for the phonon
dynamics at wave vectors near the zone boundary and temperatures near Tsp.
However, not all aspects of the data can be described, such as the strong
overdamping of the soft mode above Tsp. Overall, our results show that TiOCl is
a good realization of a spin-Peierls system, where the phonon softening allows
us to identify the transition temperature as Tsp=Tc2=92 K

shows broad H I, He I, and He II accretion disk emission lines with deep narrow
absorption components from H I, He I, Mg II and Ca II. The absorption lines are
seen throughout the orbital period, disappearing only during primary eclipse.
These absorption lines are either the the result of an optically-thick inner
accretion disk or from the photosphere of the primary star. Radial velocity
measurements show that the H I, He I, and Mg II absorption lines phase with the
the primary star, while weak absorption features in the continuum phase with
the secondary star. Radial velocity solutions give a 150+/-4 km/s
semi-amplitude for the primary star and 192.8+/-5.6 km/s for the secondary. The
individual stellar masses are 0.63-0.69 Mdot for the primary and 0.49-0.54 Mdot
for the secondary. The bright eclipsing nature of this binary has helped
provide masses for both components with an accuracy rarely achieved for CVs.
This binary most closely resembles a nova-like UX UMa or SW Sex type of CV.
J0644+3344, however, has a longer orbital period than most UX UMa or SW Sex

therefore likely to be a young interacting binary. The secondary star is

direct simulation of nonlinear self-focusing in the nonparaxial regime, and a
quantitative prediction of backscattering. However, our simulations showed that
there is a threshold value for the magnitude of the nonlinearity, above which
the iterations diverge. In this study, we numerically solve the one-dimensional
NLH using a Newton-type nonlinear solver. Because the Kerr nonlinearity
contains absolute values of the field, the NLH has to be recast as a system of
two real equations in order to apply Newton's method. Our numerical simulations
show that Newton's method converges rapidly and, in contradistinction with the
iterations based on freezing the nonlinearity, enables computations for very
high levels of nonlinearity. In addition, we introduce a novel compact
finite-volume fourth order discretization for the NLH with material
discontinuities.The one-dimensional results of the current paper create a

considerable attention. However, there has been little research on the

whether web sites (as opposed to the entire Web) exhibit structural

governmental departments, commercial companies and university departments in
different countries. These web sites consisted of as little as a few thousand
pages to millions of pages. Statistical analysis of these 18 sites revealed
that the internal link structure of the web sites are significantly different
when measured with first and second-order topological properties, i.e.
properties based on the connectivity of an individual or a pairs of nodes.
However, examination of a third-order topological property that consider the
connectivity between three nodes that form a triangle, revealed a strong
correspondence across web sites, suggestive of an invariant. Comparison with
the Web, the AS Internet, and a citation network, showed that this third-order
property is not shared across other types of networks. Nor is the property
exhibited in generative network models such as that of Barabasi and Albert.

  cooling timescale: the fragmentation boundary revisited","accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12322.x",,"astro-ph",,"  A number of previous studies of the fragmentation of self-gravitating
protostellar discs have modeled radiative cooling with a cooling timescale
(t_{cool}) parameterised as a simple multiple (beta_{cool}) of the local
dynamical timescale. Such studies have delineated the `fragmentation boundary'
in terms of a critical value of beta_{cool} (beta_{crit}), where the disc
fragments if beta_{cool} < beta_{crit}. Such an approach however begs the
question of how in reality a disc could ever be assembled with beta_{cool} <
beta_{crit}. Here we adopt the more realistic approach of gradually reducing
beta_{cool}, as might correspond to changes in thermal regime due to secular
changes in the disc density profile. We find that when beta_{cool} is gradually
reduced (on a timescale longer than t_{cool}), the disc is stabilised against
fragmentation, compared with models in which beta_{cool} is reduced rapidly. We
therefore conclude that a disc's ability to remain in a self-regulated,
self-gravitating state (without fragmentation) is partly dependent on its
thermal history, as well as its current cooling rate. Nevertheless, a slow
reduction in t_{cool} appears only to lower the fragmentation boundary by about
a factor two in t_{cool} and thus only permits maximum alpha values
(parameterising the efficiency of angular momentum transfer in the disc) that
are about a factor two higher than determined hitherto. Our results therefore
do not undermine the notion of a fundamental upper limit to the heating rate
that can be delivered by gravitational instabilities before the disc is subject
to fragmentation. An important implication of this work, therefore, is that
self-gravitating discs can enter into the regime of fragmentation via secular
evolution and it is not necessary to invoke rapid (impulsive) events to trigger
fragmentation.

derived models suggest that the rotation curve profile and amplitude are best
fit with a dark matter component similar to those of local spiral galaxies. The
stellar component also has a similar length scale, but with substantially
smaller masses than similarly luminous disk galaxies in the local universe.
Comparing the average dark matter density inside the optical radius we find
that the disk galaxies at z=1 have larger densities (by up to a factor of 7)
than similar disk galaxies in the local Universe. Furthermore, the angular
momentum per unit mass versus reference velocity is well matched to the local
relation, suggesting that the angular momentum of the disk remains constant

observations point towards a spirals' formation scenario in which stellar disks
are slowly grown by the accretion of angular momentum conserving material.

spectral interactions involved in the cascade for decaying magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) flows in the presence of a uniform magnetic field $\bf B$ at various
intensities. The results are based on a detailed analysis of three-dimensional
numerical flows at moderate Reynold numbers. The energy transfer functions, as
well as the global and partial fluxes, are examined by means of different
geometrical wavenumber shells. On the one hand, the transfer functions of the
two conserved Els\""asser energies $E^+$ and $E^-$ are found local in both the
directions parallel ($k_\|$-direction) and perpendicular ($k_\perp$-direction)
to the magnetic guide-field, whatever the ${\bf B}$-strength. On the other
hand, from the flux analysis, the interactions between the two
counterpropagating Els\""asser waves become nonlocal. Indeed, as the ${\bf
B}$-intensity is increased, local interactions are strongly decreased and the
interactions with small $k_\|$ modes dominate the cascade. Most of the energy
flux in the $k_\perp$-direction is due to modes in the plane at $k_\|=0$, while
the weaker cascade in the $k_\|$-direction is due to the modes with $k_\|=1$.
The stronger magnetized flows tends thus to get closer to the weak turbulence
limit where the three-wave resonant interactions are dominating. Hence, the
transition from the strong to the weak turbulence regime occurs by reducing the
number of effective modes in the energy cascade.

rigid geometric structure of algebraic type on a compact manifold. The

full support, we show the following.
  1) Either the manifold admits a smooth equivariant map onto a homogeneous
projective variety, defined on an open dense conull invariant set, or the Lie
algebra of the Zariski closure of the Gromov representation of the fundamental
group contains a Lie subalgebra isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the acting
group. As a corollary, a smooth non-trivial homogeneous projective factor does
exist whenever the fundamental group of $M$ admits only virtually solvable
linear representations, and thus in particular when $M$ is simply connected,
regardless of the real rank.
  2) There exist explicit examples showing that analytic rigid actions of
certain simple groups (of real rank one) may indeed fail to have a smooth
projective factor.
  3) It is possible to generalize Gromov's theorem on the algebraic hull of the
representation of the fundamental group of the manifold to the case of analytic
rigid non-unimodular structures, for actions of simple groups of any real rank.
  An important ingredient in the proofs is a generalization of Gromov's

  version",,"10.1086/586877",,"astro-ph",,"  [Abridged] Recent numerical relativity simulations have shown that the
emission of gravitational waves during the merger of two supermassive black
holes (SMBHs) delivers a kick to the final hole, with a magnitude as large as
4000 km/s. We study the motion of SMBHs ejected from galaxy cores by such kicks
and the effects on the stellar distribution using high-accuracy direct N-body
simulations. Following the kick, the motion of the SMBH exhibits three distinct
phases. (1) The SMBH oscillates with decreasing amplitude, losing energy via
dynamical friction each time it passes through the core. Chandrasekhar's theory
accurately reproduces the motion of the SMBH in this regime if 2 < ln Lambda <
3 and if the changing core density is taken into account. (2) When the
amplitude of the motion has fallen to roughly the core radius, the SMBH and
core begin to exhibit oscillations about their common center of mass. These
oscillations decay with a time constant that is at least 10 times longer than
would be predicted by naive application of the dynamical friction formula. (3)
Eventually, the SMBH reaches thermal equilibrium with the stars. We estimate
the time for the SMBH's oscillations to damp to the Brownian level in real
galaxies and infer times as long as 1 Gyr in the brightest galaxies. Ejection
of SMBHs also results in a lowered density of stars near the galaxy center;
mass deficits as large as five times the SMBH mass are produced for kick
velocities near the escape velocity. We compare the N-body density profiles
with luminosity profiles of early-type galaxies in Virgo and show that even the
largest observed cores can be reproduced by the kicks, without the need to
postulate hypermassive binary SMBHs. Implications for displaced AGNs and
helical radio structures are discussed.

high-T_c superconductors [Y. Kohsaka et al., Science 315, 1380 (2007)], we
investigate the emergence of spontaneous modulations in the d-wave
superconducting resonating valence bond phase using the t-J model at x=1/8
doping. Half-filled charge domains separated by four lattice spacings are found
to form along one of the crystal axis leading to modulated superconductivity
with out-of-phase d-wave order parameters in neighboring domains. Both
renormalized mean-field theory and variational Monte Carlo calculations yield
that the energies of modulated and uniform phases are very close to each other.
