agreement. We revisit this issue by analyzing both the 2dFGRS and SDSS DR5
catalogues using essentially identical techniques. We confirm that the 2dFGRS
exhibits relatively more large scale power than the SDSS, or, equivalently,
SDSS has more small scale power. We demonstrate that this difference is due to
the r-band selected SDSS catalogue being dominated by more strongly clustered
red galaxies, which have a stronger scale dependent bias. The power spectra of
galaxies of the same rest frame colours from the two surveys match well. If not
accounted for, the difference between the SDSS and 2dFGRS power spectra causes
a bias in the obtained constraints on cosmological parameters which is larger
than the uncertainty with which they are determined. We also found that the
correction developed by Cole et al.(2005) to model the distortion in the shape
of the power spectrum due to non-linear evolution and scale dependent bias is
not able to reconcile the constraints obtained from the 2dFGRS and SDSS power
spectra. Intriguingly, the model is able to describe the differences between
the 2dFGRS and the much more strongly clustered LRG sample, which exhibits
greater nonlinearities. This shows that more work is needed to understand the
relation between the galaxy power spectrum and the linear perturbation theory
prediction for the power spectrum of matter fluctuations. It is therefore
important to accurately model these effects to get precise estimates of
cosmological parameters from these power spectra and from future galaxy surveys
like Pan-STARRS, or the Dark Energy Survey, which will use selection criteria
similar to the one of SDSS.

Near the MOSFET channel conductance threshold, we observe oscillations in the

formation of a Si single-electron transistor. Abrupt steps present in sweeps of
the Al transistor conductance versus gate voltage are correlated with
single-electron charging events in the Si transistor, and vice versa. Analysis
of these correlations using a simple electrostatic model demonstrates that the
two single-electron transistor islands are closely aligned, with an
inter-island capacitance approximately equal to 1/3 of the total capacitance of
the Si transistor island, indicating that the Si transistor is strongly coupled
to the Al transistor.

natural measure of the number of accessible states for a single particle in one
dimension. Extension to N particles in three dimensions leads to TC/k as the
total number of possible arrangements or microstates. The different microstates
of the system are thus shown a posteriori to be equally probable, with
probability T-C/k, which implies that for the purposes of counting states the
particles of the gas are distinguishable. The most probable energy state of the
system is determined by the degeneracy of the microstates.

a static force, like wind acting on the rotor blades, can generate a resonant
excitation at a certain mechanical frequency. For nanomechanical systems

  the language editor",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20077884",,"astro-ph",,"  We verify whether the O/H abundances of galaxies can be derived from the
equivalent width (EW) R23 instead of the extinction-corrected flux R23, and
eventually propose a method of improving the reliability of this empirical
method, which is often used for the non-flux calibrated spectra of galaxies. We
select 37,173 star-forming galaxies from the SDSS-DR2, which offers a wide
range of properties to test the EW method. The EW-R23 method brings with it a
significant bias: for the bulk of SDSS galaxies, it may affect the
determination of log(O/H) by factors ranging from -0.2 to 0.1 dex and for some
galaxies by factors ranging from -0.5 to 0.2 dex. We characterize this
discrepancy (or bias) by alpha = (I_[OII]/I_Hbeta)/(EW_[OII]/EW_Hbeta), which
is virtually independent of dust extinction, while tightly correlating with
Dn(4000), although at a lower significance, with (g-r) colors. The EW-R23
method cannot be used as a proxy for the extinction-corrected flux R23 method.
  From analytical third-order polynomial fits of alpha versus (g-r) colors, we
have been able to correct the EW-R23 method. With this additional and easy
correction, the EW-R23 method provides O/H abundance values similar to those
derived from the extinction-corrected flux R23 method with an accuracy of ~0.1
dex for >92% of the SDSS galaxies.

calculated the dependence of the transition frequencies on \alpha^2 (q-factors)

core-valence correlation and Breit corrections to the q-factors appeared to be

confirms that the Fe II absorption lines seen in quasar spectra have large

remaining constant in the Newtonian limit. In qualitative terms this situation
simulates the effect of a dissipative mechanism in the classical Bondi

functional F[n] (free energy functional, e.g.), the second derivative of F[n]
plays the essential role. If the system in equilibrium is subject to the
conservation constraint of some extensive property (e.g. volume, material, or
energy conservation), the Euler equation determining the stationary point
corresponding to the equilibrium alters according to the method of Lagrange
multipliers. Here, the question as to how the effects of constraints can be
taken into account in a stability analysis based on second functional

derivatives incorporates all the effects due to constraints; therefore
constrained second derivatives provide the proper tool for the stability

constraints, it is demonstrated how the presented theory works. Further, the

Here descriptors weakly and strongly refer to 20 % and 124 % unidirectional
spatial compression of the X-point, respectively. In the weakly stressed case,
the reconnection rate, defined as the out-of-plane electric field in the
X-point (the magnetic null) normalised by the product of external magnetic
field and Alfv\'en speeds, peaks at 0.11, with its average over 1.25 Alfv\'en
times being 0.04. Electron energy distribution in the current sheet, at the
high energy end of the spectrum, shows a power law distribution with the index
varying in time, attaining a maximal value of -4.1 at the final simulation time
step (1.25 Alfv\'en times). In the strongly stressed case, magnetic
reconnection peak occurs 3.4 times faster and is more efficient. The peak
reconnection rate now attains value 2.5, with the average reconnection rate
over 1.25 Alfv\'en times being 0.5. The power law energy spectrum for the
electrons in the current sheet attains now a steeper index of -5.5, a value
close to the ones observed in the vicinity of X-type region in the Earth's
magneto-tail. Within about one Alfv\'en time, 2% and 20% of the initial
magnteic energy is converted into heat and accelerated particle energy in the
case of weak and strong stress, respectively. In the both cases, during the
peak of the reconnection, the quadruple out-of-plane magnetic field is
generated, hinting possibly to the Hall regime of the reconnection. These
results strongly suggest the importance of the collionless, stressed X-point
collapse as a possible contributing factor to the solution of the solar coronal
heating problem or more generally, as an efficient mechanism of converting
magnetic energy into heat and super-thermal particle energy.

spectra of an electrically insulating, nearly stoichiometric YTiO_3 single
crystal with ferromagnetic Curie temperature T_C = 30 K. The optical response
exhibits a weak but noticeable anisotropy. Using a classical dispersion
analysis, we identify three low-energy optical bands at 2.0, 2.9, and 3.7 eV.
Although the optical conductivity spectra are only weakly temperature dependent
below 300 K, we are able to distinguish high- and low-temperature regimes with
a distinct crossover point around 100 K. The low-temperature regime in the
optical response coincides with the temperature range in which significant
deviations from Curie-Weiss mean field behavior are observed in the
magnetization. Using an analysis based on a simple superexchange model, the
spectral weight rearrangement can be attributed to intersite d_i^1d_j^1
\longrightarrow d_i^2d_j^0 optical transitions. In particular, Kramers-Kronig
consistent changes in optical spectra around 2.9 eV can be associated with the
high-spin-state (^3T_1) optical transition. This indicates that other
mechanisms, such as weakly dipole-allowed p-d transitions and/or
exciton-polaron excitations, can contribute significantly to the optical band
at 2 eV. The recorded optical spectral weight gain of 2.9 eV optical band is
significantly suppressed and anisotropic, which we associate with complex
spin-orbit-lattice phenomena near ferromagnetic ordering temperature in YTiO_3.

and boost generators remain interaction free -- a feature characteristic of
Dirac's `` point-form\rq\rq of relativistic dynamics. Unlike previous attempts

expansion of the field operators and consider evolution of the system generated
by the 4-momentum operator. We verify that the Fock-space representations of
the Poincar\'e generators for free scalar and spin-1/2 fields look the same as

variables with $EX_{11}=0,E|X_{11}|^2=1$ and $E|X_{11}|^4<\infty$, and let
$A_n=\frac{1}{N}T_n^{{1}/{2}}X_nX_n^*T_n^{{1}/{2}}$, where $T_n^{{1}/{2}}$ is
the square root of a nonnegative definite matrix $T_n$ and $X_n$ is the
$n\times N$ matrix of the upper-left corner of the double array. The matrix
$A_n$ can be considered as a sample covariance matrix of an i.i.d. sample from
a population with mean zero and covariance matrix $T_n$, or as a multivariate
$F$ matrix if $T_n$ is the inverse of another sample covariance matrix. To
investigate the limiting behavior of the eigenvectors of $A_n$, a new form of
empirical spectral distribution is defined with weights defined by eigenvectors
and it is then shown that this has the same limiting spectral distribution as
the empirical spectral distribution defined by equal weights. Moreover, if
\{$X_{ij}$\} and $T_n$ are either real or complex and some additional moment
assumptions are made then linear spectral statistics defined by the
eigenvectors of $A_n$ are proved to have Gaussian limits, which suggests that
the eigenvector matrix of $A_n$ is nearly Haar distributed when $T_n$ is a
multiple of the identity matrix, an easy consequence for a Wishart matrix.

  discrete?","12 pages","J.Math.Phys.50:012503,2009","10.1063/1.3054277","AEI-2007-117, pi-qg-53","gr-qc",,"  One of the celebrated results of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) is the
discreteness of the spectrum of geometrical operators such as length, area and
volume operators. This is an indication that Planck scale geometry in LQG is
discontinuous rather than smooth. However, there is no rigorous proof thereof
at present, because the afore mentioned operators are not gauge invariant, they
do not commute with the quantum constraints. The relational formalism in the
incarnation of Rovelli's partial and complete observables provides a possible
mechanism for turning a non gauge invariant operator into a gauge invariant
one. In this paper we investigate whether the spectrum of such a physical, that
is gauge invariant, observable can be predicted from the spectrum of the
corresponding gauge variant observables. We will not do this in full LQG but
rather consider much simpler examples where field theoretical complications are
absent. We find, even in those simpler cases, that kinematical discreteness of
the spectrum does not necessarily survive at the gauge invariant level. Whether
or not this happens depends crucially on how the gauge invariant completion is
performed. This indicates that ``fundamental discreteness at Planck scale in
LQG'' is far from established. To prove it, one must provide the detailed
construction of gauge invariant versions of geometrical operators.

presently concentrates on single streamers or on coarse approximations of whole
breakdown trees. Here a periodic array of interacting streamer discharges in a
strong homogeneous electric field is studied in PDE approximation in two
dimensions. If the period of the streamer array is small enough, the streamers
do not branch, but approach uniform translation. When the streamers are close
to the branching regime, the enhanced field at the tip of the streamer is close
to $2 E_{\infty}$, where $E_{\infty}$ is the homogeneous field applied between
the electrodes. We discuss a moving boundary approximation to the set of PDEs.
This moving boundary model turns out to be essentially the same as the one for
two-fluid Hele-Shaw flows. In two dimensions, this model possesses a known
analytical solution. The shape of the 2D interacting streamers in uniform
motion obtained from the PDE simulations is actually well fitted by the
analytically known ``selected Saffman-Taylor finger''. This finding helps to
understand streamer interactions and raises new questions on the general theory
of finger selection in moving boundary problems.

  Workshop on Hybrid Logics (HyLo 2007)",,,,"cs.LO cs.CC",,"  Hybrid branching-time logics are introduced as extensions of CTL-like logics
with state variables and the downarrow-binder. Following recent work in the
linear framework, only logics with a single variable are considered. The
expressive power and the complexity of satisfiability of the resulting logics
is investigated.
  As main result, the satisfiability problem for the hybrid versions of several
branching-time logics is proved to be 2EXPTIME-complete. These branching-time
logics range from strict fragments of CTL to extensions of CTL that can talk
about the past and express fairness-properties. The complexity gap relative to
CTL is explained by a corresponding succinctness result.
  To prove the upper bound, the automata-theoretic approach to branching-time
logics is extended to hybrid logics, showing that non-emptiness of alternating
one-pebble Buchi tree automata is 2EXPTIME-complete.

1350-1800 square degrees at low Galactic latitude, providing HI spectra for
galaxies in regions of the sky where our knowledge of local large scale
structure remains incomplete, owing to obscuration from dust and high stellar
confusion near the Galactic plane. Because of these effects, a substantial
fraction of the galaxies detected in the survey will have no optical or
infrared counterparts. However, near infrared follow up observations of ALFA
ZOA sources found in regions of lowest obscuration could reveal whether some of
these sources could be objects in which little or no star formation has taken
place (""dark galaxies""). We present here the results of ALFA ZOA precursor
observations on two patches of sky totaling 140 square degrees (near l=40
degrees, and l=192 degrees). We have measured HI parameters for detections from
these observations, and cross-correlated with the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic
Database (NED). A significant fraction of the objects have never been detected
at any wavelength. For those galaxies that have been previously detected, a
significant fraction have no previously known redshift, and no previous HI
detection.
