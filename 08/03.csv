the burst localization we detect a highly unusual X-ray and optical transient,
SwiftJ195509.6+261406. We see high amplitude X-ray and optical variability on
very short time scales even at late times. Using near-infrared imaging assisted
by a laser guide star and adaptive optics, we identified the counterpart of
SwiftJ195509.6+261406. Late-time optical and near-infrared imaging constrain
the spectral type of the counterpart to be fainter than a K-dwarf assuming it
is of Galactic origin. It is possible that GRB 070610 and Swift
J195509.6+261406 are unrelated sources. However, the absence of a typical X-ray
afterglow from GRB 070610 in conjunction with the spatial and temporal
coincidence of the two motivate us to suggest that the sources are related. The
closest (imperfect) analog to Swift J195509.6+261406 is V4641 Sgr, an unusual
black hole binary. We suggest that Swift J195509.6+261406 along with V4641 Sgr
define a sub-class of stellar black hole binaries -- the fast X-ray novae. We
further suggest that fast X-ray novae are associated with bursts of gamma-rays.
If so, GRB 070610 defines a new class of celestial gamma-ray bursts and these
bursts dominate the long-duration GRB demographics

considered in the diquark spectator model. While the results of different
articles in the literature suggest that the signs of the Boer-Mulders function
in semi-inclusive DIS for both flavors $u$ and $d$ are the same and negative, a
previous calculation in the diquark-spectator model found that
$h_{1}^{\perp(u)}$ and $h_{1}^{\perp(d)}$ have different signs. The flavor
dependence is of significance for the analysis of the azimuthal $\cos(2\phi)$
asymmetries in unpolarized SIDIS and DY-processes, as well as for the overall
physical understanding of the distribution of transversely polarized quarks in
unpolarized nucleons. We find substantial differences with previous work. In
particular we obtain half and first moments of Boer-Mulders function that are
negative over the full range in Bjorken $x$ for both the $u$- and $d$- quarks.
In conjunction with the Collins function we then predict the $\cos(2\phi)$
azimuthal asymmetry for $\pi^{+}$ and $\pi^{-}$ in this framework. We also find
that the Sivers $u$- and $d$- quark are negative and positive respectively. As
a by-product of the formalism, we calculate the chiral-odd but ``T-even''
function $h_{1L}^{\perp}$, which allows us to present a prediction for the
single spin asymmetry $A_{UL}^{\sin(2\phi)}$ for a longitudinally polarized
target in SIDIS.

positive feedback mechanisms have been proposed to drive the diversity in
social and economic systems, but little effort has been devoted to pinpoint the
interplay between a dynamically changing social network and the spread and
gathering of information on the network. Here we analyze this phenomenon in
terms of a social network-model that explicitly simulates the feedback between
information assembly and emergence of social structures: changing beliefs are
coupled to changing relationships because agents self-organize a dynamic
network to facilitate their hunter-gatherer behavior in information space. Our
analysis demonstrates that tribal organizations and modular social networks can
emerge as a result of contact-seeking agents that reinforce their beliefs among
like-minded. We also find that prestigious persons can streamline the social
network into hierarchical structures around themselves.

experiments for many decades. The purpose of AT experiments is to acquire
reliability information quickly. Test units of a material, component, subsystem
or entire systems are subjected to higher-than-usual levels of one or more
accelerating variables such as temperature or stress. Then the AT results are
used to predict life of the units at use conditions. The extrapolation is
typically justified (correctly or incorrectly) on the basis of physically
motivated models or a combination of empirical model fitting with a sufficient
amount of previous experience in testing similar units. The need to extrapolate
in both time and the accelerating variables generally necessitates the use of
fully parametric models. Statisticians have made important contributions in the
development of appropriate stochastic models for AT data [typically a
distribution for the response and regression relationships between the
parameters of this distribution and the accelerating variable(s)], statistical
methods for AT planning (choice of accelerating variable levels and allocation
of available test units to those levels) and methods of estimation of suitable
reliability metrics. This paper provides a review of many of the AT models that
have been used successfully in this area.

the low energy effective action higher dimensional operators (derivative or
otherwise). Using a superfield language it is shown that a 4D N=1
supersymmetric theory with higher derivative operators in either the Kahler or
the superpotential part of the Lagrangian and with an otherwise arbitrary
superpotential, is equivalent to a 4D N=1 theory of second order (i.e. without
higher derivatives) with additional superfields and renormalised interactions.
We provide examples where a free theory with trivial supersymmetry breaking
provided by a linear superpotential becomes, in the presence of higher
derivatives terms and in the second order version, a non-trivial interactive
one with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. The couplings of the equivalent
theory acquire a threshold correction through their dependence on the scale of
the higher dimensional operator(s). The scalar potential in the second order
theory is not necessarily positive definite, and one can in principle have a
vanishing potential with broken supersymmetry. We provide an application to
MSSM and argue that at tree-level and for a mass scale associated to a higher
derivative term in the TeV range, the Higgs mass can be lifted above the
current experimental limits.

set of the first category, almost sure consistency fails dramatically on events
of full probability. One consequence is that almost sure consistency of binary
tree-structured rules such as CART requires conditions beyond requiring that
(1) the regression function be in ${\mathcal {L}}^1$, (2) partitions of a
Euclidean feature space be into polytopes with sides parallel to coordinate
axes, (3) the mesh of the partitions becomes arbitrarily fine almost surely and
(4) the empirical learning sample content of each polytope be ``large enough.''

  Channels - Part I: Amplify-and-Forward""",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  We consider slow fading relay channels with a single multi-antenna
source-destination terminal pair. The source signal arrives at the destination
via N hops through N-1 layers of relays. We analyze the diversity of such
channels with fixed network size at high SNR. In the clustered case where the
relays within the same layer can have full cooperation, the cooperative
decode-and-forward (DF) scheme is shown to be optimal in terms of the
diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). The upper bound on the DMT, the cut-set
bound, is attained. In the non-clustered case, we show that the naive
amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme has the maximum multiplexing gain of the
channel but is suboptimal in diversity, as compared to the cut-set bound. To
improve the diversity, space-time relay processing is introduced through the
parallel partition of the multihop channel. The idea is to let the source
signal go through K different ""AF paths"" in the multihop channel. This parallel
AF scheme creates a parallel channel in the time domain and has the maximum
diversity if the partition is properly designed. Since this scheme does not
achieve the maximum multiplexing gain in general, we propose a flip-and-forward
(FF) scheme that is built from the parallel AF scheme. It is shown that the FF
scheme achieves both the maximum diversity and multiplexing gains in a
distributed multihop channel of arbitrary size. In order to realize the DMT
promised by the relaying strategies, approximately universal coding schemes are
also proposed.

Several cosmic shear statistics have been developed in order to analyze data
from surveys. For the covariances of the prevalent second-order measures we
present simple and handy formulae, valid under the assumptions of Gaussian
density fluctuations and a simple survey geometry. We also formulate these
results in the context of shear tomography, i.e. the inclusion of redshift
information, and generalize them to arbitrary data field geometries. We define
estimators for the E- and B-mode projected power spectra and show them to be
unbiased in the case of Gaussianity and a simple survey geometry. From the
covariance of these estimators we demonstrate how to derive covariances of
arbitrary combinations of second-order cosmic shear measures. We then
recalculate the power spectrum covariance for general survey geometries and
examine the bias thereby introduced on the estimators for exemplary
configurations. Our results for the covariances are considerably simpler than
and analytically shown to be equivalent to the real-space approach presented in
the first paper of this series. We find good agreement with other numerical
evaluations and confirm the general properties of the covariance matrices. The
studies of the specific survey configurations suggest that our simplified
covariances may be employed for realistic survey geometries to good
approximation.

hydrogenation of Ga1-xMnxAs followed by local reactivation using confined

reactivation of micrometer-sized regions that accompanies the restoration of

behaviour of the temperature for large masses emerges as the Hawking
temperature of the system (classical or semiclassical phase) in which the

hole or string behavior) the temperature becomes the string temperature which
emerges as the critical temperature of the system. At low masses, a phase

reimaged by the camera onto the detector. This recombination can occur in two
different ways. We observe this ghost in two spectrographs being developed by
the University of Wisconsin - Madison: the Robert Stobie Spectrograph for the
Southern African Large Telescope and the Bench Spectrograph for the WIYN 3.5m
telescope. The typical ratio of the brightness of the ghost relative to the
integrated flux of the spectrum is of order 10^-4, implying a recombination
efficiency of the VPH gratings of order 10^-3 or higher, consistent with the
output of rigorous coupled wave analysis. Any spectrograph employing VPH
gratings, including grisms, in Littrow configuration will suffer from this
ghost, though the general effect is not intrinsic to VPH gratings themselves
and has been observed in systems with conventional gratings in non-Littrow
configurations. We explain the geometric configurations that can result in the
ghost as well as a more general prescription for predicting its position and
brightness on the detector. We make recommendations for mitigating the ghost
effects for spectrographs and gratings currently built. We further suggest
design modifications for future VPH gratings to eliminate the problem entirely,
including tilted fringes and/or prismatic substrates. We discuss the resultant
implications on the spectrograph performance metrics.

are lifted, the instanton can at best generate higher fermionic F-terms of
Beasley-Witten type. We analyse two strategies to lift the additional zero
modes. First we discuss the process of instantonic brane recombination in Type
IIA orientifolds. We show that in some cases charge invariance of the measure
enforces the presence of further zero modes which, unlike the Goldstinos,
cannot be absorbed. In other cases, the instanton exhibits reparameterisation
zero modes after recombination and a superpotential is generated if these are
lifted by suitable closed or open string couplings. In the second part of the
paper we address lifting the extra Goldstinos of D3-brane instantons by
supersymmetric three-form background fluxes in Type IIB orientifolds. This
requires non-trivial gauge flux on the instanton. Only if the part of the

several major physical mechanisms to account for the BO effect, and an example

morphological type in the sense that redder, early-type disk galaxies rotate
faster than bluer, later-type disk galaxies for most luminosities. The VL
relation at I- and K-bands is independent of surface brightness, size and light
concentration. The log-slope of the I- and K-band RL relations is a strong
function of morphology and varies from 0.25 to 0.5. The average dispersion
sigma_ln(RL) decreases from 0.33 at I-band to 0.29 at K, likely due to the
2MASS selection bias against lower surface brightness galaxies. Measurement
uncertainties are sigma_ln(V)~0.09, sigma_ln(L)~0.14 and somewhat larger and
harder to estimate for ln(R). The color dependence of the VL relation is
consistent with expectations from stellar population synthesis models. The VL
and RL residuals are largely uncorrelated with each other; the RV-RL residuals
show only a weak positive correlation. These correlations suggest that scatter
in luminosity is not a significant source of the scatter in the VL and RL
relations. The observed scaling relations can be understood in the context of a
model of disk galaxies embedded in dark matter halos that invokes low mean spin
parameters and dark halo expansion, as we describe in our companion paper
(Dutton et al. 2007). We discuss in two appendices various pitfalls of standard
analytical derivations of galaxy scaling relations, including the Tully-Fisher
relation with different slopes. (Abridged).

the classification of the timelike and the spacelike intervals. In deriving LT,
an additional independent hypothesis has been used, thus the values of velocity

are connected by the de Broglie relation. The fundamental properties of any

we think that LT is unsuitable for photon and neutrino, the photon

temperature T_c, relative to a uniform system with the same mean interaction
strength (U_i=-U on all sites). These effects are observed for stripes,
checkerboard, and even random patterns of the attractive centers, suggesting
that the pattern of inhomogeneity is unimportant. The phase diagrams also
include regions where superconductivity is obliterated due to the formation of
various charge ordered phases. The enhancement of T_{c} due to inhomogeneity is
robust as long as the electron doping per site n is less than twice the

concentration is investigated using rheological tools. It is observed that the
ageing is accompanied by an increase in the complex viscosity. The succeeding
creep experiments performed at various ages showed damped oscillations in the
strain. The characteristic time-scale of the damped oscillations, retardation
time, showed a prominent decrease with the age of the system. However, this
dependence weakens with an increase in the salt concentration, which is known
to change microstructure of the system from glass-like to gel-like. We
postulate that a decrease in the retardation time can be represented as a
decrease in the viscosity (friction) of the dissipative environment surrounding
the arrested entities that opposes elastic deformation of the system. We
believe that ageing in colloidal glass leads to a greater ordering that
enhances relative spacing between the constituents thereby reducing the
frictional resistance. However, since a gel state is inherently different in
structure (fractal network) than that of a glass (disordered), ageing in the
same does not induce ordering. Consequently, we observe inverse dependence of
retardation time on age becoming weaker with an increase in the salt
concentration. We analyze these results from a perspective of ageing dynamics
of both glass state and gel state of laponite suspensions.

type Ia SNe come from both young and old stars. The dependence of the rates
with the radio power of the parent galaxy is best reproduced by a bimodal
distribution of delay time between the formation of the progenitor and its

system might host a black hole or a neutron star. Recent observations by
INTEGRAL have shown that Cygnus X-3 was again in an extremely ultrasoft state.
Here we present our analysis of the transition from the ultrasoft state,
dominated by blackbody radiation at soft X-rays plus non-thermal emission in
the hard X-rays, to the low hard state.
  Methods: INTEGRAL observed Cyg X-3 six times during three weeks in late May
and early June 2007. Data from IBIS/ISGRI and JEM-X1 were analysed to show the
spectral transition.
  Results: During the ultrasoft state, the soft X-ray spectrum is
well-described by an absorbed (NH = 1.5E22 1/cm**2) black body model, whereas
the X-ray spectrum above 20 keV appears to be extremely low and hard (Gamma =
1.7). During the transition, the radio flux rises to a level of >1 Jy, and the
soft X-ray emission drops by a factor of 3, while the hard X-ray emission rises
by a factor of 14 and becomes steeper (up to Gamma = 4).
  Conclusions: The ultrasoft state apparently precedes the emission of a jet,
which is apparent in the radio and hard X-ray domain.

This technique has been used to measure forces in the range of pico- and

there are cases where these assumptions are not fulfilled Here, we show how to

what is expected from secular evolution driven by angular momentum losses
caused by gravitational radiation under the hypothesis of conservative mass
transfer. Using simple considerations on the angular momentum of the system, we
propose an explanation of this puzzling result assuming that during X-ray
quiescence the source is ejecting matter (and angular momentum) from the inner

a possible secular evolution of the system under the hypothesis of highly
non-conservative mass transfer. In this case, we find stringent constraints on
the masses of the two components of the binary system and its inclination. The
proposed orbital evolution indicates that in this kind of sources the neutron
star is capable to efficiently ablate the companion star, suggesting that this

from the same location family. We refer to these mixtures as semi-parametric
because no additional assumptions other than symmetry are made regarding the
parametric form of the component distributions. Because the class of symmetric
distributions is so broad, identifiability of parameters is a major issue in
these mixtures. We develop a notion of identifiability of finite mixture
models, which we call k-identifiability, where k denotes the number of
components in the mixture. We give sufficient conditions for k-identifiability
of location mixtures of symmetric components when k=2 or 3. We propose a novel
distance-based method for estimating the (location and mixing) parameters from
a k-identifiable model and establish the strong consistency and asymptotic
normality of the estimator. In the specific case of L_2-distance, we show that
our estimator generalizes the Hodges--Lehmann estimator. We discuss the
numerical implementation of these procedures, along with an empirical estimate
of the component distribution, in the two-component case. In comparisons with
maximum likelihood estimation assuming normal components, our method produces
somewhat higher standard error estimates in the case where the components are
truly normal, but dramatically outperforms the normal method when the
components are heavy-tailed.

in inferring the basic genetic constitution of diploid organisms on the basis
of their genotype. This information allows researchers to perform association
studies for the genetic variants involved in diseases and the individual
responses to therapeutic agents.
  A notable approach to the problem is to encode it as a combinatorial problem
(under certain hypotheses, such as the pure parsimony criterion) and to solve
it using off-the-shelf combinatorial optimization techniques. The main methods
applied to Haplotype Inference are either simple greedy heuristic or exact
methods (Integer Linear Programming, Semidefinite Programming, SAT encoding)
that, at present, are adequate only for moderate size instances.
  We believe that metaheuristic and hybrid approaches could provide a better
scalability. Moreover, metaheuristics can be very easily combined with problem
specific heuristics and they can also be integrated with tree-based search
techniques, thus providing a promising framework for hybrid systems in which a
good trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency can be reached.
  In this paper we illustrate a feasibility study of the approach and discuss
some relevant design issues, such as modeling and design of approximate solvers
that combine constructive heuristics, local search-based improvement strategies
and learning mechanisms. Besides the relevance of the Haplotype Inference
problem itself, this preliminary analysis is also an interesting case study
because the formulation of the problem poses some challenges in modeling and
hybrid metaheuristic solver design that can be generalized to other problems.

discrete, self-similar period, Delta_l, decreases as l increases in such a way
that the critical solution appears to become periodic in the limit. The mass

galaxy spectra with high S/N (>20). Coadded spectra of galaxies with similar
velocity dispersions, absolute r-band magnitudes and 4000\AA-break values are
used for those regions of parameter space where individual spectra have lower
S/N. We estimate the total density of metals and of baryons in stars and, from
these two quantities, we obtain a mass- and volume-averaged stellar metallicity
of <Z_star>=1.04+-0.14 Z_sun, i.e. consistent with solar. We also study how
metals are distributed in galaxies according to their mass, morphology and age,
and we then compare these distributions with the corresponding distributions of
stellar mass. We find that the bulk of metals locked up in stars in the local
Universe reside in massive, bulge-dominated galaxies, with red colours and high
4000\AA-break values corresponding to old stellar populations. Bulge-dominated
and disc-dominated galaxies contribute similar amounts to the total stellar
mass density, but have different fractional contributions to the mass density
of metals in stars, in agreement with the mass-metallicity relation.
Bulge-dominated galaxies contain roughly 40% of the total amount of metals in
stars, while disc-dominated galaxies less than 25%. Finally, at a given galaxy
stellar mass, we define two characteristic ages as the median of the
distributions of mass and metals as a function of age. These characteristic
ages decrease progressively from high-mass to low-mass galaxies, consistent
with the high formation epochs of stars in massive galaxies.

low-temperature equilibrium heat capacity ceq of the quasi-1 D organic compound
(TMTTF)2Br, characterized by a commensurate Spin Density Wave (SDW) ground
state. Below 1K, ceq is dominated by a Schottky-like contribution, very
sensitive to the experimental time scale, a property that we have previously
measured in numerous DW compounds. Under applied field (in the range 0.2- 7 T),
the equilibrium dynamics, and hence ceq extracted from the time constant,
increases enormously. For B = 2-3 T, ceq varies like B2, in agreement with a
magnetic Zeeman coupling. Another specific property, common to other
Charge/Spin density wave (DW) compounds, is the occurrence of metastable
branches in ceq, induced at very low temperature by the field exceeding a
critical value. These effects are discussed within a generalization to SDWs in
a magnetic field of the available Larkin-Ovchinnikov local model of strong
pinning. A limitation of the model when compared to experiments is pointed out.

traveling downstream at a constant speed over a shear flow of finite depth. In
case the free surface is flat, a sharp criterion of linear instability is
established for a general class of shear flows with inflection points and the
maximal unstable wave number is found. Comparison to the rigid-wall setting
testifies that free surface has a destabilizing effect. For a class of unstable
shear flows, the bifurcation of nontrivial periodic traveling waves of
small-amplitude is demonstrated at any wave number. We show the linear
instability of small nontrivial waves bifurcated at an unstable wave number of
the background shear flow. The proof uses a new formulation of the linearized
water-wave problem and a perturbation argument. An example of the background
shear flow of unstable small-amplitude periodic traveling waves is constructed
for an arbitrary vorticity strength and for an arbitrary depth, illustrating
that vorticity has a subtle influence on the stability of water waves.

incoherent structures have been observed in the photoemission spectra of
layered cobaltates. Surprisingly, these many-body effects are found to increase
near the band insulator regime. We explain these unexpected observations in
terms of a novel spin-polaron model for CoO_2 planes which is based on a fact
of the spin-state quasidegeneracy of Co^{3+} ions in oxides. Scattering of the
photoholes on spin-state fluctuations suppresses their coherent motion. The
observed ``peak-dip-hump'' type lineshapes are well reproduced by the theory.
