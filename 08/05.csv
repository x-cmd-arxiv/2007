quantities of multichannel disordered wires in the presence of the Coulomb
interactions. Within the replica nonlinear $\sigma$-model (NL$\sigma$M)
formalism, they arise from nonperturbative soliton saddle points of the
NL$\sigma$M action. The problem is reduced to evaluating the partition function
of a replicated classical one dimensional Coulomb gas. The state of the latter
depends on two parameters: the number of transverse channels in the wire,
N_{ch}, and the dimensionless conductance, G(L_T), of a wire segment of length
equal to the thermal diffusion length, L_T. At relatively high temperatures,
$G(L_T) \gtrsim \ln N_{ch} $, the gas is dimerized, i.e. consists of bound
neutral pairs. At lower temperatures, $\ln N_{ch} \gtrsim G(L_T) \gtrsim 1$,
the pairs overlap and form a Coulomb plasma. The crossover between the two
regimes occurs at a parametrically large conductance $G(L_T) \sim \ln N_{ch}$,
and may be studied independently from the perturbative effects. Specializing to
the high temperature regime, we obtain the leading nonperturbative correction
to the wire heat capacity. Its ratio to the heat capacity for noninteracting
electrons, C_0, is $\delta C/C_0\sim N_{ch}G^2(L_T)e^{-2G(L_T)}$.

total spread of the MLWF in real space. This done in the space of unitary
matrices that describe rotations of the Bloch bands at each k-point. As a
result, Wannier90 is independent of the basis set used in the underlying
calculation to obtain the Bloch states. Therefore, it may be interfaced
straightforwardly to any electronic structure code. The locality of MLWF can be
exploited to compute band-structure, density of states and Fermi surfaces at
modest computational cost. Furthermore, Wannier90 is able to output MLWF for
visualisation and other post-processing purposes. Wannier functions are already
used in a wide variety of applications. These include analysis of chemical
bonding in real space; calculation of dielectric properties via the modern
theory of polarisation; and as an accurate and minimal basis set in the

onset of disk formation in classical Be stars and cluster age and/or

provides a diagnostic of the dominant and any secondary polarigenic agents
present, enabling us to discriminate pure gas disk systems, i.e. classical Be
stars, from composite gas plus dust disk systems, i.e. Herbig Ae/Be or B[e]
stars. Our intrinsic polarization results, along with available near-IR color
information, strongly supports the suggestion of Wisniewski et al. that
classical Be stars are present in clusters of age 5-8 Myr, and contradict
assertions that the Be phenomenon only develops in the second half of a B
star's main sequence lifetime, i.e. no earlier than 10 Myr.
  Comparing the polarimetric properties of our dataset to a similar survey of
Galactic classical Be stars, we find that the prevalence of polarimetric Balmer
jump signatures decreases with metallicity. We speculate that these results
might indicate that either it is more difficult to form large disk systems in
low metallicity environments, or that the average disk temperature is higher in
these low metallicity environments. We have characterized the polarimetric
signatures of all candidate Be stars in our data sample and find ~25% are

J0034-00 to that of the T8 brown dwarf 2MASS J0415-09, the latest-type and
coolest well-studied brown dwarf to date, with Teff~750 K, we find evidence
that ULAS J0034-00 is significantly cooler. First, the measured values of the
near-infrared absorption spectral indices imply a later classification, of
T8.5. Second, the H-[4.49] colour provides an empirical estimate of the
temperature of 540<Teff<660 K (+/-2sig range). Third, the J- and H-band peaks
are somewhat narrower in ULAS J0034-00, and detailed comparison against
spectral models calibrated to 2MASS J0415-09 yields an estimated temperature
lower by 60-120 K relative to 2MASS J0415-09 i.e. 630<Teff<690 K (+/-2sig), and
lower gravity or higher metallicity according to the degenerate combination
-0.5<delta(log g-2[m/H])<-0.25 (+/-2sig). Combining these estimates, and
considering systematics, it is likely the temperature lies in the range
600<Teff<700 K. Despite the low inferred Teff we find no evidence for strong
absorption by NH3 over the wavelength range 1.51-1.56 um. Evolutionary models
imply that the mass and age are in the ranges 15-36 M(Jup) and 0.5-8 Gyr,
respectively. The measured proper motion, of (0.37+/-0.07)arcsec/yr, combined
with the photometrically estimated distance of 14-22 pc, implies a tangential
velocity of ~30 km/s. ULAS J0034-00 is significantly bluer than 2MASS J0415-09
in Y-J, so future searches should allow for the possibility that cooler T

information to determine astrophysical factors for binary rearrangement
processes $x + A \to b + B$ at astrophysically relevant energies by measuring
the cross section for the Trojan Horse reaction $a + A \to y+ b + B$ in
quasi-free kinematics. We present the theory of the Trojan Horse method for
resonant binary subreactions based on the half-off-energy-shell R matrix
approach which takes into account the off-energy-shell effects and initial and
final state interactions.

of an S-constructible stack of categories on X. The motivating example is the
stack of S-constructible perverse sheaves. We introduce a 2-category $EP_{\leq

version of the fundamental 2-groupoid. Our main result is that the 2-category

discussed for a long time. The phenomenon of the phase-coherent precession of
magnetization in superfluid 3He and the related effects of spin superfluidity
are based on the true Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons. Several different
states of coherent precession has been observed in 3He-B: homogeneously
precessing domain (HPD); persistent signal formed by Q-balls at very low
temperatures; coherent precession with fractional magnetization; and two new
modes of the coherent precession in compressed aerogel. In compressed aerogel
the coherent precession has been also found in 3He-A. Here we demonstrate that
all these cases are examples of a Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons, with
the magnon interaction term in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation being provided by
different types of spin-orbit coupling in the background of the coherent
precession.

massless flavors and a Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) term. In the presence of the FI
term, supersymmetry is spontaneously broken at tree level (on the Coulomb
branch), leaving a pseudo-flat direction in the classical potential. This
vacuum degeneracy is removed once quantum corrections are taken into account.
Due to the SU(2) gauge dynamics, the effective potential exhibits a local
minimum at the dyon point, where not only supersymmetry but also U(1)_R
symmetry is broken, while a supersymmetric vacuum would be realized toward
infinity with the runaway behavior of the potential. This local minimum is
found to be parametrically long-lived. Interestingly, from a phenomenological
point of view, in this meta-stable vacuum the massive hypermultiplets inherent
in the theory play the role of the messenger fields in the gauge mediation
scenario, when the Standard Model gauge group is embedded into their flavor
symmetry.

that exhibit power-law growth, is studied. Since the growth of the randomness
is slower than that of these terms, it is possible to use methods applied in
the study of Schr\""odinger operators with random decaying potentials. A
particular result of the analysis is the existence of operators with
arbitrarily fast transport whose spectral measure is zero dimensional. The
results are applied to the infinite Gaussian $\beta$ Ensembles and their

the center of the block forming an apparent antiferroelectric state. Bond
valence sums and bond lengths do not show the presence of charge ordering,
suggesting that all 4d electrons are delocalized in these compounds at the
temperature studied, T = 200 K.
