depends on the theory of gravity and additional fields, providing a possible
way of distinguishing competing theories. With the assumption that the geometry
and kinematics of the homogeneous universe have been measured to sufficient
accuracy, we present a procedure for understanding and testing the relationship
between the cosmological matter distribution and metric perturbations (along
with their respective evolution) using the ratio of the physical size of the
perturbation to the size of the horizon as our small expansion parameter. We
expand around Newtonian gravity on linear, subhorizon scales with coefficient
functions in front of the expansion parameter. Our framework relies on an
ansatz which ensures that (i) the Poisson equation is recovered on small scales
(ii) the metric variables (and any additional fields) are generated and
supported by the nonrelativistic matter overdensity. The scales for which our
framework is intended are small enough so that cosmic variance does not
significantly limit the accuracy of the measurements and large enough to avoid
complications from nonlinear effects and baryon cooling. The coefficient
functions provide a general framework for contrasting the consequences of
Lambda CDM and its alternatives. We calculate the coefficient functions for
general relativity with a cosmological constant and dark matter, GR with dark
matter and quintessence, scalar-tensor theories, f(R) gravity and braneworld
models. We identify a possibly unique signature of braneworld models.
Constraining the coefficient functions provides a streamlined approach for
testing gravity in a scale dependent manner. We briefly discuss the
observations best suited for an application of our framework.

analyze the XMM-Newton observations on the same target, as well as observations
using the Chandra LETG and the High Resolution Camera (HRC) combination. These

is seen in either the XMM-Newton and the Chandra LETG+HRC data, we find that
our result is consistent with the upper limits from both data sets. We
attribute the non-detection to (1) higher quality of the Chandra LETG+ACIS

two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet distributions PD(alpha,theta). The diffusions
X(alpha,theta) are obtained in a scaling limit transition from certain finite
Markov chains on partitions of natural numbers. The state space of
X(alpha,theta) is an infinite-dimensional simplex called the Kingman simplex.
  In the special case when parameter alpha vanishes, our finite Markov chains
are similar to Moran-type model in population genetics, and our diffusion
processes reduce to the infinitely-many-neutral-alleles diffusion model studied
by Ethier and Kurtz (1981).
  Our main results extend those of Ethier and Kurtz to the two-parameter case
and are as follows: The Poisson-Dirichlet distribution PD(alpha,theta) is a
unique stationary distribution for the corresponding process X(alpha,theta);
the process is ergodic and reversible; the spectrum of its generator is
explicitly described. The general two-parameter case seems to fall outside the
setting of models of population genetics, and our approach differs in some
aspects from that of Ethier and Kurtz.

from the physics of magnetic reconnection and magneto-hydrodynamical evolution
of coronal structures, nonetheless reproduce quite well the observed
statistical distribution of flare characteristics. We report here on a large
set of data assimilation runs on synthetic energy release time series. Our
results indicate that, despite the unpredictable (and unobservable) stochastic

succeeds in producing optimal initial conditions that reproduce adequately the
time series of energy released by avalanches/flares. This is an essential first

represent the momentum correlation function at zero relative momentum. It is
useful to study an exactly solvable problem in which the lambda parameter and
its dependence on the coherence properties of the boson system can be worked
out in great detail. We are therefore motivated to study the state of a gas of
noninteracting identical bosons at various temperatures held together in a
harmonic oscillator potential that arises either externally or from bosons' own
mean fields. We determine the degree of Bose-Einstein condensation and its
momentum correlation function as a function of the attributes of the boson
environment. The parameter lambda can then be evaluated from the momentum
correlation function. We find that the lambda(p,T) parameter is a sensitive
function of both the average pair momentum p and the temperature T, and the
occurrence of lambda=1 is not a consistent measure of the absence of a coherent
condensate fraction. In particular, for large values of p, the lambda parameter
attains the value of unity even for significantly coherent systems with large
condensate fractions. We find that if a pion system maintains a static
equilibrium within its mean field, and if it contains a root-mean-squared
radius, a pion number, and a temperature typical of those in high-energy
heavy-ion collisions, then it will contain a large fraction of the
Bose-Einstein pion condensate.

In this paper, cosmological N-body + Eulerian hydrodynamic simulations,
including radiative cooling and heating, are used to address this question as
we examine the formation and evolution of cool core (CC) and non-cool core
(NCC) clusters. These adaptive mesh refinement simulations produce both CC and
NCC clusters in the same volume. They have a peak resolution of 15.6 h^{-1} kpc
within a (256 h^{-1} Mpc)^3 box. Our simulations suggest that there are
important evolutionary differences between CC clusters and their NCC
counterparts. Many of the numerical CC clusters accreted mass more slowly over
time and grew enhanced cool cores via hierarchical mergers; when late major
mergers occurred, the CC's survived the collisions. By contrast, NCC clusters
experienced major mergers early in their evolution that destroyed embryonic
cool cores and produced conditions that prevented CC re-formation. As a result,
our simulations predict observationally testable distinctions in the properties
of CC and NCC beyond the core regions in clusters. In particular, we find
differences between CC versus NCC clusters in the shapes of X-ray surface
brightness profiles, between the temperatures and hardness ratios beyond the
cores, between the distribution of masses, and between their supercluster
environs. It also appears that CC clusters are no closer to hydrostatic
equilibrium than NCC clusters, an issue important for precision cosmology
measurements.

molar excess entropies from the transition-matrix Monte Carlo simulation data.
We find that the species-dependent self-diffusivities of confined fluids are
very similar to those of the bulk mixture if compared at the same,
appropriately defined, packing fraction up to intermediate values, but then
deviate negatively from the bulk behavior at higher packing fractions. On the
other hand, the relationships between self-diffusivity and partial molar excess
entropy (or total excess entropy) observed in the bulk fluid are preserved
under confinement even at relatively high packing fractions and for different
mixture compositions. This suggests that the partial molar excess entropy,
calculable from classical density functional theories of inhomogeneous fluids,
can be used to predict some of the nontrivial dynamical behaviors of fluid
mixtures in confined environments.

on the cuprates BSCCO and Na-CCOC. However the presence of these patterns has
not been confirmed by a bulk probe such as neutron scattering. In particular,
simple checkerboard patterns are inconsistent with neutron scattering data, in
that they have low energy incommsensurate (IC) spin peaks rotated 45 degrees
from the direction of the charge IC peaks. However, it is unclear whether other
checkerboard patterns can solve the problem. In this paper, we have studied
more complicated checkerboard patterns (""modulated checkerboards"") by using
spin wave theory and analyzed noncollinear checkerboards as well. We find that
the high energy response of the modulated checkerboards is inconsistent with
neutron scattering results, since they fail to exhibit a resonance peak at
(pi,pi), which has recently been shown to be a universal feature of cuprate
superconductors. We further argue that the newly proposed noncollinear
checkerboard also lacks a resonance peak. We thus conclude that to date no
checkerboard pattern has been proposed which satisfies both the low energy
constraints and the high energy constraints imposed by the current body of
experimental data in cuprate superconductors.

that the bifurcation between quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution for fast

earlier for massive low metallicity stars, persists in the mass range
considered here. Consequently, there are two separate PCSN progenitor types:
(I) Fast rotators produce PCSNe from very massive Wolf-Rayet stars, and (II)
Slower rotators that generate PCSNe in hydrogen-rich massive yellow
hypergiants. We find that hydrogen-rich PCSNe could occur at metallicities as
high as Z$_{\odot}$/3, which -- assuming standard IMFs are still valid to
estimate their birth rates -- results in a rate of about one PCSN per 1000
supernovae in the local universe, and one PCSN per 100 supernovae at a redshift
of $z=5$. PCSNe from WC-type Wolf-Rayet stars are restricted to much lower
metallicity.

two decay rates $1/\tau_+$ and $1/\tau_-$. In high temperature regime, the
average of these two rates varies with the grating wave-vector $q$

that an $n$-dubit duality computer can be modeled by an $(n+1)$-qubit quantum

shown that the distribution of subhalos is scale-free, in the sense that if
scaled by the velocity dispersion of the parent halo, the velocity distribution
function of galaxy-sized and cluster-sized halos are identical. For
cluster-sized halos, simulation results agreed well with observations.
Simulations, however, predicted far too many subhalos for galaxy-sized halos.
Our galaxy has several tens of known dwarf galaxies. On the other hands,
simulated dark-matter halos contain thousands of subhalos. We have performed
simulation of a single large volume and measured the abundance of subhalos in
all massive halos. We found that the variation of the subhalo abundance is very
large, and those with largest number of subhalos correspond to simulated halos
in previous studies. The subhalo abundance depends strongly on the local
density of the background. Halos in high-density regions contain large number
of subhalos. Our galaxy is in the low-density region. For our simulated halos
in low-density regions, the number of subhalos is within a factor of three to
that of our galaxy. We argue that the ``missing dwarf problem'' is not a real
problem but caused by the biased selection of the initial conditions in
previous studies, which were not appropriate for field galaxies.

states that females in good physiological conditions are more likely to produce
male offspring, when the variance of reproductive success amongst males is
high. A number of studies, aimed at its experimental verification, have found
adequate supportive evidence in its favour. Theoretical investigations,
however, have been few, perhaps because formulating a population-genetic model
for describing the Trivers-Willard hypothesis turns out to be surprisingly
complex. The present study describes a minimal population genetic model to
explore one specific scenario, viz. how is the preference for a male offspring
by females in good condition altered when 'g', the proportion of such females
in the population changes from a low to a high value. As expected, when the
proportion of such females is low, i.e., for low values of 'g', the
Trivers-Willard (TW) strategy goes to fixation against the equal investment
strategy. This holds true up to gmax, a critical value of 'g', above which the
two strategies coexist, but the proportion of the TW strategy steadily
decreases as 'g' increases to unity. Similarly, when the effect of well-endowed
males attaining disproportionately high number of matings is more pronounced,
the TW strategy is more likely to go to fixation. Interestingly, the success of
the TW strategy has a complex dependence on the variance in the physiological
condition of females. If the difference in the two types of conditions is not
large, TW strategy is favoured, and its success is more likely as the
difference increases. However, beyond a critical value of the difference, the
TW strategy is found to be less and less likely to succeed as the difference
becomes larger. Possible reasons for these effects are discussed.

been the realization of a source of electric current that is accurately related
to the operation frequency $f$. There is an urgent call for a quantum standard
of electric current and for the so-called metrological triangle, where voltage
from Josephson effect and resistance from quantum Hall effect are tested
against current via Ohm's law for a consistency check of the fundamental

southwest part of the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) RX J1713.7-3946 with an
energy coverage of 0.4-40 keV. The X-ray spectrum, presumably of synchrotron
origin, is known to be completely lineless, making this SNR ideally suited for
a detailed study of the X-ray spectral shape formed through efficient particle
acceleration at high speed shocks. With a sensitive hard X-ray measurement from
the HXD PIN on board Suzaku, we determine the hard X-ray spectrum in the 12--40
keV range to be described by a power law with photon index Gamma = 3.2+/- 0.2,
significantly steeper than the soft X-ray index of Gamma = 2.4+/- 0.05 measured
previously with ASCA and other missions. We find that a simple power law fails
to describe the full spectral range of 0.4-40 keV and instead a power-law with
an exponential cutoff with hard index Gamma = 1.50+/- 0.09 and high-energy
cutoff epsilon_c = 1.2+/- 0.3 keV formally provides an excellent fit over the
full bandpass. If we use the so-called SRCUT model, as an alternative model, it
gives the best-fit rolloff energy of epsilon_{roll} = 0.95+/- 0.04 keV.
Together with the TeV gamma-ray spectrum ranging from 0.3 to 100 TeV obtained
recently by HESS observations, our Suzaku observations of RX J1713.7-3946
provide stringent constraints on the highest energy particles accelerated in a
supernova shock.

Although this is a peculiar prescription, we show that it {\it does not

{\it does not even classically} imply a constant expansion rate. Other
important points are: (1) the quantity $R_{\rm ren}$ of Garriga and Tanaka is
neither a properly defined composite operator, nor is it constant; (2) gauge
dependence does not render a Green's function devoid of physical content; (3)
scalar models on a non-dynamical de Sitter background (for which there is no
gauge issue) can induce arbitrarily large secular contributions to the stress
tensor; (4) the same secular corrections appear in observable quantities in
quantum gravity; and (5) the prospects seem good for deriving a simple
stochastic formulation of quantum gravity in which the leading secular effects
can be summed and for which the expectation values of even complicated, gauge

of relic integer-spin Hawking radiation -- at fixed total energy $E$. The only
conserved macroscopic quantity is the total energy $E$ (the total energy of the
relic radiation). Data for a boundary-value approach, with massless,
integer-spin perturbations, are set on initial and final space-like
hypersurfaces. In the resulting 1-dimensional statistical-mechanics problem,
the real part of the (complex) time separation at spatial infinity, $T =
{\mid}T{\mid}\exp(-i\delta), \delta >0$, is the variable conjugate to the total
energy. We count the number of weak-field configurations on the final
space-like hypersurface with energy $E$. One recovers the Cardy formula and the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, if Re(T) is of the order of the black-hole life-
time, leading to a statistical interpretation of black-hole entropy. The
microcanonical entropy includes a logarithmic correction to the black-hole area
law, which is {\it universal} (independent of black-hole parameters). Here, the
discreteness of the energy levels is crucial. This approach is compared with
that of string theory for the transition to the fundamental-string r\'egime in
the final stages of evaporation. The squared coupling, $g^2$, regulating the
transition to a highly-excited string state and {\it vice versa}, can be
related to the angle, $\delta$, of complex-time rotation above. The
strong-coupling r\'egime corresponds to a Euclidean black hole, while the
physical limit of a Lorentzian space-time (as $ \delta \to 0_+$) corresponds to
the weak-coupling r\'egime. This resembles the transition to a highly-excited
string-like state which subsequently decays into massless particles, thereby
avoiding the naked singularity.

spherically symmetric. The (large) Lorentzian proper-time interval between
$\Sigma_{I}, \Sigma_{F}$, measured at spatial infinity, is denoted by $T$. The

$T\to{\mid}T{\mid}\exp(-i\theta)$, for $0<\theta\leq{\pi}/2$. We calculate the

a pair of asymptotically flat spacelike hypersurfaces $\Sigma_I$ and $\Sigma_F$
carrying initial and final boundary data for the gravitational and other
fields, is rotated: $T\to{\mid}T{\mid}\exp(-i\delta)$, where $0< \delta
\leq{\pi}/2$. Classically and quantum mechanically, this procedure is expected
to lead to a well-posed boundary-value problem. Thus, we have found quantum
amplitudes (not just probability densities) relating to a pure state at late
times following gravitational collapse of matter to a black hole. Such pure
states, arising from gravitational collapse, admit a description in terms of
coherent and squeezed states. Indeed, this description is not so different from
that arising in a well-known context, namely, the highly-squeezed final state
of the relic radiation background in inflationary cosmology. For definiteness,
we study the simplest model of collapse, based on Einstein gravity with a
massless scalar field. Following the complex rotation above, one finds that, in
an adiabatic approximation, the resulting quantum amplitude may be expressed in
terms of generalized coherent states of the harmonic oscillator. A physical
interpretation is given; further, a squeezed-state representation follows.

The etale part of $G$ over $U$ gives rise to a monodromy representation $\rho$
of the fundamental group of $U$ on the Tate module of $G$. Motivated by a
famous theorem of Igusa, we prove in this article that $\rho$ is surjective if
$G_0$ is connected and HW-cyclic. This latter condition is equivalent to that
Oort's $a$-number of $G_0$ equals 1, and it is satisfied by all connected

can be used to constrain the sterile neutrino mass, offering several advantages
against the analysis based on the combination of CMB, LSS and Ly\alpha forest

distribution, no assumption on light-to-mass bias is required. In addition,
unlike the galaxy clustering and Ly\alpha forest power spectra, the projected
gravitational potential power spectrum probes a larger range of angular scales,
the non-linear corrections being required only at very small scales. Taking
into account the changes in the time-temperature relation of the primordial
plasma and the modification of the neutrino thermal potential, we compute the
projected gravitational potential power spectrum and its correlation with the
temperature in the presence of DM sterile neutrino. We show that the
cosmological parameters are generally not biased when DM sterile neutrino is

m_s >2.08 keV at 95% CL, consistent with the lower mass limit obtained from the
combined analysis of CMB, SDSS 3D power spectrum and SDSS Ly\alpha forest power

allow us to interrogate the significance of one aspect of codon usage, such a
GC content, while controlling for another aspect, such as adaptation to
host-preferred codons. We find that 33 phage genomes exhibit highly non-random
patterns in their GC3-content, use of host-preferred codons, or both. We show
that the head and tail proteins of these phages exhibit significant bias

the mass-loss rates in stationary stellar winds of hot massive stars. Assuming
a power-law dependence of mass loss on metallicity, Mdot \propto Z^{m}, and
adopting a theoretical relation between the terminal velocity and metallicity,
v_inf \propto Z^{0.13} (Leitherer et al.), we find m = 0.83 +/- 0.16 for
non-clumped outflows from an analysis of the wind momentum luminosity relation
(WLR) for stars more luminous than 10^{5.2} Lsun. Within the errors, this
result agrees with the prediction of m = 0.69 +/- 0.10 from Vink et al. For the
high luminosity stars we find the mass loss rates to be greater than the
predictions, implying wind clumping factors in their line-forming regions of
~4. For lower luminosity stars, the winds are so weak that their strengths
cannot be reliably derived from optical lines, and one must rely on analysis of
UV lines. In the low-luminosity domain the Galactic WLR is found to be much
steeper than expected from theory, leading to a discrepancy between UV
mass-loss rates and the predictions by a factor 100 at luminosities of L ~
10^{4.75} Lsun, the origin of which is unknown. We emphasize that even if the
current mass-loss rates of hot luminous stars are overestimated as a result of
wind clumping, the degree of clumping would likely to be independent of
metallicity, so the scalings derived in this study are expected to remain
correct.

steady state. This transition is attained for sufficiently ``extensile'' rods,
in the case of flow-aligning liquid crystals, and for sufficiently
``contractile'' ones for flow-tumbling materials. In a quasi-1D geometry, deep

of hysteresis and history-dependent steady states, as well as of spontaneous
banded flow. Flow-tumbling materials, in contrast, re-arrange themselves so
that only the two boundary layers flow in steady state. Two-dimensional

with the spontaneous flow appearing as patterns made up of ``convection
rolls''. These results demonstrate a remarkable richness (including dependence
on anchoring conditions) in the steady-state phase behaviour of active
materials, even in the absence of external forcing; they have no counterpart

continuum emission is detected towards MWC 297 from which we estimate a disk
mass (gas+dust) of 0.07 M$_{\odot}$ and a disk radius of $\le$ 80 AU. Our
result demonstrates that circumstellar disks can survive around massive stars
well into their main sequence phase even after they have become optically
visible. Complementing our observations with the data compiled from the
literature, we find the submm dust opacity index $\beta$ to be between 0.1 and
0.3. If the emission is optically thin, the low value of $\beta$ indicates the
presence of relatively large grains in the disk, possibly because of grain
growth. We do not detect any CO emission associated with the continuum source.
We argue that the $^{13}$CO emission from the disk is likely optically thin, in
which case, we derive an upper limit to the gas mass which implies significant
depletion of molecular gas in the disk. The mass of this disk and the
