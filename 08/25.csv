compared to each other and to potentially exact solutions for a pair of
contact-interacting fermions trapped in a 1D double-well potential, a model of
atoms in a quasi-1D optical lattice or electrons of a Hydrogen molecule in a
strong magnetic field. An exact few-body Hamiltonian is solved numerically in
momentum space yielding a highly-correlated eigenspectrum. Additionally,
approximate ground-state energies are obtained using both density functional
theory (DFT) functional and 2-site Hubbard models. A 1D adiabatic LDA kernel is
constructed for use in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), and
the resulting excited-state spectrum is compared to the exact and Hubbard
results. DFT is shown to give accurate results for wells with small separations
but fails to describe localization of opposite spin fermions to different
sites. A locally cognizant (LC) density functional based on an effective local
fermion number would provide a solution to this problem, and an approximate
treatment presented here compares favorably with the exact and Hubbard results.
The TDDFT excited-state spectrum is accurate in the small parameter regime with
non-adiabatic effects accounting for any deviations. As expected, the
ground-state Hubbard model outperforms DFT at large separations but breaks down
at intermediate separations due to improper scaling to the united-atom limit.
At strong coupling, both Hubbard and TDDFT methods fail to capture the
appropriate energetics.

supersymmetry phenomenology is the observation that Goldstino loops can

used an energy-dependent treatment of the neutrino transport based on the

equations are closed with a variable Eddington factor obtained by iteratively
solving a model Boltzmann equation. We focus on the evolution of a 15 Msun
progenitor and show that shock revival and the explosion are initiated at about
600 ms post bounce, powered by neutrino energy deposition. Similar to previous
findings for an 11.2 Msun star, but significantly later, the onset of the
explosion is fostered by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI). This
instability exhibits highest growth rates for the dipole and quadrupole modes,
which lead to large-amplitude bipolar shock oscillations and push the shock to
larger radii, thus increasing the time accreted matter is exposed to neutrino
heating in the gain layer. Therefore also convective overturn behind the shock
is strengthened. A ""soft"" nuclear equation of state that causes a rapid
contraction and a smaller radius of the forming neutron star and thus a fast
release of gravitational binding energy, seems to be more favorable for an
explosion. Rotation has the opposite effect because it leads to a more extended
and cooler neutron star and thus lower neutrino luminosities and mean energies
and overall less neutrino heating. Neutron star g-mode oscillations and the
acoustic mechanism play no important role in our simulations. (abridged)

in molecular clouds results from a variety of very poorly understood processes.
We have investigated three mechanisms; desorption resulting from H_2 formation
on grains, direct cosmic ray heating and cosmic ray induced photodesorption.
Whilst qualitative differences exist between these processes (essentially
deriving from the assumptions concerning the species-selectivity of the
desorption and the assumed threshold adsorption energies, E_t) all three
processes are found to be potentially very significant in dark cloud
conditions. It is therefore important that all three mechanisms should be
considered in studies of molecular clouds in which freeze-out and desorption
are believed to be important.
  Employing a chemical model of a typical static molecular core and using
likely estimates for the quantum yields of the three processes we find that
desorption by H_2 formation probably dominates over the other two mechanisms.
However, the physics of the desorption processes and the nature of the dust
grains and ice mantles are very poorly constrained. We therefore conclude that
the best approach is to set empirical constraints on the desorption, based on
observed molecular depletions - rather than try to establish the desorption
efficiencies from purely theoretical considerations. Applying this method to
one such object (L1689B) yields upper limits to the desorption efficiencies
that are consistent with our understanding of these mechanisms.

surface of proto-magnetars and the midplane of neutrino-cooled accretion flows
(NDAFs) are electron degenerate and neutron-rich (neutron-to-proton ratio n/p
>> 1). If this substantial free neutron excess is preserved to large radii in
ultra-relativistic outflows, several important observational consequences may
result. Weak interaction processes, however, can drive n/p to ~1 in the
nondegenerate regions that obtain just above the surfaces of NDAFs and
proto-magnetars. Our calculations show that mildly relativistic neutron-rich
outflows from NDAFs are possible in the presence of a strong poloidal magnetic
field. However, we find that neutron-rich winds possess a minimum mass-loss
rate that likely precludes simultaneously neutron-rich and ultra-relativistic
(Lorentz factor > 100) NDAF winds accompanying a substantial accretion power.
In contrast, proto-magnetars are capable of producing neutron-rich
long-duration GRB outflows ~10-30 seconds following core bounce for
sub-millisecond rotation periods; such outflows would, however, accompany only
extremely energetic events, in which the GRB + SN energy budget exceeds ~ 4e52
ergs. Neutron-rich highly relativistic outflows may also be produced during
some short-duration GRBs by geometrically thick accretion disks formed from
compact object mergers. The implications for r-process nucleosynthesis, optical
transients due to non-relativistic neutron-rich winds, and Nickel production in
proto-magnetar and NDAF winds are also briefly discussed.

space H1. The result is established for scalar curvature R of the background
metric having any sign; non-negative R requires additional positivity
assumptions either on the matter energy density or on the trace-free
divergence-free part of the extrinsic curvature. Although the formulation is
different, the result can be viewed as lowering the regularity of the recent
result of Maxwell on rough CMC solutions. We also establish existence of
non-CMC solutions of the Hamiltonian and momentum constraint equations. The
result is obtained using fixed-point iteration and compactness arguments
directly, rather than by building a contraction map. The non-CMC result can be
viewed as a type of extension of the regularity of the 1996 non-CMC result of
Isenberg and Moncrief to lower regularity and to scalar curvature R having any
sign.

  thermodynamics","restructured, 6 figure",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.other quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In real-life statistical data, it seems that conditional probabilities for
the effect given their causes tend to be less complex and smoother than
conditionals for causes, given their effects. We have recently proposed and
tested methods for causal inference in machine learning using a formalization
of this principle.
  Here we try to provide some theoretical justification for causal inference
methods based upon such a ``causally asymmetric'' interpretation of Occam's
Razor. To this end, we discuss toy models of cause-effect relations from
classical and quantum physics as well as computer science in the context of
various aspects of complexity.
  We argue that this asymmetry of the statistical dependences between cause and
effect has a thermodynamic origin. The essential link is the tendency of the
environment to provide independent background noise realized by physical
systems that are initially uncorrelated with the system under consideration
rather than being finally uncorrelated. This link extends ideas from the
literature relating Reichenbach's principle of the common cause to the second
law.

observability implies stability of the filter, i.e., the filtered estimates
become insensitive to the initial measure at large times. For the special case
where the signal is a finite-state Markov process and the observations are of
the white noise type, a complete (necessary and sufficient) characterization of
filter stability is obtained in terms of a slightly weaker detectability
condition. In addition to observability, the role of controllability in filter
stability is explored. Finally, the results are partially extended to
non-compact signal state spaces.

average deceleration parameter. This kinematic result holds regardless of the
curvature of the universe as well as of the underlying gravity theory. It
remains valid even in the context of brane-world motivated cosmologies. Since
the present age parameter of the Universe is accurately adjusted to $H_0t_0 =
1$, it is shown that the time averaged value of the deceleration parameter is
zero. This also means that the cosmic age today is exactly the one predicted by
a relativistic flat cosmological model filled by K-matter, a fluid satisfying
the equation of state $p = -{{1/3}}\rho$. By assuming the validity of this
relation (in an average long time meaning), it is argued that the decelerating
stages of the expansion must exactly be compensated by the accelerated phases,
as if the observed Universe coasts forever. If this is true, the present
accelerating stage must be followed by a subsequent decelerating phase as
predicted by some recent scalar field and brane-world motivated cosmologies.

expansion in which the counterterms automatically turn out to be consistent

counterterms, in problems with nontrivial boundary conditions, which are either
completely derived from the free cases or at most supplemented with the
addition of counterterms only at the boundaries. We obtain \emph{finite}
results for the massive and massless cases, in sharp contrast to some of the

supplementary renormalization procedure in addition to the usual regularization
and renormalization programs, which makes the usage of any analytic

larger bias voltages the current does not vanish any more since further
tunneling channels participate in the electron conduction and we also observe
photon-assisted tunneling which leads to steps in the current-voltage

ultrafast optical switching of the current through molecular junctions.
