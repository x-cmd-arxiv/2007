kpc) at rest-frame optical wavelengths, the others are extended (1< r_e < 10
kpc). For reference, 1 kpc corresponds to 0.12 arcsec at z=2.5 in the adopted
cosmology. We separate actively star forming galaxies from quiescent galaxies
by modeling their rest-frame UV-NIR SEDs. The star forming galaxies span the
full range of sizes, while the quiescent galaxies all have r_e<2kpc. In the
redshift range where MIPS 24 micron imaging is a sensitive probe of re-radiated
dust emission (z<2.5), the 24 micron fluxes confirm that the light of the small
quiescent galaxies is dominated by old stars, rather than dust-enshrouded star
formation or AGN activity. The inferred surface mass densities and velocity
dispersions for the quiescent galaxies are very high compared to those in local
galaxies. The galaxies follow a Kormendy relation (between surface brightness
and size) with approximately the same slope as locally, but shifted to brighter
surface brightnesses, consistent with a mean stellar formation redshift of
z_f~5. This paper demonstrates a direct relation between star formation
activity and size at z~2.5, and the existence of a significant population of
massive, extremely dense, old stellar systems without readily identifiable
counterparts in the local universe.

of galactic cosmic ray isotope ratios from solar-system ratios predicted by
these models, 12C/16O, 22Ne/20Ne, and 58Fe/56Fe, are very close to those
observed. All of the isotopic ratios that we have measured are consistent with
a GCR source consisting of ~20% of WR material mixed with ~80% material with
solar-system composition. Since WR stars are evolutionary products of OB stars,
and most OB stars exist in OB associations that form superbubbles, the good
agreement of our data with WR models suggests that OB associations within
superbubbles are the likely source of at least a substantial fraction of GCRs.
In previous work it has been shown that the primary 59Ni (which decays only by
electron-capture) in GCRs has decayed, indicating a time interval between
nucleosynthesis and acceleration of >10^5 yr.In this paper we suggest a
scenario that should allow much of the 59Ni to decay in the OB association

memoryless channels. The transmitter starts sending one block codeword at an
instant that is uniformly distributed within a certain time period, which
represents the level of asynchronism. The receiver, by means of a sequential
decoder, must isolate the message without knowing when the codeword
transmission starts but being cognizant of the asynchronism level A. We are
interested in how quickly can the receiver isolate the sent message,
particularly in the regime where A is exponentially larger than the codeword
length N, which we refer to as `strong asynchronism.'
  This model of sparse communication may represent the situation of a sensor
that remains idle most of the time and, only occasionally, transmits
information to a remote base station which needs to quickly take action.
  The first result shows that vanishing error probability can be guaranteed as
N tends to infinity while A grows as Exp(N*k) if and only if k does not exceed
the `synchronization threshold,' a constant that admits a simple closed form
expression, and is at least as large as the capacity of the synchronized
channel. The second result is the characterization of a set of achievable
strictly positive rates in the regime where A is exponential in N, and where
the rate is defined with respect to the expected delay between the time
information starts being emitted until the time the receiver makes a decision.
  As an application of the first result we consider antipodal signaling over a
Gaussian channel and derive a simple necessary condition between A, N, and SNR
for achieving reliable communication.

the corresponding cross section coming from gluon-gluon fusion at $x_F = 0.9$
is relatively negligible and therefore the peak from intrinsic bottom should be
clearly visible for experiments with forward detection capabilities. The

from intrinsic heavy quark Fock states in the proton is sufficiently large that
detection at the Tevatron and the LHC may be possible.

properties of the very large SNR RX J0852.0-4622. The available observations do
not clearly distinguish between a ``nearby'' (at $\sim 200$ pc) and a
``distant'' (at $\sim 1$ kpc) source scenario. Therefore two correspondingly
different models were analyzed. While the 200 pc solution can not be a priory
excluded, the 1 kpc solution turns out to be clearly preferable for physical
reasons. It requires a core collapse supernova (SN) with a massive progenitor
in a molecular cloud $\sim 4000$ yrs ago. The overall synchrotron spectrum and
the filamentary structures in hard X-rays both consistently lead to an
amplified magnetic field $B > 100 \mu$G in the SNR interior. This implies a
suppression of the leptonic TeV $\gamma$-ray emission to about 1 percent of the
flux measured by the H.E.S.S. telescope system which therefore must be
hadronic, consistent with the theoretical solution. Up to the present the 1 kpc
solution has already converted $\sim 10$ percent of the explosion energy into
nonthermal energy, as expected for a Galactic CR source. Also the derived
$\gamma$-ray morphology is consistent with the H.E.S.S. measurements. For the
``nearby'' solution the leptonic and hadronic $\gamma$ ray fluxes are in the
ratio 1:10 which means that this case is also hadronically dominated. However,
the magnetic field strength, consistent with the overall synchrotron spectrum,
differs significantly from that derived from the X-ray filaments. Finally, the
total mechanical energy released amounts to only $1.8 \times 10^{50}$ erg,
uncomfortably low even for a core collapse event.

nebulae in previous surveys. We also find prominent halos surrounding the
central aspherical shapes in many of our objects -- these are direct signatures
of the undisturbed circumstellar envelopes of the progenitor AGB stars.
Although the majority of these have surface-brightness distributions consistent
with a constant mass-loss rate with a constant expansion velocity, there are
also examples of objects with varying mass-loss rates. As in our surveys of
young planetary nebulae (PNs), we find no round PPNs. The similarities in
morphologies between our survey objects and young PNs supports the view that
the former are the progenitors of aspherical planetary nebulae, and that the
onset of aspherical structure begins during the PPN phase (or earlier). Thus,
the primary shaping of a PN clearly does not occur during the PN phase via the
fast radiative wind of the hot central star, but significantly earlier in its
evolution.

the ambient gas density falls with distance from the central engine. The source

independent of radio source size. This is consistent with the standard model in
which each source grows at a roughly constant rate during which time the
central engine puts out a roughly constant beam power. The fact that the total

that the sources are being sampled at random times during their lifetimes.

haloes and their environment. In this paper, we assess whether the ellipsoidal
collapse model can produce a similar dependence. First, we explore the
statistical correlation that originates from Gaussian initial conditions. We
derive analytic expressions for a number of joint statistics of the shear
tensor and estimate the sensitivity of the local characteristics of the shear
to the global geometry of the large scale environment. Next, we concentrate on
the dynamical aspect of the environmental dependence using a simplified model
that takes into account the interaction between a collapsing halo and its
environment. We find that the tidal force exerted by the surrounding mass
distribution causes haloes embedded in overdense regions to virialize earlier.
An effective density threshold whose shape depends on the large scale density
provides a good description of this environmental effect. We show that, using
this approach, a correlation between formation redshift, large scale bias and
environment density naturally arises. The strength of the effect is comparable,
albeit smaller, to that seen in simulations. It is largest for low mass haloes
and decreases as one goes to higher mass objects. Furthermore, haloes that
formed early are substantially more clustered than those that assembled
recently. On the other hand, our analytic model predicts a decrease in median
formation redshift with increasing environment density, in disagreement with
the trend detected in overdense regions. However, our results appear consistent
with the behaviour inferred in relatively underdense regions. We argue that the
ellipsoidal collapse model may apply in low density environments where
nonlinear effects are negligible (abridged).

from high-redshift supernovae, distant galaxies and baryon oscillations. The
models are based either on brane cosmologies or on Liouville strings in which a
relaxation dark energy is provided by a rolling dilaton field (Q-cosmology). An
interesting feature of such cosmologies is the possibility of effective
four-dimensional negative-energy dust and/or exotic scaling of dark matter. An
important constraint that can discriminate among models is the evolution of the
Hubble parameter as a function of the redshift, H(z). We perform fits using a
unifying formula for the evolution of H(z), applicable to different models. We
find evidence for a negative-energy dust at the current era, as well as for
exotic-scaling (a^{-delta}) contributions to the energy density, with
3.3<delta<4.3. The latter could be due to dark matter coupling with the dilaton
in Q-cosmology models, but it is also compatible with the possibility of dark
radiation from a brane Universe to the bulk in brane-world scenarios, which
could also encompass Q-cosmology models. The best-fit model seems to include an
a^{-2}-scaling contribution to the energy density of the Universe, which is
characteristic of the dilaton relaxation in Q-cosmology models, not to be
confused with the spatial curvature contribution of conventional cosmology. We
conclude that Q-cosmology fits the data equally well with the Lambda-CDM model
for a range of parameters that are in general expected from theoretical
considerations.

(2007) as a likely magnetar in G327.24-0.13, an apparent supernova remnant. No
X-ray pulsations have been detected from it. Using the Parkes radio telescope,
we discovered pulsations with period P = 2.069 s. Using the Australia Telescope
Compact Array, we localized these to 1E 1547.0-5408. We measure dP/dt =
(2.318+-0.005)e-11, which for a magnetic dipole rotating in vacuo gives a
surface field strength of 2.2e14 G, a characteristic age of 1.4 kyr, and a
spin-down luminosity of 1.0e35 ergs/s. Together with its X-ray characteristics,
these rotational parameters of 1E 1547.0-5408 prove that it is a magnetar, only
the second known to emit radio waves. The distance is ~9 kpc, derived from the
dispersion measure of 830 pc/cc. The pulse profile at a frequency of 1.4 GHz is
extremely broad and asymmetric due to multipath propagation in the ISM, as a
result of which only approximately 75% of the total flux at 1.4 GHz is pulsed.
At higher frequencies the profile is more symmetric and has FWHM = 0.12P.
Unlike in normal radio pulsars, but in common with the other known
radio-emitting magnetar, XTE J1810-197, the spectrum over 1.4-6.6 GHz is flat
or rising, and we observe large, sudden changes in the pulse shape. In a
contemporaneous Swift X-ray observation, 1E 1547.0-5408 was detected with
record high flux, f_X(1-8 keV) ~ 5e-12 ergs/cm^2/s, 16 times the historic
minimum. The pulsar was undetected in archival radio observations from 1998,
implying a flux < 0.2 times the present level. Together with the transient
behavior of XTE J1810-197, these results suggest that radio emission is
triggered by X-ray outbursts of usually quiescent magnetars.

clustering at z~1 in the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey. Using volume-limited
subsamples in bins of both color and luminosity, we find that: 1) The
clustering dependence is much stronger with color than with luminosity and is
as strong with color at z~1 as is found locally. We find no dependence of the
clustering amplitude on color for galaxies on the red sequence, but a
significant dependence on color for galaxies within the blue cloud. 2) For
galaxies in the range L/L*~0.7-2, a stronger large-scale luminosity dependence
is seen for all galaxies than for red and blue galaxies separately. The
small-scale clustering amplitude depends significantly on luminosity for blue
galaxies, with brighter samples having a stronger rise on scales r_p<0.5 Mpc/h.
3) Redder galaxies exhibit stronger small-scale redshift-space distortions
(""fingers of god""), and both red and blue populations show large-scale
distortions in xi(r_p,pi) due to coherent infall. 4) While the clustering
length, r_0, increases smoothly with galaxy color (in narrow bins), its
power-law exponent, gamma, exhibits a sharp jump from the blue cloud to the red
sequence. The intermediate color `green' galaxy population likely includes
transitional galaxies moving from the blue cloud to the red sequence; on large
scales green galaxies are as clustered as red galaxies but show infall
kinematics and a small-scale correlation slope akin to the blue galaxy
population. 5) We compare our results to a semi-analytic galaxy formation model
applied to the Millenium Run simulation. Differences between the data and the

efficiently generate density, velocity, and halo fields at z=9 in a 250 Mpc
box, resolving halos with masses M>2.2e8 solar masses. We construct ionization
fields corresponding to various values of x_H. With these, we generate LAE
luminosity functions and ""counts-in-cell'' statistics. As in previous studies,
we find that LAEs begin to disappear rapidly when x_H > 0.5. Constraining
x_H(z=9) with luminosity functions is difficult due to the many uncertainties
inherent in the host halo mass <--> Lya luminosity mapping. However, using a
very conservative mapping, we show that the number densities derived using the
six z~9 LAEs recently discovered by Stark et al. (2007) imply x_H < 0.7. On a
more fundamental level, these LAE number densities, if genuine, require
substantial star formation in halos with M < 10^9 solar masses, making them
unique among the current sample of observed high-z objects. Furthermore,
reionization increases the apparent clustering of the observed LAEs. We show
that a ``counts-in-cell'' statistic is a powerful probe of this effect,
especially in the early stages of reionization. Specifically, we show that a
field of view (typical of upcoming IR instruments) containing LAEs has >10%
higher probability of containing more than one LAE in a x_H>0.5 universe than a
x_H=0 universe with the same overall number density. With this statistic, a
fully ionized universe can be robustly distinguished from one with x_H > 0.5
using a survey containing only ~ 20--100 galaxies.

reaction for which significant non-spherical electric (E2) and Coulomb

of Q^{2} from the photon point through 6 GeV^{2}. Quark model calculations for
these quadrupole amplitudes are at least an order of magnitude too small and
even have the wrong sign. Lattice QCD, chiral effective field theory, and
dynamic model calculations which include the effects of the pion-cloud are in
approximate agreement with experiment. This is expected due to the spontaneous
breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD and the resulting, long range (low Q^{2})
effects of the pion-cloud. Other observables such as nucleon form factors and
virtual Compton scattering experiments indicate that the pion-cloud is playing
a significant role in nucleon structure. Semi-inclusive deep inelastic
scattering experiments with transverse polarized beam and target also show the
effect of non-zero quark angular momentum.

outward from the bright central galaxy (BCG). Three galaxies 1-1.5 mag fainter
than the BCG lie within 17 kpc (projected) of the BCG and are probably
participating in the merger. The plume is detected in all four IRAC channels
and at optical wavelengths in images from the WIYN telescope; the surface
brightness is remarkably high ($\mu_r\approx$24.8 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ at 50 kpc).
The optical and infrared colors are consistent with those of other BCGs,
suggesting that the plume is composed of old stars and negligible recent star
formation (hence a ""dry merger""). The luminosity in the plume is at least
equivalent to a 4L^* galaxy. A diffuse halo extending 110 kpc from the BCG in
one IRAC image suggests the total amount of diffuse light is L_r\sim
1.3x10^{11}h^{-2} L_sun. A Chandra observation shows an X-ray image and
spectrum typical of moderate-mass clusters. We use MMT/Hectospec to measure 905
redshifts in a 1 deg^2 region around the cluster. The velocities of two of the
BCG companions indicate a merger timescale for the companion galaxies of
$\sim$110 Myr and $\sim$0.5-1 Gyr for the plume. We conclude that the BCG and
intracluster light of CL0958 is formed by major mergers at moderate redshifts.
After the major merger is complete, CL0958 will likely become a fossil cluster.

different for even or odd spacetime dimension, and proportional to the ratio of

holes the greybody factor has a rich structure in which there are several
critical frequencies where it equals either one (pure transmission) or zero
(pure reflection, with these frequencies corresponding to the normal modes of
pure AdS spacetime). At asymptotic frequencies the computation of the greybody
factor uses a technique inspired by monodromy matching, and some universality
is hidden in the transmission and reflection coefficients. For either charged

functions, while for asymptotically AdS black holes the greybody factor
precisely equals one (corresponding to pure blackbody emission).

fermion compounds exhibit antiferromagnetic long-range order, but a strong
competition between the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida(RKKY) interaction and

Our aim is to show how magnons such as measured in the antiferromagnetic phase
of these Ce compounds, can be described with a microscopic Heisenberg-Kondo
model as introduced by J.R.Iglesias, C.Lacroix and B.Coqblin, used before for
studies of the non-magnetic phase. The model includes the correlated Ce-4f
electrons hybridized with the conduction band, and we consider competing RKKY
(Heisenberg-like J_{H}) and Kondo (J_{K}) antiferromagnetic couplings. Carrying
on a series of unitary transformations, we perturbatively derive a second-order
effective Hamiltonian which, projected onto the antiferromagnetic electron
ground state, describes the spin wave excitations, renormalized by their
interaction with correlated itinerant electrons. We numerically study how the
different parameters of the model influence the renormalization of the magnons,
yielding useful information for the analysis of inelastic neutron scattering
experiments in antiferromagnetic heavy fermion compounds. We also compare our
results with available experimental data, finding good agreement with the spin
wave measurements in cubic CeIn3.

between the layers. This system has low-energy charged excitations which may
carry textures in real spin or pseudospin. Away from filling factor nu =1 a
finite density of these is present in the ground state of the 2DEG and forms a
crystal. Depending on the relative size of the various energy scales, such as
tunneling (Delta_SAS), Zeeman coupling (Delta_Z) or electrical bias (Delta_b),
these textured crystal states can involve spin, pseudospin, or both
intertwined. In this article, we present a comprehensive numerical study of the
collective excitations of these textured crystals using the GRPA. For the pure
spin case, at finite Zeeman coupling the state is a Skyrmion crystal with a
gapless phonon mode, and a separate Goldstone mode that arises from a broken
U(1) symmetry. At zero Zeeman coupling, we demonstrate that the constituent
Skyrmions break up, and the resulting state is a meron crystal with 4 gapless
modes. In contrast, a pure pseudospin Skyrme crystal at finite tunneling has
only the phonon mode. For Delta_SAS=0, the state evolves into a meron crystal
and supports an extra gapless U(1) mode in addition to the phonon. For a CP(3)
Skyrmion crystal, we find a U(1) gapless mode in the presence of the
symmetry-breaking fields. In addition, a second mode with a very small gap is
present in the spectrum.

C_{\ell}, paying special attention to the matter-radiation equality peak and
the baryon wiggles. Lensing mixes the correlation function of the source
galaxies with the matter correlation at the lower redshifts of the lenses.
Since the lenses probe structure nearer to the observer, the angular scale
dependence of the lensing terms is different from that of the sources, thus the
observed correlation function is distorted. We quantify how the lensing
corrections depend on the width of the selection function, the galaxy bias b,
and the number count slope s. The correction increases with redshift and larger
corrections are present for sources with steep number count slopes and/or broad
redshift distributions. The most drastic changes to C_{\ell} occur for
measurements at z >~1.5 and \ell <~ 100. For the source distributions we
consider, magnification bias can shift the matter-radiation equality scale by
1-6% at z ~ 1.5 and by z ~ 3.5 the shift can be as large as 30%. The baryon
bump in \theta^2w(\theta) is shifted by <~ 1% and the width is typically
increased by ~10%. Shifts of >~ 0.5% and broadening of >~ 20% occur only for
very broad selection functions and/or galaxies with (5s-2)/b>~2. However, near
the baryon bump the magnification correction is not constant but a gently
varying function which depends on the source population. Depending on how the

of 3.89 days and a super-orbital variation with an average length of 55 days.
As we show here, however, the length of the super-orbital cycle varies by
almost a factor of two, even across adjacent cycles. To study both the orbital
and super-orbital variation we utilize lightcurves from the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer All Sky Monitor (RXTE-ASM). We employ the orbital ephemeris from
Wojdowski et al. (1998) to obtain the average orbital profile, and we show that
this profile exhibits complex modulation during non-eclipse phases.
Additionally, a very interesting ``bounceback'' in X-ray count rate is seen
during mid-orbital eclipse phases, with a softening of the emission during
these periods. This bounceback has not been previously identified in pointed
observations. We then define a super-orbital ephemeris (the phase of the
super-orbital cycle as a function of date) based on the ASM lightcurve and
analyze the trend and distribution of super-orbital cycle lengths. SMC X-1
exhibits a bimodal distribution of these lengths, similar to what has been
observed in other systems (e.g., Her X-1), but with more dramatic changes in
cycle length. There is some hint, but not conclusive evidence, for a dependence
of the super-orbital cycle length upon the underlying orbital period, as has
been observed previously for Her X-1 and Cyg X-2. Using our super-orbital
ephemeris we are also able to create an average super-orbital profile over the
71 observed cycles, for which we witness overall hardening of the spectrum
during low count rate times. We combine the orbital and super-orbital
ephemerides to study the correlation between the orbital and super-orbital
variations in the system.

persistent wormhole manifests as a particle-like object whose interaction with
cosmic matter is purely gravitational. As such it may be considered a viable
candidate for the sort of weakly interacting massive particle long believed to
be the prime constituent of cold dark matter.

alternating magnetic field has been observed previously in numerical
simulations of magnetic systems. However, experimental evidence for this DPT
has thus far been limited to qualitative observations of hysteresis loop
collapse in studies of hysteresis loop area scaling. Here, we present
significantly stronger evidence for the experimental observation of this DPT,
in a [Co(4 A)/Pt(7 A)]_3-multilayer system with strong perpendicular
anisotropy. We applied an out-of-plane, time-varying (sawtooth) field to the
[Co/Pt]_3 multilayer, in the presence of a small additional constant field,
H_b. We then measured the resulting out-of-plane magnetization time series to
produce nonequilibrium phase diagrams (NEPDs) of the cycle-averaged
magnetization, Q, and its variance, Var(Q), as functions of P and H_b. The
experimental NEPDs are found to strongly resemble those calculated from
simulations of a kinetic Ising model under analagous conditions. The similarity
of the experimental and simulated NEPDs, in particular the presence of a
localized peak in the variance Var(Q) in the experimental results, constitutes
strong evidence for the presence of this DPT in our magnetic multilayer
samples. Technical challenges related to the hysteretic nature and response
time of the electromagnet used to generate the time-varying applied field
precluded us from extracting meaningful critical scaling exponents from the
current data. However, based on our results, we propose refinements to the
experimental procedure which could potentially enable the determination of
critical exponents in the future.

mobility of about 2000 cm2/(V*s) being by several orders of magnitude higher
than in known ferromagnetic two-dimensional structures. The analysis of the
electro-physical properties of these systems is based on detailed study of
their structure by means of high-resolution X-ray diffractometry and
glancing-incidence reflection, which allow us to restore the depth profiles of
structural characteristics of the QWs and thin Mn containing layers. These
investigations show absence of Mn atoms inside the QWs. The quality of the

Transport properties reveal features inherent to ferromagnetic systems: a
specific maximum in the temperature dependence of the resistance and the
anomalous Hall effect (AHE) observed in samples with both ""metallic"" and
activated types of conductivity up to ~100 K. AHE is most pronounced in the
temperature range where the resistance maximum is observed, and decreases with
decreasing temperature. The results are discussed in terms of interaction of

emitted by precipitating relativistic electrons are strongly forward beamed
toward the photosphere, and that the majority of these gamma-rays must be
Compton back-scattered by the solar atmosphere in order to reach the observer.
Then, the Compton degradation was found to make the observable gamma-ray
spectra much softer than is predicted by simple analytic calculations. The
gamma-ray signals were found to be enhanced by several conditions, including a
broad pitch-angle distribution of the electrons, a near-limb flare longitude,
and a significant tilt in the magnetic field lines if the flare longitude is
rather small. These results successfully explain several important flare
properties observed in the hard X-ray to gamma-ray range, including in
particular those obtained with Yohkoh. A comparison of the Yohkoh spectrum from
a GOES X3.7 class limb flare on 1998 November 22, with a simulation assuming a

show variations between epochs at about the 30% level for the sample as a

the success probability for obtaining an uncorrupted state can be improved to

in one-way quantum communication for rejecting the errors caused by the

twisted and the S-matrix in the non-gauge qft's becomes independent of the
noncommutativity parameter theta^{\mu\nu}. Here we show that the noncommutative
algebra has a commutative spacetime algebra as a substructure: the Poincare,
diffeomorphism and gauge groups are based on this algebra in the twisted
approach as is known already from the earlier work of [hep-th/0510059]. It is
natural to base covariant derivatives for gauge and gravity fields as well on
this algebra. Such an approach will in particular introduce no additional gauge
fields as compared to the commutative case and also enable us to treat any
gauge group (and not just U(N)). Then classical gravity and gauge sectors are
the same as those for \theta^{\mu \nu}=0, but their interactions with matter
fields are sensitive to theta^{\mu \nu}. We construct quantum noncommutative
gauge theories (for arbitrary gauge groups) by requiring consistency of twisted
statistics and gauge invariance. In a subsequent paper (whose results are
summarized here), the locality and Lorentz invariance properties of the
S-matrices of these theories will be analyzed, and new non-trivial effects
coming from noncommutativity will be elaborated.

space-time containing a singularity. The present paper focuses on timelike
singularities. We use the naked timelike singularity of the super-critical
Reissner-Nordstrom geometry as an example. While one could impose boundary
conditions at the singularity that would prevent the particles from falling
into the singularity, we are interested here in the case in which particles
have positive probability to hit the singularity and get annihilated. The wish
for reversibility, equivariance, and the Markov property then dictates that
particles must also be created by the singularity, and indeed dictates the rate
at which this must occur. That is, a stochastic law prescribes what comes out
of the singularity. We specify explicit equations of a non-rigorous model
involving an interior-boundary condition on the wave function at the
singularity, which can be used also in other versions of quantum theory besides
Bohmian mechanics. As the resulting theory involves particle creation and
annihilation, it can be regarded as a quantum field theory, and the stochastic
process for the Bohmian particles is analogous to Bell-type quantum field
theories.

source of gamma-ray emission that is characterised by a hard power-law spectrum

efficient at some prespecified density f. When based on normal scores, they are
uniformly more efficient than the traditional normal-theory estimator based on
empirical covariance matrices (the asymptotic normality of which, moreover,
requires finite moments of order four), irrespective of the actual underlying
elliptical density. They rely on an original rank-based version of Le Cam's
one-step methodology which avoids the unpleasant nonparametric estimation of

to be equivariant in a weak asymptotic sense. Simulations confirm their

under the basic assumption that the X-ray emission is produced in an ensemble
of shocks formed in the winds driven by these objects. Shocks develop either as
a result of radiation-driven instabilities or due to confinement of the wind by
relatively strong magnetic field, and since they are radiative, a simple model
of their X-ray emission was developed that allows a direct comparison with
observations. According to our model, the shock structures (clumps, complete or
fractional shells) eventually become `cold' clouds in the X-ray sky of the
star. As a result, it is expected that for large covering factors of the hot
clumps, there is a high probability for X-ray absorption by the `cold' clouds,
resulting in blue-shifted spectral lines. Our analysis has revealed that such a
correlation indeed exists for the considered sample of OB stars. As to the
temperature characteristics of the X-ray emission plasma, the studied OB stars
fall in two groups: (i) one with plasma temperature limited to 0.1-0.4 keV;
(ii) the other wtih X-rays produced in plasmas at considerably higher

variable SDSS J150722.30+523039.8 (hereafter SDSS J1507). This system has an
orbital period of 66.61 minutes, placing it below the observed ``period
minimum'' for cataclysmic variables. We determine the system parameters via a
parameterised model of the eclipse fitted to the observed lightcurve by chi^2
minimisation. We obtain a mass ratio of q = 0.0623 +/- 0.0007 and an orbital
inclination i = 83.63 +/- 0.05 degrees. The primary mass is M_w = 0.90 +/- 0.01
M_sun. The secondary mass and radius are found to be M_r =0.056 +/- 0.001 M_sun
and R_r = 0.096 +/- 0.001 R_sun respectively. We find a distance to the system
of 160 +/- 10 pc. The secondary star in SDSS J1507 has a mass substantially
below the hydrogen burning limit, making it the second confirmed sub-stellar
donor in a cataclysmic variable.
  The very short orbital period of SDSS J1507 is readily explained if the
secondary star is nuclearly evolved, or if SDSS J1507 formed directly from a
detached white dwarf/brown dwarf binary. Given the lack of any visible
contribution from the secondary star, the very low secondary mass and the low
HeI(6678AA)/Halpha emission line ratio, we argue that SDSS J1507 probably
formed directly from a detached white dwarf/brown dwarf binary. If confirmed,
SDSS J1507 will be the first such system identified. The implications for
binary star evolution, the brown-dwarf desert and the common envelope phase are
discussed.

focus on the formation and evolution of the pulsating sdB star in the very

scenario of this unique system, so that it can be confronted with observations.
We probe the stellar structure of the progenitors of sdB stars in short-period
binaries using detailed stellar evolution calculations. Applying this to
PG1336-018 we reconstruct the common-envelope phase during which the sdB star
was formed. The results are interpreted in terms of the standard
common-envelope formalism (the alpha-formalism) based on the energy equation,
and an alternative description (the gamma-formalism) using the angular momentum
equation. We find that if the common-envelope evolution is described by the
alpha-formalism, the sdB progenitor most likely experienced a helium flash. We
then expect the sdB mass to be between 0.39 and 0.48 Msun, and the sdB
progenitor initial mass to be below ~2 Msun. However, the results for the
gamma-formalism are less restrictive, and a broader sdB mass range (0.3 - 0.8
Msun) is possible in this case. Future seismic mass determination will give
strong constraints on the formation of PG1336-018 and, in particular, on the CE

diameter of a ribbonlike ring, which is determined analytically in the

parameters complex is a difficult task. Although the 2F1 function verifies
numerous analytical properties involving power series expansions whose
implementation is apparently immediate, their use is thwarted by instabilities
induced by cancellations between very large terms. Furthermore, small areas of
the complex plane are inaccessible using only 2F1 power series formulas, thus
rendering 2F1 evaluations impossible on a purely analytical basis. In order to
solve these problems, a generalization of R.C. Forrey's transformation theory
has been developed. The latter has been successful in treating the 2F1 function
with real parameters. As in real case transformation theory, the large
canceling terms occurring in 2F1 analytical formulas are rigorously dealt with,
but by way of a new method, directly applicable to the complex plane. Taylor
series expansions are employed to enter complex areas outside the domain of
validity of power series analytical formulas. The proposed algorithm, however,
becomes unstable in general when |a|,|b|,|c| are moderate or large. As a
physical application, the calculation of the wave functions of the analytical
Poschl-Teller-Ginocchio potential involving 2F1 evaluations is considered.

at 3 mm, namely CH3OH (2_K-1_K), HC3N (11-10), HCN (1-0) and OCS (7-6).
Moreover, the bright B1 clump has also been observed at better spatial
resolution in CS (2-1), CH3OH (2_1-1_1)A-, and 34SO (3_2-2_1). These high
spatial resolution observations show a very rich structure in all the tracers,
revealing a clumpy structure of the gas superimposed to an extended emission.
In fact, the three clumps detected by previous IRAM-30m single dish
observations have been resolved into several sub-clumps and new clumps have
been detected in the outflow. The clumps are associated with the two cavities
created by two shock episodes driven by the precessing jet. In particular, the
clumps nearest the protostar are located at the walls of the younger cavity
with a clear arch-shape form while the farthest clumps have slightly different
observational characteristics indicating that they are associated to the older
shock episode. The emission of the observed species peaks in different part of
the lobe: the east clumps are brighter in HC3N (11-10), HCN (1-0) and CS (2-1)
while the west clumps are brighter in CH3OH(2_K-1_K), OCS (7-6) and 34SO

the physical conditions and/or the chemical composition along the lobe of the
outflow at small scale, likely related to the shock activity and the precession
of the outflow. In particular, we observe the decoupling of the silicon
monoxide and methanol emission, common shock tracers, in the B1 clump located

optical spectroscopy of the Type Ia supernova (SN) 2006X in the nearby galaxy

intrinsically peculiar color evolution, or it is highly reddened [E(B -
V)_{host} = 1.42+/-0.04 mag] with R_V = 1.48+/-0.06, much lower than the
canonical value of 3.1 for the average Galactic dust. SN 2006X also has one of
the highest expansion velocities ever published for a SN Ia. Compared with the
other SNe Ia we analyzed, SN 2006X has a broader light curve in the U band, a
more prominent bump/shoulder feature in the V and R bands, a more pronounced
secondary maximum in the I and near-infrared bands, and a remarkably smaller
late-time decline rate in the B band. The B - V color evolution shows an
obvious deviation from the Lira-Phillips relation at 1 to 3 months after
maximum brightness. At early times, optical spectra of SN 2006X displayed
strong, high-velocity features of both intermediate-mass elements (Si, Ca, and
S) and iron-peak elements, while at late times they showed a relatively blue
continuum, consistent with the blue U-B and B-V colors at similar epochs. A
light echo and/or the interaction of the SN ejecta and its circumstellar
material may provide a plausible explanation for its late-time photometric and
spectroscopic behavior. Using the Cepheid distance of M100, we derive a Hubble
constant of 72.7+/-8.2 km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}(statistical) from the normalized
dereddened luminosity of SN 2006X. We briefly discuss whether abnormal dust is
a universal signature for all SNe Ia, and whether the most rapidly expanding
objects form a subclass with distinct photometric and spectroscopic properties.

  Reviews","Astron.Astrophys.Rev.15:1-66,2007","10.1007/s00159-007-0006-1",,"astro-ph",,"  (abridged) We review how the recent increase in X-ray and radio data from
black hole and neutron star binaries can be merged together with theoretical
advances to give a coherent picture of the physics of the accretion flow in
strong gravity. Both long term X-ray light curves, X-ray spectra, the rapid
X-ray variability and the radio jet behaviour are consistent with a model where
a standard outer accretion disc is truncated at low luminosities, being
replaced by a hot, inner flow which also acts as the launching site of the jet.
Decreasing the disc truncation radius leads to softer spectra, as well as
higher frequencies (including QPO's) in the power spectra, and a faster jet.
The collapse of the hot flow when the disc reaches the last stable orbit
triggers the dramatic decrease in radio flux, as well as giving a qualitative
(and often quantitative) explanation for the major hard--soft spectral
transition seen in black holes and neutron stars.
  After collapse of the hot inner flow, the spectrum in black hole systems can
be dominated by the disc emission. Its behaviour is consistent with the
existence of a last stable orbit, and such data can be used to estimate the
black hole spin. These systems can also show very different spectra at these
high luminosities, in which the disc spectrum is strongly distorted by
Comptonization. The structure of the accretion flow becomes increasingly
uncertain as the luminosity approaches (and exceeds) the Eddington luminosity,
though there is growing evidence that winds play an important role. We stress
that these high Eddington fraction flows are key to understanding many
disparate and currently very active fields such as ULX, Narrow Line Seyfert
1's, and the growth of the first black holes in the Early Universe.

determine the radio spectra of 31 luminous and ultraluminous IRAS galaxies
(LIRGs/ULIRGs). We construct the radio spectra using both new and archival
data. From our sample of radio spectra we find that very few have a straight
power-law slope. Although some sources show a flattening of the radio spectral
slope at high frequencies the average spectrum shows a steepening of the radio
spectrum from 1.4 to 22.5 GHz. This is unexpected because in sources with high
rates of star formation we expect flat spectrum, free-free emission to make a
significant contribution to the radio flux at higher radio frequencies. Despite
this trend the radio spectral indices between 8.4 and 22.5 GHz are flatter for
sources with higher values of the FIR-radio flux density ratio q, when this is
calculated at 8.4 GHz. Therefore, sources that are deficient in radio emission
relative to FIR emission (presumably younger sources) have a larger thermal
component to their radio emission. However, we find no correlation between the
radio spectral index between 1.4 and 4.8 GHz and q at 8.4 GHz. Because the low
frequency spectral index is affected by free-free absorption, and this is a
function of source size for a given mass of ionized gas, this is evidence that
the ionized gas in ULIRGs shows a range of densities. The youngest LIRGs and
ULIRGs are characterized by a larger contribution to their high-frequency radio
spectra from free-free emission. However, the youngest sources are not those
that have the greatest free-free absorption at low radio frequencies. The
sources in which the effects of free-free absorption are strongest are instead
the most compact sources. Although these have the warmest FIR colours, they are
not necessarily the youngest sources.

convenient, model-independent way of parameterizing a wide class of ``new
physics'' scenarios. In this article, we study the performance of reactor and
superbeam neutrino experiments in the presence of such non-standard
interactions (NSI). Due to interference between the standard and non-standard
amplitudes, sizeable effects are to be expected if the NSI parameters are close
to their current upper limits. We derive approximate formulas for the relevant
oscillation probabilities including NSI, and show how the leading effects can
be understood intuitively even without any calculations. We will present a
classification of all possible NSI according to their impact on reactor and
superbeam experiments, and it will turn out that these experiments are highly
complementary in terms of their sensitivity to the non-standard parameters. The
second part of the paper is devoted to detailed numerical simulations, which
will demonstrate how a standard oscillation fit of the mixing angle theta-13
may fail if experimental data is affected by NSI. We find that for some
non-standard terms, reactor and superbeam experiments would yield seemingly
conflicting results, while in other cases, they may agree well with each other,
but the resulting value for theta-13 could be far from the true value. This
offset may be so large that the true theta-13 is even ruled out erroneously. In
the last section of the paper, we demonstrate that reactor and superbeam data
can actually establish the presence of non-standard interactions. Throughout
our discussion, we pay special attention to the impact of the complex phases,
and of the near detectors.

on an unknown parameter $\theta$, we are interested in accurately estimating
the true parametric density function at a future observation from the same
distribution. The asymptotic risk of Bayes predictive density estimates with
Kullback--Leibler loss function $D(f_{\theta}||{\hat{f}})=\int{f_{\theta}
\log{(f_{\theta}/ hat{f})}}$ is used to examine various ways of choosing prior
distributions; the principal type of choice studied is minimax. We seek
asymptotically least favorable predictive densities for which the corresponding
asymptotic risk is minimax. A result resembling Stein's paradox for estimating
normal means by the maximum likelihood holds for the uniform prior in the
multivariate location family case: when the dimensionality of the model is at
least three, the Jeffreys prior is minimax, though inadmissible. The Jeffreys
prior is both admissible and minimax for one- and two-dimensional location
problems.

can be formulated in a spacetime setting, without assuming that the
gravitational fields are weak and that the bending angles are small. The first
part is devoted to analytical methods considering spacetimes in which the
equations for light rays (lightlike geodesics) is completely integrable. This
includes spherically symmetric static spacetimes, the Kerr spacetime and plane
gravitational waves. The second part is devoted to qualitative methods which
give some information on lensing properties without actually solving the
equation for lightlike geodesics. This includes Morse theory, methods from
differential topology and bifurcation theory.

  reduces blood-brain barrier disruption and leukocyte infiltration following
  transient focal cerebral ischaemia in rats",,"Journal of Neurochemistry 100(4): 1108-1120 (2007)",,,"q-bio.NC q-bio.TO",,"  Several studies suggest that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 plays a pivotal role in
the progression of ischaemic brain damage. In the present study, we
investigated the effects of selective inhibition of COX-2 with nimesulide (12
mg/kg) and selective inhibition of COX-1 with valeryl salicylate (VAS, 12-120
mg/kg) on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, Evans
blue (EB) extravasation and infarct volume in a standardized model of transient
focal cerebral ischaemia in the rat. Post-ischaemic treatment with nimesulide
markedly reduced the increase in PGE2 levels in the ischaemic cerebral cortex
24 h after stroke and diminished infarct size by 48% with respect to
vehicle-treated animals after 3 days of reperfusion. Furthermore, nimesulide
significantly attenuated the blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and leukocyte
infiltration (as measured by EB leakage and MPO activity, respectively) seen at
48 h after the initial ischaemic episode. These studies provide the first
experimental evidence that COX-2 inhibition with nimesulide is able to limit
BBB disruption and leukocyte infiltration following transient focal cerebral
ischaemia. Neuroprotection afforded by nimesulide is observed even when the
treatment is delayed until 6 h after the onset of ischaemia, confirming a wide
therapeutic window of COX-2 inhibitors in experimental stroke. On the contrary,
selective inhibition of COX-1 with VAS had no significant effect on the
evaluated parameters. These data suggest that COX-2 activity, but not COX-1
activity, contributes to the progression of focal ischaemic brain injury, and
that the beneficial effects observed with non-selective COX inhibitors are
probably associated to COX-2 rather than to COX-1 inhibition.
