  Dust in Galaxies","ApJ, 69 pages, 46 figures, Accepted",,"10.1086/523621",,"astro-ph",,"  Spectral and photometric observations of nearby galaxies show a correlation
between the strength of their mid-IR aromatic features, attributed to PAH
molecules, and their metal abundance, leading to a deficiency of these features
in low-metallicity galaxies. In this paper, we suggest that the observed
correlation represents a trend of PAH abundance with galactic age, reflecting
the delayed injection of carbon dust into the ISM by AGB stars in the final
post-AGB phase of their evolution. AGB stars are the primary sources of PAHs
and carbon dust in galaxies, and recycle their ejecta back to the interstellar
medium only after a few hundred million years of evolution on the main
sequence. In contrast, more massive stars that explode as Type II supernovae
inject their metals and dust almost instantaneously after their formation. We
first determined the PAH abundance in galaxies by constructing detailed models
of UV-to-radio SED of galaxies that estimate the contribution of dust in
PAH-free HII regions, and PAHs and dust from photodissociation regions, to the
IR emission. All model components: the galaxies' stellar content, properties of
their HII regions, and their ionizing and non-ionizing radiation fields and
dust abundances, are constrained by their observed multiwavelength spectrum.
After determining the PAH and dust abundances in 35 nearby galaxies using our
SED model, we use a chemical evolution model to show that the delayed injection
of carbon dust by AGB stars provides a natural explanation to the dependence of
the PAH content in galaxies with metallicity. We also show that larger dust
particles giving rise to the far-IR emission follow a distinct evolutionary
trend closely related to the injection of dust by massive stars into the ISM.

is detected for ~6000 seconds in the 18-100 keV energy band at a luminosity of
~3.8 x 10^{35} erg s^{-1}; this is compatible with the high end of the range of
luminosities expected for quiescent emission. The system is observed to be
outside of the centrifugal inhibition regime and pulsations are detected with
periodicity, P=103.7 +/- 0.1 seconds. An examination of the pulse history of
the source shows that it had been in a constant state of spin-down since it
entered the quiescent phase in 1994. The rate of spin-down implies the
consistent presence of an accretion disk supplying torques to the pulsar. The
observations show that the system is still active and highly variable even in
the absence of recent Type I or Type II X-ray outbursts.

supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Although the operator is not BPS, it has a
finite expectation value at least up to order (g^2 N)^2. This does not happen
generally for a generic non-BPS Wilson loop whose expectation value is UV
divergent. For this reason we call this a near-BPS Wilson loop and conjecture
that its exact expectation value is finite. We derive the general form of the
boundary condition satisfied by the dual string worldsheet and find that it is
deformed. Finiteness of the expectation value of the Wilson loop, together with
some rather remarkable properties of the Lunin-Maldacena metric and the
B-field, fixes the boundary condition to be one which is characterized by the
vielbein of the deformed supergravity metric. The Wilson loop operators provide
natural candidates as dual descriptions to some of the existing D-brane
configurations in the Lunin-Maldacena background. We also construct the string
dual configuration for a near-1/4 BPS circular Wilson loop operator. The string
lies on a deformed three-sphere instead of a two-sphere as in the undeformed
case. The expectation value of the Wilson loop operator is computed using the
AdS/CFT correspondence and is found to be independent of the deformation. We
conjecture that the exact expectation value of the Wilson loop is given by the
same matrix model as in the undeformed case.

correlations, Rouse modes, and orientations of bond and chain end-to-end
vectors, are analyzed within the framework of the Mode Coupling Theory (MCT).
An unusually large value of the exponent parameter is obtained. This feature
suggests the possibility of an underlying higher-order MCT scenario for dynamic
arrest.

$\mean{v_{RP}}$, the relation which, in an approximate form, was found earlier
by Bhalerao and Ollitrault in a more general analysis, but under the same
assumption that $v_2$ is proportional to the initial system eccentricity. We
further show that in the Gaussian model all higher order cumulants are equal to
$\vfour$. Analysis of the distribution in the magnitude of the flow vector, the
$Q-$distribution, reveals that it is totally defined by two parameters,
$\vtwo$, the flow from 2-particle cumulants, and $\vfour$, thus providing
equivalent information compared to the method of cumulants. The flow obtained

transmit a common message over long distances in an energy efficient fashion.
However, the process of making available the same message to all collaborating
nodes introduces delays. In this paper, a MAC-PHY cross-layer scheme is
proposed that enables collaborative beamforming at significantly reduced
collaboration overhead. It consists of two phases. In the first phase, nodes
transmit locally in a random access time-slotted fashion. Simultaneous
transmissions from multiple source nodes are viewed as linear mixtures of all
transmitted packets. In the second phase, a set of collaborating nodes, acting
as a distributed antenna system, beamform the received analog waveform to one
or more faraway destinations. This step requires multiplication of the received
analog waveform by a complex weight, which is independently computed by each
cooperating node, and which allows packets bound to the same destination to add
coherently at the destination node. Assuming that each node has access to
location information, the proposed scheme can achieve high throughput, which in
certain cases exceeds one. An analysis of the symbol error probability
corresponding to the proposed scheme is provided.

spectroscopy. With follow-up high-resolution spectroscopy, we use CO-bandhead
equivalent width and high-precision radial velocity measurements to identify a
core grouping of 26 physically-associated RSGs -- the largest such cluster
known to-date. Using the stars' velocity dispersion, and their inferred
luminosities in conjuction with evolutionary models, we argue that the cluster
has an initial mass of $\sim$40,000\msun, and is therefore among the most
massive in the galaxy. Further, the cluster is only a few hundred parsecs away
from the cluster of 14 RSGs recently reported by Figer et al (2006). These two
RSG clusters represent 20% of all known RSGs in the Galaxy, and now offer the
unique opportunity to study the pre-supernova evolution of massive stars, and
the Blue- to Red-Supergiant ratio at uniform metallicity. We use GLIMPSE,
MIPSGAL and MAGPIS survey data to identify several objects in the field of the
larger cluster which seem to be indicative of recent region-wide starburst
activity at the point where the Scutum-Crux arm intercepts the Galactic bulge.
Future abundance studies of these clusters will therefore permit the study of
the chemical evolution and metallicity gradient of the Galaxy in the region
where the disk meets the bulge.

temperatures of irradiated VHJs can reach 2500-3000 K. Thermal emission from
VHJs is therefore potentially strong at optical wavelengths. We explore the

newly discovered VHJs with the right combination of orbital separation and host

nearly edge-on galaxy NGC4244 across its outer disk surface density break. The
stellar photometry allows us to study the distribution of different stellar
populations and reach very low equivalent surface brightnesses. We find that
the break occurs at the same radius for young, intermediate age, and old stars.
The stellar density beyond the break drops sharply by a factor of at least 600
in 5 kpc. The break occurs at the same radius independent of height above the
disk, but is sharpest in the midplane and nearly disappears at large heights.
These results make it unlikely that truncations are caused by a star formation
threshold alone: the threshold would have to keep the same radial position from
less than 100 Myr to 10 Gyr ago, in spite of potential disturbances such as
infall and redistribution of gas by internal processes. A dynamical
interpretation of truncation formation is more likely such as due to angular
momentum redistribution by bars or density waves, or heating and stripping of
stars caused by the bombardment of dark matter sub-halos. The latter
explanation is also in quantitative agreement with the small diffuse component

X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observation of the globular cluster NGC 6440. The
oscillation is detected following a burst-like event which was decaying at the
beginning of the observation. The time scale of the decay suggests we may have
seen the tail-end of a long-duration burst. Low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are
known to emit thermonuclear X-ray bursts that are sometimes modulated by the
spin frequency of the star, the so called burst oscillations. The pulsations
reported here are peculiar if interpreted as canonical burst oscillations. In
particular, the pulse train lasted for ~500 s, much longer than in standard
burst oscillations. The signal was highly coherent and drifted down by ~2x10^-3
Hz, much smaller than the ~Hz drifts typically observed during normal bursts.
The pulsations are reminiscent of those observed during the much more energetic
``superbursts'', however, the temporal profile and the energetics of the burst
suggest that it was not the tail end nor the precursor feature of a superburst.
It is possible that we caught the tail end of an outburst from a new
`intermittent'' accreting X-ray millisecond pulsar, a phenomenon which until
now has only been seen in HETE J1900.1$-$2455 (Galloway et al. 2007). We note

of near-infrared (NIR)-selected massive galaxies at high redshifts:
BzK-selected star-forming galaxies (BzKs); distant red galaxies (DRGs); and
extremely red objects (EROs). We used the SCUBA HAlf Degree Extragalactic
Survey (SHADES), the largest uniform submm survey to date. Partial overlap of
SIRIUS/NIR images and SHADES in SXDF has allowed us to identify 4 submm-bright
NIR-selected galaxies, which are detected in the mid-infrared, 24 micron, and
the radio, 1.4 GHz. We find that all of our submm-bright NIR-selected galaxies
satisfy the BzK selection criteria, except for one galaxy whose B-z and z-K
colours are however close to the BzK colour boundary. Two of the submm-bright
NIR-selected galaxies satisfy all of the selection criteria we considered, i.e.
they belong to the BzK-DRG-ERO overlapping population, or `extremely red' BzKs.
Although these extremely red BzKs are rare (0.25 arcmin^{-2}), up to 20 % of
this population could be submm galaxies. This fraction is significantly higher
than that found for other galaxy populations studied here. Via a stacking
analysis, we have detected the 850 micron flux of submm-faint BzKs and EROs in
our SCUBA maps. While the contribution of z~2 BzKs to the submm background is
about 10--15 % and similar to that from EROs typically at z~1, BzKs have a
higher fraction (~30 %) of submm flux in resolved sources compared with EROs
and submm sources as a whole. From the SED fitting analysis for both
submm-bright and submm-faint BzKs, we found no clear signature that
submm-bright BzKs are experiencing a specifically luminous evolutionary phase,
compared with submm-faint BzKs. An alternative explanation might be that
submm-bright BzKs are more massive than submm-faint ones.

  Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  The partition function pertaining to finite--temperature decoding of a
(typical) randomly chosen code is known to have three types of behavior,
corresponding to three phases in the plane of rate vs. temperature: the {\it
ferromagnetic phase}, corresponding to correct decoding, the {\it paramagnetic
phase}, of complete disorder, which is dominated by exponentially many
incorrect codewords, and the {\it glassy phase} (or the condensed phase), where
the system is frozen at minimum energy and dominated by subexponentially many
incorrect codewords. We show that the statistical physics associated with the
two latter phases are intimately related to random coding exponents. In
particular, the exponent associated with the probability of correct decoding at
rates above capacity is directly related to the free energy in the glassy
phase, and the exponent associated with probability of error (the error
exponent) at rates below capacity, is strongly related to the free energy in
the paramagnetic phase. In fact, we derive alternative expressions of these
exponents in terms of the corresponding free energies, and make an attempt to
obtain some insights from these expressions. Finally, as a side result, we also
compare the phase diagram associated with a simple finite-temperature universal
decoder for discrete memoryless channels, to that of the finite--temperature

photometry includes ~300,000 objects in the (B, V) color-magnitude diagram

A subsample of ~200,000 stars has been photometrized in all the three bands
simultaneously. The features observed in the CMDs imply a variety of stellar
ages up to at least 1 Gyr, and possibly as old as a Hubble time. The spatial
variation of the CMD morphology and of the red giant branch colors point toward
the presence of an age gradient: young and intermediate-age stars tend to be
concentrated toward the galactic center, while old stars are present
everywhere. The spatial variation in the average luminosity of carbon stars
suggests that there is not a strong metallicity gradient (< 0.2 dex). Also, we
detect an interesting resolved star cluster on the West side of the galaxy,
surrounded by a symmetric tidal or spiral feature consisting of young stars.
The positions of the stars in NGC 4449 younger than 10 Myr are strongly
correlated with the Halpha emission. We derive the distance of NGC 4449 from

Fermi-surface property. Here we present an {\it ab-initio} approach for
computing the anomalous Hall conductivity that takes advantage of this
observation by converting the integral over the Fermi sea into a more efficient
integral on the Fermi surface only. First, a conventional electronic-structure
calculation is performed with spin-orbit interaction included.
Maximally-localized Wannier functions are then constructed by a post-processing
step in order to convert the {\it ab-initio} electronic structure around the
Fermi level into a tight-binding-like form. Working in the Wannier
representation, the Brillouin zone is sampled on a large number of equally
spaced parallel slices oriented normal to the total magnetization. On each
slice, we find the intersections of the Fermi-surface sheets with the slice by
standard contour methods, organize these into a set of closed loops, and
compute the Berry phases of the Bloch states as they are transported around
these loops. The anomalous Hall conductivity is proportional to the sum of the
Berry phases of all the loops on all the slices. Illustrative calculations are
performed for Fe, Co and Ni.

corresponding Schr\""odinger operator is not automatically self-adjoint on its
natural domain. Such operators admit more than one self-adjoint domain, and the
spectrum and all physical consequences depend seriously on the self-adjoint
version chosen. The article discusses how the self-adjoint domains can be
identified in terms of a boundary condition for the asymptotic behaviour of the
wave functions around the singularity, and what physical differences emerge for
different self-adjoint versions of the Hamiltonian. The paper reviews and
interprets known results, with the intention to provide a practical guide for
all those interested in how to approach these ambiguous situations.

spherical symmetry and shell crossing which are important in the non-linear
regime. Our model is designed so that it predicts a relation between the
peculiar velocity and density contrast that agrees with the results of N-body
simulations in the region where such a comparison can sensibly be made. Prior
to turnaround, when the unmodified spherical collapse model is expect to be a
good approximation, the predictions of the two models coincide almost exactly.
The effects of a late time dominating dark energy component are also taken into
account. The improved spherical collapse model is a useful tool when one
requires a good approximation not just to the evolution of the density contrast
but also its trajectory. Moreover, the analytical fitting formulae presented is
simple enough to be used anywhere where the standard spherical collapse might
be used but with the advantage that it includes a realistic model of the
effects of virialisation.

~10 km/s. We show that the shape of the average HI profile beyond the terminal

fast component with $\Delta v=25.9$ km/s. Examining the widths with Galactic
radius we find that the narrowest two components show little variation with
radius and their small scale fluctuations track each other very well,
suggesting that they share the same cloud-to-cloud motions. The width of the
widest component is constant until R<4 kpc, where it increases sharply.

applications, e.g., Mathematical Physics and Control Theory. The simplest

Sub-Riemannian Geometry enjoys major differences from the Riemannian being a
generalisation of the latter at the same time, e.g., geodesics are not unique
and may be singular, the Hausdorff dimension is larger than the manifold
topological dimension. There exists a large amount of literature developing
sub-Riemannian Geometry. However, very few is known about its natural extension
to pseudo-Riemannian analogues. It is natural to begin such a study with some
low-dimensional manifolds. Based on ideas from sub-Riemannian geometry we
develop sub-Lorentzian geometry over the classical 3-D anti-de Sitter space.
Two different distributions of the tangent bundle of anti-de Sitter space yield
two different geometries: sub-Lorentzian and sub-Riemannian. It is shown that
the set of timelike and spacelike `horizontal' curves is non-empty and we study
the problem of horizontal connectivity in anti-de Sitter space. We also use

the radiation-dominated epoch, the equation-of-state parameter of the new
agegraphic dark energy $w_q=-1/3$ whereas $\Omega_q=n^2a^2$; in the
matter-dominated epoch, $w_q=-2/3$ whereas $\Omega_q=n^2a^2/4$; eventually, the
new agegraphic dark energy dominates; in the late time $w_q\to -1$ when
$a\to\infty$, and the new agegraphic dark energy mimics a cosmological
constant. In every stage, all things are consistent. The confusion in the
original agegraphic dark energy model proposed in arXiv:0707.4049 disappears in
this new model. Furthermore, $\Omega_q\ll 1$ is naturally satisfied in both
radiation-dominated and matter-dominated epochs where $a\ll 1$. In addition, we
further extend the new agegraphic dark energy model by including the
interaction between the new agegraphic dark energy and background matter. In
this case, we find that $w_q$ can cross the phantom divide.

detected in mid-infrared (S_{3.6um} > 6 uJy) reside at the most massive and
dusty end of the LBG population, with relatively high and tight $M/L$ in

dusty star-forming galaxies with star formation rates of 100--1000 Msun/yr,

function of massive LBGs, we estimate that the lower limit for the star
formation rate density from LBGs more massive than 10^11 Msun at z~3 is > 3.3 x
10^-3 Msun/yr/Mpc^3, showing for the first time that the UV-bright population
of massive galaxies alone contributes significantly to the global star
formation rate density at z~3. When combined with the star formation rate
densities at z < 2, our result reveals a steady increase in the contribution of
massive galaxies to the global star formation from z=0 to z=3, providing strong

existence and nature of extra-solar planetary systems. The fitting of stellar
radial velocity time series data is attempted by constructing a model to
quantify the orbital properties of a star-planetary system. This is achieved
with the Planetary Orbit Fitting Process (POFP). Though specific to the
investigated problem, the POFP is founded on two separate, more general ideas.
One is a Solver producing the gravitational dynamics of a Three-Body system by
integrating its Newtonian equations of motion. The other is an independent
optimisation scheme. Both have been devised using MATLAB. Applying the
optimisation to the Solver results in a realistic Three-Body dynamics that best
describes the radial velocity data under the model-specific
orbital-observational constraints. Combining these aspects also allows for the
study of dynamical instability derived from interaction, which is reaffirmed as
a necessary criterion for evaluating the fit. The validity of POFP solutions
with respect to the observations and other models is discussed in this context.
The underlying generality and fundamental principles demonstrate a larger frame
of operation where problems in Physics and Mathematics can be solved with a
multitude of techniques.

importantly, we prove that the existence of a large energy gap between a few
low-lying excitation patterns and the majority of the other (in principle)

crucial for this area-dependence. We also remark that this is an indication

there are some classes of structured matrices for which the permanent is
calculable in polynomial time. The most well-known example is the fixed-jump
(0,1) circulant matrix which, using algebraic techniques, was shown by Minc to
satisfy a constant-coefficient fixed-order recurrence relation.
  In this note we show how, by interpreting the problem as calculating the
number of cycle-covers in a directed circulant graph, it is straightforward to
reprove Minc's result using combinatorial methods. This is a two step process:
the first step is to show that the cycle-covers of directed circulant graphs
can be evaluated using a transfer matrix argument. The second is to show that
the associated transfer matrices, while very large, actually have much smaller
characteristic polynomials than would a-priori be expected.
  An important consequence of this new viewpoint is that, in combination with a
new recursive decomposition of circulant-graphs, it permits extending Minc's
result to calculating the permanent of the much larger class of circulant
matrices with non-fixed (but linear) jumps. It also permits us to count other
types of structures in circulant graphs, e.g., Hamiltonian Cycles.

in a distributed system. Mobile robots (or agents) are one of the emerging
trends in distributed computing as they mimic autonomous biologic entities. The
contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we present a new model for
studying mobile entities in networks subject to transient faults. Our model
differs from the classical robot model because robots have constraints about
the paths they are allowed to follow, and from the classical agent model
because the number of agents remains fixed throughout the execution of the
protocol. Second, in this model, we study the possibility of designing
self-stabilizing algorithms when those algorithms are run by mobile robots (or
agents) evolving on a graph. We concentrate on the core building blocks of
robot and agents problems: naming and leader election. Not surprisingly, when
no constraints are given on the network graph topology and local execution
model, both problems are impossible to solve. Finally, using minimal hypothesis
with respect to impossibility results, we provide deterministic and
probabilistic solutions to both problems, and show equivalence of these
problems by an algorithmic reduction mechanism.

acting only between particles of different size. The small particles provide
the bonds between the large ones. With a proper choice of the interaction
parameters, as well as of the relative concentration of the two species, it is
possible to control the effective valence. Here we focus on a specific choice
of the parameters which favors tetrahedral ordering and study the equilibrium
static properties of the system in a large window of densities and
temperatures. Upon lowering the temperature we observe a progressive increase
in local order, accompanied by the formation of a four-coordinated network of
bonds. Three different density regions are observed: at low density the system
phase separates into a gas and a liquid phase; at intermediate densities a
network of fully bonded particles develops; at high densities -- due to the
competition between excluded volume and attractive interactions -- the system
forms a defective network. The very same behavior has been previously observed
in numerical studies of non-spherical models for molecular liquids, such as
water, and in models of patchy colloidal particles. Differently from these
models, theoretical treatments devised for spherical potentials, e.g. integral
equations and ideal mode coupling theory for the glass transition can be
applied in the present case, opening the way for a deeper understanding of the

second quantization, is a representation of the N-particle Schr\""odinger
equation, and this means that basically the ultra second quantization of the
equation is the same as the original N-particle equation: they coincide in
3N-dimensional space.
  We consider a short action pairwise potential V(x_i -x_j). This means that as
the number of particles tends to infinity, $N\to\infty$, interaction is
possible for only a finite number of particles. Therefore, the potential
depends on N in the following way: $V_N=V((x_i-x_j)N^{1/3})$. If V(y) is finite
with support $\Omega_V$, then as $N\to\infty$ the support engulfs a finite
number of particles, and this number does not depend on N.
  As a result, it turns out that the superfluidity occurs for velocities less
than $\min(\lambda_{\text{crit}}, \frac{h}{2mR})$, where
$\lambda_{\text{crit}}$ is the critical Landau velocity and R is the radius of
the nanotube.

surface density and gas surface density in the spiral galaxy M51a (NGC 5194),
using multi-wavelength data obtained as part of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby
Galaxies Survey (SINGS). We introduce a new SFR index based on a linear
combination of H-alpha emission-line and 24 micron continuum luminosities, that
provides reliable extinction-corrected ionizing fluxes and SFR densities over a
wide range of dust attenuations. The combination of these extinction-corrected
SFR densities with aperture synthesis HI and CO maps has allowed us to probe
the form of the spatially-resolved star formation law on scales of 0.5 to 2
kpc. We find that the resolved SFR vs gas surface density relation is well
represented by a Schmidt power law, which is similar in form and dispersion to
the disk-averaged Schmidt law. We observe a comparably strong correlation of
the SFR surface density with the molecular gas surface density, but no
significant correlation with the surface density of atomic gas. The
best-fitting slope of the Schmidt law varies from N = 1.37 to 1.56, with
zeropoint and slope that change systematically with the spatial sampling scale.
We tentatively attribute these variations to the effects of areal sampling and
averaging of a nonlinear intrinsic star formation law. Our data can also be
fitted by an alternative parametrization of the SFR surface density in terms of
the ratio of gas surface density to local dynamical time, but with a
considerable dispersion.

accretion with different efficiency. The population of Compton-thick sources
plays a key role in our understanding of the BH growth history. Their space
density and redshift distribution is relevant to estimate the SMBH mass
function. A comparison with the relic SMBH mass distribution in the local
Universe constrains the average radiative efficiency and Eddington ratio of the
accretion. We discuss a new synthesis model of Compton-thin and Compton-thick
sources that is in concordance with deep X-ray observations and in particular
predicts the right level of contribution of the Compton-thick source population
observed in the Chandra Deep Field South observations as well as the first
INTEGRAL and Swift catalogues of AGN. Currently, one of the most important
problems is the evolution of obscuration with redshift.

find a trade-off between static and very abstract risk measures as we are more

introducing a general axiomatic approach to dynamic risk measures, we relate
the dynamic version of convex risk measures to BSDEs.

magnifications in pairs of images that straddle a critical curve. Simple
theoretical arguments suggest that the magnification of these images should be
approximately equivalent, whereas one image is observed to be significantly
demagnified. Microlensing provides a possible explanation for this discrepancy.
There are two key parameters when modelling this effect. The first, the
fraction of smooth matter in the lens at the image positions, has been explored
by Schechter and Wambsganss (2002). They have shown that the anomalous flux
ratio observed in the lensed quasar MG 0414+0534 is a priori a factor of 5 more
likely if the assumed smooth matter content in the lens model is increased from
0% to 93%. The second parameter, the size of the emission region, is explored
in this paper, and shown to be more significant. We find that the broadening of
the magnification probability distributions due to smooth matter content is
washed out for source sizes that are predicted by standard models for quasars.
We apply our model to the anomalous lensed quasar MG 0414+0534, and find a 95%
upper limit of 2.62 x 10^(16) h^(-1/2) (M/Msun)^(1/2) cm on the radius of the

unconstrained.

measure-valued process that keeps track of the ages of customers in service.
Under mild assumptions on the service time distribution, as the number of
servers goes to infinity, a law of large numbers (or fluid) limit is
established for this pair of processes. The limit is characterised as the
unique solution to a coupled pair of integral equations, which admits a fairly
explicit representation. As a corollary, the fluid limits of several other
functionals of interest, such as the waiting time, are also obtained.
Furthermore, in the time-homogeneous setting, the fluid limit is shown to
converge to its equilibrium. Along the way, some results of independent

property of the fluid limit. A motivation for studying these systems is that
they arise as models of computer data systems and call centers.

further examined the spectrum of the diffuse X-ray emission from the remnant
interior with a background-subtracted count rate of ~0.06 counts s^-1 in
0.3-3.5 keV. The spectrum of the emission can be described by a thermal plasma
with a temperature of ~0.3-0.6 keV and a Si over-abundance of >~7 solar. These
spectral characteristics, together with the extremely low X-ray luminosity,
suggest that the remnant arises from a supernova with an anomalously low

the remnant may indicate an early thermalization of the SN ejecta by the

employed. In one technique, the SN ejecta are treated as a single zone, while
in the other a density and abundance distribution in velocity is used from an
explosion model. In both cases, heating caused by gamma-ray and positron
deposition is computed (in the latter case using a Monte Carlo technique to
describe the propagation of gamma-rays and positrons), as is cooling via
forbidden-line emission. The results are compared, and although general
agreement is found, the stratified models are shown to reproduce the observed
line profiles much more accurately than the single-zone model. The explosion
produced ~ 0.1 Msun of 56Ni. The distribution in velocity of the various
elements is in agreement with that obtained from the early-time models, which
indicated an ejected mass of ~ 2.5 Msun with a kinetic energy of 4 x 10^{51}
erg. Nebular spectroscopy confirms that most of the ejected mass (~ 1.2 Msun)
was oxygen. The presence of an oxygen-rich inner core, combined with that of
56Ni at high velocities as deduced from early-time models, suggests that the
explosion was asymmetric, especially in the inner part.

the exact theory, differ in general at finite approximation order. We derive
generalized (2PI) Ward identities for these various $n$-point functions and
show that such identities are exactly satisfied at any approximation order in
2PI QED. In particular, we show that 2PI-resummed vertex functions, i.e.
field-derivatives of the so-called 2PI-resummed effective action, exactly
satisfy standard Ward identities. We identify another set of $n$-point
functions in the 2PI framework which exactly satisfy the standard Ward
identities at any approximation order. These are obtained as field-derivatives
of the two-point function $\bcG^{-1}[\phi]$, which defines the extremum of the
2PI effective action. We point out that the latter is not constrained by the
underlying symmetry. As a consequence, the well-known fact that the
corresponding gauge-field polarization tensor is not transverse in momentum
space for generic approximations does not constitute a violation of (2PI) Ward
identities. More generally, our analysis demonstrates that approximation
schemes based on 2PI functional techniques respect all the Ward identities
associated with the underlying abelian gauge symmetry. Our results apply to
arbitrary linearly realized global symmetries as well.

tessellations of the plane to those of the Poisson-Voronoi case, thus analyzing
in a common framework symmetry-break processes and the approach to uniformly
random distributions of tessellation-generating points. We consider ensemble
simulations of tessellations generated by points whose regular positions are
perturbed through a Gaussian noise controlled by the parameter alpha. We study
the number of sides, the area, and the perimeter of the Voronoi cells. For
alpha>0, hexagons are the most common class of cells, and 2-parameter gamma
distributions describe well the statistics of the geometrical characteristics.
The symmetry break due to noise destroys the square tessellation, whereas the
honeycomb hexagonal tessellation is very stable and all Voronoi cells are
hexagon for small but finite noise with alpha<0.1. For a moderate amount of
Gaussian noise, memory of the specific unperturbed tessellation is lost,
because the statistics of the two perturbed tessellations is indistinguishable.
When alpha>2, results converge to those of Poisson-Voronoi tessellations. The
properties of n-sided cells change with alpha until the Poisson-Voronoi limit
is reached for alpha>2. The Desch law for perimeters is confirmed to be not
valid and a square root dependence on n is established. The ensemble mean of
the cells area and perimeter restricted to the hexagonal cells coincides with
the full ensemble mean; this might imply that the number of sides acts as a
thermodynamic state variable fluctuating about n=6; this reinforces the idea
that hexagons, beyond their ubiquitous numerical prominence, can be taken as
generic polygons in 2D Voronoi tessellations.

disclosure risk. Risk arises from non-empty sample cells which represent small
population cells and from population uniques in particular. Therefore risk
estimation requires assessing how many of the relevant population cells are
likely to be small. Various methods have been proposed for this task, and we

smoothing using a local neighborhood of this cell, that is, cells having
similar or close values in all attributes. We provide some preliminary results
and experiments with this method. Comparisons are made to two other methods: 1.
a log-linear models approach in which inference on a given cell is based on a
``neighborhood'' of cells determined by the log-linear model. Such
neighborhoods have one or some common attributes with the cell in question, but
some other attributes may differ significantly. 2 The Argus method in which
inference on a given cell is based only on the sample frequency in the specific
cell, on the sample design and on some known marginal distributions of the
population, without learning from any type of ``neighborhood'' of the given
cell, nor from any model which uses the structure of the table.
