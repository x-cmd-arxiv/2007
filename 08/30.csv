and find that they fall into three classes. (1) The vast majority show Fe L
emission between 0.7 and 1 keV and Si and S K alpha emission; we associate
these with shocked ejecta. A few of these are found at or beyond the mean blast
wave radius. (2) A very few regions show solar O/Fe abundance rations; these we
associate with shocked circumstellar medium (CSM). Otherwise O is scarce. (3) A
few regions are dominated by continuum, probably synchrotron radiation.
Finally, we find no central point source, with a limit about 100 times fainter
than the central object in Cas A. The evidence that the blast wave is
interacting with CSM may indicate a Ia explosion in a more massive progenitor.

  Special Issue)",,"10.1093/pasj/60.sp1.S351",,"astro-ph",,"  We observed an X-ray afterglow of GRB 060904A with the Swift and Suzaku
satellites. We found rapid spectral softening during both the prompt tail phase
and the decline phase of an X-ray flare in the BAT and XRT data. The observed
spectra were fit by power-law photon indices which rapidly changed from $\Gamma
= 1.51^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ to $\Gamma = 5.30^{+0.69}_{-0.59}$ within a few hundred
seconds in the prompt tail. This is one of the steepest X-ray spectra ever
observed, making it quite difficult to explain by simple electron acceleration
and synchrotron radiation. Then, we applied an alternative spectral fitting
using a broken power-law with exponential cutoff (BPEC) model. It is valid to
consider the situation that the cutoff energy is equivalent to the synchrotron
frequency of the maximum energy electrons in their energy distribution. Since
the spectral cutoff appears in the soft X-ray band, we conclude the electron
acceleration has been inefficient in the internal shocks of GRB 060904A. These
cutoff spectra suddenly disappeared at the transition time from the prompt tail
phase to the shallow decay one. After that, typical afterglow spectra with the
photon indices of 2.0 are continuously and preciously monitored by both XRT and
Suzaku/XIS up to 1 day since the burst trigger time. We could successfully
trace the temporal history of two characteristic break energies (peak energy
and cutoff energy) and they show the time dependence of $\propto t^{-3} \sim
t^{-4}$ while the following afterglow spectra are quite stable. This fact
indicates that the emitting material of prompt tail is due to completely
different dynamics from the shallow decay component. Therefore we conclude the
emission sites of two distinct phenomena obviously differ from each other.

""closed"" hamiltonian operator and ""open"" markovian Lindblad operators, is
obtained. The theory is based on the chord function, i.e. the Fourier transform
of the Wigner function. It reduces to an exact solution of the Lindblad master
equation if the hamiltonian operator is a quadratic function and the Lindblad
operators are linear functions of positions and momenta.
  Initially, the semiclassical formulae for the case of hermitian Lindblad
operators are reinterpreted in terms of a (real) double phase space, generated
by an appropriate classical double Hamiltonian. An extra ""open"" term is added
to the double Hamiltonian by the non-hermitian part of the Lindblad operators
in the general case of dissipative markovian evolution. The particular case of
generic hamiltonian operators, but linear dissipative Lindblad operators, is
studied in more detail. A Liouville-type equivariance still holds for the
corresponding classical evolution in double phase, but the centre subspace,
which supports the Wigner function, is compressed, along with expansion of its
conjugate subspace, which supports the chord function.
  Decoherence narrows the relevant region of double phase space to the
neighborhood of a caustic for both the Wigner function and the chord function.
This difficulty is avoided by a propagator in a mixed representation, so that a
further ""small-chord"" approximation leads to a simple generalization of the
quadratic theory for evolving Wigner functions.

investigation of the 2-dimensional charge-density-wave 1$T$-TaS$_2$ whose

parameters, raising the GUT scale SU(2) gaugino mass |M_2| from its unified
value results in a smaller value of -m_{H_u}^2 at the weak scale. By the
electroweak symmetry breaking conditions, this implies a reduced value of \mu^2
{\it vis \`a vis} models with gaugino mass unification. The lightest neutralino
can then be mixed Higgsino dark matter with a relic density in agreement with
the measured abundance of cold dark matter (DM). We explore the phenomenology
of this high |M_2| DM model. The spectrum is characterized by a very large wino
mass and a concomitantly large splitting between left- and right- sfermion
masses. In addition, the lighter chargino and three light neutralinos are
relatively light with substantial higgsino components. The higgsino content of
the LSP implies large rates for direct detection of neutralino dark matter, and
enhanced rates for its indirect detection relative to mSUGRA. We find that
experiments at the LHC should be able to discover SUSY over the portion of
parameter space where m_{\tg} \alt 2350-2750 ~GeV, depending on the squark
mass, while a 1 TeV electron-positron collider has a reach comparable to that
of the LHC. The dilepton mass spectrum in multi-jet + \ell^+\ell^- + \eslt
events at the LHC will likely show more than one mass edge, while its shape
should provide indirect evidence for the large higgsino content of the decaying

stunningly a geometric realization of its representation ring in the braided

how one can use the co-cycles $\beta$ above to twist a) the global orbifold
$K$--theory of the inertia of a global quotient and more importantly b) the
stacky $K$--theory of a global quotient $[X/G]$. This corresponds to twistings

significantly more entropy into the core regions of the ICM atmosphere, even

  Way","22 pages including 5 figures. Submitted to the Astronomical Journal",,"10.1088/0004-6256/136/1/367",,"astro-ph",,"  We show that the Galactic bulge and disk share a similar, strong, decline in
[O/Mg] ratio with [Mg/H]. The similarity of the [O/Mg] trend in these two,
markedly different, populations suggests a metallicity-dependent modulation of
the stellar yields from massive stars, by mass loss from winds, and related to
the Wolf-Rayet phenomenon, as proposed by McWilliam & Rich (2004). We have
modified existing models for the chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge and
the solar neighborhood with the inclusion of metallicity-dependent oxygen
yields from theoretical predictions for massive stars that include mass loss by
stellar winds. Our results significantly improve the agreement between
predicted and observed [O/Mg] ratios in the bulge and disk above solar
metallicity; however, a small zero-point normalization problem remains to be
resolved. The zero-point shift indicates that either the semi-empirical yields
of Francois et al. (2004) need adjustment, or that the bulge IMF is not quite
as flat as found by Ballero et al. (2007); the former explanation is preferred.
Our result removes a previous inconsistency between the interpretation of
[O/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] ratios in the bulge, and confirms the conclusion that the
bulge formed more rapidly than the disk, based on the over-abundances of
elements produced by massive stars. We also provide an explanation for the
long-standing difference between [Mg/Fe] and [O/Fe] trends among disk stars
more metal-rich than the sun.

  Bose-Einstein condensates supported by optical lattices","20 pages, 23 figs, accepted to PRA",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.76.043623",,"nlin.PS",,"  Models of two-dimensional (2D) traps, with the double-well structure in the
third direction, for Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) are introduced, with
attractive or repulsive interactions between atoms. The models are based on
systems of linearly coupled 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs), where the
coupling accounts for tunneling between the wells. Each well carries an optical
lattice (OL) (stable 2D solitons cannot exist without OLs). The main subject of
the work is spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in two-component 2D solitons
and localized vortices. We demonstrate that, in the system with attraction or
repulsion, SSB occurs in families of symmetric or antisymmetric solitons (or
vortices), respectively. The corresponding bifurcation destabilizes the
original solution branch and gives rise to a stable branch of asymmetric
solitons or vortices. In the model with attraction, all stable branches
eventually terminate due to the onset of collapse. Stable asymmetric solitons
in higher finite bandgaps, and vortices with a multiple topological charge are
found too. The models also give rise to first examples of \textit{embedded
solitons%} and \textit{embedded vortices}(the states located inside Bloch
bands) in two dimensions. In the linearly-coupled system with opposite signs of
the nonlinearity in the two cores, two distinct types of stable solitons and
vortices are found, dominated by either the self-attractive component or the
self-repulsive one. In the system with a mismatch between the two OLs, a
\textit{pseudo-bifurcation} is found: when the mismatch attains its largest
value ($\pi $), the bifurcation does not happen, as branches of different
solutions asymptotically approach each other but fail to merge.

The ACS was used for 126 orbits to image a single field in two colors (F814W,
F606W) 5 arcmin SE of the cluster center. The field observed overlaps that of
archival WFPC2 data from 1994 and 1997 which were used to proper motion (PM)
clean the data. Applying the PM corrections produces a remarkably clean CMD
which reveals a number of features never seen before in a globular cluster CMD.
In our field, the main sequence stars appeared to terminate close to the
location in the CMD of the hydrogen-burning limit predicted by two independent
sets of stellar evolution models. The faintest observed main sequence stars are
about a magnitude fainter than the least luminous metal-poor field halo stars
known, suggesting that the lowest luminosity halo stars still await discovery.
At the bright end the data extend beyond the main sequence turnoff to well up
the giant branch. A populous white dwarf cooling sequence is also seen in the
cluster CMD. The most dramatic features of the cooling sequence are its turn to
the blue at faint magnitudes as well as an apparent truncation near F814W = 28.
The cluster luminosity and mass functions were derived, stretching from the
turn off down to the hydrogen-burning limit. It was well modeled with either a
very flat power-law or a lognormal function. In order to interpret these fits
more fully we compared them with similar functions in the cluster core and with
a full N-body model of NGC 6397 finding satisfactory agreement between the
model predictions and the data. This exercise demonstrates the important role
and the effect that dynamics has played in altering the cluster IMF.

that are under the influence of supermassive black hole gravity and radiation
from an accretion disk surrounding the black hole. This work is an extension of
the earlier work presented by Proga, where nonrotating flows were studied.
Here, we consider effects of rotation, a position-dependent radiation
temperature, density at large radii, and uniform X-ray background radiation. As
in the non-rotating case, the rotating flow settles into a configuration with
two components (1) an equatorial inflow and (2) a bipolar inflow/outflow with
the outflow leaving the system along the pole. However, with rotation the flow
does not always reach a steady state. In addition, rotation reduces the outflow
collimation and the outward flux of mass and kinetic energy. Moreover rotation
increases the outward flux of the thermal energy and can lead to fragmentation
and time-variability of the outflow. We also show that a position-dependent
radiation temperature can significantly change the flow solution. In
particular, the inflow in the equatorial region can be replaced by a thermally
driven outflow. Generally, as it have been discussed and shown in the past, we
find that self-consistently determined preheating/cooling from the quasar
radiation can significantly reduce the rate at which the central BH is fed with
matter. However, our results emphasize also a little appreciated feature.
Namely, quasar radiation drives a non-spherical, multi-temperature and very
dynamic flow. These effects become dominant for luminosities in excess of 0.01
of the Eddington luminosity.

cylindrical composite was synthesized by electro-deposition. The maximum ME
voltage coefficient of cylindrical ME composite is 35V/cm Oe, about three times
higher than that of the plate trilayered composite with the same raw materials
and magnetostrictive- piezoelectric phase thickness ratio. The high ME voltage
coefficient of cylindrical composite owes to the self-bound effect of circle.
Moreover, the resulting complex condition can induce a double peak in the field
dependence of ME coefficient.

The dark energy contributes about two-thirds of the critical density of the

anisotropy of cosmic microwave background (CMB).The SN Ia observations also
suggest that the universe expanded from a deceleration to an acceleration phase
at some redshift, implying the existence of a nearly uniform component of dark
energy with negative pressure. We use the ``gold'' sample containing 157 SNe Ia
and two recent well-measured additions, SNe Ia 1994ae and 1998aq to explore the
properties of dark energy and the transition redshift. For a flat universe with
the cosmological constant, we measure $\Omega_{M}=0.28_{-0.05}^{+0.04}$, which
is consistent with Riess et al. The transition redshift is
$z_{T}=0.60_{-0.08}^{+0.06}$. We also discuss several dark energy models that
define the $w(z)$ of the parameterized equation of state of dark energy
including one parameter and two parameters ($w(z)$ being the ratio of the
pressure to energy density). Our calculations show that the accurately
calculated transition redshift varies from $z_{T}=0.29_{-0.06}^{+0.07}$ to
$z_{T}=0.60_{-0.08}^{+0.06}$ across these models. We also calculate the minimum

their own existence by exchange of matter and energy with the surroundings.
Their subsequent evolution depends on the environment where they are born.
Under contemporary Earth conditions the lifetime of such complexities is
relatively short. A similar self-organization mechanism, produced by simple

Contrary to the commonly accepted view, we find that the well-known
Berg-Purcell scaling for the association rate is modified as a function of
time. Specifically, the effective on-rate changes non-monotonically as a
function of time and equals the intrinsic rate at very early as well as late
times, while being approximately equal to the Berg-Purcell value at
intermediate times. The effective dissociation rate, as it appears in the
binding curve or measured in a dissociation experiment, is strongly modified by
rebinding events and assumes the Berg-Purcell value except at very late times,
where the decay is algebraic and not exponential. In equilibrium, the ligand
concentration everywhere in the solution is the same and equals its spatial
mean, thus ensuring that there is no depletion in the vicinity of the cell.
Implications of our results for binding experiments and numerical simulations

this paper, we present spatial and metal abundance properties of 95 M81

system. These globular clusters are divided into two M81 metallicity groups by
a KMM test. Our results show that, the metal-rich clusters did not demonstrate
a centrally concentrated spatial distribution as ones in M31, and metal-poor
clusters tend to be less spatially concentrated. In other words, the
distribution of the metal-rich clusters in M81 is not very similar to that of
M31. Most of the metal-rich clusters distribute at projected radii of 4-8 kpc.
It is also noted that the metal-rich clusters distribute within the inner 20
kpc, and the metal-poor ones do out to radii of ~40 kpc. Like our Galaxy and
M31, the metallicity distribution of globular clusters in M81 along
galactocentric radius suggests that some dissipation occurred during the
formation of the globular cluster system, i.e. smooth, pressure-supported
collapse models of galaxies are unlikely to produce such radial distribution of
metallicity presented in this paper. There is not evident correlation between
globular cluster luminosity and metallicity in M81 globular clusters. The
overwhelming conclusion of this paper seems to be that a more complete and
thorough cluster search is needed in M81.

flow. It is shown that under the geodesic flow, the normalized parameter
measure on the curve gets asymptotically equidistributed with respect to the
normalized natural Riemannian measure on the unit tangent bundle of a closed
totally geodesically immersed submanifold.
  Moreover, if this immersed submanifold is a proper subset, then a lift of the
curve to the universal covering space $T^1(H^n)$ is mapped into a proper
subsphere of the ideal boundary sphere $\partial H^n$ under the visual map.
This proper subsphere can be realized as the ideal boundary of an isometrically
embedded hyperbolic subspace in $H^n$ covering the closed immersed submanifold.
  In particular, if the visual map does not send a lift of the curve into a
proper subsphere of $\partial H^n$, then under the geodesic flow the curve gets
asymptotically equidistributed on the unit tangent bundle of the manifold with
respect to the normalized natural Riemannian measure.
  The proof uses dynamical properties of unipotent flows on finite volume
homogeneous spaces of SO(n,1).

through a dust-driven wind during the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase.
Recent studies show that winds from late-type stars are far from being smooth.
Mass-loss variations occur on different time scales, from years to tens of
thousands of years. The variations appear to be particularly prominent towards
the end of the AGB evolution. The occurrence, amplitude and time scale of these
variations are still not well understood.
  The goal of our study is to gain insight into the structure of the
circumstellar envelope (CSE) of WX Psc and map the possible variability of the
late-AGB mass-loss phenomenon.
  We have performed an in-depth analysis of the extreme infrared AGB star WX
Psc by modeling (1) the CO J=1-0 through 7-6 rotational line profiles and the
full spectral energy distribution (SED) ranging from 0.7 to 1300 micron. We
hence are able to trace a geometrically extended region of the CSE.
  Both mass-loss diagnostics bear evidence of the occurrence of mass-loss
modulations during the last ~2000 yr. In particular, WX Psc went through a high
mass-loss phase (Mdot~5e-5 Msun/yr) some 800 yr ago. This phase lasted about
600 yr and was followed by a long period of low mass loss (Mdot~5e-8 Msun/yr).
The present day mass-loss rate is estimated to be ~6e-6 Msun/yr.
  The AGB star WX Psc has undergone strong mass-loss rate variability on a time
scale of several hundred years during the last few thousand years. These
variations are traced in the strength and profile of the CO rotational lines
and in the SED. We have consistently simulated the behaviour of both tracers
using radiative transfer codes that allow for non-constant mass-loss rates.

observations and future studies of planetesimal growth. Method: We numerically
model the evolution of dust in a protoplanetary disk using a two-fluid (gas +
dust) Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code, which is non-self-gravitating
and locally isothermal. The code follows the three dimensional distribution of
dust in a protoplanetary disk as it interacts with the gas via aerodynamic
drag. In this work, we present the evolution of a minimum mass solar nebula
(MMSN) disk comprising 1% dust by mass in the presence of an embedded planet.
We run a series of simulations which vary the grain size and planetary mass to
see how they affect the resulting disk structure. Results: We find that gap
formation is much more rapid and striking in the dust layer than in the gaseous
disk and that a system with a given stellar, disk and planetary mass will have
a completely different appearance depending on the grain size. For low mass
planets in our MMSN disk, a gap can open in the dust disk while not in the gas
disk. We also note that dust accumulates at the external edge of the planetary
gap and speculate that the presence of a planet in the disk may enhance the
formation of a second planet by facilitating the growth of planetesimals in
this high density region.

morphology. Galaxy morphology is found to depend critically on the local
environment set up by the nearest neighbor galaxy in addition to luminosity and
the large scale density. When a galaxy is located farther than the virial
radius from its closest neighbor, the probability for the galaxy to have an
early morphological type is an increasing function only of luminosity and the
local density due to the nearest neighbor ($\rho_n$). The tide produced by the
nearest neighbor is thought to be responsible for the morphology transformation
toward the early type at these separations. When the separation is less than
the virial radius, i.e. when $\rho_n > \rho_{\rm virial}$, its morphology
depends also on the neighbor's morphology and the large-scale background
density over a few Mpc scales ($\rho_{20}$) in addition to luminosity and
$\rho_n$. The early type probability keeps increasing as $\rho_n$ increases if
its neighbor is an early type. But the probability decreases as $\rho_n$
increases when the neighbor is a late type. The cold gas streaming from the
late type neighbor can be the reason for the morphology transformation toward
late type. The overall early-type fraction increases as $\rho_{20}$ increases
when $\rho_n > \rho_{\rm virial}$. This can be attributed to the hot halo gas
of the neighbor which is confined by the pressure of the ambient medium held by
the background mass. We have also found that galaxy luminosity depends on
$\rho_n$, and that the isolated bright galaxies are more likely to be recent
merger products. We propose a scenario that a series of morphology and
luminosity transformation occur through distant interactions and mergers, which
results in the morphology--luminosity--local density relation.

  Methods. Observation triggered soon after the SN 2004dt discovery allowed us

days) after the B band maximum. Observations carried out on an almost daily
basis allowed us a good sampling of the fast spectroscopic evolution of SN
2004dt in the early stages. To obtain this result, low-resolution, long-slit
spectroscopy was obtained using a number of facilities.
  Results. This supernova, which in some absorption lines of its early spectra
showed the highest degree of polarization ever measured in any SN Ia, has a
complex velocity structure in the outer layers of its ejecta. Unburnt oxygen is
present, moving at velocities as high as ~16,700 km/s, with some
intermediate-mass elements (Mg, Si, Ca) moving equally fast. Modeling of the
spectra based on standard density profiles of the ejecta fails to reproduce the
observed features, whereas enhancing the density of outer layers significantly
improves the fit. Our analysis indicates the presence of clumps of
high-velocity, intermediate-mass elements in the outermost layers, which is
also suggested by the spectropolarimetric data.

and output flux from a spectrometer is accurate determination of the
spectrophotometric calibration. In the case of spectrometers onboard
satellites, the accuracy of this part of the calibration pedigree is ultimately
linked to the accuracy of the set of reference SEDs that the spectrophotometric
calibration is built on. In this paper, we deal with the spectrophotometric
calibration of infrared (IR) spectrometers onboard satellites in the 2 to 200
micron range. We aim at comparing the different reference SEDs used for the IR
spectrophotometric calibration. The emphasis is on the reference SEDs of
stellar standards with spectral type later than A0, with special focus on the
theoretical model atmosphere spectra. Using the MARCS model atmosphere code,
spectral reference SEDs were constructed for a set of IR stellar standards (A
dwarfs, solar analogs, G9-M0 giants). A detailed error analysis was performed
to estimate proper uncertainties on the predicted flux values. It is shown that
the uncertainty on the predicted fluxes can be as high as 10%, but in case
high-resolution observational optical or near-IR data are available, and IR
excess can be excluded, the uncertainty on medium-resolution SEDs can be
reduced to 1-2% in the near-IR, to ~3% in the mid-IR, and to ~5% in the far-IR.
Moreover, it is argued that theoretical stellar atmosphere spectra are at the
moment the best representations for the IR fluxes of cool stellar standards.
When aiming at a determination of the spectrophotometric calibration of IR
spectrometers better than 3%, effort should be put into constructing an
appropriate set of stellar reference SEDs based on theoretical atmosphere
spectra for some 15 standard stars with spectral types between A0V and M0III.

vector has high information content, is not sensitive against B-mode
contamination and only shows small correlation between data points of different
angular scales. We show that a data vector of the two-point correlation
function (2PCF) in general contains more information on cosmological parameters
compared to a data vector of the aperture mass dispersion. Reason for this is
the fact that <M_ap^2> lacks the information of the convergence power spectrum
(P_\kappa) on large angular scales, which is contained in the 2PCF data vector.
Therefore we create a combined data vector N, which retains the advantages of
<M_ap^2> and in addition is also sensitive to the large-scale information of
P_\kappa. We compare the information content of the three data vectors by
performing a detailed likelihood analysis and use ray-tracing simulations to
derive the covariance matrices. In the last part of the paper we contaminate
all data vectors with B-modes on small angular scales and examine their
robustness against this contamination.The combined data vector strongly
improves constraints on cosmological parameters compared to <M_ap^2>. Although,
in case of a pure E-mode signal the information content of the 2PCF is higher,
in the more realistic case where B-modes are present the 2PCF data vector is
strongly contaminated and yields biased cosmological parameter estimates. N
shows to be robust against this contamination. Furthermore the individual data
points of N show a much smaller correlation compared to the 2PCF leading to an
almost diagonal covariance matrix.

introduce a systematic perturbation expansion in which the counterterms
automatically turn out to be consistent with the boundary conditions. This will
inevitably lead to nontrivial position dependence for physical quantities, as a
manifestation of the breaking of the translational invariance. This is in
contrast to the usual usage of the counterterms in problems with nontrivial
boundary conditions, which are either completely derived from the free cases or
at most supplemented with the addition of counterterms only at the boundaries.
Our results for the massive and massless cases are different from those

have been established for $\alpha$-mixing spatial processes by extending the
theory of the backfitting procedure to the spatial case. This facilitates the
confidence intervals for the component functions, although the asymptotic

reported. Applications to real data illustrate that the improvement in

the dust component, is not easily separable from the cosmological or
extragalactic component. In this paper, some doubts will be raised concerning
the validity of the methods used to date to remove Galactic dust emission in
order to show that none of them achieves its goal.
  First, I review the recent bibliography on the topic and discuss critically
the methods of foreground subtraction: the cross-correlation with templates,
analysis assuming the spectral shape of the Galactic components, the ""maximum
entropy method"", ""internal linear combination"", and ""wavelet-based high
resolution fitting of internal templates"". Second, I analyse the galactic
latitude dependence from WMAP data. The frequency dependence is discussed with
the data in the available literature. The result is that all methods of
subtracting the Galactic contamination are inaccurate. The galactic latitude
dependence analysis or the frequency dependence of the anisotropies in the
range 50-250 GHz put a constraint on the maximum Galactic contribution in the
power spectrum to be less than a ~10% (68% C. L.) for a ~1 degree scale, and
possibly higher for larger scales.
  The origin of most of the signal in the CMBR anisotropies is not Galactic. In
any case, the subtraction of the Galaxy is not accurate enough to allow a
""precision Cosmology""; other sources of contamination (extragalactic, solar
system) are also present.

with the S294 region is ~ 2.3 arcmin. We found an anomalous reddening law for
the dust inside the cluster region and the ratio of total-to-selective
extinction is found to be 3.8+-0.1. We estimate the minimum reddening E (B-V) =
1.35 mag and distance of 4.8+-0.2 kpc to the region from optical CC and CM
diagrams. We identified the ionizing source of the HII region, and spectral
type estimates are consistent with a star of spectral type ~ B0 V. The 2MASS
JHKs images reveal a partially embedded cluster associated with the ionizing
source along with a small cluster towards the eastern border of S294. The
ionization front seen along the direction of small cluster in radio continuum
and Halpha images, might be due to the interaction of ionizing sources with the
nearby molecular cloud. We found an arc shaped diffuse molecular hydrogen
emission at 2.12 micron and a half ring of MSX dust emission which surrounds
the ionized gas in the direction of the ionization front. Self consistent
radiative transfer model of mid- to far-infrared continuum emission detected
near small cluster is in good agreement with the observed spectral energy
distribution of a B1.5 ZAMS star. The morphological correlation between the
ionised and molecular gas, along with probable time scale involved between the

defined by the radio lobes. For TNJ0205+2242, the Ly-alpha profile narrows
significantly outside the jet radius, indicating the presence of a quiescent
halo. TNJ0121+1320 has two components separated by ~10 kpc and a velocity
offset of ~300 km s^-1. If motions are gravitational, this implies a dynamical
mass of 2x10^11 M_sun for the more massive, radio-loud component. The dynamical
mass, molecular gas mass measured from the CO line emission, and radio
luminosity of these two compact radio galaxies imply that compact radio sources
may well develop large-scale, energetic outflows as observed in extended radio
galaxies, with the potential of removing significant fractions of the ISM from
the host galaxy. The absence of luminous emission line gas extending beyond the
radio emission in these sources agrees with the observed timescales and outflow
rates in extended radio galaxies, and adds further evidence that the energetic,
large-scale outflows observed in extended radio sources (Nesvadba et al. 2006)
are indeed the result of influence of the radio jet.

constructing a locally asymptotically normal (LAN) family of probability

asymptotic variance within the LAN family. The solution of this minimization

given by a tilting formula. The implementation of the tilting formula is
facilitated by solving a Poisson equation. A few numerical examples are given

the LCDM model, especially at the latest stages of reionization, due to the
higher recombination efficiency. As a consequence, the bubbles' `epoch of

with a multimodal distribution of behavior. This can be interpreted as a
coexistence of different social norms, a result that goes beyond previous
investigations. The model is discrete in time and space, behavior is
characterized in a continuous state space. The adaptation of social behavior by
each agent is based on attractive and repulsive forces caused by friendly and
adversary relations among agents. The model is analyzed both analytically and
by means of spatio-temporal computer simulations. It provides conditions under
which we find convergence towards a single norm, coexistence of two opposing
norms, and coexistence of a multitude of norms. For the latter case, we also
show the evolution of the spatio-temporal distribution of behavior.

the evolution of several chemical elements, we compare our theoretical results
with accurate and new stellar data of neutron capture elements and we are able
to impose strong constraints on the nucleosynthesis of the studied elements. We
can suggest the stellar sites of production for each element. In particular,
the r-process component of each element (if any) is produced in the mass range
from 10 to 30 Msun, whereas the s-process component arises from stars in the
range from 1 to 3 Msun. Using the same chemical evolution model, extended to
different galactocentric distances, we obtain results on the radial gradients
of the Milky Way. We compare the results of the model not only for the neutron
capture elements but also for alpha-elements and iron peak elements with new
data of Cepheids stars. We give a possible explanation to the considerable
scatter of neutron capture elements observed in low metallicity stars in the
solar vicinity, compared to the small star to star scatter observed for the
alpha-elements. In fact, we have developed a stochastic chemical evolution
model, in which the main assumption is a random formation of new stars, subject
to the condition that the cumulative mass distribution follows a given initial
mass function. With our model we are able to reproduce the different features
of neutron capture elements and alpha-elements. Finally, we test the
prescriptions for neutron capture elements also for the dwarf spheroidal
galaxies of the Local Group. We predict that the chemical evolution of these
elements in dwarf spheroidal galaxies is different from the evolution in the
solar vicinity and indicates that dwarf spheroidal galaxies (we see nowadays)
cannot be the building blocks of our Galaxy.

efficiency is related to the prediction power of future price change using the
indices of twenty seven stock markets. Efficiency refers to weak-form efficient
market hypothesis (EMH) in terms of the information of past price changes. The
prediction power corresponds to the hit-rate, which is the rate of the
consistency between the direction of actual price change and that of predicted
one, calculated by the nearest neighbor prediction method (NN method) using the
out-of-sample. In this manuscript, the Hurst exponent and the approximate
entropy (ApEn) are used as the quantitative measurements of the degree of
efficiency. The relationship between the Hurst exponent, reflecting the various
time correlation property, and the ApEn value, reflecting the randomness in the
time series, shows negative correlation. However, the average prediction power
on the direction of future price change has the strongly positive correlation
with the Hurst exponent, and the negative correlation with the ApEn. Therefore,
the market index with less market efficiency has higher prediction power for
future price change than one with higher market efficiency when we analyze the
market using the past price change pattern. Furthermore, we show that the Hurst
exponent, a measurement of the long-term memory property, provides more
significant information in terms of prediction of future price changes than the
ApEn and the NN method.

(marginal) distribution and transition function denoted by $\pi$ and $Q$, say
$S_n=g(W_1)+...+g(W_n)$, where $g$ is square integrable and has mean 0 with
respect to $\pi$. If $S_n$ has the form $S_n=M_n+R_n$, where $M_n$ is a square
integrable martingale with stationary increments and $E(R_n^2)=o(n)$, then $g$
is said to admit a martingale approximation. Necessary and sufficient
conditions for such an approximation are developed. Two obvious necessary
conditions are $E[E(S_n|W_1)^2]=o(n)$ and $\lim_{n\to

g\Vert^2_+=\limsup_{n\to \infty}E(S_n^2)/n$; then $\Vert\cdot\Vert_+$ defines a
pseudo norm on the subspace of $L^2(\pi)$ where it is finite. In one main
result, a simple necessary and sufficient condition for a martingale
approximation is developed in terms of $\Vert\cdot\Vert_+$. Let $Q^*$ denote
the adjoint operator to $Q$, regarded as a linear operator from $L^2(\pi)$ into
itself, and consider co-isometries ($QQ^*=I$), an important special case that
includes shift processes. In another main result a convenient orthonormal basis
for $L_0^2(\pi)$ is identified along with a simple necessary and sufficient
condition for the existence of a martingale approximation in terms of the
coefficients of the expansion of $g$ with respect to this basis.

Such strategy also dispenses with the interaction with an ancilla system in the
implementation. We also show that classical communications are indispensable in
realizing the deterministic transformations of a single bipartite entangled
state. With a finite number of identical pairs of two entangled bosons, on the
other hand, we can realize the deterministic transformation to any target
entangled state of equal or less Schmidt rank through an extension of the

circumstellar dust around 48 young stars in the $\rho$ Ophiuchus dark clouds.
Supplemented with previous 1.3 mm observations of an additional 99 objects from
the literature, the statistical distributions of disk masses and submillimeter
colors are calculated and compared to those in the Taurus-Auriga region. These
basic submillimeter properties of young stellar objects in both environments
are shown to be essentially identical. As with their Taurus counterparts, the
$\rho$ Oph circumstellar dust properties are shown to evolve along an empirical
evolution sequence based on the infrared spectral energy distribution. The
combined $\rho$ Oph and Taurus Class II samples (173 sources) are used to set
benchmark values for basic outer disk characteristics: M_disk ~ 0.005 solar
masses, M_disk/M_star ~ 1%, and $\alpha$ ~ 2 (where $F_{\nu} \propto
\nu^{\alpha}$ between 350 microns and 1.3 mm). The precision of these numbers
are addressed in the context of substantial solid particle growth in the
earliest stages of the planet formation process. There is some circumstantial
evidence that disk masses inferred from submillimeter emission may be
under-estimated by up to an order of magnitude.
