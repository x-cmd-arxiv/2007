on the minimum distance of expander codes. Furthermore, Tanner's
parity-oriented eigenvalue lower bound on the minimum distance is generalized
to yield a new lower bound on the minimum pseudocodeword weight. These bounds
are useful in predicting the performance of LDPC codes under graph-based
iterative decoding and linear programming decoding.

derive a covariant general formalism of inertial forces in General Relativity.
Inspired by the works of Abramowicz et. al. (see e.g. Abramowicz and Lasota,
Class. Quantum Grav. 14 (1997) A23), we also study conformal rescalings of
spacetime and investigate how these affect the inertial force formalism. While
many ways of describing spatial curvature of a trajectory has been discussed in
papers prior to this, one particular prescription (which differs from the
standard projected curvature when the reference is shearing) appears novel. For
the particular case of a hypersurface-forming congruence, using a suitable
rescaling of spacetime, we show that a geodesic photon is always following a
line that is spatially straight with respect to the new curvature measure. This
fact is intimately connected to Fermat's principle, and allows for a certain
generalization of the optical geometry as will be further pursued in a
companion paper (Jonsson and Westman, Class. Quantum Grav. 23 (2006) 61). For
the particular case when the shear-tensor vanishes, we present the inertial
force equation in three-dimensional form (using the bold face vector notation),
and note how similar it is to its Newtonian counterpart. From the spatial
curvature measures that we introduce, we derive corresponding covariant
differentiations of a vector defined along a spacetime trajectory. This allows
us to connect the formalism of this paper to that of Jantzen et. al. (see e.g.
Bini et. al., Int. J. Mod. Phys. D 6 (1997) 143).

Galactic plane (l=298.756deg, b=-0.408deg) and we aimed to determine its
physical parameters and to investigate its high-mass stellar content and
especially WR stars. Our analysis is based on SOFI/NTT JsHKs imaging and low
resolution (R~2000) spectroscopy of the brightest cluster members in the K
atmospheric window. For the age determination we applied isochrone fits for MS
and Pre-MS stars. We derived stellar parameters of the WR stars candidates
using a full nonLTE modeling of the observed spectra. Using a variety of
techniques we found that G30 is very young cluster, with age t~4Myr. The
cluster is located in Carina spiral arm, it is deeply embedded in dust and
suffers reddening of Av~10.5+-1.1mag. The distance to the object is
d=7.2+-0.9kpc. The mass of the cluster members down to 2.35Msol is ~1600Msol.
Cluster's MF for the mass range of 5.6 to 31.6Msol shows a slope of
Gamma=-1.01+-0.03. The total mass of the cluster obtained by this MF down to
1Msol is about 3x10^3Msol. The spectral analysis and the models allow us to
conclude that in G30 are at least one Ofpe/WN and two WR stars. The WR stars
are of WN6-7 hydrogen rich type with progenitor masses more than 60Msol. G30 is
a new member of the exquisite family of young Galactic clusters, hosting WR
stars. It is a factor of two to three less massive than some of the youngest
super-massive star clusters like Arches, Quintuplet and Central cluster and is
their smaller analog.

processivity by the telomerase. In the model, the processive nucleotide
addition is implemented on the basis of two requirements: One is that stem IV
loop stimulates the chemical reaction of nucleotide incorporation, and the
other one is the existence of an ssRNA-binding site adjacent to the polymerase
site that has a high affinity for the unpaired base of the template. The
unpairing of DNA:RNA hybrid after the incorporation of the nucleotide paired
with the last base on the template, which is the prerequisite for repeat
addition processivity, is caused by a force acting on the primer. The force is
resulted from the unfolding of stem III pseudoknot that is induced by the
swinging of stem IV loop towards the nucleotide-bound polymerase site. Based on
the model, the dynamics of processive nucleotide and repeat additions by
Tetrahymena telomerase are quantitatively studied, which give good explanations
to the previous experimental results. Moreover, some predictions are presented.
In particular, it is predicted that the repeat addition processivity is mainly
determined by the difference between the free energy required to disrupt the
DNA:RNA hybrid and that required to unfold the stem III pseudoknot, with the
large difference corresponding to a low repeat addition processivity while the
small one corresponding to a high repeat addition processivity.

as mixed equations of elliptic-hyperbolic type, free boundary problems, and
corner singularity where an elliptic degenerate curve meets a free boundary. In
this paper we develop a rigorous mathematical approach to overcome these
difficulties involved and establish a global theory of existence and stability
for shock reflection by large-angle wedges for potential flow. The techniques
and ideas developed here will be useful for other nonlinear problems involving
similar difficulties.

the quantization of energy levels, and confirmed quantum mechanical predictions
for the average size of the two lowest energy states wave functions.
Improvements in position-like measurements can increase the accuracy by an
order of magnitude only. We therefore develop another approach, consisting in
accurate measurements of the energy levels. The GRANIT experiment is devoted to
the study of resonant transitions between quantum states induced by an
oscillating perturbation.
  According to Heisenberg's uncertainty relations, the accuracy of measurement
of the energy levels is limited by the time available to perform the
transitions. Thus, trapping quantum states will be necessary, and each source
of losses has to be controlled in order to maximize the lifetime of the states.
We discuss the general principles of transitions between quantum states, and
consider the main systematical losses of neutrons in a trap.

$D$ to $H$ if $uv\in A(D)$ implies $f(u)f(v)\in A(H).$ For a fixed digraph $H$,
the homomorphism problem is to decide whether an input digraph $D$ admits a
homomorphism to $H$ or not, and is denoted as HOMP($H$). Digraphs are allowed
to have loops, but not allowed to have parallel arcs.
  A natural optimization version of the homomorphism problem is defined as
follows. If each vertex $u \in V(D)$ is associated with costs $c_i(u), i \in
V(H)$, then the cost of the homomorphism $f$ is $\sum_{u\in V(D)}c_{f(u)}(u)$.
For each fixed digraph $H$, we have the {\em minimum cost homomorphism problem

graph $D$ with costs $c_i(u),$ $u \in V(D), i\in V(H)$, whether there exists a
homomorphism of $D$ to $H$ and, if one exists, to find one of minimum cost.
  In a recent paper, we posed a problem of characterizing polynomial time
solvable and NP-hard cases of the minimum cost homomorphism problem for acyclic
multipartite tournaments with possible loops (w.p.l.). In this paper, we solve
the problem for reflexive multipartite tournaments and demonstrate a
considerate difficulty of the problem for the whole class of multipartite
tournaments w.p.l. using, as an example, acyclic 3-partite tournaments of order
4 w.p.l.\footnote{This paper was submitted to Discrete Mathematics on April 6,

  An optimization version of the homomorphism problem was motivated by a

\cite{gutinDAM154a}. If each vertex $u \in V(D)$ is associated with costs

  Although a complete dichotomy classification of the complexity of MinHOM($H$)
for a digraph $H$ remains an unsolved problem, complete dichotomy
classifications for MinHOM($H$) were proved when $H$ is a semicomplete digraph
\cite{gutinDAM154b}, and a semicomplete multipartite digraph \cite{gutinDAM}.
In these studies, it is assumed that the digraph $H$ is loopless. In this
paper, we present a full dichotomy classification for semicomplete digraphs
with possible loops, which solves a problem in \cite{gutinRMS}.\footnote{This

that the V4+ S = 1/2 spins condense into S = 1 triplet dimers below the

dimers into a global singlet state is observed at 2.5 K, with no long range

a subtle lattice anomaly evidences a spin-lattice coupling in the triplet dimer

plane and proved the existence and uniqueness of zone diagrams there. In the
present paper we generalize this concept in various ways. We consider general
sites in m-spaces (a simple generalization of metric spaces) and prove several
existence and (non)uniqueness results in this setting. In contrast to previous
works, our (rather simple) proofs are based on purely order theoretic
arguments. Many explicit examples are given, and some of them illustrate new
