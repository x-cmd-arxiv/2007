extra dimensions and a flat metric in d_0 dimensions, endowed with a warp
factor e^{2\gamma} depending on the distance l from the string center. All
possible regular solutions to the field equations are classified by the
behavior of the warp factor and the extra-dimensional circular radius r(l).
Solutions with r\to \infty and r\to \const >0 as l\to \infty are interpreted in
terms of thick brane world models. Solutions with r \to 0 as l \to l_c > 0,
i.e., those with a second center, are interpreted as either multi-brane systems
(which is appropriate for large enough distances l_c between the centers) or as
Kaluza-Klein type configurations with extra dimensions invisible due to their
smallness. For the case of the Mexican-hat symmetry breaking potential, we
build a full map of regular solutions on the (\epsilon,\Gamma) parameter plane,
where \epsilon acts as an effective cosmological constant while \Gamma
characterizes the strength of gravity. The trapping properties of candidate
brane worlds for test scalar fields are discussed. Good trapping properties for
massive fields are found for models with growing warp factors. Kaluza-Klein
type models are shown to possess nontrivial warp factor behaviors, leading to
matter particle mass spectra which seem promising from the standpoint of
hierarchy problems.

of vortices in a background shearing Keplerian flow. We make use of
high-resolution global two-dimensional compressible hydrodynamic simulations.
We introduce the concept of nonlinear adjustment to describe the transition of
unbalanced vortical fields to a long-lived configuration. We discuss the
conditions under which vortical perturbations evolve into long-lived persistent
structures and we describe the properties of these equilibrium vortices. The
properties of equilibrium vortices appear to be independent from the initial
conditions and depend only on the local disk parameters. In particular we find
that the ratio of the vortex size to the local disk scale height increases with
the decrease of the sound speed, reaching values well above the unity. The
process of spiral density wave generation by the vortex, discussed in our
previous work, appear to maintain its efficiency also at nonlinear amplitudes
and we observe the formation of spiral shocks attached to the vortex. The
shocks may have important consequences on the long term vortex evolution and
possibly on the global disk dynamics. Our study strengthens the arguments in
favor of anticyclonic vortices as the candidates for the promotion of planetary
formation. Hydrodynamic shocks that are an intrinsic property of persistent
vortices in compressible Keplerian flows are an important contributor to the
overall balance. These shocks support vortices against viscous dissipation by
generating local potential vorticity and should be responsible for the eventual
fate of the persistent anticyclonic vortices. Numerical codes have be able to
resolve shock waves to describe the vortex dynamics correctly.

Cen, under the assumption that it is the remnant of an ancient dwarf spheroidal
galaxy (dSph), the bulk of which was disrupted and accreted by our Galaxy ~10
Gyr ago. We highlight the very different roles played by Type II and Type Ia
supernovae (SNe) in the chemical enrichment of the inner regions of the
putative parent dSph. While the SNe II pollute the interstellar medium rather
uniformly, the SNe Ia ejecta may remain confined inside dense pockets of gas as
long as succesive SNe II explosions spread them out. Stars forming in such
pockets have lower alpha-to-iron ratios than the stars forming elsewhere. Owing
to the inhomogeneous pollution by SNe Ia, the metal distribution of the stars
in the central region differs substantially from that of the main population of
the dwarf galaxy, and resembles that observed in Omega Cen. This inhomogeneous
mixing is also responsible for a radial segregation of iron-rich stars with
depleted [alpha/Fe] ratios, as observed in some dSphs. Assuming a star
formation history of ~1.5 Gyr, our model succeeds in reproducing both the iron
and calcium distributions observed in Omega Cen and the main features observed
in the empirical alpha/Fe versus Fe/H plane. Finally, our model reproduces the
overall spread of the color-magnitude diagram, but fails in reproducing the
morphology of the SGB-a and the double morphology of the main sequence.
However, the inhomogeneous pollution reduces (but does not eliminate) the need
for a significantly enhanced helium abundance to explain the anomalous position
of the blue main sequence. Further models taking into account the dynamical
interaction of the parent dwarf galaxy with the Milky Way and the effect of AGB
pollution will be required.

see deviations which we fit, and this allows us to control the systematic error
involved in extracting the tension. We compare the resulting string tensions
with Casimir scaling, which we find to be lower than our data by 1%-4%.
Extrapolating our results to N=oo we see that our data fits more naturally to
1/N rather than 1/N^2 corrections. Finally, we see that the full spectrum of

Additional information is provided by the afterglow lightcurve. The resolution
and wavelength range of the spectra and the bright afterglow facilitate a
detailed study and fitting of the absorption line systems in order to derive
column densities. We also use deep imaging to detect the host galaxy and probe
the nature of an intervening system at z = 1.48 seen in absorption in the
afterglow spectra. We detect four discrete velocity systems in the resonant
metal absorption lines, best explained by shells within and/or around the host
created by starburst winds. The fine-structure lines have no less than three
components with strengths decreasing from the redmost components. We therefore
suggest that the fine-structure lines are best explained to be produced by UV
pumping from which follows that the redmost component is the one closest to the
burst where also NV was detected. The host is detected in deep HST imaging with
F814W_AB = 27.48 +- 0.19 mag and a 3 sigma upper limit of H = 20.6 mag (Vega)

differential Hamiltonian H (a ""Laplacian"") with suitable conditions at
vertices. For the case of scale-invariant vertex conditions (i.e., conditions
that do not mix the values of functions and of their derivatives), the constant
term of the heat-kernel expansion is shown to be proportional to the trace of
the internal scattering matrix of the graph. This observation is placed into
the index-theory context by factoring the Laplacian into two first-order
operators, H =A*A, and relating the constant term to the index of A. An
independent consideration provides an index formula for any differential
operator on a finite quantum graph in terms of the vertex conditions. It is
found also that the algebraic multiplicity of 0 as a root of the secular
determinant of H is the sum of the nullities of A and A*.

The Mn$_{12}$ molecules are oriented such that the magnetic easy axis is normal
to the surface, and the terminating ligands in the Mn$_{12}$ are replaced by
thiol groups (-SH) where the H atoms are lost upon adsorption onto the surface.
This sulfur-terminated Mn$_{12}$ molecule has a total magnetic moment of 18
$\mu_B$ in the ground state, in contrast to 20$\mu_B$ for the standard
Mn$_{12}$. The Mn$_{12}$ molecular orbitals broaden due to the interaction of
the molecule with the gold surface and the broadening is of the order of 0.1
eV. It is an order of magnitude less than the single-electron charging energy
of the molecule so the molecule is weakly bonded to the surface. Only electrons
with majority spin can be transferred from the surface to the sulfur-terminated
Mn$_{12}$ since the gold Fermi level is well above the majority lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) but below the minority LUMO. The amount of
the charge transfer is calculated to be 1.23 electrons, dominated by the tail
in the electronic distribution of the gold surface. A calculation of level
shift upon charging provides 0.28 electrons being transferred. The majority of
the charge transfer occurs at the S, C, and O atoms close to the surface. The
total magnetic moment also changes from 18 $\mu_B$ to 20 $\mu_B$, due to
rearrangements of the magnetic moments on the S and Mn atoms upon adsorption
onto the surface. The magnetic anisotropy barrier is computed including
spin-orbit interaction self-consistently in density-functional theory. The
barrier for the Mn$_{12}$ on the gold surface decreases by 6 K in comparison to

structures capable of hosting Population III star formation. The calculations
include self-consistent multifrequency conservative transfer of UV photons
together with nine-species primordial chemistry and all relevant radiative
processes. The ultimate fates of these halos varies with central density and
proximity to the central source but generally fall into one of four categories.
Diffuse halos with central densities below 2 - 3 cm$^{-3}$ are completely
ionized and evaporated by the central star anywhere in the cluster. More
evolved halo cores at densities above 2000 cm$^{-3}$ are impervious to both
ionizing and Lyman-Werner flux at most distances from the star and collapse of
their cores proceeds without delay. Radiative feedback in halos of intermediate
density can be either positive or negative, depending on how the I-front
remnant shock both compresses and deforms the core and enriches it with H$_2$.
We find that the 120 M$_\odot$ star photodissociates H$_2$ in most halos within
the cluster but that catalysis by H- rapidly restores molecular hydrogen within
a few hundred Kyr after the death of the star, with little delay in star
formation. Our models exhibit significant departures from previous
one-dimensional spherically-symmetric simulations, which are prone to serious
errors due to unphysical geometric focusing effects.

effect ct of damping the flow speed along the tube. Stability of geodesic flows
in the Riemannian twisted thin tubes (almost filaments), against constant

simulations in one-dimensional spherical geometry, including radiative cooling

SN-driven bubble. We find the size and mass of the SN-driven bubble shell
depend on the structure of the pre-existing wind bubble as well as the SN
explosion energy E_{SN} (= N_{SN} 10^{51} ergs). The hot cavity inside the
bubble is 2-3 times bigger in volume and hotter than that of a bubble created
by SNe exploded in a uniform interstellar medium (ISM). For an association with
10 massive stars in the average ISM, the SN-driven shell has an outer radius of
R_{ss} ~ (85 pc) N_{SN}^{0.1} and a mass of M_{ss} ~ (10^{4.8} Msun)
N_{SN}^{0.3}at 10^6 years after the explosion. By that time most of the
explosion energy is lost via radiative cooling, while ~10% remains as kinetic
energy and ~10% as thermal energy. We also calculate the total integrated
spectrum of diffuse radiation emitted by the shock-heated gas of the SN bubble.
For the models with 0.1 solar metalicity, the radiative energy loss is smaller
and the fraction of non-ionizing photons is larger, compared to those with
solar metalicity. We conclude the photoionization/heating by diffuse radiation
is the most dominant form of feedback from SN explosions into the surrounding

The article is a summary of our experience and ends with a request for
suggestions to improve the circuit without losing its simplicity.

"0708.3598","Hans-Christian Herbig","Hans-Christian Herbig","Variations on Homological Reduction","Ph.D. thesis, December 2006, german abstract",,,,"math.QA math-ph math.MP",,"  In this paper, we are concerned with the BFV-reduction of first class
constraints in classsical Hamiltonian mechanics and deformation quantization.
As a result, we obtain continuous star products for certain singular reduced
symplectic quotients. We relate the notion of ""irreducibility"" of a constraint
to the notion of complete intersection used in commutative algebra. We
generalize the classical BFV construction to the case of projective Tate
generators using a super-Poisson bracket discovered by M. Rothstein. We also
discuss the problem of infinite reducibility. Several examples are elaborated
on.
