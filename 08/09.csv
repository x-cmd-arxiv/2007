consider the case when non-maximally entangled two-qubit pure states are shared
by neighboring nodes of the network. For a given pair of nodes, we investigate
how to generate the maximal entanglement between them by performing local
measurements, assisted by classical communication, on the other nodes. We find
optimal measurement protocols for both small and large 1D networks. Quite
surprisingly, we prove that Bell measurements are not always the optimal ones
to perform in such networks. We generalize then the results to simple small 2D
networks, finding again counter-intuitive optimal measurement strategies.
Finally, we consider large networks with hierarchical lattice geometries and 2D
networks. We prove that perfect entanglement can be established on large
distances with probability one in a finite number of steps, provided the
initial entanglement shared by neighboring nodes is large enough. We discuss
also various protocols of entanglement distribution in 2D networks employing
classical and quantum percolation strategies.

  From the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR4 spectroscopic sample, we selected 83
occulting galaxy pairs and measured disk opacity over the redshift range z =
0.0-0.2 with the goal to determine the recent evolution of disk dust opacity.
The enrichment of the ISM changes over the lifetime of a disk and it is
reasonable to expect the dust extinction properties of spiral disks as a whole
to change over their lifetime. When they do, the change will affect our
measurements of galaxies over the observable universe.
  From the SDSS pairs we conclude that spiral disks show evidence of extinction
to ~2 effective radii. However, no evidence for recent evolution of disk
opacity is evident, due to the limited redshift range and our inability to
distinguish other factors on disk opacity such as the presence of spiral arms
and Hubble type. Such effects also mask any relation between surface brightness
and optical depth that has been found in nearby galaxies. Hence, we conclude
that the SDSS spectral catalog is an excellent way to find occulting pairs and
construct a uniform local sample. However, higher resolution than the SDSS
images is needed to disentangle the effects of spiral arms and Hubble type from
evolution since z = 0.2.

low temperature T (5-50 K), $\sigma^A_{xy}$ is T-independent, consistent with
the Berry-phase/Karplus-Luttinger theory. Above 50 K, we extract an inelastic
AHE conductivity $\sigma^{in}_{xy}$ that scales as the square of $\Delta\rho$

clarifies the T dependence and sign-reversal of the AHE coefficient R_s(T). We
discuss the possible ubiquity of $\sigma^{in}_{xy}$ in ferromagnets, and ideas
for interpreting its scaling with $(\Delta\rho)^2$. Measurements of the
magnetoresistance (MR) reveal a rich pattern of behavior vs. T and field
tilt-angle. We show that the 2 mechanisms, the anisotropic MR effect and

propagating in a periodic and nonlinear medium at Bragg resonance are governed
by the nonlinear coupled mode equations (NLCME). This system of PDEs, similar
in structure to the Dirac equations, has gap soliton solutions that travel at
any speed between 0 and the speed of light. A recently considered strategy for
spatial trapping or capture of gap optical soliton light pulses is based on the
appropriate design of localized defects in the periodic structure. Localized
defects in the periodic structure give rise to defect modes, which persist as
{\it nonlinear defect modes} as the amplitude is increased. Soliton trapping is
the transfer of incoming soliton energy to {\it nonlinear} defect modes. To
serve as targets for such energy transfer, nonlinear defect modes must be
stable. We therefore investigate the stability of nonlinear defect modes.
Resonance among discrete localized modes and radiation modes plays a role in
the mechanism for stability and instability, in a manner analogous to the
nonlinear Schr\""odinger / Gross-Pitaevskii (NLS/GP) equation. However, the
nature of instabilities and how energy is exchanged among modes is considerably
more complicated than for NLS/GP due, in part, to a continuous spectrum of
radiation modes which is unbounded above and below. In this paper we (a)
establish the instability of branches of nonlinear defect states which, for
vanishing amplitude, have a linearization with eigenvalue embedded within the
continuous spectrum, (b) numerically compute, using Evans function, the
linearized spectrum of nonlinear defect states of an interesting multiparameter
family of defects, and (c) perform direct time-dependent numerical simulations
in which we observe the exchange of energy among discrete and continuum modes.

multipoles, the mean angular power spectrum of string-induced CMB temperature
anisotropies can be described by a power law slowly decaying as \ell^{-p}, with
p=0.889 (+0.001,-0.090) (including only systematic errors). Such a behavior
suggests that a nonvanishing string contribution to the overall CMB
anisotropies may become the dominant source of fluctuations at small angular

disappear only in the limit of ordinary General Relativity, where an accidental
redundancy ensures that the na\""ive Palatini works there. We outline the
correct decoupling limits and the strong coupling regimes. As a corollary we
find that the so-called `Modified Source Gravity' models suffer from strong

  Knapen, T. J. Mahoney, and A. Vazdekis (eds)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The combination of a finite time-scale for star formation, rapid early
stellar evolution and rapid stellar-dynamical processes imply that the stellar
IMF cannot be inferred for any star cluster independently of its age (the
Cluster IMF Theorem). The IMF can nevertheless be constrained statistically by
evolving many theoretical populations drawn from one parent distribution and
testing these against observed populations. It follows that all known
well-resolved stellar populations are consistent with having been drawn from
the same parent mass distribution. The IMF Universality Hypothesis therefore
cannot be discarded despite the existence of the Cluster IMF Theorem. This
means that the currently existing star-formation theory fails to describe the
stellar outcome, because it predicts a dependency of the IMF on the physical
boundary conditions not observed. The IGIMF Theorem, however, predicts a
variation of galaxy-wide IMFs in dependence of the galaxy's star-formation rate
even if the IMF Universality Hypothesis is valid. This variation has now been
observed in SDSS galaxy data. Detailed analysis of the binary properties in the
very-low-mass star and brown dwarf (BD) mass regime on the one hand, and in the
stellar regime on the other, shows there to be a discontinuity in the IMF near
0.1Msun such that BDs follow a separate distribution function. Very recent
observations of the stellar population within 1pc of the nucleus of the MW do
suggest a top-heavy IMF, perhaps hinting at a variation of the star-formation
outcome with tidal field and temperature thereby violating the IMF Universality
Hypothesis under these physically extreme conditions. Another violation of this
hypothesis appears to emerge for extremely metal-poor stars such that the
primordial IMF appears to have been depleted in low-mass stars.

reduced contamination from non-GCs. For the spiral galaxies analyzed for the

convolved with an accurate representation of the uv coverage of MERLIN. The

fitting models to the observed light curve. This allows direct comparison of

cases. It is widely understood that degenerate categories give rise to monoids,
doubly degenerate bicategories to commutative monoids, and degenerate
bicategories to monoidal categories; however, to understand this correspondence
fully we examine the totalities of such structures together with maps between
them and higher maps between those. Categories naturally form a 2-category
{\bfseries Cat} so we take the full sub-2-category of this whose 0-cells are
the degenerate categories. Monoids naturally form a category, but we regard
this as a discrete 2-category to make the comparison. We show that this
construction does not yield a biequivalence; to get an equivalence we ignore
the natural transformations and consider only the {\it category} of degenerate
categories. A similar situation occurs for degenerate bicategories. The
tricategory of such does not yield an equivalence with monoidal categories; we
must consider only the categories of such structures. For doubly degenerate
bicategories the tricategory of such is not naturally triequivalent to the
category of commutative monoids (regarded as a tricategory). However in this
case considering just the categories does not give an equivalence either; to
get an equivalence we consider the {\it bicategory} of doubly degenerate
bicategories. We conclude with a hypothesis about how the above cases might
generalise for n-fold degenerate n-categories.

exploiting cooperative diversity in wireless networks. In this paper, two
asynchronous cooperative diversity schemes are proposed, namely, distributed
delay diversity and asynchronous space-time coded cooperative diversity
schemes. In terms of the overall diversity-multiplexing (DM) tradeoff function,
we show that the proposed independent coding based distributed delay diversity
and asynchronous space-time coded cooperative diversity schemes achieve the
same performance as the synchronous space-time coded approach which requires an
accurate symbol-level timing synchronization to ensure signals arriving at the
destination from different relay nodes are perfectly synchronized. This
demonstrates diversity order is maintained even at the presence of asynchronism
between relay node. Moreover, when all relay nodes succeed in decoding the
source information, the asynchronous space-time coded approach is capable of
achieving better DM-tradeoff than synchronous schemes and performs equivalently
to transmitting information through a parallel fading channel as far as the
DM-tradeoff is concerned. Our results suggest the benefits of fully exploiting
the space-time degrees of freedom in multiple antenna systems by employing
asynchronous space-time codes even in a frequency flat fading channel. In
addition, it is shown asynchronous space-time coded systems are able to achieve
higher mutual information than synchronous space-time coded systems for any

expectation values for physical observables in the Casimir effect is based on
using the Abel-Plana summation formula. This enables to derive the renormalized
quantities in a manifestly cutoff independent way and to present them in the
form of strongly convergent integrals. However, applications of the Abel-Plana
formula, in its usual form, are restricted by simple geometries when the
eigenmodes have a simple dependence on quantum numbers. The author generalized
the Abel-Plana formula which essentially enlarges its application range. Based
on this generalization, formulae have been obtained for various types of series
over the zeros of combinations of Bessel functions and for integrals involving
these functions. It has been shown that these results generalize the special
cases existing in literature. Further, the derived summation formulae have been
used to summarize series arising in the direct mode summation approach to the
Casimir effect for spherically and cylindrically symmetric boundaries, for
boundaries moving with uniform proper acceleration, and in various braneworld
scenarios. This allows to extract from the vacuum expectation values of local
physical observables the parts corresponding to the geometry without boundaries
and to present the boundary-induced parts in terms of integrals strongly
convergent for the points away from the boundaries. As a result, the
renormalization procedure for these observables is reduced to the corresponding
procedure for bulks without boundaries. The present paper reviews these
results. We also aim to collect the results on vacuum expectation values for
local physical observables such as the field square and the energy-momentum
tensor in manifolds with boundaries for various bulk and boundary geometries.

  version","Phys.Rev.D76:104043,2007","10.1103/PhysRevD.76.104043",,"astro-ph",,"  We develop a parameterized post-Friedmann (PPF) framework which describes
three regimes of modified gravity models that accelerate the expansion without
dark energy. On large scales, the evolution of scalar metric and density
perturbations must be compatible with the expansion history defined by distance
measures. On intermediate scales in the linear regime, they form a
scalar-tensor theory with a modified Poisson equation. On small scales in dark
matter halos such as our own galaxy, modifications must be suppressed in order
to satisfy stringent local tests of general relativity. We describe these
regimes with three free functions and two parameters: the relationship between
the two metric fluctuations, the large and intermediate scale relationships to
density fluctuations and the two scales of the transitions between the regimes.
We also clarify the formal equivalence of modified gravity and generalized dark
energy. The PPF description of linear fluctuation in f(R) modified action and
the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworld models show excellent agreement with
explicit calculations. Lacking cosmological simulations of these models, our
non-linear halo-model description remains an ansatz but one that enables
well-motivated consistency tests of general relativity. The required
suppression of modifications within dark matter halos suggests that the linear
and weakly non-linear regimes are better suited for making complementary test
of general relativity than the deeply non-linear regime.

CCD camera (XIS) and the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD), the AGN intrinsic nuclear
emission and its reprocessed signals were observed simultaneously. The
intrinsic emission is highly obscured with an absorbing column of $\sim 5
\times 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and was detectable only above $\sim 10$ keV. The
spectrum below 10 keV is dominated by reflection continuum and emission lines
from neutral/ionized material. Along with a neutral iron K$\alpha$ line, a
neutral iron K$\beta$ and a neutral nickel K$\alpha$ line were detected for the
first time from this source. The neutral lines and the cold reflection
continuum are consistent with both originating in the same location. The
Compton down-scattered shoulder in the neutral Fe-K$\alpha$ line is $\sim 10%$
in flux of the narrow core, which confirms that the line originates from
reflection rather than transmission. The weakness of the Compton shoulder also
indicates that the reflector is probably seen nearly edge-on. Flux of the
intrinsic emission varied by a factor of $\sim 2$ within $\sim 20$ ks, which
requires the obscuring material to be geometrically thin. Broadband spectral
modeling showed that the solid angle of the neutral reflector is less than a
few $\times 10^{-2} \times 2\pi$. All this evidence regarding the reprocessed
signals suggests that a disk-like absorber/reflector is viewed from a near
edge-on angle.

Localized Waves), a great deal of results has been published on this important
subject, from both the theoretical and the experimental point of view.
Initially, the theory was developed taking into account only free space;
however, in recent years, it has been extended for more complex media
exhibiting effects such as dispersion[5-7], nonlinearity[8], anisotropy[9] and
losses[10]. Such extensions have been carried out along with the development of
efficient methods for obtaining nondiffracting beams and pulses in the
subluminal, luminal and superluminal regimes[11-18]. This paper (partly a
review) addresses some theoretical methods related to nondiffracting solutions
of the linear wave equation in unbounded homogeneous media, as well as to some
interesting applications of such waves. In section II we analyze the general
structure of the Localized Waves, develop the so called Generalized
Bidirectional Decomposition, and use it to obtain several luminal and
superluminal (especially X-shaped) nondiffracting solutions of the wave
equation. In section III we develop a space-time focusing method by a
continuous superposition of X-Shaped pulses of different velocities. Section IV
addresses the properties of chirped optical X-Shaped pulses propagating in
material media without boundaries. Finally, in Section V, we show how a
suitable superposition of Bessel beams can be used to obtain stationary
localized wave fields, with a static envelope and a high transverse
localization, and whose longitudinal intensity pattern can assume any desired
shape within a chosen interval of the propagation axis.

respectively. We also find that the the average lens-source proper motion of

foreground absorption due to the pre-existing, ionized, warm, clumpy red giant

data on the radial-velocity variability of the anomalous yellow supergiant
QYSge. The strongest and most peculiar feature in its spectrum is the complex
profile of NaI D lines, which contains a narrow and a very wide emission
components. The wide emission component can be seen to extend from -170 to +120
km/s, and at its central part it is cut by an absorption feature, which, in
turn, is split into two subcomponents by a narrow (16km/s at r=2.5) emission
peak. An analysis of all the Vr values leads us to adopt for the star a
systemic velocity of Vr=-21.1 km/s, which corresponds to the position of the
narrow emission component of NaI. The locations of emission-line features of
NaI D lines are invariable, which point to their formation in regions that are
external to the supergiant's photosphere. Differential line shifts of about
10km/s are revealed. The absorption lines in the spectrum of QYSge have a
substantial width of FWHM~45 km/s. The method of model atmospheres is used to
determine the following parameters: Teff=6250K, lg g=2.0, and microturbulence
Vt=4.5km/s. The metallicity of the star is found to be somewhat higher than the
solar one with an average overabundance of iron-peak elements of [Met/H]=+0.20.
The star is found to be slightly overabundant in carbon and nitrogen,
[C/Fe]=+0.25, [N/Fe]=+0.27. The alpha-process elements Mg, Si, and Ca are
slightly overabundant [alpha/H]=+0.12. The strong sodium excess, [Na/Fe]=+0.75,
is likely to be due to the dredge-up of the matter processed in the NeNa cycle.
Heavy elements of the s-process are underabundant relative to the Sun. On the
whole, the observed properties of QYSge do not give grounds for including this
star into the group of RCrB or RVTau-type type objects.

arises in several important physical problems, especially in the study of
quantum field theory in an external background. While the mathematics of this
system is straightforward, several conceptual issues arise in such a study. We
present a general formalism to address some of the conceptual issues like the
emergence of classicality, definition of particle content, back reaction etc.
In particular, we parametrize the wave function in terms of a complex number
(which we call excitation parameter) and express all physically relevant
quantities in terms it. Many of the notions -- like those of particle number
density, effective Lagrangian etc., which are usually defined using asymptotic
in-out states -- are generalized as time-dependent concepts and we show that
these generalized definitions lead to useful and reasonable results. Having
developed the general formalism we apply it to several examples. Exact analytic
expressions are found for a particular toy model and approximate analytic
solutions are obtained in the extreme cases of adiabatic and highly
non-adiabatic evolution. We then work out the exact results numerically for a
variety of models and compare them with the analytic results and
approximations. The formalism is useful in addressing the question of emergence
of classicality of the quantum state, its relation to particle production and
to clarify several conceptual issues related to this. In Paper II
(arXiv:0708.1237), which is a sequel to this, the formalism will be applied to
analyze the corresponding issues in the context of quantum field theory in
background cosmological models and electric fields.

(arXiv:0708.1233) to analyze the evolution of a quantized time-dependent
oscillator, to address several questions in the context of quantum field theory
in time dependent external backgrounds. In particular, we study the question of
emergence of classicality in terms of the phase space evolution and its
relation to particle production, and clarify some conceptual issues. We
consider a quantized scalar field evolving in a constant electric field and in
FRW spacetimes which illustrate the two extreme cases of late time adiabatic
and highly non-adiabatic evolution. Using the time-dependent generalizations of
various quantities like particle number density, effective Lagrangian etc.
introduced in Paper I, we contrast the evolution in these two limits bringing
out key differences between the Schwinger effect and evolution in the de Sitter
background. Further, our examples suggest that the notion of classicality is
multifaceted and any one single criterion may not have universal applicability.
For example, the peaking of the phase space Wigner distribution on the
classical trajectory \emph{alone} does not imply transition to classical
behavior. An analysis of the behavior of the \emph{classicality parameter},
which was introduced in Paper I, leads to the conclusion that strong particle
production is necessary for the quantum state to become highly correlated in
phase space at late times.

  the text",,,,"cs.LG",,"  Supervised learning deals with the inference of a distribution over an output
or label space $\CY$ conditioned on points in an observation space $\CX$, given
a training dataset $D$ of pairs in $\CX \times \CY$. However, in a lot of
applications of interest, acquisition of large amounts of observations is easy,
while the process of generating labels is time-consuming or costly. One way to
deal with this problem is {\em active} learning, where points to be labelled
are selected with the aim of creating a model with better performance than that
of an model trained on an equal number of randomly sampled points. In this
paper, we instead propose to deal with the labelling cost directly: The
learning goal is defined as the minimisation of a cost which is a function of
the expected model performance and the total cost of the labels used. This
allows the development of general strategies and specific algorithms for (a)
optimal stopping, where the expected cost dictates whether label acquisition
should continue (b) empirical evaluation, where the cost is used as a
performance metric for a given combination of inference, stopping and sampling
methods. Though the main focus of the paper is optimal stopping, we also aim to
provide the background for further developments and discussion in the related
field of active learning.

acceleration of pairs drives the two-stream instabilities between pairs and
protons, leading to the ``proton sedimentation'' in the accelerating pair
frame. Pairs are continuously shock heated by proton clumps, scattering the
thermal photons into the broken power-law shape, with the non-thermal energy
that is comparable to the proton kinetic energy, consistent with observations.
Pair photospheres become unstable around the radius of the progenitor star

excitation and damping of oscillations in groups of coronal loops rather than
in individual and isolated structures. We present results on the oscillatory
properties (periods, damping rates, and spatial distribution of perturbations)
for resonantly damped oscillations in a system of two inhomogeneous coronal
slabs and compare them to the properties found in single slab loop models. A
system of two identical coronal loops is modeled, in Cartesian geometry, as
being composed by two density enhancements. The linear magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) wave equations for oblique propagation of waves are solved and the
damping of the different solutions, due to the transversal inhomogeneity of the
density profile, is computed. The physics of the obtained results is analyzed
by an examination of the perturbed physical variables. We find that, due to the
interaction between the loops, the normal modes of oscillation present in a
single slab split into symmetric and antisymmetric oscillations when a system
of two identical slabs is considered. The frequencies of these solutions may
differ from the single slab results when the distance between the loops is of
the order of a few slab widths. Oblique propagation of waves weakens this
interaction, since solutions become more confined to the edges of the slabs.
The damping is strong for surface-like oscillations, while sausage body-like
solutions are unaffected. For some solutions, and small slab separations, the
damping in a system of two loops differs substantially from the damping of a
single loop.

narrowband spectral indices which rely on the variation of the strength of
molecular lines with spectral type and a comparison with other previously
classified young, low-mass objects in the Chamaeleon I star-forming region. We
have investigated and compared many different molecular indices and have

essentially independent of both reddening and nebular emission lines.
Confirmation of candidate young stars and brown dwarfs as bona fide cluster
members may be accomplished with moderate resolution spectra in the optical
region by an analysis of the strength of the gravity-sensitive Na doublet. It
has been established that this feature is much weaker in these very young
objects than in field dwarfs. A sodium spectral index is used to estimate the
surface gravity and to demonstrate quantitatively the difference between young
(1-2Myr) objects, and dwarf and giant field stars.

luminescence can be selectively obtained from either the nanowire or the
substrate. For one polarity of the applied voltage, ultraviolet (and visible)
light is generated in the GaN nanowire, while for the opposite polarity
infrared light is emitted from the Si substrate. We propose a model, which
explains the key features of the data, based on electron tunnelling from the
valence band of one semiconductor into the conduction band of the other

sufficient potential energy difference between the two semiconductors,
electrons can tunnel from the valence band of GaN into the Si conduction band.
This process results in the creation of holes in GaN, which can recombine with
conduction band electrons generating GaN band-to-band luminescence. A similar
process applies under the opposite polarity for Si light emission. This device
structure affords an additional experimental handle to the study of
electroluminescence in single nanowires and, furthermore, could be used as a
novel approach to two-colour light-emitting devices.

possible exception, all objects have low gravities, in line with young ages,

we model this using a neutral Compton reflection component, assumed to be
associated with distant, optically thick material such as the molecular torus.
Once this, and absorption by a zone of ionized gas in the line-of-sight is
accounted for, less than half of the sample observations show an acceptable
fit. Approximately 2/3 of the sample shows evidence for further, broadened
emission in the iron K-band. When modeled with a Gaussian, the inferred energy
is close to that expected for neutral iron, with a slight redshift, with an
average velocity width of ~0.1c. The mean parameters are consistent with
previous ASCA results and support the idea that the broad components can be
associated with the accretion disk. Before proceeding to that conclusion, we
test an alternative model comprising a blend of 3-4 narrow, unshifted emission
lines (including the 6.4 keV core), together with 1-2 zones of highly ionized
gas in the line-of-sight. Around 1/3 of the objects are not adequately fit by
this model, and in general better fits are obtained with a relativistic disk
line model, which has fewer free parameters. Nonetheless we find that
absorption by ionized gas affects the spectrum above 2.5 keV in approximately

underlying massless field theory that might be the origin of the Standard
Model. A color sextet quark sector - producing both electroweak symmetry
breaking and dark matter - is added to QCD to saturate asymptotic freedom. The
sextet sector is then embedded uniquely in ``QUD'' - an anomaly free, just
asymptotically free, massless SU(5) theory with elementary lepton and triplet
quark sectors very close to the Standard Model. A multi-regge bound-state
S-Matrix is constructed using infra-red divergent scaling reggeon interactions
that couple via massless fermion chiral anomalies. Within the QCD sub-sector
there is an ``anomalous wee gluon'' critical phenomenon that produces a
spectrum with confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. The exponentiation of
left-handed gauge boson divergences implies that the full set of composite
interactions and the low-mass spectrum of QUD could be just those of the
Standard Model. All particles, including neutrinos, appear as massive,
Goldstone boson related, bound-states and there is no Higgs field. The
different coupling strengths, multiple mass scales, and multigenerational
structure should also appear. The Critical Pomeron may be the S-Matrix
manifestation of the underlying fixed-point field theory.
  If QUD underlies the Standard Model as described, the sextet sector should
produce new, unmistakeable, large cross-sections at the LHC, for which the

energies of sqrt = 161-209 GeV with the OPAL detector at LEP, 11693 W-pair
candidate events are selected. These data are used to obtain measurements of
the W-pair production cross sections at 10 different centre-of-mass energies.
The ratio of the measured cross sections to the Standard Model expectation is
found to be: data/SM = 1.002 +- 0.011(stat.) +- 0.007(syst.) +- 0.005(theory),
where the uncertainties are statistical, experimental systematics and theory
systematics respectively. The data are used to determine the W boson branching
fractions, which are found to be consistent with lepton universality of the
charged current interaction. Assuming lepton universality, the branching ratio
to hadrons is determined to be 67.41 +- 0.37(stat.) +- 0.23(syst.)%, from which
the CKM matrix element Vcs is determined to be
0.96+-0.017(stat.)+-0.012(syst.).
  The differential cross section as a function of the W^- production angle is
measured for the qqev and qqmv final states. The results described in this
paper are consistent with the expectations from the Standard Model.

  ""Extragalactic Jets: Theory and Observation from Radio to Gamma Ray"" ASP
  Conference Series, T. A. Rector and D. S. De Young (eds.)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The complex X-ray morphology of the 300 kpc long X-ray jet in PKS1127-145
(z=1.18 quasar) is clearly discerned in a ~100 ksec Chandra observation. The
jet X-ray surface brightness gradually decreases by an order of magnitude going
out from the core. The X-ray spectrum of the inner jet is relatively flat with
alpha_X=0.66+/-0.15 and steep in the outer jet with alpha_X=1.0+/-0.2. The
X-ray and radio jet intensity profiles are strikingly different, with the radio
emission peaking strongly at the two outer knots while the X-ray emission is
strongest in the inner jet region. We discuss the constraints implied by these
data on the X-ray emission models and conclude that ``one-zone'' models fail
and that at least a two-component model is needed to explain the jet's
broadband emission. We propose that the X-ray emission originates in the jet
proper while the bulk of the radio emission comes from a surrounding jet
sheath. We also consider intermittent jet activity as a possible cause of the
observed jet morphology.

infinite at finite temperatures T for anisotropies -1 < Delta < 1.
Perturbations which break integrability, e.g. a next-nearest neighbor coupling
J', render the conductivity finite. We construct numerically a non-local
conserved operator J_parallel which is responsible for the finite spin Drude
weight of the integrable model and calculate its decay rate for small J'. This
allows us to obtain a lower bound for the spin conductivity sigma_s >= c(T) /
J'^2, where c(T) is finite for J' to 0. We discuss the implication of our
result for the general question how non-local conservation laws affect
transport properties.

surrounded by Bragg mirrors is studied, showing that the mirrors act to confine
the surface plasmons associated with the Extraordinary Optical Transmission
effect, forming a surface resonant cavity. The overall effect is increased
light transmission intensity by more than a factor of three beyond the already
enhanced transmission, independent of whether the Bragg mirrors are on the
input or the output side of the incident light. The geometry of the Bragg
mirror structures controls the enhancement, and can even reduce the
transmission in half. By varying these geometric parameters, we were able to
periodically modulate the transmission of light for specific wavelengths,
consistent with the propagation and interference of surface plasmon waves in a
resonant cavity. FDTD simulations and a wave propagation model verify this
effect.

the neutron-star X-ray binary SAX J1748.9--2021 in the globular cluster NGC
6440. The pulsations were seen during both 2001 and 2005 outbursts of the
source, but only intermittently, appearing and disappearing on timescales of
hundreds of seconds. We find a suggestive relation between the occurrence of
type-I X-ray bursts and the appearance of the pulsations but the relation is
not strict. This behavior is very similar to that of the intermittent accreting
millisecond X-ray pulsar HETE J1900.1--2455. The reason for the intermittence
of the pulsations remains unclear. However it is now evident that a strict
division between pulsating and non-pulsating does not exist. By studying the
Doppler shift of the pulsation frequency we determine an orbit with a period of
8.7 hrs and an projected semi major axis of 0.39 lightsec. The companion star
might be a main--sequence or a slightly evolved star with a mass of $\sim$1
$M_\odot$. Therefore, SAX J1748.9--2021 has a longer period and may have a more
massive companion star than all the other accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars
except for Aql X-1.
