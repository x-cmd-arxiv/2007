acid had no synergistic effect along with other COX inhibitors (SC-58125 and
indomethacin). The inhibition of IL-1beta-mediated PGE2 synthesis by ascorbic
acid was not due to the inhibition of the expression of COX-2 or microsomal
prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES-1). Rather, ascorbic acid dose-dependently
(0.1-100 microM) produced a significant reduction in IL-1beta-mediated
production of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha), a reliable
indicator of free radical formation, suggesting that the effects of ascorbic

of the neuronal redox status since COX activity is known to be enhanced by
oxidative stress. Our results provide in vitro evidence that the
neuroprotective effects of ascorbic acid may depend, at least in part, on its
ability to reduce neuronal COX-2 activity and PGE2 synthesis, owing to its
antioxidant properties. Further, these experiments suggest that a combination

rescued CA1 pyramidal neurons from ischemic death even when treatment was
delayed until 24 h after ischemia (34+/-9% protection). Neuroprotective effect
of nimesulide is still evident 30 days after the ischemic episode, providing
the first experimental evidence that cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors confer a
long-lasting neuroprotection. Oral administration of nimesulide was also able
to significantly reduce brain damage, suggesting that protective effects are
independent of the route of administration. The present study confirms the
ability of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors to reduce brain damage induced by
cerebral ischemia and indicates that nimesulide can provide protection when
administered for up to 24 h post-ischemia.

flavor changing neutral currents are acceptably small since they are
automatically suppressed by small Yukawa couplings. This is the case even

red HB clusters tend to have large eccentricities and inhabit the area
populated by dwarf spheroidal stars, favoring an extraGalactic origin. Old

have preferentially high eccentricities, again hinting at their extraGalactic
origin. We compare detailed abundances of a variety of elements between the
halo and all dwarf galaxies studied to date, including both dwarf spheroidals
and irregulars. The salient feature is that halo abundances are essentially
unique. In particular, the general alpha vs. [Fe/H] pattern of 12 of the 13
galaxies studied are similar to each other and very different from the Milky
Way. Sagittarius appears to be the only possible exception. It appears very
unlikely that a significant fraction of the metal-rich halo could have come
from disrupted dwarf galaxies of low mass. However, at least some of the
metal-poor halo may have come from typical dwarfs, and a portion of the
intermediate metallicity halo may have come from very massive systems. The
chemical differences between the dwarfs and the halo are due to a combination
of a low star formation efficiency and a high galactic wind efficiency in the
former. The formation problem may be solved if the majority of halo stars
formed within a few, very massive satellites accreted very early. However, any
such satellites must either be accreted MUCH earlier than postulated, before
the onset of SNe Ia , or star formation must be prevented to occur in them
until only shortly before they are accreted.

half power. However, the synchrotron efficiency varies widely from nearly unity
to one part in 10,000, such that relatively feeble radio source can have
quasar-like mechanical power. The synchrotron ages of cluster radio sources are

context of non-exponential discounting. This gives rise to time-inconsistency
of the decision-maker. If the decision-maker at time t=0 can commit his/her
successors, he/she can choose the policy that is optimal from his/her point of
view, and constrain the others to abide by it, although they do not see it as
optimal for them. If there is no commitment mechanism, one must seek a
subgame-perfect equilibrium strategy between the successive decision-makers. In
the line of the earlier work by Ekeland and Lazrak we give a precise definition
of equilibrium strategies in the context of the portfolio management problem,
with finite horizon, we characterize it by a system of partial differential
equations, and we show existence in the case when the utility is CRRA and the
terminal time T is small. We also investigate the infinite-horizon case and we
give two different explicit solutions in the case when the utility is CRRA (in
contrast with the case of exponential discount, where there is only one). Some
of our results are proved under the assumption that the discount function h(t)
is a linear combination of two exponentials, or is the product of an
exponential by a linear function.

whose set of axioms and original basic properties were given in [9]. Let
$$\A=(\A,{\Ah},c,(0,g,d),a,(1,l,r),{\Lh},{\Rh})$$ be an Ann-category. The
coherence theorem states that in the category $ \A$, any morphism built from
the above isomorphisms and the identification by composition and the two
operations $\tx$, $\ts$ only depends on its source and its target.
  The first coherence theorems were built for monoidal and symmetric monoidal
categories by Mac Lane [7]. After that, as shown in the References, there are
many results relating to the coherence problem for certain classes of
categories.
  For Ann-categories, applying Hoang Xuan Sinh's ideas used for Gr-categories
in [2], the proof of the coherence theorem is constructed by faithfully
``embedding'' each arbitrary Ann-category into a quite strict Ann-category.
Here, a {\it quite strict} Ann-categogy is an Ann-category whose all
constraints are strict, except for the commutativity and left distributivity
ones.

have triggered major advances in optical frequency metrology and precision
measurements and in applications such as broadband laser-based gas sensing8 and
molecular fingerprinting. Early work generated frequency combs by intra-cavity
phase modulation while to date frequency combs are generated utilizing the
comb-like mode structure of mode-locked lasers, whose repetition rate and
carrier envelope phase can be stabilized. Here, we report an entirely novel
approach in which equally spaced frequency markers are generated from a
continuous wave (CW) pump laser of a known frequency interacting with the modes
of a monolithic high-Q microresonator13 via the Kerr nonlinearity. The
intrinsically broadband nature of parametric gain enables the generation of

relying on any external spectral broadening. Optical-heterodyne-based

stars), their luminosities, the interstellar extinction, the mass-loss rate
distribution and the total mass-loss rate in the bulge. The MIR data of MSX
point sources have been combined with the NIR (J, H and Ks) data of 2MASS
survey. The cross-identification was restricted to Ks-band detected sources
with Ks <= 11 mag. However, for those bright MSX D-band sources ([D] < 4.0
mag), which do not satisfy this criteria, we have set no Ks-band magnitude cut
off. The relation between Mdot and (Ks-[15])0 was used to derive the mass-loss
rate of each MSX source in the bulge fields. Except for very few post-AGB
stars, PNe and OH/IR stars, a large fraction of the detected sources at 15
micron (MSX D-band) are AGB stars well above the RGB tip. A number of them show
an excess in ([A]-[D])0 and (Ks-[D])0 colours, characteristic of mass-loss.
These colours, especially (Ks-[D])0, enable estimation of the mass-loss rates
(Mdot) of the sources in the bulge fields which range from 10^{-7} to 10^{-4}

identification. Optical spectra, taken across five different, widely separated
nebula regions of the remnant as seen on the HAlpha images, show average ratios
of [NII]/HAlpha =2.42, [SII]/HAlpha = 2.10, and [SII] 6717/6731 = 1.23, as well
as strong [OI] 6300, 6364A and [OII] 3727A emission. These ratios are firmly
within those typical of SNRs. Here, we also present the radio-continuum
detection of the SNR at 20/13cm from observations with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA). Radio emission is also seen at 4850 MHz, in the PMN
survey (Griffith and Wright 1993) and at 843 MHz from the SUMSS survey (Bock,
Large and Sadler 1999). We estimate an angular diameter of ~30 arcmin and
obtain an average radio spectral index of alpha = -0.6 +- 0.1 which indicates
the non-thermal nature of G332.5-5.6. Fresh analysis of existing ROSAT X-ray
data in the vicinity also confirms the existence of the SNR. The distance to
G332.5-5.6 has been independently estimated by Reynoso and Green (2007) as 3.4
kpc based on measurements of the HI lambda21 cm line seen in absorption against
the continuum emission. Our cruder estimates via assumptions on the height of
the dust layer (3.1 kpc) and using the Sigma-D relation (4 kpc) are in good
agreement.

variable has an $\alpha$-stable law, for $0<\alpha<1$, and the other variable
has the law defined by polynomially tilting the density of an $\alpha$-stable
random variable by a factor $\theta>-\alpha$. When $\theta=0$, these variables
equate with the ratio investigated by Lamperti [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 88

variable arises in a variety of areas and gains importance from a close
connection to the stable laws. This rationale, and connection to the
$\operatorname {PD}(\alpha,\theta)$ distribution, motivates the investigations
of its generalizations which we refer to as Lamperti-type laws. We identify and
exploit links to random variables that commonly appear in a variety of
applications. Namely Linnik, generalized Pareto and $z$-distributions. In each
case we obtain new results that are of potential interest. As some highlights,
we then use these results to (i) obtain integral representations and other
identities for a class of generalized Mittag--Leffler functions, (ii) identify
explicitly the L\'{e}vy density of the semigroup of stable continuous state
branching processes (CSBP) and hence corresponding limiting distributions

EPPF can be represented as ratios of Fox-$H$ functions, and in the case of
rational $\alpha,$ Meijer-G functions. Furthermore the results show that the
resulting unconditional EPPF's, can be expressed in terms of H and G transforms
indexed by a function h. Hence when h is itself a H or G function the EPPF is
also an H or G function. An implication, in the case of rational $\alpha,$ is
that one can compute explicitly thousands of EPPF's derived from possibly
exotic special functions. This would also apply to all $\alpha$ except that
computations for general Fox functions are not yet available. However, moving
away from special functions, we demonstrate how results from probability theory
may be used to obtain calculations. We show that a forward recursion can be
applied that only requires calculation of the simplest components. Additionally
we identify general classes of EPPF's where explicit calculations can be
carried out using distribution theory.

phase of half-doped manganites are extracted from correlated ab initio

O-2$p_{\sigma}$ to Mn-3d charge transfer configurations. The model spectra of
both a purely magnetic non-symmetric Heisenberg Hamiltonian involving a
magnetic oxygen and two non-symmetric double exchange models are compared to
the \textit{ab initio} one. While a satisfactory agreement between the
Heisenberg spectrum and the calculated one is obtained, the best description is
provided by a double exchange model involving excited non-Hund atomic states.
This refined model not only perfectly reproduces the spectrum of the embedded
cluster in the crystal geometry, but also gives a full description of the local
double-well potential energy curve of the ground state (resulting from the
interaction of the charge localized electronic configurations) and the local
potential energy curves of all excited states ruled by the double exchange
mechanism.

stationary, reflection-symmetric, asymptotically flat solutions of Einstein
equations that have a non-Kerr (anomalous) higher-order multipole-moment

detectors should observe gravitational waves generated during inspirals of
compact objects into supermassive central bodies. If the central body deviates
from the Kerr metric, this will manifest itself in the emitted waves. Here, we
explore some of the features of orbits in non-Kerr spacetimes that might lead
to observable signatures. As a basis for this analysis, we use a family of
exact solutions proposed by Manko & Novikov which deviate from the Kerr metric
in the quadrupole and higher moments, but we also compare our results to other
work in the literature. We examine isolating integrals of the orbits and find
that the majority of geodesic orbits have an approximate fourth constant of the
motion (in addition to the energy, angular momentum and rest mass) and the
resulting orbits are tri-periodic to high precision. We also find that this
fourth integral can be lost for certain orbits in some oblately deformed
Manko-Novikov spacetimes. However, compact objects will probably not end up on
these chaotic orbits in nature. We compute the location of the innermost stable
circular orbit (ISCO) and find that the behavior of orbtis near the ISCO can be
qualitatively different depending on whether the ISCO is determined by the
onset of an instability in the radial or vertical direction. Finally, we
compute periapsis and orbital-plane precessions for nearly circular and nearly
equatorial orbits in both the strong and weak field, and discuss weak-field
precessions for eccentric equatorial orbits.
