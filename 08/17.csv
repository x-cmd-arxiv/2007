  classification problem","13p",,,,"q-bio.GN q-bio.BM q-bio.QM",,"  This work is concerned with the development of a well-founded, theoretically
justified, and least complicated metric for the classification of proteins with
reference to enzymes. As the signature of an enzyme family, a catalytic domain
is easily fingerprinted. Given that the classification problem has so far
seemed intractable, a classification schema derived from the catalytic domain
would be satisfying. Here I show that there exists a natural ab initio if
nonobvious basis to theorize that the catalytic domain of an enzyme is uniquely
informative about its regulation. This annotates its function. Based on this
hypothesis, a method that correctly classifies potassium ion channels into
their respective subfamilies is described. To put the principle on firmer
ground, extra validation was sought and obtained through co-evolutionary
analyses. The co-evolutionary analyses reveal a departure from the notion that
potassium ion channel proteins are functionally modular. This finding is
discussed in light of the prevailing notion of domain. These studies establish
that significant co-evolution of the catalytic domain of a gene with its
conjoint domain is a specialized, necessary process following fusion and
swapping events in evolution. Instances of this discovery are likely to be
found pervasive in protein science.

including cases where the atomic state is initially mixed and the atomic
transition is detuned from resonance. We then explore the effects of other
nearby modes by calculating the exact time evolution of entanglement in more
complex systems with two, three, and five field modes. For these cases we can
obtain exact solutions which include the strong coupling regimes. Finally, we
consider the entanglement of a two-level atom with the infinite collection of
modes present in the intracavity field of a Fabre-Perot cavity. In contrast to
the usual treatment of atom-field interactions with a continuum of modes using
the Born-Markov approximation, our treatment in all cases describes the full
non-Markovian dynamics of the atomic subsystem. Only when an analytic
expression for the infinite mode case is desired do we need to make a weak
coupling assumption which at long times approximates Markovian dynamics.

As an example of a consistent analysis of tensor perturbations in Fourth Order
Gravity, we apply the formalism to a simple background solution of R^n gravity.
We obtain the exact solutions of the perturbation equations for scales much
bigger than and smaller than the Hubble radius. It is shown that the evolution
of tensor modes is highly sensitive to the choice of n and an interesting new
feature arises. During the radiation dominated era, their exist a growing
tensor perturbation for nearly all choices of n. This occurs even when the
background model is undergoing accelerated expansion as opposed to the case of
General Relativity. Consequently, cosmological gravitational wave modes can in
principle provide a strong constraint on the theory of gravity independent of

(BJ), with a collimation factor >10,000, which impacted polar ejecta (PE) to
produce the ""Mystery Spot"" (MS), ~24 lt-d away. Other details of SN 1987A
suggest that it came from a merger of 2 stellar cores of a common envelope (CE)
binary, i.e. a ""double degenerate"" (DD) SN. Even having to penetrate the CE,
the BJ may have caused a long-soft (l)GRB upon hitting the PE, thus DD can
produce lGRBs. Because DD must be the dominant merger/SN mechanism in
elliptical galaxies (EGs), where only short, hard GRBs (sGRBs) have been
observed, DD without CE or PE must also produce sGRBs, and thus NS-NS mergers
may not make GRBs as we know them, and/or be as common as previously thought.
Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the non-core-collapsed globular clusters are also
99% DD-formed from WD-WD merger, consistent with their 2.10 ms minimum spin
period, the 2.14 ms signal seen from SN 1987A, and sGRBs offset from the
centers of EGs. The details of Ia's suggest that these are also DD, and the
total thermonuclear disruption paradigm is now in serious doubt as well, a
cause for concern in Ia Cosmology, because Ia's will appear to be Ic's when
viewed from their DD merger poles, given sufficient matter above that lost to
core-collapse. As a DD SN, 1987A appears to be the Rosetta Stone for 99% of
SNe, GRBs and MSPs, including all recent nearby SNe except SN 1986J, and the
more distant SN 2006gy. There is no need to invent exotica, such as

shape of the congressional districts should be of a simplest figure and we
apply a modified ""shortest split line algorithm"" where the factor of the same
population is considered only. The second standard is that the gerrymandering
should ensure the integrity of the current administrative area as the
convenience for management. Thus we combine the factor of the administrative
area with the first standard, and generate an improved model resulting in the
new diagram in which the perimeters of the districts are along the boundaries
of some current counties. Moreover, the gerrymandering should consider the
geographic features.The third standard is introduced to describe this
situation. Finally, it can be proved that the difference between the supporting
ratio of a certain party in each district and the average supporting ratio of
that particular party in the whole state obeys the Chi-square distribution
approximately. Consequently, we can obtain an archetypal formula to check
whether the gerrymandering we propose is fair.

the multiple access mode when the relay transmits. If the broadcast component
channel is physically degraded, the half-duplex relay channel will also be
referred to as physically degraded. The capacity of this degraded half-duplex
relay channel is examined. It is shown that the block Markov coding suggested
in the seminal paper by Cover and El Gamal can be modified to achieve capacity
for the degraded half-duplex relay channel. In the code construction, the
listen-transmit schedule of the relay is made to depend on the message to be

evolution. Specifically, it allows us to trace the long-term decline of
rotation and activity on the main-sequence. Here we present rotation periods
measured for five stars in Praesepe with masses of 0.1-0.5Ms -- the first
rotation periods for members of this cluster. Photometric periodicities were
found from two extensive monitoring campaigns, and are confirmed by multiple
independent test procedures. We attribute these variations to magnetic spots
co-rotating with the objects, thus indicating the rotation period. The five
periods, ranging from 5 to 84h, show a clear positive correlation with object
mass, a trend which has been reported previously in younger clusters. When
comparing with data for F-K stars in the coeval Hyades, we find a dramatic drop
in the periods at spectral type K8-M2 (corresponding to 0.4-0.6Ms). A
comparison with periods of VLM stars in younger clusters provides a constraint
on the spin-down timescale: We find that the exponential rotational braking
timescale is clearly longer than 200 Myr, most likely 400-800 Myr. These
results are not affected by the small sample size in the rotation periods. Both
findings, the steep drop in the period-mass relation and the long spin-down
timescale, indicate a substantial change in the angular momentum loss mechanism
for very low mass objects, possibly the breakdown of the solar-type (Skumanich)
rotational braking. While the physical origin for this behaviour is unclear, we
argue that parts of it might be explained by the disappearance of the radiative
core and the resulting breakdown of an interface-type dynamo in the VLM regime.
Rotational studies in this mass range hold great potential to probe magnetic
properties and interior structure of main-sequence stars.

more sensitive study of the properties of the X-ray gas. The X-ray emission
from Abell 13 is extended to the northwest of the X-ray peak and shows
substructure indicative of a recent merger event. The cluster X-ray emission is
centered on the bright galaxy H of Slee et al. 2001. We find no evidence for a
cooling flow in the cluster. A knot of excess X-ray emission is coincident with
the other bright elliptical galaxy F. This knot of emission has properties
similar to the enhanced emission associated with the large galaxies in the Coma
cluster.
  With these Chandra data we are able to compare the properties of the hot
X-ray gas with those of the radio relic from VLA data, to study the interaction
of the X-ray gas with the radio emitting electrons. Our results suggest that
the radio relic is associated with cooler gas in the cluster. We suggest two
explanations for the coincidence of the cooler gas and radio source. First, the
gas may have been uplifted by the radio relic from the cluster core.
Alternatively, the relic and cool gas may have been displaced from the central
galaxy during the cluster merger event.

In this paper we focus on the results of the WEBT campaign. The source
exhibited substantial variability of optical flux and spectral shape, with a
characteristic time scale of a few days. The variability patterns throughout
the optical BVRI bands were very closely correlated with each other. In
intriguing contrast to other (in particular, BL Lac type) blazars, we find a
lag of shorter- behind longer-wavelength variability throughout the RVB ranges,
with a time delay increasing with increasing frequency. Spectral hardening
during flares appears delayed with respect to a rising optical flux. This, in
combination with the very steep IR-optical continuum spectral index of ~ 1.5 -
2.0, may indicate a highly oblique magnetic field configuration near the base
of the jet. An alternative explanation through a slow (time scale of several
days) acceleration mechanism would require an unusually low magnetic field of <

presenting results in several major branches of source coding theory: lossless

universal lossy coding. The main conclusions demonstrate that there is a
significant rate savings when order is irrelevant. In particular, lossless
coding of n letters from a finite alphabet requires Theta(log n) bits and
universal lossless coding requires n + o(n) bits for many countable alphabet

converge for all random sequences, i.e. we give a partial negative answer to
the open problem. We also provide a positive answer for some non-universal

determining the physical properties of the high-transition temperature
(high-Tc) copper oxide superconductors, but their possible role in the electron
pairing for superconductivity remains an open question. The principal feature
of the spin fluctuations in optimally doped high-Tc superconductors is a well
defined magnetic resonance whose energy (Er) tracks Tc (as the composition is
varied) and whose intensity develops like an order parameter in the
superconducting state. We show that the suppression of superconductivity and
its associated condensation energy by a magnetic field in the electron-doped
high-Tc superconductor, Pr0.88LaCe0.12CuO4-d (Tc = 24 K), is accompanied by the
complete suppression of the resonance and the concomitant emergence of static
antiferromagnetic (AF) order. Our results demonstrate that the resonance is
intimately related to the superconducting condensation energy, and thus suggest
that it plays a role in the electron pairing and superconductivity.

explain the magnitude of the QPO frequency drift, which is otherwise

study the coupling between the bursting layer and the deep ocean. The coupling
turns out to be weak and only a small fraction of the surface-wave energy gets

spatial structure and clumping in the fast wind of the central star of the
H-rich planetary nebula NGC6543 (HD164963). Time-series data of the unsaturated
PV 1118, 1128 resonance line P Cygni profiles provide a very sensitive
diagnostic of variable wind conditions in the outflow. We report on the
discovery of episodic and recurrent optical depth enhancements in the PV
absorption troughs, with some evidence for a 0.17-day modulation time-scale.
SEI line-synthesis modelling is used to derive physical properties, including
the optical depth evolution of individual `events'. The characteristics of
these features are essentially identical to the `discrete absorption
components' (DACs) commonly seen in the UV lines of massive OB stars. We have
also employed the unified model atmosphere code CMFGEN to explore spectroscopic
signatures of clumping, and report in particular on the clear sensitivity of
the PV lines to the clump volume filling factor. The results presented here
have implications for the downward revision of mass-loss rates in PN central
stars. We conclude that the temporal structures seen in the PV lines of NGC6543
likely have a physical origin that is similar to that operating in massive,
luminous stars, and may be related to near-surface perturbations caused by
stellar pulsation and/or magnetic fields.

singularity. In this work we inquire on whether, in gravitational collapse,
spacetime can sustain singularity-free trapped surfaces, in the sense that such
a spacetime remains geodetically complete. As a test case, we consider a well
known solution of the Einstien Field Equations which is Schwarzschild-like at
large distances and consists of a fluid with a $p=-\rho $ equation of state
near $r=0$. By following both the expansion parameters $\theta ^{+}$ and
$\theta ^{-}$ across the horizon and into the black hole we find that both
$\theta ^{+}$ and $\theta ^{+}\theta ^{-}$ have turning points inside the
trapped region. Further, we find that deep inside the black hole there is a
region $0\leq r<r_{0}$ (that includes the black hole center) which is not
trapped. Thus the trapped region is bounded both from outside and inside. The
spacetime is geodetically complete, a result which violates a condition for
singularity formation. It is inferred that in general if gravitational collapse
were to proceed with a $p=-\rho $ fluid formation, the resulting black hole may
be singularity-free.

triple system where the LIRG phenomenon is dominated by the smallest of the

  One nucleus is a regular barred spiral with significant rotation, while
another is highly disturbed with a surface brightness distribution intermediate
to that of disk and bulge systems, and hints of remaining arm/bar structure. We
derive dynamical masses in the range 3-7x10^10 M_solar for both. The third
component appears to be a 1-2x10^10 M_solar mass irregular galaxy. The total
system exhibits HII galaxy-like optical line ratios and strengths, and no
evidence for AGN activity is found from optical or mid-infrared data. The star
formation rate is estimated to be 190 M_solar/yr. We search for SNe, super star
clusters, and detect 100-300 km/s outflowing gas from the Bird. Overall, the

formation peak - the strongest star formation does not come from the two major

  meeting, Athens, September 2007",,,,"hep-th",,"  The original formulation of the (weak) anthropic principle was prompted by a
question about objective time at a macroscopic level, namely the age of the
universe when ``anthropic'' observers such as ourselves would be most likely to
emerge. Theoretical interpretation of what one observes requires the theory to
indicate what is expected, which will commonly depend on where, and
particularly when, the observation can be expected to occur. In response to the
question of where and when, the original version of the anthropic principle
proposed an {it a priori} probability weighting proportional to the number of
``anthropic'' observers present. The present discussion takes up the question
of the time unit characterising the biological clock controlling our subjective
internal time, using a revised alternative to a line of argument due to Press,
who postulated that animal size is limited by the brittleness of bone. On the
basis of a static support condition depending on the tensile strength of flesh
rather than bone, it is reasoned here that our size should be subject to a
limit inversely proportional to the terrestrial gravitation field g, which is
itself found to be proportional (with a factor given by the 5/2 power of the
fine structure constant) to the gravitational coupling constant.This provides
an animal size limit that will in all cases be of the order of a thousandth of
the maximum mountain height, which will itself be of the order of a thousandth
of the planetary radius. The upshot, via the (strong) anthropic principle, is
that the need for brains, and therefore planets, that are large in terms of
baryon number may be what explains the weakness of gravity relative to
electromagnetism.

the nuclear recoils created in the scattering of low-energy neutrons with CF4

optical and radio luminosity of a point source at the centre of SN 1987A place
limits on the properties of a central neutron star. However, neither these nor

star (P >~ 100 ms) with a moderate surface dipole magnetic field in SN 1987A.
Galactic studies suggest that a significant fraction of pulsars are born with

squares of sequential prediction errors from the beginning, APE$_{\delta_n}$ is
obtained by summing these squared errors from stage $n\delta_n$, where $n$ is
the sample size and $1/n\leq \delta_n\leq 1-(1/n)$ may depend on $n$. Under
certain regularity conditions, an asymptotic expression is derived for the
mean-squared prediction error (MSPE) of an AR predictor with order determined
by APE$_{\delta_n}$. This expression shows that the prediction performance of
APE$_{\delta_n}$ can vary dramatically depending on the choice of $\delta_n$.
Another interesting finding is that when $\delta_n$ approaches 1 at a certain
rate, APE$_{\delta_n}$ can achieve asymptotic efficiency in most practical
situations. An asymptotic equivalence between APE$_{\delta_n}$ and an
information criterion with a suitable penalty term is also established from the
MSPE point of view. This offers new perspectives for understanding the
information and prediction-based model selection criteria. Finally, we provide
the first asymptotic efficiency result for the case when the underlying
AR($\infty$) model is allowed to degenerate to a finite autoregression.

cluster (cluster 10) and its environment near the centre of the dwarf irregular
starburst galaxy NGC 1569. This forms part of a larger and on-going study of
the formation and collimation mechanisms of galactic winds, including three
additional IFU pointings in NGC 1569 covering the base of the galactic wind
which are analysed in a companion paper. The good spatial- and
spectral-resolution of these GMOS/IFU observations, covering 4740-6860 A, allow
us to probe the interactions between clusters and their environments on small
scales. Combining our GMOS spectrum with HST imaging, we find that cluster 10
is composed of two very close components with ages of 5-7 Myr and <5 Myr, and a
combined mass of 7 +/- 5 x 10^3 Msun.
  A detailed analysis of the H_alpha emission line profile shapes across the
whole field-of-view shows them to be composed of a bright narrow feature
(intrinsic FWHM ~ 50 km/s) superimposed on a fainter broad component (FWHM <
300 km/s). By mapping the properties of each individual component, we
investigate the small-scale structure and properties of the ionized ISM,
including reddening, excitation and electron densities, and for the first time
find spatial correlations between the line component properties. We discuss in
detail the possible mechanisms that could give rise to the two components and
these correlations, and conclude that the most likely explanation for the broad
emission is that it is produced in a turbulent mixing layer on the surface of
the cool gas clumps embedded within the hot, fast-flowing cluster winds. We
conclude we are sampling well within the outer bounding shocks of the expanding
superbubbles and within the outflow 'energy injection zone'.

zeros corresponding to the missing edges of $G$. The parameter space for the
scale parameter of ${\mathcal{N}}_G$ is the cone $Q_G$, dual to $P_G$, of
incomplete matrices with submatrices corresponding to the cliques of $G$ being
positive definite. In this paper we construct on the cones $Q_G$ and $P_G$ two
families of Wishart distributions, namely the Type I and Type II Wisharts. They
can be viewed as generalizations of the hyper Wishart and the inverse of the
hyper inverse Wishart as defined by Dawid and Lauritzen [Ann. Statist. 21
(1993) 1272--1317]. We show that the Type I and II Wisharts have properties
similar to those of the hyper and hyper inverse Wishart. Indeed, the inverse of
the Type II Wishart forms a conjugate family of priors for the covariance
parameter of the graphical Gaussian model and is strong directed hyper Markov
for every direction given to the graph by a perfect order of its cliques, while
the Type I Wishart is weak hyper Markov. Moreover, the inverse Type II Wishart
as a conjugate family presents the advantage of having a multidimensional shape
parameter, thus offering flexibility for the choice of a prior.

gravity of our Earth. This may provide a nice pedagogical tool for elementary

whose radio spectrum is that of an optically thick stellar wind. On average the

in the diffuse ISM by CMB anisotropy experiments. The 5--31 GHz spectral
indices are consistent with both flat spectra and spinning dust emissivities,

detailed study of the objects with the largest cm-excess, including the low
