observables r and Omega_gw(f). Here r is the tensor-to-scalar ratio,
constrained by cosmic-microwave-background (CMB) experiments; and Omega_gw(f)
is the energy spectrum of primordial gravitational-waves, constrained e.g. by
pulsar-timing measurements, laser-interferometer experiments, and Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Differentiating the master equation yields a new
expression for the tilt d(ln Omega_gw(f))/d(ln f). The relationship between r
and Omega_gw(f) depends sensitively on the uncertain physics of the early
universe, and we show that this uncertainty may be encapsulated (in a
model-independent way) by two quantities: w_hat(f) and nt_hat(f), where
nt_hat(f) is a certain logarithmic average over nt(k) (the primordial tensor
spectral index); and w_hat(f) is a certain logarithmic average over w_tilde(a)
(the effective equation-of-state in the early universe, after horizon
re-entry). Here the effective equation-of-state parameter w_tilde(a) is a
combination of the ordinary equation-of-state parameter w(a) and the bulk
viscosity zeta(a). Thus, by comparing constraints on r and Omega_gw(f), one can
obtain (remarkably tight) constraints in the [w_hat(f), nt_hat(f)] plane. In
particular, this is the best way to constrain (or detect) the presence of a
``stiff'' energy component (with w > 1/3) in the early universe, prior to BBN.
Finally, although most of our analysis does not assume inflation, we point out
that if CMB experiments detect a non-zero value for r, then we will immediately
obtain (as a free by-product) a new upper bound w_hat < 0.55 on the
logarithmically averaged effective equation-of-state parameter during the
``primordial dark age'' between the end of inflation and the start of BBN.

Concurrence minima also occur and are controlled by entangled resonance

binary pairs with a circumbinary disk around the B component. Recent work by
Boden and collaborators using infrared interferometry and radial velocity data
resulted in a determination of the physical orbit for HD 98800 B. We use the
resulting inclination of the binary and the measured extinction toward the B
component stars to constrain the distribution of circumbinary material.
Although a standard optically and geometrically thick disk model can reproduce
the spectral energy distribution, it can not account for the observed
extinction if the binary and the disk are co-planar. We next constructed a
dynamical model to investigate the influence of the A component, which is not
in the Ba-Bb orbital plane, on the B disk. We find that these interactions have
a substantial impact on the inclination of the B circumbinary disk with respect
to the Ba-Bb orbital plane. The resulting warp would be sufficient to place
material into the line of sight and the non-coplanar disk orientation may also
cause the upper layers of the disk to intersect the line of sight if the disk
is geometrically thick. These simulations also support that the dynamics of the
Ba-Bb orbit clear the inner region to a radius of ~3 AU. We then discuss
whether the somewhat unusual properties of the HD 98800 B disk are consistent
with material remnant from the star formation process or with more recent
creation by collisions from larger bodies.

1616 ONC sources detected in the ``Chandra Orion Ultra-deep Project'' 850 ksec
observation. We employed a binning-free maximum likelihood method to segment
the light-curves into intervals of constants signal and identified flares on
the basis of both the amplitude and the time-derivative of the source
luminosity. We then derived and compared the flare frequency and energy
distribution of CygOB2 and ONC sources. The effect of the length of the
observation on these results was investigated by repeating the statistical
analysis on five 100 ksec-long segments extracted from the ONC data. Results:
We detected 147 and 954 flares from the CygOB2 and ONC sources, respectively.
The flares in CygOB2 have decay times ranging from ~0.5 to about 10 hours. The
flare energy distributions of all considered flare samples are described at
high energies well by a power law with index alpha=-(2.1+-0.1). At low
energies, the distributions flatten, probably because of detection
incompleteness. We derived average flare frequencies as a function of flare
energy. The flare frequency is seen to depend on the source's intrinsic X-ray
luminosity, but its determination is affected by the length of the observation.
The slope of the high-energy tail of the energy distribution is, however,
affected little. A comparison of CygOB2 and ONC sources, accounting for
observational biases, shows that the two populations, known to have similar
X-ray emission levels, have very similar flare activity.

ejection, one of the very first such events observed in a low-mass source. Also
in component A, a marginal detection of 0.7 cm emission associated with the

imply that Ab is a relatively extended dusty structure, where grain coagulation
may already have taken place. With an angular size increasing with frequency,

of protein concentrations among its nodes, and the average binding strength.
Our primary conclusion is that, on average, the effects of a perturbation are
strongly localized and exponentially decay with the network distance away from
the perturbed node, which explains why, despite globally connected topology,
individual functional modules in such networks are able to operate fairly
independently. We also found that under specific favorable conditions, realized
in a significant number of paths in the yeast network, concentration
perturbations can selectively propagate over considerable network distances (up
to four steps). Such ""action-at-a-distance"" requires high concentrations of

ionization front instabilities in the galaxy today that are responsible for a
variety of phenomena in the interstellar medium, from the morphologies of
nebulae to triggered star formation in molecular clouds. An important question
in early reionization and chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium is
whether such instabilities arose in the H II regions of the first stars and
primeval galaxies, which were devoid of metals. We present three-dimensional
numerical simulations that reveal both shadow and thin-shell instabilities
readily formed in primordial gas. We find that the hard UV spectra of
Population III stars broadened primordial ionization fronts, causing H2
formation capable of inciting violent thin- shell instabilities in D-type
fronts, even in the presence of intense Lyman-Werner flux. The high post- front
gas temperatures associated with He ionization sustained and exacerbated shadow
instabilities, unaided by molecular hydrogen cooling. Our models indicate that
metals eclipsed H2 cooling in I-front instabilities at modest concentrations,
from 0.001- 0.01 solar. We conclude that ionization front instabilities were
prominent in the H II regions of the first stars and galaxies, influencing the
escape of ionizing radiation and metals into the early universe.

source of much debate. In this review, we discuss two key physical ingredients
that are required in order for reliable quantitative models of the UV output of
stellar populations to be computed, namely, the mass loss rates of red giant
branch stars and the helium enrichment ""law"" at high metallicities. In
particular, the recent evidence pointing towards a strong enhancement in the
abundances of the alpha-elements in the Galactic bulge (compared to the disk),
and also the available indications of a similar overabundance in (massive)
elliptical galaxies, strongly suggest that the helium abundance Y may be higher
in ellipticals and bulges than it is in spiral disks by an amount that may
reach up to 0.15 at [Fe/H] ~ +0.5. If so, this would strongly favor the
production of hot HB stars at high metallicity in galactic spheroids. We also
discuss the existence of mass loss recipes beyond the commonly adopted Reimers
""law"" that are not only more consistent with the available empirical data, but
also much more favorable to the production of extended HB stars at high
metallicity. Finally, we discuss new empirical evidence that suggests that
different evolutionary channels may be responsible for the production of EHB
stars in the field and in clusters.

coefficients at a given energy and voltage in a self-consistent manner, as well
as the corresponding current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. This scheme has
advantages because it is applicable to large systems, easily transportable to
different types of quantum chemistry packages, and extendable to describe
time-dependent phenomena or inelastic scatterings. It has been applied to
diverse types of practical electronic devices such as carbon nanotubes,
graphene nano-ribbons, metallic nanowires, and molecular electronic devices.

inversely proportional to torsion, it has the effect of causing a damping in

that Cartan torsion induces shear viscous asymmetric stresses in the fluid,

in 5 large solar flares selected for spectral hardening in the course of the
event. The X-ray bremsstrahlung emission from non-thermal electrons is
characterized by two spectroscopically distinct phases: impulsive and gradual.
The impulsive phase usually consists of several emission spikes following a
soft-hard-soft spectral pattern, whereas the gradual stage manifests itself as
spectral hardening while the flux slowly decreases. Both the soft-hard-soft
(impulsive) phase and the hardening (gradual) phase are well described by
piecewise linear dependence of the photon spectral index on the logarithm of
the hard X-ray flux. The different linear parts of this relation correspond to
different rise and decay phases of emission spikes. The temporal evolution of
the spectra is compared with the configuration and motion of the hard X-ray
sources in RHESSI images. These observations reveal that the two stages of
electron acceleration causing these two different behaviors are closely related
in space and time. The transition between the impulsive and gradual phase is
found to be smooth and progressive rather than abrupt. This suggests that they
arise because of a slow change in a common accelerator rather than being caused
by two independent and distinct acceleration processes. We propose that the
hardening during the decay phase is caused by continuing particle acceleration
with longer trapping in the accelerator before escape.

investigated for a wide range of coverages and adsorption sites. The fcc and
tetra-II sites (see the text for definition) are found to be energetically
preferred for the on-surface and subsurface adsorption, respectively, in the
whole range of coverage considered. The on-surface and subsurface oxygen
binding energies monotonically increase with the coverage, and the latter is
always higher than the former, thus indicating the tendency to the formation of
oxygen islands (clusters) and the higher stability of subsurface adsorption.
The on-surface and subsurface diffusion-path energetics of atomic oxygen, and
the activation barriers for the O penetration from the on-surface to the
subsurface sites are presented at low and high coverages. In particular, it is
shown that the penetration barrier from the on-surface hcp to the subsurface
tetra-I site is as small as 65 meV at low coverage ($\Theta $=0.25). The other
properties of the O/Pb(111) system, including the charge distribution, the
lattice relaxation, the work function, and the electronic density of states,

beginning with a collapse of a superficial layer of the quark star. This layer
of material turns equivalently to viscous fluid at first, the viscosity of
which helps deplete the energy released from both the accumulated elastic

glitch. Numerical calculations show that the observed slow glitches could be

curves and in the astrometric microlensing centroid shift trajectories. As
expected, the light curve deviation increases as the shear increases and the
impact parameter decreases. Although the light curve in the presence of a small
shear is similar to the simple Paczynski curve with a slightly smaller impact
parameter, the detailed difference between the light curve with and without
shear reflects the direction and the magnitude of the shear. The centroid shift
trajectory also deviates from a simple ellipse in the presence of shear. The
distortion of the centroid shift trajectory increases as the impact parameter
decreases, and the shape of the trajectory becomes complicated when the impact
parameter becomes small enough. The magnitude of the maximum distortion depends
on the magnitude and the direction of the shear. For a source trajectory in a
given direction, the time of the maximum distortion depends mostly on the
impact parameter and hardly on the shear. It is possible to determine the
magnitude of the shear and its direction if both the time and the magnitude of
the maximum astrometric distortion are measured. The magnitude of the shear
produced by the Galactic bulge or a globular cluster falls in the range
10^{-6}--10^{-4} in normalized units. Although the actual determination of the
shear from the Galactic sub-structures will not be easy due to complications
such as binary companion, future large scale microlensing experiments may
enable us to determine the shear in some high amplification events, leading

formula is discussed. It is concluded that new measurements of radiative heat
transfer are required to find out the adequate description of a metal in the
theory of electromagnetic fluctuations.

  paradox in general relativity","14 pages, 21 figures","Am.J.Phys.74:905-916,2006","10.1119/1.2198880",,"gr-qc",,"  As the velocity of a rocket in a circular orbit near a black hole increases,
the outwardly directed rocket thrust must increase to keep the rocket in its
orbit. This feature might appear paradoxical from a Newtonian viewpoint, but we
show that it follows naturally from the equivalence principle together with
special relativity and a few general features of black holes. We also derive a
general relativistic formalism of inertial forces for reference frames with
acceleration and rotation. The resulting equation relates the real experienced
forces to the time derivative of the speed and the spatial curvature of the
particle trajectory relative to the reference frame. We show that an observer
who follows the path taken by a free (geodesic) photon will experience a force
perpendicular to the direction of motion that is independent of the observers
velocity. We apply our approach to resolve the submarine paradox, which regards
whether a submerged submarine in a balanced state of rest will sink or float
when given a horizontal velocity if we take relativistic effects into account.
We extend earlier treatments of this topic to include spherical oceans and show
that for the case of the Earth the submarine floats upward if we take the
curvature of the ocean into account.

will precess as it is moved along a curved path relative to an inertial frame
S. We explain this effect, which is known as Thomas precession, by considering
a real grid that moves along with the gyroscope, and that by definition is not
rotating as observed from its own momentary inertial rest frame. From the basic
properties of the Lorentz transformation we deduce how the form and rotation of
the grid (and hence the gyroscope) will evolve relative to S. As an
intermediate step we consider how the grid would appear if it were not length
contracted along the direction of motion. We show that the uncontracted grid
obeys a simple law of rotation. This law simplifies the analysis of spin
precession compared to more traditional approaches based on Fermi transport. We
also consider gyroscope precession relative to an accelerated reference frame
and show that there are extra precession effects that can be explained in a way
analogous to the Thomas precession. Although fully relativistically correct,
the entire analysis is carried out using three-vectors. By using the
equivalence principle the formalism can also be applied to static spacetimes in
general relativity. As an example, we calculate the precession of a gyroscope
orbiting a static black hole. In an addendum the general reasoning is extended
to include also rotating reference frames.
