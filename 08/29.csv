for generic inhomogeneity profiles, and our numerical computations further
verify it up to redshifts z~2. At higher redshifts, the method breaks down due
to its inability to capture the time evolution of the inhomogeneities. We also
demonstrate that the running smoothing scale R(z) can mimic acceleration,
suggesting it could be at least as important as the backreaction in explaining
dark energy as an inhomogeneity induced illusion.

stellar atmospheres, especially in metal-poor stars, where convective motions
penetrate to higher atmospheric levels. Such asymmetries are usually neglected
in abundance analyses. The determination of the 6Li/7Li isotopic ratio is prone
to suffering from such asymmetries, as the contribution of 6Li is a slight
blending reinforcement of the red wing of each component of the corresponding
7Li line, with respect to its blue wing. Aims: The present paper studies the
halo star HD 74000 and estimates the impact of convection-related asymmetries
on the Li isotopic ratio determination. Method: Two methods are used to meet
this aim. The first, which is purely empirical, consists in deriving a template
profile from another element that can be assumed to originate in the same
stellar atmospheric layers as Li I, producing absorption lines of approximately
the same equivalent width as individual components of the 7Li I resonance line.
The second method consists in conducting the abundance analysis based on NLTE
line formation in a 3D hydrodynamical model atmosphere, taking into account the
effects of photospheric convection. Results: The results of the first method
show that the convective asymmetry generates an excess absorption in the red
wing of the 7Li absorption feature that mimics the presence of 6Li at a level
comparable to the hitherto published values. This opens the possibility that
only an upper limit on 6Li/7Li has thus far been derived. The second method
confirms these findings. Conclusions: From this work, it appears that a
systematic reappraisal of former determinations of 6Li abundances in halo stars
is warranted.

control over dynamical transformations in classical mechanics and quantum

topology is more complicated than those of previously studied problems on
compact Lie groups such as the orthogonal and unitary groups because the
incompatibility of the Frobenius norm with the pseudo-Riemannian structure on

endemic infectious diseases have been considered for long as a necessary
addition to an underlying deterministic theory. The latter would explain the
regular behaviour of recurrent epidemics, and the former the superimposed noise
of observed incidence patterns. Recently, a stochastic theory based on a
mechanism of resonance with internal noise has shifted the role of
stochasticity closer to the center stage, by showing that the major dynamic
patterns found in the incidence data can be explained as resonant fluctuations,
whose behaviour is largely independent of the amplitude of seasonal forcing,
and by contrast very sensitive to the basic epidemiological parameters. Here we
elaborate on that approach, by adding an ingredient which is missing in
standard epidemic models, the 'mixing network' through which infection may
propagate. We find that spatial correlations have a major effect in the
enhancement of the amplitude and the coherence of the resonant stochastic
fluctuations, providing the ordered patterns of recurrent epidemics, whose
period may differ significantly from that of the small oscillations around the
deterministic equilibrium. We also show that the inclusion of a more realistic,
time correlated, recovery profile instead of exponentially distributed
infectious periods may, even in the random-mixing limit, contribute to the same
effect.

and is also bright in UV. The source also shows strong, narrow iron lines
including fluorescent Fe K as well as Fe xxv and Fe xxvi. The X-ray spectrum
can be fit with a thermal model including an absorption component that
partially covers the source. Most of the equivalent width of the iron
fluorescent line in this model can be explained as a combination of
reprocessing in a dense absorber plus reflection off a white dwarf surface, but
it is likely that the continuum is partially seen in reflection as well. Unlike
other symbiotic systems that show hard X-ray emission (CH Cyg, RT Cru, T CrB,
GX1+4), SS73 17 is not known to have shown nova-like optical variability, X-ray
flashes, or pulsations, and has always shown faint soft X-ray emission. As a
result, although it is likely a white dwarf, the nature of the compact object

different outcomes (e.g., heads or tails) depend on the amount wagered on those
outcomes. The game is perhaps the simplest possible probabilistic game in which
perception affects reality. By varying the `reality map', which relates the
amount wagered to the probability of the outcome, it is possible to move
continuously from a purely objective game in which probabilities have no
dependence on wagers, to a purely subjective game in which probabilities equal
the amount wagered. The reality map can reflect self-reinforcing strategies or
self-defeating strategies. In self-reinforcing games, rational players can
achieve increasing returns and manipulate the outcome probabilities to their
advantage; consequently, an early lead in the game, whether acquired by chance
or by strategy, typically gives a persistent advantage. We investigate the game
both in and out of equilibrium and with and without rational players. We
introduce a method of measuring the inefficiency of the game and show that in
the large time limit the inefficiency decreases slowly in its approach to
equilibrium as a power law with an exponent between zero and one, depending on
the subjectivity of the game.

primordial element mix with the first heavier elements. The resulting ultra
metal-poor abundance distribution provided the initial conditions for the
second stars of a wide range of initial masses reaching down to intermediate
and low masses. The importance of these second stars for understanding the
origin of the elements in the early universe are manifold. While the massive
first stars have long vanished the second stars are still around and currently
observed. They are the carriers of the information about the first stars, but
they are also capable of nuclear production themselves. For example, in order
to use ultra or extremely metal-poor stars as a probe for the r-process in the
early universe a reliable model of the s-process in the second stars is needed.
Eventually, the second stars may provide us with important clues on questions
ranging from structure formation to how the stars actually make the elements,
not only in the early but also in the present universe. In particular the
C-rich extremely metal-poor stars, most of which show the s-process signature,
are thought to be associated with chemical yields from the evolved giant phase
of intermediate mass stars. Models of such AGB stars at extremely low
metallicity now exist, and comparison with observation show important
discrepancies, for example with regard to the synthesis of nitrogen. This may
hint at burning and mixing aspects of extremely metal-poor evolved stars that
are not yet included in the standard picture of evolution, as for example the
hydrogen-ingestion flash. The second stars of intermediate mass may have also
played an important role in the formation of heavy elements that form through
slow neutron capture reaction chains (s-process). Comparison of models with
observations reveal which aspects of the physics input and assumptions need to
be improved. The s-process is a particularly useful diagnostic tool for probing

mass binaries down to separations of 0.04-0.07"" (6-10 AU at 160 pc) and,
typically, companions with mass ratios as low as 0.2 outside of 0.2"" (~30 AU).

find companions around the majority of our targets, giving a binary frequency
of 11% [+9,-6], thus confirming the trend for a lower binary frequency with
decreasing mass. By combining our work with previous surveys, we arrive at the
largest sample of young VLMOs (72) with high angular resolution imaging to
date. Its multiplicity fraction is in statistical agreement with that for VLMOs
in the field. In addition we note that many field stellar binaries with lower
binding energies and/or wider cross sections have survived dynamical evolution
and that statistical models suggest tidal disruption by passing stars is
unlikely to affect the binary properties of our systems. Thus, we argue that
there is no significant evolution of multiplicity with age among brown dwarfs
and VLM stars in OB and T associations between a few Myr to several Gyr.
Instead, the observations to date suggest that VLM objects are either less
likely to be born in fragile multiple systems than solar mass stars or such
systems are disrupted very early.

Such surface condensation can significantly affect the thermal emission from
isolated neutron stars, and may lead to the formation of a charge-depleted
acceleration zone (""vacuum gap"") in the magnetosphere above the stellar polar
cap. Using the latest results on the cohesive property of magnetic condensed
matter, we quantitatively determine the conditions for surface condensation and
vacuum gap formation in magnetic neutron stars. We find that condensation can
occur if the thermal energy kT of the neutron star surface is less than about
8% of its cohesive energy Q_s, and that a vacuum gap can form if the neutron
star's rotation axis and magnetic moment point in opposite directions and kT is
less than about 4% of Q_s. Thus, vacuum gap accelerators may exist for some
neutron stars. Motivated by this result, we also study the physics of pair
cascades in the vacuum gap model for photon emission by accelerating electrons
and positrons due to both curvature radiation and resonant/nonresonant inverse
Compton scattering. Our calculations of the condition of cascade-induced vacuum
breakdown and the related pulsar death line/boundary generalize previous works
to the superstrong field regime. We find that inverse Compton scatterings do
not produce a sufficient number of high energy photons in the gap and thus do
not lead to pair cascades for most neutron star parameters. We discuss the
implications of our results for the recent observations of neutron star thermal
radiation as well as for the detection/non-detection of radio emission from

observational constraints that make the operation of the rapid mode unlikely to

rotation-induced horizontal turbulent diffusion may suppress the 3He-driven

explain observational evidence of enhanced extra mixing. The 3He exhaustion in
stars approaching the red giant branch (RGB) tip should make the 3He mixing
inefficient on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). In spite of this, there are

images of a sample of 17 nearby galaxies, most of them hosting bars and active
galactic nuclei. I use BUDDA v2.1 to produce the fits, allowing to include bars
and AGN in the models. A comparison with previous results from the literature
shows a fairly good agreement. It is found that the axial ratio of bars, as
measured from ellipse fits, can be severely underestimated if the galaxy
axisymmetric component is relatively luminous. Thus, reliable bar axial ratios
can only be determined by taking into account the contributions of bulge and
disc to the light distribution in the galaxy image. Through a number of tests,
I show that neglecting bars when modelling barred galaxies can result in a
overestimation of the bulge-to-total luminosity ratio of a factor of two.
Similar effects result when bright, type 1 AGN are not considered in the
models. By artificially redshifting the images, I show that the structural
parameters of more distant galaxies can in general be reliably retrieved
through image fitting, at least up to the point where the physical spatial
resolution is ~ 1.5 Kpc. This exercise shows that disc parameters are
particularly robust, but bulge parameters are prone to errors if its effective
radius is small compared to the seeing radius, and might suffer from systematic
effects. In this low resolution regime, the effects of ignoring bars are still
present, but AGN light is smeared out. I briefly discuss the consequences of
these results to studies of the structural properties of galaxies, in
particular on the stellar mass budget in the local universe. With reasonable

excitation has been derived and analyzed in systematically doped
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ single crystals. The Volovik's relation predicted
for a d-wave superconductor has been well demonstrated in wide doping regime,
showing a robust evidence for the d-wave pairing symmetry. Furthermore the
nodal gap slope $v_\Delta$ of the superconducting gap is derived and is found
to follow the same doping dependence of the pseudogap obtained from ARPES and
tunnelling measurement. This strongly suggests a close relationship between the
pseudogap and superconductivity. Taking the entropy conservation into account,
we argue that the ground state of the pseudogap phase should have Fermi arcs
with finite density of states at zero K, and the transport data show that it
behaves like an insulator due to probably weak localization. A nodal metal
picture for the pseudogap phase cannot interpret the data. Based on the Fermi
arc picture for the pseudogap phase it is found that the superconducting energy
scale or $T_c$ in underdoped regime is governed by both the maximum gap and the
spectral weight from the Fermi arcs. This suggests that there are two energy
scales: superconducting energy scale and the pseudogap. The superconductivity
may be formed by the condensation of Fermi arc quasiparticles through pairing
by exchanging virtue bosons.

such a graph possess some non-trivial internal structure that varies across and
differentiates among distinct types of links or nodes. In this work, we
abstract such additional information as network annotations. We introduce a
network topology modeling framework that treats annotations as an extended
correlation profile of a network. Assuming we have this profile measured for a
given network, we present an algorithm to rescale it in order to construct
networks of varying size that still reproduce the original measured annotation
profile.
  Using this methodology, we accurately capture the network properties
essential for realistic simulations of network applications and protocols, or
any other simulations involving complex network topologies, including modeling
and simulation of network evolution. We apply our approach to the Autonomous
System (AS) topology of the Internet annotated with business relationships
between ASs. This topology captures the large-scale structure of the Internet.
In depth understanding of this structure and tools to model it are cornerstones
of research on future Internet architectures and designs. We find that our

correlations within this topology, thus reproducing a number of its important

that Tc decreased from 37 to 36 K. Lattice parameter a decreased from 3.085 A

dust grains that collide and build up larger and larger bodies (Safronov 1969).
How this process continues from metre-sized boulders to kilometre-scale
planetesimals is a major unsolved problem (Dominik et al. 2007): boulders stick
together poorly (Benz 2000), and spiral into the protostar in a few hundred
orbits due to a head wind from the slower rotating gas (Weidenschilling 1977).
Gravitational collapse of the solid component has been suggested to overcome
this barrier (Safronov 1969, Goldreich & Ward 1973, Youdin & Shu 2002). Even
low levels of turbulence, however, inhibit sedimentation of solids to a
sufficiently dense midplane layer (Weidenschilling & Cuzzi 1993, Dominik et al.
2007), but turbulence must be present to explain observed gas accretion in
protostellar discs (Hartmann 1998). Here we report the discovery of efficient
gravitational collapse of boulders in locally overdense regions in the
midplane. The boulders concentrate initially in transient high pressures in the
turbulent gas (Johansen, Klahr, & Henning 2006), and these concentrations are
augmented a further order of magnitude by a streaming instability (Youdin &
Goodman 2005, Johansen, Henning, & Klahr 2006, Johansen & Youdin 2007) driven
by the relative flow of gas and solids. We find that gravitationally bound
clusters form with masses comparable to dwarf planets and containing a
distribution of boulder sizes. Gravitational collapse happens much faster than
radial drift, offering a possible path to planetesimal formation in accreting
circumstellar discs.

``Rapid planetesimal formation in turbulent circumstellar discs''. It contains
15 sections (\S1.1 -- \S1.15) that address a number of subjects related to the
main paper. We describe in detail the Poisson solver used to find the
self-potential of the solid particles, including a linear and a non-linear test
problem (\S1.3). Dissipative collisions remove energy from the motion of the
particles by collisional cooling (\S1.4), an effect that allows gravitational
collapse to occur in somewhat less massive discs (\S1.7). A resolution study of
the gravitational collapse of the boulders is presented in \S1.6. We find that
gravitational collapse can occur in progressively less massive discs as the
grid resolution is increased, likely due to the decreased smoothing of the
particle-mesh self-gravity solver with increasing resolution. In \S1.10 we show
that it is in good agreement with the Goldreich & Ward (1973) stability
analysis to form several-hundred-km-sized bodies, when the analysis is applied
to 5 AU and to regions of increased boulder column density. \S11 is devoted to
the measurement of random speeds and collision speeds between boulders. We find
good agreement between our measurements and analytical theory for the random
speeds, but the measured collision speeds are 3 times lower than expected from
analytical theory. Higher resolution studies, and an improved analytical theory
of collision speeds that takes into account epicyclic motion, will be needed to
determine whether collision speeds have converged. In \S1.12 we present models
with no magnetic fields. The boulder layer still exhibits strong clumping, due
to the streaming instability, if the global solids-to-gas ratio is increased by
a factor 3. Gravitational collapse occurs as readily as in magnetised discs.

exhibit the formation of metastable solid phases with the initial (nominal)
chemical composition. This fact is explained by complete solute trapping
leading to diffusionless (chemically partitionless) solidification at a finite
growth velocity of crystals. Special attention is paid to developing a model of
rapid solidification which describes a transition from chemically partitioned
to diffusionless growth of crystals. Analytical treatments lead to the
condition for complete solute trapping which directly follows from the analysis
of the solute diffusion around the solid-liquid interface and atomic attachment
and detachment at the interface. The resulting equations for the flux balance
at the interface take into account two kinetic parameters: diffusion speed
$V_{DI}$ on the interface and diffusion speed $V_D$ in bulk phases. The model
describes experimental data on nonequilibrium solute partitioning in
solidification of Si-As alloys [M.J. Aziz et al., J. Cryst. Growth {\bf 148},

The approach reveals the inherent finite-dimensional character of many
difficult prediction problems, the role of duality and biorthogonality for a
finite set of random variables. The lemma is particularly useful when the
number of missing values is small, like one or two, as in the case of
Kolmogorov and Nakazi prediction problems. The stationarity of the underlying

paper, we concentrate on the discrete case in which topology plays no role. Our
theory is particularly suited to the development of the_Roe (C*-)algebras_
C*(X) and their K-theory on the analytic side; we also hope that it will be of
use in the strictly geometric/algebraic setting of controlled topology and
algebra. We leave these topics to future papers.
  Crucial to our approach are nonunital coarse spaces, and what we call
_locally proper_ maps (which are actually implicit in [MR1988817]). Our_coarse
category_ Crs generalizes the usual one: its objects are nonunital coarse
spaces and its morphisms (locally proper) coarse maps modulo_closeness_. Crs is
much richer than the usual unital coarse category. As such, it has all nonzero
limits and all colimits. We examine various other categorical issues. E.g., Crs
does not have a terminal object, so we substitute a_termination functor_ which
will be important in the development of exponential objects (i.e., ""function
spaces"") and also leads to a notion of_quotient coarse spaces_. To connect our
methods with the standard methods, we also examine the relationship between Crs
and the usual coarse category of Roe.
  Finally we briefly discuss some basic examples and applications. Topics
include_metric coarse spaces_,_continuous control_ [MR1277522], metric and
continuously controlled_coarse simplices_,_sigma-coarse spaces_ [MR2225040],
and the relation between quotient coarse spaces and the K-theory of Roe

observations at 5 GHz reveal, for the first time, extended emission connecting
the core with the bright complex of emission that dominates the flux density of
the parsec scale structure at frequencies below 20 GHz. The evolution of this

lead to an upwards revision of the 4He primordial abundance at Yp=0.2477 +/-
0.0029 (Peimbert et al 2007) removing a major source of tension between SBBN

factor 4 lower than expected. We argue that the difference reduces to a factor
2 when the IRFM Teff scale is adopted. Diffusion has been suggested to have
depleted Li in halo dwarfs by the required amount to remove the gap, however
this would imply an implausible high abundance of the more fragile 6Li detected
in some halo dwarfs, thus leaving the puzzle open.

compressible hydrodynamics for a one-dimesional isentropic fluid, with an
appropriately motivated information theoretic extension, is described by a

enthalpy function, one obtains the cubic NLS or other modified NLS equations

measures which include the Fisher measure as their first member. The lowest
members of the hiearchy are shown to be included in the expansion of a
regularized Kullback-Leibler measure while, on the other hand, a suitable
combination of the NLS hierarchy leads to a Wootters type measure related to a
NLS equation with a relativistic dispersion relation. Finally, through our

Interferometry Mission PlanetQuest (SIM PlanetQuest). We use the capabilities
of this mission to illustrate the importance of the next level of astrometric
precision in modern astrophysics. SIM PlanetQuest is currently in the detailed
design phase, having completed all of the enabling technologies needed for the
flight instrument in 2005. It will be the first space-based long baseline
Michelson interferometer designed for precision astrometry. SIM will contribute
strongly to many astronomical fields including stellar and galactic
astrophysics, planetary systems around nearby stars, and the study of quasar
and AGN nuclei. SIM will search for planets with masses as small as an Earth
orbiting in the `habitable zone' around the nearest stars using differential
astrometry, and could discover many dozen if Earth-like planets are common. It
will be the most capable instrument for detecting planets around young stars,
thereby providing insights into how planetary systems are born and how they
evolve with time. SIM will observe significant numbers of very high- and
low-mass stars, providing stellar masses to 1%, the accuracy needed to
challenge physical models. Using precision proper motion measurements, SIM will
probe the galactic mass distribution and the formation and evolution of the
Galactic halo. (abridged)

to produce ultracold molecules in pre-set quantum states. For future
experiments it will be important to efficiently transfer these molecules from

schemes are excellent tools for transfer, but can be involved in terms of
equipment, laser stabilization and finding the right transitions. Here we
demonstrate a very general and simple way for transfer of molecules from one

The scheme is based on Zeeman tuning the molecular state to avoided level
crossings where radio-frequency transitions can then be carried out. By
repeating this process at different crossings, molecules can be successively
transported through a large manifold of quantum states. As an important
spin-off of our experiments, we demonstrate a high-precision spectroscopy

coupling between a scalar field, \Phi, and the Ricci scalar, R, F(\Phi)R. The
Jordan frame evolution is described in terms of dynamical variables m \equiv
d\ln F/d\ln \Phi and r \equiv -\Phi F/f, where F(\Phi) = d f(\Phi)/d\Phi. The
evolution can be alternatively viewed in the Einstein frame as a general
coupling between scalar dark energy and matter, \beta. We present a complete,
consistent picture of evolution in the Einstein and Jordan frames and consider
the conditions on the form of the coupling F and \beta required to give the
observed cold dark matter (CDM) dominated era that transitions into a late time
accelerative phase, including transitory accelerative eras that have not
previously been investigated. We find five classes of evolutionary behavior of
which four are qualitatively similar to those for f(R) theories (which have
\beta=1/2). The fifth class exists only for |\beta| < \sqrt{3}/4, i.e. not for
f(R) theories. In models giving transitory late time acceleration, we find a
viable accelerative region of the (r,m) plane accessible to scalar-tensor
theories with any coupling, \beta (at least in the range |\beta| \leq 1/2,
which we study in detail), and an additional region open only to theories with
|\beta| < \sqrt{3}/4.

exhibit an asymmetry between dephasing and relaxation that may result in qubits
experiencing discrete phase errors more frequently than discrete bit errors. In
the presence of such an error asymmetry, an appropriately asymmetric quantum
code - that is, a code that can correct more phase errors than bit errors -
will be more efficient than a traditional, symmetric quantum code. Here we
construct fault tolerant circuits to convert between an asymmetric subsystem
code and a symmetric subsystem code. We show that, for a moderate error
asymmetry, the failure rate of a logical circuit can be reduced by using a
combined symmetric asymmetric system and that doing so does not preclude
universality.

The pseudo-Dirac nature of the bino gives a natural mechanism of enhanced
co-annihilation because these two states are degenerate in the absence of
electroweak symmetry breaking. In addition, the lightest state can be
consistent with limits of direct detection experiments because of the lack of
vector interactions, as with the case of the MSSM bino.

by a network of half--integer defect lines which emerge from the point defects

system is disordered and the half--integer defect lines thread through the cell
joining point defects on the top and bottom surfaces. We present a simple

of the shower is reconstructed based on the correlation between viewing angle
and arrival time of the signals detected by the telescope. The signals are
compared to those expected for different shower geometries and the best-fit
geometry is determined. The calculation of the expected signals is usually
based on a relatively simple function which is motivated by basic geometrical
considerations. This function is based on certain assumptions on the processes
of light emission and propagation through the atmosphere. For instance, the
fluorescence light is assumed to propagate with vacuum speed of light. We
investigate the validity of these assumptions and provide corrections that can

epochs have been used to detect flux density and spectral shape variability in
order to pinpoint contaminant objects, since young radio sources are not
expected to be significantly variable on such a short time-scale. From the
analysis of the spectral variability we find 13 contaminant objects, 11
quasars, 1 BL Lac, and 1 unidentified object, which we have rejected from the
sample of candidate young radio sources. The 6 years elapsed between the first
and latest observing run are not enough to detect any substantial evolution of
the overall spectrum of genuine, non variable, young radio sources. If we also
consider the pc-scale information, we find that the total radio spectrum we
observe is the result of the superposition of the spectra of different regions
(lobes, hot-spots, core, jets), instead of a single homogeneous radio
component. This indicates that the radio source structure plays a relevant role
in determining the spectral shape also in the rather common case in which the
morphology appears unresolved even on high-resolution scales.

  The main goal of the study presented in this thesis was to perform in-situ
investigations on deformation structures in plastically deformed
polycrystalline copper at low degrees (<5%) of tensile deformation. Copper is
taken as a model system for pure fcc metals.
  A novel synchrotron-radiation based technique has been developed. The
technique allows for in-situ 3D reciprocal space mapping of reflections from
deeply-embedded individual grains in polycrystalline samples during tensile
deformation. We have shown that the resulting 3D maps from copper, consists of
bright sharp peaks superimposed on a cloud of enhanced intensity. It is
concluded that the individual peaks arise from the individual dislocation-free
regions (the subgrains) in the dislocation structure.
  Based on data taken under static load, the strain distribution in and between
the individual subgrains is analyzed and compared to composite type models. The
consequences of stress relaxation and unloading is moreover discussed. The
dynamics of the dislocation structure are investigated by continuous and
stepwise deformation experiments. On the basis of such data the unset of
subgrain formation and the subgrain refinement process is analyzed.

existing CERN data on pi(-) p -> pi(-)pi(+) n on polarized target at 17.2
GeV/c. The purity of the final state is controlled by the purity of recoil
nucleon polarization. We develop a spin formalism to calculate expressions for
recoil nucleon polarization for two specific pure initial states. Imposing
conditions of purity on the recoil nuclon polarization we obtain conditions on
the amplitudes which are violated by model independent amplitude analysis of
CERN data at large t. We conclude that pure states can evolve into mixed states
in pi(-) p -> pi(-)pi(+) n. In quantum theory such non-unitary evolution occurs
in open quantum systems interacting with an environment. We present evidence to
validate the view of the pion creation process as an open quantum system
interacting with a quantum environment. The observed process is
