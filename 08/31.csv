neutral material at a large distance from the central supermassive black hole.
We report the strong detections of Fe K$\alpha$ and Si K$\alpha$ lines, which
are marginally resolved with the Chandra HETGS, and we constrain the emission
radius of the fluorescing material to >1 pc. There is some evidence for modest
additional broadening at the base of the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ core with a

VIII Ly $\alpha$, an O VIII RRC feature, and possibly a Ne IX forbidden line)

the known extended X-ray emission that lies ~160 pc from the nucleus. We

algal blooms (HABs) produced by the toxic dinoflagellate \emph{Karenia brevis}
on the West Florida Shelf. However, because the early stages of HAB development
are usually not detected, these theories have been so far very difficult to
verify. In this paper we employ simulated \emph{Lagrangian coherent structures}
(LCSs) to trace the early location of a HAB in late 2004 before it was
transported to an area where it could be detected by satellite imagery, and
then we make use of a population dynamics model to infer the factors that may
have led to its development. The LCSs, which are computed based on a surface
flow description provided by an ocean circulation model, delineate past and
future histories of boundaries of passively advected fluid domains. The
population dynamics model determines nitrogen in two components, nutrients and
phytoplankton, which are assumed to be passively advected by the simulated
surface currents. Two nearshore nutrient sources are identified for the HAB
whose evolution is found to be strongly tied to the simulated LCSs. While one
nutrient source can be associated with a coastal upwelling event, the other is
seen to be produced by river runoff, which provides support to a theory of HAB
development that considers nutrient loading into coastal waters produced by
human activities as a critical element. Our results show that the use of
simulated LCSs and a population dynamics model can greatly enhance our
understanding of the early stages of the development of HABs.

Model, which we call the Maximal Mass Model because it contains a limiting mass
$M$ for its fundamental constituents. The parameter $M$ is considered as a new
universal physical constant of Nature and therefore is called the fundamental
mass. It is introduced in a purely geometrical way, like the velocity of light
as a maximal velocity in the special relativity. If one chooses the Euclidean
formulation of quantum field theory, the adequate realization of the limiting
mass hypothesis is reduced to the choice of the de Sitter geometry as the
geometry of the 4-momentum space. All fields, defined in de Sitter p-space in
configurational space obey five dimensional Klein-Gordon type equation with
fundamental mass $M$ as a mass parameter. The role of dynamical field variables
is played by the Cauchy initial conditions given at $x_5 = 0$, guarantying the
locality and gauge invariance principles. The corresponding to the geometrical
requirements formulation of the theory of scalar, vector and spinor fields is
considered in some detail. On a simple example it is demonstrated that the
spontaneously symmetry breaking mechanism leads to renormalization of the
fundamental mass $M$. A new geometrical concept of the chirality of the fermion
fields is introduced. It would be responsible for new measurable effects at
high energies $E \geq M$. Interaction terms of a new type, due to the existence
of the Higgs boson are revealed. The most intriguing prediction of the new
approach is the possible existence of exotic fermions with no analogues in the
SM, which may be candidate for dark matter constituents.

Using a set of coordinates based on the Laplacian eigenvectors as a diagnostic
tool for synchronization dynamics, we find that the process of frequency
synchronization can be visualized as a series of quasi-independent transitions
involving different normal modes. Particular features of the partially
synchronized state can be understood in terms of the behavior of particular
modes or groups of modes. For example, there are important partially
synchronized states in which a set of low-lying modes remain unlocked while
those in the main spectral peak are locked. We find therefore that spectra
influence dynamics in ways that go beyond results relating a single threshold

is governed by two limits: the Eddington limit and the photon-tiring limit. A
star must exceed the effective Eddington limit for continuum driving to
overcome the stellar gravity. The photon-tiring limit places an upper limit on
the mass loss rate that can be driven to infinity, given the energy available
in the radiation field of the star. Since continuum driving does not require
the presence of metals in the stellar atmosphere it is particularly suited to
removing mass from low- and zero-metallicity stars and can play a crucial part
in their evolution. Using a porosity length formalism we compute numerical
simulations of super-Eddington, continuum driven winds to explore their
behaviour for stars both below and above the photon-tiring limit. We find that
below the photon tiring limit, continuum driving can produce a large, steady
mass loss rate at velocities on the order of the escape velocity. If the star
exceeds the photon-tiring limit, a steady solution is no longer possible. While
the effective mass loss rate is still very large, the wind velocity is much
smaller

transmitting it to all the relays. It is shown that DOSTBCs are a special case

is derived. The bounds obtained are approximately twice larger than that of the

rules out soft equations of state and has provoked a debate whether the

contribution it is shown that modern quantum field theoretical approaches to
quark matter including color superconductivity and a vector meanfield allow a
microscopic description of hybrid stars which fulfill the new, strong
constraints. The deconfinement transition in the resulting stiff hybrid
equation of state is weakly first order so that signals of it have to be
expected due to specific changes in transport properties governing the
rotational and cooling evolution caused by the color superconductivity of quark
matter. A similar conclusion holds for the investigation of quark deconfinement
in future generations of nucleus-nucleus collision experiments at low

homogeneous, polytropic stellar models, is to base the theory firmly on a
variational principle. Another essential novelty is to let mass distribution
extend to infinity, the boundary between bulk and atmosphere being defined by
an abrupt change in the polytropic index, triggered by the density. The logical
next step in this program is to include the effect of radiation, which is a
very significant complication since a full treatment would have to include an
account of ionization, thus fieldsrepresenting electrons, ions, photons,
gravitons and neutral atoms as well. In way of preparation, we consider models
that are charged but homogeneous, involving only gravity, electromagnetism and
a single scalar field that represents both the mass and the electric charge; in
short, anon-neutral plasma. While this work only represents a stage in the

  tables",,"10.1086/525272",,"astro-ph",,"  Equivalent widths (EWs) observed in high-redshift Lyman alpha galaxies could
be stronger than the EW intrinsic to the stellar population if dust is present
residing in clumps in the inter-stellar medium (ISM). In this scenario,
continuum photons could be extinguished while the Lyman alpha photons would be
resonantly scattered by the clumps, eventually escaping the galaxy. We
investigate this radiative transfer scenario with a new sample of six Lyman
alpha galaxy candidates in the GOODS CDF-S, selected at z = 4.4 with
ground-based narrow-band imaging obtained at CTIO. Grism spectra from the HST
PEARS survey confirm that three objects are at z = 4.4, and that another object
contains an active galactic nuclei (AGN). If we assume the other five (non-AGN)
objects are at z = 4.4, they have rest-frame EWs from 47 -- 190 A. We present
results of stellar population studies of these objects, constraining their
rest-frame UV with HST and their rest-frame optical with Spitzer. Out of the
four objects which we analyzed, three objects were best-fit to contain stellar
populations with ages on the order of 1 Myr and stellar masses from 3 - 10 x
10^8 solar masses, with dust in the amount of A_1200 = 0.9 - 1.8 residing in a
quasi-homogeneous distribution. However, one object (with a rest EW ~ 150 A)
was best fit by an 800 Myr, 6.6 x 10^9 solar mass stellar population with a
smaller amount of dust (A_1200 = 0.4) attenuating the continuum only. In this
object, the EW was enhanced ~ 50% due to this dust. This suggests that large EW
Lyman alpha galaxies are a diverse population. Preferential extinction of the
continuum in a clumpy ISM deserves further investigation as a possible cause of
the overabundance of large-EW objects that have been seen in narrow-band
surveys in recent years.

Spectrometer (XIS) aboard the Suzaku X-ray satellite. The NPS is a large region
of enhanced soft X-ray and radio emission projected above the plane of the
Galaxy, likely produced by a series of supernovae and stellar winds from the
nearby Sco-Cen OB association. The exceptional sensitivity and spectral
resolution of the XIS below 1 keV allow unprecedented probing of low-energy
spectral lines, including CVI (0.37 keV) and NVII (0.50 keV), and we have
detected highly-ionized nitrogen toward the NPS for the first time. For this
single pointing toward the brightest 3/4 keV emission (l = 26.8 deg, b = +22.0
deg), the best-fit NPS emission model implies a hot (kT ~ 0.3 keV), collisional
ionization equilibrium (CIE) plasma with depleted C, O, Ne, Mg, and Fe
abundances of less than 0.5 solar, but an enhanced N abundance, with N/O = 4.0
+0.4,-0.5 times solar. The temperature and total thermal energy of the gas
suggest heating by one or more supernovae, while the enhanced nitrogen
abundance is best explained by enrichment from stellar material that has been
processed by the CNO cycle. Due to the time required to develop AGB stars, we
conclude that this N/O enhancement cannot be caused by the Sco-Cen OB
association, but may result from a previous enrichment episode in the solar
neighborhood.

J. 677, 92-126 (2008)","10.1086/526414",,"astro-ph",,"  Opacity effects in relativistic sources of high-energy gamma-rays, such as
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) or Blazars, can probe the Lorentz factor of the outflow
and the distance of the emission site from the source, and thus help constrain
the composition of the outflow (protons, pairs, magnetic field) and the
emission mechanism. Most previous works consider the opacity in steady state.
Here we study time dependent effects of the opacity to pair production
($\gamma\gamma \to e^+e^-$) in impulsive relativistic sources. We present a
simple, yet rich, semi-analytic model for the time and energy dependence of the
optical depth, $\tau$, where an ultra-relativistic thin spherical shell emits
isotropically in its own rest frame over a finite range of radii, $R_0 < R <
R_0 + \Delta R$. This is very relevant for GRB internal shocks. We find that in
an impulsive source ($\Delta R <~ R_0$), while the instantaneous spectrum has
an exponential cutoff above the photon energy $\epsilon_1(T)$ where $\tau = 1$,
the time integrated spectrum has a power-law high-energy tail above a photon
energy $\epsilon_{1*} \sim \epsilon_1(\Delta T)$ where $\Delta T$ is the
duration of the emission episode. Furthermore, photons with $\epsilon >
\epsilon_{1*}$ will arrive mainly near the onset of the spike or flare from to
the short emission episode, as in impulsive sources it takes time to build-up
the (target) photon field, and thus $\tau(\epsilon)$ initially increases with
time and $\epsilon_1(T)$ decreases with time, so that photons of energy
$\epsilon > \epsilon_{1*}$ are able to escape the source mainly very early on
while $\epsilon_1(T) > \epsilon$. As the source approaches a quasi-steady state
($\Delta R >> R_0$), the time integrated spectrum develops an exponential
cutoff, while the power-law tail becomes increasingly suppressed.

address soft tissues arguing that most of the human body is made of such
tissues that can move as well as deform during surgical gestures [1]. An
intra-operative use of a continuous Finite Element (FE) Model of a given tissue
mainly faces two problems: (1) the numerical simulations have to be
""interactive"", i.e. sufficiently fast to provide results during surgery (which
can be a strong issue in the context of hyperelastic models for example) and
(2) during the intervention, the surgeon needs a device that can be used to
provide to the model an estimation of the patient-specific constitutive
behaviour of the soft tissues. This work proposes an answer to the second
point, with the design of a new aspiration device aiming at characterizing the
in vivo constitutive laws of human soft tissues. The device was defined in
order to permit sterilization as well an easy intra-operative use.

the production and runaway evolution of centrally condensed molecular cloud
cores, a process that has been termed the gravomagneto catastrophe. Our
calculation applies in the geometric limit of a highly flattened core and
allows for a semi-analytic treatment of the full problem, although physical
fixes are required to resolve a poor representation of the central region. A
noteworthy feature of the overall formulation is that the solutions for the
ambipolar diffusion portion of the evolution for negative times ($t < 0$) match
smoothly onto the collapse solutions for positive times ($t > 0$). The
treatment shows that the resulting cores display non-zero, but
sub-magnetosonic, inward velocities at the end of the diffusion epoch, in
agreement with current observations. Another important result is the derivation
of an analytic relationship between the dimensionless mass to flux ratio
$\lambda_0\equiv f_0^{-1}$ of the central regions produced by runaway core
condensation and the dimensionless measure of the rate of ambipolar diffusion
$\epsilon$. In conjunction with previous work showing that ambipolar diffusion
takes place more quickly in the presence of turbulent fluctuations, i.e., that
the effective value of $\epsilon$ can be enhanced by turbulence, the resultant
theory provides a viable working hypothesis for the formation of isolated
molecular-cloud cores and their subsequent collapse to form stars and planetary
systems.

Probe Microscopy (SPM) technique in which the cantilever is excited and the
response is recorded over a band of frequencies simultaneously rather than at a
single frequency as in conventional SPMs. This band excitation (BE) SPM allows
very rapid acquisition of the full frequency response at each point (i.e.
transfer function) in an image and in particular enables the direct measurement
of energy dissipation through the determination of the Q-factor of the
cantilever-sample system. The BE method is demonstrated for force-distance and
voltage spectroscopies and for magnetic dissipation imaging with sensitivity
close to the thermomechanical limit. The applicability of BE for various SPMs
is analyzed, and the method is expected to be universally applicable to all

state space is a chain for which upward jumps may be only of unit size; there

determined, for an irreducible continuous-time skip-free chain and any d, the
passage time distribution from state 0 to state d. When the nonzero eigenvalues
nu_j of the generator are all real, their result states that the passage time
is distributed as the sum of d independent exponential random variables with

extrinsic couplings of a quantum system are effectively averaged out by
application of specially designed driving fields (refocusing pulse sequences).
This entails pumping energy into the system, which can be especially dangerous
when it has sharp spectral features like a cavity mode close to resonance. In
this work we show that such an effect can be avoided with properly constructed
refocusing sequences. To this end we construct the average Hamiltonian
expansion for the system evolution operator associated with a single ``soft''
pi-pulse. To second order in the pulse duration, we characterize a symmetric
pulse shape by three parameters, two of which can be turned to zero by shaping.
We express the effective Hamiltonians for several pulse sequences in terms of
these parameters, and use the results to analyze the structure of error
operators for controlled Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. When errors are cancelled
to second order, numerical simulations show excellent qubit fidelity with
strongly-suppressed oscillator heating.

finite quantum system in the setting of large numbers of copies, and find a
closed form expression for the asymptotic exponential rate at which the
specified error probability tends to zero. This leads to the identification of
the quantum generalisation of the classical Chernoff distance.
  The proof relies on two new techniques that have been introduced in
[quant-ph/0610027] and [quant-ph/0607216], respectively, and that are also well
suited to prove the quantum generalisation of the Hoeffding bound, which is a
modification of the Chernoff distance and specifies the optimal achievable
asymptotic error rate in the context of asymmetric hypothesis testing. This has
been done subsequently by Hayashi [quant-ph/0611013] and Nagaoka
[quant-ph/0611289] for the special case where both hypotheses have full
support.
  Moreover, quantum Stein's Lemma and quantum Sanov's theorem may be derived
directly from the quantum Hoeffding bound combining it with a result obtained
recently in [math/0703772].
  The goal of this paper is to present the proofs of the above mentioned
results in a unified way and in full generality (allowing hypothetic states
with different supports). Additionally, we give an in-depth treatment of the
properties of the quantum Chernoff distance. We argue that, although it is not
a metric, it is a natural distance measure on the set of density operators, due
to its clear operational meaning.

  Statist",,,,"math.PR",,"  In dynamical percolation, the status of every bond is refreshed according to
an independent Poisson clock. For graphs which do not percolate at criticality,
the dynamical sensitivity of this property was analyzed extensively in the last
decade. Here we focus on graphs which percolate at criticality, and investigate
the dynamical sensitivity of the infinite cluster. We first give two examples
of bounded degree graphs, one which percolates for all times at criticality and
one which has exceptional times of nonpercolation. We then make a nearly
complete analysis of this question for spherically symmetric trees with
spherically symmetric edge probabilities bounded away from 0 and 1. One
interesting regime occurs when the expected number of vertices at the nth level
that connect to the root at a fixed time is of order n(\log n)^\alpha. R. Lyons
(1990) showed that at a fixed time, there is an infinite cluster a.s. if and
only if \alpha >1. We prove that the probability that there is an infinite
cluster at all times is 1 if \alpha > 2, while this probability is 0 if
1<\alpha \le 2. Within the regime where a.s. there is an infinite cluster at
all times, there is yet another type of ``phase transition'' in the behavior of
the process: if the expected number of vertices at the nth level connecting to
the root at a fixed time is of order n^\theta with \theta > 2, then the number
of connected components of the set of times in [0,1] at which the root does not
percolate is finite a.s., while if 1<\theta < 2, then the number of such
components is infinite with positive probability.

branch across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram until the white-dwarf domain is
reached, using various central-star models coupled to different initial
envelope configurations. Along each sequence the relevant line emissions of the
nebulae are computed and analysed. Maximum line luminosities in Hbeta and
[OIII] 5007A are achieved at stellar effective temperatures of about 65000K and
95000-100000K, respectively, provided the nebula remains optically thick for
ionising photons. In the optically thin case, the maximum line emission occurs
at or shortly after the thick/thin transition. Our models suggest that most
planetary nebulae with hotter (>~ 45000K) central stars are optically thin in
the Lyman continuum, and that their [OIII] 5007A emission fails to explain the
bright end of the observed planetary nebulae luminosity function. However,
sequences with central stars of >~ 0.6 Msun and rather dense initial envelopes
remain virtually optically thick and are able to populate the bright end of the
luminosity function. Individual luminosity functions depend strongly on the
central-star mass and on the variation of the nebular optical depth with time.
Hydrodynamical simulations of planetary nebulae are essential for any
understanding of the basic physics behind their observed luminosity function.
In particular, our models do not support the claim of Marigo et.al (2004)
according to which the maximum 5007A luminosity occurs during the recombination
phase well beyond 100 000K when the stellar luminosity declines and the nebular
models become, at least partially, optically thick. Consequently, there is no
need to invoke relatively massive central stars of, say > 0.7 Msun, to account
for the bright end of the luminosity function.

continuum limit by non-minimal CFTs where the role of a Z_N symmetry, in

illuminate the close interaction between high-density matter under extreme
conditions and the transport of leptons and energy in general relativistically

be relevant for the different evolutionary phases, e.g. nuclear structure for
weak rates in collapse, the equation of state of bulk nuclear matter during
bounce, multidimensional plasma dynamics in the postbounce evolution, and
neutrino cross sections in the explosive nucleosynthesis. We illustrate the

history of Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). A
knowledge of the hard X-ray bolometric correction, \kappa_{2-10keV} is a vital
input into these studies. Variations in the disk emission in the UV have not
previously been taken into account in calculating \kappa_{2-10keV}; we show
that such variations are important by constructing optical--to--X-ray SEDs for
54 AGN. In particular, we use FUSE UV and X-ray data from the literature to
constrain the disk emission as well as possible. Previous work has suggested a
dependence of \kappa_{2-10keV} on AGN luminosity, but we find significant
spread in \kappa_{2-10keV} with no simple dependence on luminosity. Populations
such as Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 nuclei (NLS1s), Radio Loud and X-ray Weak AGN may
have values of \kappa_{2-10keV} differing systematically from the rest of the
AGN population. Other sources of uncertainty include intrinsic extinction in
the optical--UV, X-ray and UV variability and uncertainties in SMBH mass
estimates. Our results suggest a more well-defined relationship between
\kappa_{2-10keV} and Eddington ratio in AGN, with a transitional region at an
Eddington ratio of ~0.1, below which the bolometric correction is typically 15
- 25, and above which it is typically 40 - 70. We consider the potential
implied parallels with the low/hard and high/soft states in Galactic Black Hole
(GBH) accretion, and present bolometric corrections for the GBH binary GX 339-4
for comparison. Our findings reinforce previous studies proposing a multi-state
description of AGN accretion analogous to that for GBH binaries. Future
calculations of the SMBH mass density may need to account for the possible
dependence of \kappa_{2-10keV} on Eddington ratio.

this zonal flow dominated state is rapidly destroyed and a turbulence-dominated
state re-emerges. The transition is explained in terms of the Kelvin-Helmholtz
stability of zonal flows. This is the first observation of an upshift of
turbulence onset in the resistive drift wave system, which is analogous to the
well-known Dimits shift in turbulence driven by ion temperature gradients.

collisions has given rise to the idea that partons propagating through a medium
in addition to energy loss by induced radiation also undergo substantial energy
loss due to elastic collisions. However, the precise magnitude of this elastic
energy loss component is highly controversial. While it is for a parton inside
a medium surprisingly difficult to define the difference between elastic and
radiative processes rigorously, the main phenomenological difference is in the
dependence of energy loss on in-medium pathlength: in a constant medium
radiative energy loss is expected to grow quadratically with pathlength,
elastic energy loss linearly. In this paper, we investigate a class of energy
loss models with such a linear pathlength dependence and demonstrate that they
are incompatible with measured data on hard hadronic back-to-back correlations
where a substantial variation of pathlength is probed. This indicates that any
elastic energy loss component has to be small.

non-trivially on the momentum, decreasing sufficiently fast in the deep
ultraviolet, in order for the renormalizability of QCD to be preserved. General
arguments based on the analogy with the constituent quark masses, as well as
explicit calculations using the operator-product expansion, suggest that the
gluon mass falls off as the inverse square of the momentum, relating it to the
gauge-invariant gluon condensate of dimension four. In this article we
demonstrate that the power-law running of the effective gluon mass is indeed
dynamically realized at the level of the non-perturbative Schwinger-Dyson
equation. We study a gauge-invariant non-linear integral equation involving the
gluon self-energy, and establish the conditions necessary for the existence of
infrared finite solutions, described in terms of a momentum-dependent gluon
mass. Assuming a simplified form for the gluon propagator, we derive a
secondary integral equation that controls the running of the mass in the deep
ultraviolet. Depending on the values chosen for certain parameters entering
into the Ansatz for the fully-dressed three-gluon vertex, this latter equation
yields either logarithmic solutions, familiar from previous linear studies, or
a new type of solutions, displaying power-law running. In addition, it
furnishes a non-trivial integral constraint, which restricts significantly (but
does not determine fully) the running of the mass in the intermediate and
infrared regimes. The numerical analysis presented is in complete agreement
with the analytic results obtained, showing clearly the appearance of the two
types of momentum-dependence, well-separated in the relevant space of
parameters. Open issues and future directions are briefly discussed.

curvature perturbation. In the specific model of two fields, $\phi_1$ and
$\phi_2$, with exponential potentials, $-V_i \exp (-c_i \phi_i)$, we calculate
the bispectrum of the resulting curvature perturbation. We find that the
non-Gaussianity is dominated by non-linear evolution on super-Hubble scales and
hence is of the local form. The non-linear parameter of the curvature
perturbation is given by $f_{NL} = 5 c_j^2 /12$, where $c_j$ is the exponent of
the potential for the field which becomes sub-dominant at late times. Since
$c_j^2$ must be large, in order to generate an almost scale invariant spectrum,
the non-Gaussianity is inevitably large. By combining the present observational
constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$ and the scalar spectral index, the specific model
studied in this paper is thus ruled out by current observational data.

First, a linkage kinematic analysis method is used to have a rough idea of the

Besides, this method shows that variations in the design parameters of the same

particularly the influence of the variations in the parallelograms. It turns
out that the kinematic isotropic configuration of the manipulator is the least

closest configurations to its kinematic singular configurations are the most
sensitive ones to geometrical variations.

radial-velocity spectroscopic data when looking for exoplanets signatures. We
aim at quantifying the impact of stellar spots on stars with various spectral
types and rotational velocities and comparing the simulations with data
obtained with the HARPS spectrograph. Methods: We have developed detailed
simulations of stellar spots and estimated their effects on a number of
observables commonly used in the analysis of radial-velocity data when looking
for extrasolar planets, such as radial-velocity curves, cross-correlation
functions, bisector spans and photometric curves. The computed stellar spectra
are then analyzed in the same way as when searching for exoplanets. Results: 1)
A first grid of simulation results is built for F-K type stars, with different
stellar and spot properties. 2) It is shown quantitatively that star spots with
typical sizes of 1% can mimic both radial-velocity curves and the bisector
behavior of short-period giant planets around G-K type stars with a vsini lower
than the spectrograph resolution. For stars with intermediate vsini, smaller
spots may produce similar features. In these cases, additional observables
(e.g., photometry, spectroscopic diagnostics) are mandatory to confirm the
presence of short-period planets. We show that, in some cases, photometric
variations may not be enough to clearly rule out spots as explanations of the
observed radial-velocity variations. This is particularly important when
searching for super-Earth planets. 3) It is also stressed that quantitative
values obtained for radial-velocity and bisector span amplitudes depend

opinions distant from their opinion by less than a certain interaction radius.
Some results obtained on this model rely on the fact that the opinion orders
remain unchanged under iteration, a property that is consistent with the
intuition in models with simultaneous updating on a fully connected
communication topology. Several variations of this model have been proposed. We
show that some natural variations are not order preserving and therefore cause
potential problems with the theoretical analysis and the consistence with the

that have altered expression levels relative to two or more states of a cell.
Knowing the enrichment of gene sets defined by functional categories, such as
gene ontology (GO) annotations, is valuable for analyzing the biological
signals in microarray expression data. A common approach to measuring
enrichment is by cross-classifying genes according to membership in a
functional category and membership on a selected list of significantly altered
genes. A small Fisher's exact test $p$-value, for example, in this $2\times2$
table is indicative of enrichment. Other category analysis methods retain the
quantitative gene-level scores and measure significance by referring a
category-level statistic to a permutation distribution associated with the
original differential expression problem. We describe a class of random-set
scoring methods that measure distinct components of the enrichment signal. The
class includes Fisher's test based on selected genes and also tests that
average gene-level evidence across the category. Averaging and selection
methods are compared empirically using Affymetrix data on expression in
nasopharyngeal cancer tissue, and theoretically using a location model of
differential expression. We find that each method has a domain of superiority
in the state space of enrichment problems, and that both methods have benefits
in practice. Our analysis also addresses two problems related to
multiple-category inference, namely, that equally enriched categories are not
detected with equal probability if they are of different sizes, and also that
there is dependence among category statistics owing to shared genes. Random-set
enrichment calculations do not require Monte Carlo for implementation. They are
made available in the R package allez.

fairly precise formulation is possible in the context of the standard model
(here defined to include gravity). Some fundamental constants have profound
geometric meaning. The ordinary gravitational constant parameterizes the
stiffness, or resistance to curvature, of space-time. The cosmological term
parameterizes space-time's resistance to expansion -- which may be, and
apparently is at present, a {\it negative} resistance, i.e. a tendency toward
expansion. The three gauge couplings of the strong, electromagnetic, and weak
interactions parameterize resistance to curvature in internal spaces. The
remaining fundamental couplings, of which there are a few dozen, supply an
ungainly accommodation of inertia. The multiplicity and variety of fundamental
constants are esthetic and conceptual shortcomings in our present understanding
of foundational physics. I discuss some ideas for improving the situation. I
then briefly discuss additional constants, primarily cosmological, that enter
into our best established present-day world model. Those constants presently
appear as macroscopic state parameters, i.e. as empirical ``material
constants'' of the Universe. I mention a few ideas for how they might become

calculations, by solving three time-dependent kinetic equations for protons,
electrons and photons in addition to the usual mass and energy conservation
equations. We follow the evolution of the RBW as it sweeps up circumstellar
matter and assume that the swept-up electrons and protons have energies equal
to the Lorentz factor of the flow. While the electrons radiate their energies
through synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation on short timescales, the
protons, at least initially, start accumulating without any dissipation. As the
accumulated mass of relativistic protons increases, however, they can become
supercritical to the `proton-photon pair-production - synchrotron radiation'
network, and, as a consequence, they transfer explosively their stored energy
to secondary electron-positron pairs and radiation. This results in a burst
which has many features similar to the ones observed in GRB prompt emission. We
have included in our calculations the radiation drag force exerted on the flow
from the scattered radiation of the prompt emission on the circumstellar
material. We find that this can decelerate the flow on timescales which are
much faster than the ones related to the usual adiabatic/radiative ones. As a
result the emission exhibits a steep drop just after the prompt phase, in
agreement with the Swift afterglow observations.

different than their equilibrium counterparts. Such processes are of great
importance for the understanding of relaxation in single molecule devices. As a
detailed case study, we investigate here a generic spin-fermion model, where a
two-level system couples to two metallic leads with different chemical
potentials. We present results for the spin relaxation rate in the nonadiabatic
limit for an arbitrary coupling to the leads, using both analytical and exact
numerical methods. The non-equilibrium dynamics is reflected by an exponential
relaxation at long times and via complex phase shifts, leading in some cases to
an ""anti-orthogonality"" effect. In the limit of strong system-lead coupling at
zero temperature we demonstrate the onset of a Marcus-like Gaussian decay with
{\it voltage difference} activation. This is analogous to the equilibrium
spin-boson model, where at strong coupling and high temperatures the spin
excitation rate manifests temperature activated Gaussian behavior. We find that
there is no simple linear relationship between the role of the temperature in
the bosonic system and a voltage drop in a non-equilibrium electronic case. The
two models also differ by the orthogonality-catastrophe factor existing in a
fermionic system, which modifies the resulting lineshapes. Implications for
current characteristics are discussed. We demonstrate the violation of
pair-wise Coulomb gas behavior for strong coupling to the leads. The results
presented in this paper form the basis of an exact, non-perturbative
description of steady-state quantum dissipative systems.

submanifolds in ambient spaces which have a lower bound on their radial
sectional curvatures. The submanifolds are themselves only assumed to have
lower bounds on the radial part of the mean curvature vector field and on the
radial part of the intrinsic unit normals at the boundaries of the extrinsic
spheres, respectively. In the same vein we also establish lower bounds on the
mean exit time for Brownian motion in the extrinsic balls. In those cases,
where we may extend our analysis to hold all the way to infinity, we apply a
capacity comparison technique to obtain a sufficient condition for the
submanifolds to be parabolic, i.e. a condition which will guarantee that any
Brownian particle, which is free to move around in the whole submanifold, is
bound to eventually revisit any given neighborhood of its starting point with
probability 1. The results of this paper are in a rough sense dual to similar
results obtained previously by the present authors in complementary settings
where we assume that the curvatures are bounded from above.
