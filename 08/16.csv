simulations to investigate the cumulative effect of substructure mergers onto
thin disk galaxies in the context of the LCDM paradigm of structure formation.
Our simulation campaign is based on a hybrid approach. Substructure properties
are culled directly from cosmological simulations of galaxy-sized cold dark
matter (CDM) halos. In contrast to what can be inferred from statistics of the
present-day substructure populations, accretions of massive subhalos onto the
central regions of host halos, where the galactic disk resides, since z~1
should be common occurrences. One host halo merger history is subsequently used
to seed controlled numerical experiments of repeated satellite impacts on an
initially-thin Milky Way-type disk galaxy. We show that these accretion events
produce several distinctive observational signatures in the stellar disk
including: a ring-like feature in the outskirts; a significant flare; a central
bar; and faint filamentary structures that (spuriously) resemble tidal streams.
The final distribution of disk stars exhibits a complex vertical structure that
is well-described by a standard ``thin-thick'' disk decomposition. We conclude
that satellite-disk encounters of the kind expected in LCDM models can induce
morphological features in galactic disks that are similar to those being
discovered in the Milky Way, M31, and in other disk galaxies. These results
highlight the significant role of CDM substructure in setting the structure of
disk galaxies and driving galaxy evolution. Upcoming galactic structure surveys
and astrometric satellites may be able to distinguish between competing
cosmological models by testing whether the detailed structure of galactic disks
is as excited as predicted by the CDM paradigm.

produce space charges, due to the divergence of the spontaneous polarization.
These space charges interact with mobile ions, so that one must consider the
coupled dynamics of the orientation and ionic degrees of freedom. Previous
theory and light scattering experiments on thin free-standing films of
ferroelectric liquid crystals have not included this coupling, possibly
invalidating their quantitative conclusions. We consider the most important
case of very slow ionic dynamics, compared to rapid orientational fluctuations,
and focus on the use of a short electric field pulse to quench orientational
fluctuations. We find that the resulting change in scattered light intensity
must include a term due to the quasistatic ionic configuration, which has
previously been ignored. In addition to developing the general theory, we
present a simple model to demonstrate the role of this added term.

orbital period (P = 1.87844 days), minimum masses (M_1 sin^3 i = 0.35 M_sun and
M_2 sin^3 i =0.33 M_sun) and other orbital parameters. The photometric
observations exhibit a sinusoidal variation with the same period as the orbital
period. We interpret this as signs of active regions carried along with
rotation in a tidally synchronized system, and study the evolution of the
amplitude of the modulation in longer timescales. Together with the mean
magnitude, the modulation exhibits a roughly cyclic variation with a period of
around 800 days. This periodicity is also found in the flux of the Ca II K
lines of both components, which seem to be in phase. The periodic changes in
the three observables are interpreted as a sign of a stellar activity cycle.
Both components appear to be in phase, which implies that they are magnetically
connected. The measured cycle of approximately 2.2 years (800 days) is
consistent with previous determinations of activity cycles in similar stars.

controllability, provide an attractive system for quantum information
processing and for simulation of complex problems in condensed matter physics.
Many quantum information processing schemes require that individual qubits be
manipulated and deterministically entangled with one another, a process that
would typically be accomplished by controlled, state-dependent, coherent
interactions among qubits. Recent experiments have made progress toward this
goal by demonstrating entanglement among an ensemble of atoms confined in an
optical lattice. Until now, however, there has been no demonstration of a key
operation: controlled entanglement between atoms in isolated pairs. We have
used an optical lattice of double-well potentials to isolate and manipulate
arrays of paired atoms, inducing controlled entangling interactions within each
pair. Our experiment is the first realization of proposals to use controlled
exchange coupling in a system of neutral atoms. Although 87Rb atoms have nearly
state-independent interactions, when we force two atoms into the same physical
location, the wavefunction exchange symmetry of these identical bosons leads to
state-dependent dynamics. We observe repeated interchange of spin between atoms
occupying different vibrational levels, with a coherence time of more than ten
milliseconds. This observation represents the first demonstration of the
essential component of a quantum SWAP gate in neutral atoms. The ""half
implementation"" of SWAP, the sqrt(SWAP) gate, is entangling, and together with
single qubit rotations form a set of universal gates for quantum computation.

chains (Rouse model), and polymers in good and poor solvents. We show for the
Rouse model, using a modification of the theory of Szabo, Schulten, and
Schulten, that the time scale for cyclization is $\tau_c\sim \tau_0 N^2$ (where
$\tau_0$ is a microscopic time scale and $N$ is the number of monomers),
provided the coupling between the relaxation dynamics of the end-to-end vector
and the looping dynamics is taken into account. The resulting analytic
expression fits the simulation results accurately when $a$, the capture radius
for contact formation, exceeds $b$, the average distance between two connected
beads. Simulations also show that, when $a < b$, $\tau_c\sim N^{\alpha_\tau}$,
where $1.5<{\alpha_\tau}\le 2$ in the range $7<N<200$ used in the simulations.
By using a diffusion coefficient that is dependent on the length scales $a$ and
$b$ (with $a<b$), which captures the two-stage mechanism by which looping
occurs when $a < b$, we obtain an analytic expression for $\tau_c$ that fits
the simulation results well. The kinetics of contact formation between the ends
of the chain are profoundly affected when interactions between monomers are
taken into account. Remarkably, for $N < 100$ the values of $\tau_c$ decrease
by more than two orders of magnitude when the solvent quality changes from good
to poor. Fits of the simulation data for $\tau_c$ to a power law in $N$
($\tau_c\sim N^{\alpha_\tau}$) show that $\alpha_\tau$ varies from about 2.4 in
a good solvent to about 1.0 in poor solvents. Loop formation in poor solvents,
in which the polymer adopts dense, compact globular conformations, occurs by a
reptation-like mechanism of the ends of the chain.

better than about 100 micro-arcseconds at each of the twelve observed epochs.
The trajectory of T Tau Sb on the plane of the sky could, therefore, be traced

for disk galaxies is the buildup of dense central components that get mistaken
for classical (i.e., merger-built) bulges but that were grown out of disk stars

is made that in view of the many examples of unconventional superconductors

superconductivity emerges as a highly competitive ground state in systems where
Coulomb repulsion plays a dominant role. The physics of the cuprates is
discussed, emphasizing the unusual pseudogap phase in the underdoped region. It
is argued that the resonating valence bond (RVB) picture, as formulated using
gauge theory with fermionic and bosonic matter fields, gives an adequate
physical understanding, even though many details are beyond the powers of
current calculational tools. The recent discovery of quantum oscillations in a
high magnetic field is discussed in this context. Meanwhile, the problem of the
quantum spin liquid (a spin system with antiferromagnetic coupling which
refuses to order even at zero temperature) is a somewhat simpler version of the
high $T_c$ problem where significant progress has been made recently. It is
understood that the existence of matter fields can lead to de-confinement of
the U(1) gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions, and novel new particles (called
fractionalized particles), such as fermionic spinons which carry spin ${1\over
2}$ and no charge, and gapless gauge bosons can emerge to create a new critical
state at low energies. We even have a couple of real materials where such a
scenario may be realized experimentally. The article ends with answers to
questions such as: what limits $T_c$ if pairing is driven by an electronic
energy scale? why is the high $T_c$ problem hard? why is there no consensus?
and why is the high $T_c$ problem important?

open system dynamics are fully controllable, it is shown that the control
landscape for open systems can be lifted to the analysis of an equivalent
auxiliary landscape of a closed composite system that contains the
environmental interactions. This inherent connection can be analyzed to provide
relevant information about the topology of the original open system landscape.
Application to the optimization of an observable expectation value reveals the
same landscape simplicity observed in former studies on closed systems. In
particular, no false sub-optimal traps exist in the system control landscape
when seeking to optimize an observable, even in the presence of complex

solving the discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) numerically. In

excitation method that is dependent on the atomic internal states and used to
generate approximately a standard coherent state of harmonic oscillator. The
coherent average method then is proposed to construct the state-selective
trigger pulse. A state-selective trigger pulse can keep Gaussian shape
unchanged but change in an internal-state-dependent form the center-of-mass
position and/or momentum of an atomic Gaussian wave-packet motional state. A
Gaussian wave-packet state is one of the simplest wave-packet states that can
be easily manipulated and controlled in time and space. The paper also
investigates how to manipulate in time and space an atomic Gaussian wave-packet
motional state by a generalized quadratic potential field. A general quadratic
Hamiltonian can affect not only the center-of-mass position and momentum but
also the complex linewidth of a Gaussian wave-packet motional state while keep
Gaussian shape of the motional state unchanged. It is shown that generally
quadratic terms of a quadratic Hamiltonian can control directly the complex
linewidth, while linear terms of a quadratic Hamiltonian can affect only the
center-of-mass position and momentum of a Gaussian wave-packet motional state.

dust grains having various sizes. The rapid growth and fading of the transient

evolution of brightness and chromospheric emission lines during deeply

lensing (early-type) galaxies. By combining two independent techniques -
stellar population synthesis and gravitational lensing - we can compare the
baryonic and dark matter content in these galaxies within the regions that can
be probed using the images of the lensed background source. Two samples were
studied, extracted from the CASTLES and SLACS surveys. The former probes a
wider range of redshifts and allows us to explore the mass distribution out to
~5Re. The high resolution optical images of the latter (using HST/ACS) are used
to show a pixellated map of the ratio between total and baryonic matter. We
find dark matter to be absent in the cores of these galaxies, with an
increasing contribution at projected radii R>Re. The slopes are roughly
compatible with an isothermal slope (better interpreted as an adiabatically
contracted NFW profile), but a large scatter in the slope exists among
galaxies. There is a trend suggesting most massive galaxies have a higher
content of dark matter in the regions probed by this analysis.

than in the coexisting gas at temperature and pressure conditions close to
those of Titan's present atmosphere at ground level. Furthermore we show that,
by contrast, argon is poorly trapped in these ices. This trapping mechanism
implies that the gas-phase is progressively depleted in xenon and krypton when
the coexisting clathrate hydrates form whereas the initial abundance of argon
remains almost constant. Our results are thus compatible with the deficiency of

Neel/dimer spin order. In a broad parameter regime, the orbital
antiferromagnetic phase is found to be stable. An intermediate gapless phase of
finite width is found to lie in between two charge-ordered gapped phases.
Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions are found to lead from the gapless phase to
either of the charge-ordered phases. A detailed analysis is also carried out

critical quantum fluctuations in driving the strong dispersion in the

a ""paramagnetic system"" of a classical theory in the sense that virtual color
charges (gluons) emerges in it as a spin effect of a paramagnetic material when
a magnetic field aligns their microscopic magnetic dipoles. Due to that strong
classical analogy with the paramagnetism of Landau's theory,we will be able to
use a certain Landau effective action without temperature and phase transition
for just representing QCD-vacuum behavior at higher energies as being
magnetization of a paramagnetic material in the presence of a magnetic field
$H$. This reasoning will allow us to apply Thompson's approach to such an
action in order to extract an ""effective susceptibility"" ($\chi>0$) of
QCD-vacuum. It depends on logarithmic of energy scale $u$ to investigate
hadronic matter. Consequently we are able to get an ``effective magnetic
permeability"" ($\mu>1$) of such a ""paramagnetic vacuum"". Actually,as QCD-vacuum
must obey Lorentz invariance,the attainment of $\mu>1$ must simply require that
the ""effective electrical permissivity"" is $\epsilon<1$ in such a way that
$\mu\epsilon=1$ ($c^2=1$). This leads to the anti-screening effect where the
asymptotic freedom takes place. We will also be able to extend our

QED-vacuum (screening) and the paramagnetic bosonic properties of QCD-vacuum

the $\ell_1$ norm of $\beta$--the optimal coefficient path is piecewise linear,
that is, $\partial \hat{\beta}(\lambda)/\partial \lambda$ is piecewise
constant. We derive a general characterization of the properties of (loss $L$,
penalty $J$) pairs which give piecewise linear coefficient paths. Such pairs
allow for efficient generation of the full regularized coefficient paths. We
investigate the nature of efficient path following algorithms which arise. We
use our results to suggest robust versions of the LASSO for regression and
classification, and to develop new, efficient algorithms for existing problems
in the literature, including Mammen and van de Geer's locally adaptive
regression splines.

understand how the assumption of axial symmetry affects reconstructed masses
and stellar motions of systems which are intrinsically not axisymmetric,
whether it leads to a bias and how such a potential bias can be recognised in
models of real galaxies. The mass recovery at the half-light radius depends on
viewing-angle and intrinsic shape: edge-on views allow to reconstruct total
masses with an accuracy between 20% (triaxial/prolate remnants) and 3% (oblate
remnant). Masses of highly flattened, face-on systems are underestimated by up
to 50%. Deviations in local mass densities can be larger where remnants are
strongly triaxial or prolate. Luminous M/L are sensitive to box orbits in the
remnants. Box orbits cause the central kinematics to vary with viewing-angle.
Reconstructed luminous M/L and central masses follow this variation. Luminous
M/L are always underestimated (up to a factor of 2.5). Respective dark halos in
the models can be overestimated by about the same amount, depending again on
viewing angle. Reconstructed velocity anisotropies depend on viewing angle and
on the orbital composition of the remnant. We construct N-body realisations of
the Schwarzschild models to discuss chaotic orbits and the virial equilibrium
in our models. Apparently flattened, rotating ellipticals of intermediate mass
are likely close to both, axial symmetry and edge-on orientation. Our results
imply that Schwarzschild models allow a reconstruction of their masses and

frequently in many scientific fields. A popular method for analyzing such
functional data is ``smoothing first, then estimation.'' That is, statistical
inference such as estimation and hypothesis testing about functional data is
conducted based on the substitution of the underlying individual functions by
their reconstructions obtained by one smoothing technique or another. However,
little is known about this substitution effect on functional data analysis. In
this paper this problem is investigated when the local polynomial kernel (LPK)
smoothing technique is used for individual function reconstructions. We find
that under some mild conditions, the substitution effect can be ignored
asymptotically. Based on this, we construct LPK reconstruction-based estimators
for the mean, covariance and noise variance functions of a functional data set
and derive their asymptotics. We also propose a GCV rule for selecting good
bandwidths for the LPK reconstructions. When the mean function also depends on
some time-independent covariates, we consider a functional linear model where
the mean function is linearly related to the covariates but the covariate
effects are functions of time. The LPK reconstruction-based estimators for the
covariate effects and the covariance function are also constructed and their
asymptotics are derived. Moreover, we propose a $L^2$-norm-based global test
statistic for a general hypothesis testing problem about the covariate effects
and derive its asymptotic random expression. The effect of the bandwidths
selected by the proposed GCV rule on the accuracy of the LPK reconstructions
and the mean function estimator is investigated via a simulation study. The
proposed methodologies are illustrated via an application to a real functional
data set collected in climatology.

spatial discrete scale invariance (DSI) is considered. Spatial DSI implies the
existence of a fundamental scaling ratio (b_1). We address time-dependent
physical processes, which as a consequence of the time evolution develop a
characteristic length of the form $\xi \propto t^{1/z}$, where z is the dynamic
exponent. So, we conjecture that the interplay between the physical process and
the symmetry properties of the fractal leads to the occurrence of time DSI
evidenced by soft log-periodic modulations of physical observables, with a
fundamental time scaling ratio given by $\tau = b_1 ^z$. The conjecture is
tested numerically for random walks, and representative systems of broad
universality classes in the fields of irreversible and equilibrium critical
phenomena.

they contain. For examples, lists, binary trees, tuples, etc, can be
approximated by sets or multisets of the items within them. Such approximations
can be used to provide partial correctness properties of logic programs. For
example, one might wish to specify than whenever the atom $sort(t,s)$ is proved
then the two lists $t$ and $s$ contain the same multiset of items (that is, $s$
is a permutation of $t$). If sorting removes duplicates, then one would like to
infer that the sets of items underlying $t$ and $s$ are the same. Such results
could be useful to have if they can be determined statically and automatically.
We present a scheme by which such collection analysis can be structured and
automated. Central to this scheme is the use of linear logic as a omputational
logic underlying the logic of Horn clauses.

density estimation experiments and the accompanying Poisson experiments. The
significance of asymptotic equivalence is that all asymptotically optimal
statistical procedures can be carried over from one experiment to the other.
The equivalence given here is established under a weak assumption on the
parameter space $\mathcal{F}$. In particular, a sharp Besov smoothness
condition is given on $\mathcal{F}$ which is sufficient for Poissonization,
namely, if $\mathcal{F}$ is in a Besov ball $B_{p,q}^{\alpha}(M)$ with $\alpha
p>1/2$. Examples show Poissonization is not possible whenever $\alpha p<1/2$.
In addition, asymptotic equivalence of the density estimation model and the
accompanying Poisson experiment is established for all compact subsets of
$C([0,1]^m)$, a condition which includes all H\""{o}lder balls with smoothness
$\alpha>0$.
