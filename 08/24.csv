spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) driven by galactic tides. We adopt a
cosmologically-motivated model where dSphs are approximated by a King model
embedded within an NFW halo. We find that these NFW-embedded King models are
extraordinarily resilient to tides; the stellar density profile still resembles
a King model even after losing more than 99% of the stars. As tides strip the
galaxy, the stellar luminosity, velocity dispersion, central surface
brightness, and core radius decrease monotonically. Remarkably, we find that
the evolution of these parameters is solely controlled by the total amount of
mass lost from within the luminous radius. Of all parameters, the core radius
is the least affected: after losing 99% of the stars, R_c decreases by just a
factor of ~2. Interestingly, tides tend to make dSphs more dark-matter
dominated because the tightly bound central dark matter ``cusp'' is more
resilient to disruption than the ``cored'' King profile. We examine whether the
extremely large M/L ratios of the newly-discovered ultra-faint dSphs might have
been caused by tidal stripping of once brighter systems. Although dSph tidal
evolutionary tracks parallel the observed scaling relations in the
luminosity-radius plane, they predict too steep a change in velocity dispersion
compared with the observational estimates hitherto reported in the literature.
The ultra-faint dwarfs are thus unlikely to be the tidal remnants of systems
like Fornax, Draco, or Sagittarius. Despite spanning four decades in
luminosity, dSphs appear to inhabit halos of comparable peak circular velocity,
lending support to scenarios that envision dwarf spheroidals as able to form
only in halos above a certain mass threshold.

the Schrodinger picture state vectors, viewed as functionals of spacelike

of time evolution are the scalar field energy-momentum densities with a
particular normal-ordering and with a (non-unique) c-number contribution. The
c-number contribution to the Schrodinger equation, called the ``anomaly
potential'', is needed to make the equation integrable in light of the
Schwinger terms present in the commutators of the normal-ordered
energy-momentum densities. Here we give a quantum geometric interpretation of
the anomaly potential. In particular, we show the anomaly potential corresponds
to the expression in a gauge of the natural connection on the bundle of vacuum
states over the space of embeddings of Cauchy curves into the spacetime. The
holonomy of this connection is the geometric phase associated with dynamical
evolution along a closed path in the space of embeddings generated by the
normal-ordered energy-momentum densities. The presence of the anomaly potential
in the functional Schrodinger equation provides a dynamical phase which removes
this holonomy, so that there is no net phase change for quantum transport
around closed loops in the space of embeddings.

stock markets have uncovered market-specific scaling laws, where a master curve
of price impact can be obtained in each market when stock capitalization $C$ is
included as an argument in the scaling relation. However, the rationale of
introducing stock capitalization in the scaling is unclear and the anomalous
negative correlation between price change $r$ and trade size $\omega$ for small
trades is unexplained. Here we show that these issues can be addressed by
taking into account the aggressiveness of orders that result in trades together
with a proper normalization technique. Using order book data from the Chinese
market, we show that trades from filled and partially filled limit orders have
very different price impact. The price impact of trades from partially filled
orders is constant when the volume is not too large, while that of filled
orders shows power-law behavior $r\sim \omega^\alpha$ with $\alpha\approx2/3$.
When returns and volumes are normalized by stock-dependent averages,
capitalization-independent scaling laws emerge for both types of trades.
However, no scaling relation in terms of stock capitalization can be
constructed. In addition, the relation $\alpha=\alpha_\omega/\alpha_r$ is
verified, where $\alpha_\omega$ and $\alpha_r$ are the tail exponents of trade
sizes and returns. These observations also enable us to explain the anomalous
negative correlation between $r$ and $\omega$ for small-size trades. We
anticipate that these regularities may hold in other order-driven markets.

order of a wavelength, and (3) supports a mode with speed-of-light phase
velocity in vacuum. Photonic crystals--structures whose electromagnetic

a superposition of AGN and to place constraints on AGN evolution. We performed
a stacking analysis of the hard X-ray spectra of AGN detected in two recent
all-sky surveys, performed by the IBIS/ISGRI instrument aboard INTEGRAL and by
the PCA instrument aboard RXTE, taking into account the space densities of AGN
with different luminosities and absorption column densities. We derived the
collective SED of local AGN in the 3-300 keV energy band. Those AGN with
luminosities below 10^43.5 erg/s (17-60 keV) provide the main contribution to
the local volume hard X-ray emissivity, at least 5 times more than more
luminous objects. The cumulative spectrum exhibits (although with marginal
significance) a cutoff at energies above 100-200 keV and is consistent with the
CXB spectrum if AGN evolve over cosmic time in such a way that the SED of their
collective high-energy emission has a constant shape and the relative fraction
of obscured AGN remains nearly constant, while the AGN luminosity density
undergoes strong evolution between z~1 and z=0, a scenario broadly consistent
with results from recent deep X-ray surveys. The first direct comparison
between the collective hard X-ray SED of local AGN and the CXB spectrum
demonstrates that the popular concept of the CXB being a superposition of AGN
is generally correct. By repeating this test using improved AGN statistics from
current and future hard X-ray surveys, it should be possible to tighten the
constraints on the cosmic history of black hole growth.

vortex system in high temperature layered superconductors, with magnetic field
normal to the layers, in the presence of a small concentration of strong random
point pinning defects via numerical minimization of a model free energy
functional in terms of the time-averaged local density of pancake vortices.
Working at constant magnetic induction and point pinning center concentration,
we find that the equilibrium phase at low temperature ($T$) and small pinning
strength ($s$) is a topologically ordered Bragg glass. As $T$ or $s$ is
increased, the Bragg glass undergoes a first order transition to a disordered
phase which we characterize as a ``vortex slush'' with polycrystalline
structure within the layers and interlayer correlations extending to about
twenty layers. This is in contrast with the pinned vortex liquid phase into
which the Bragg glass was found to melt, using the same methods, in the case of
a large concentration of weak pinning centers: that phase was amorphous with
very little interlayer correlation. The value of the second moment of the
random pinning potential at which the Bragg glass melts for a fixed temperature
is very different in the two systems. These results imply that the effects of
random point pinning can not be described only in terms of the second moment of
the pinning potential, and that some of the unresolved contradictions in the
literature concerning the nature of the low $T$ and high $s$ phase in this
system are likely to arise from differences in the nature of the pinning in
different samples, or from assumptions made about the pinning potential.

account the open string tachyon which stretches between the flavour D8-branes
and anti D8-branes. There are several reasons of consistency for doing this:
(i) Even if it might be reasonable to ignore the tachyon in the ultraviolet
where the flavour branes and antibranes are well separated and the tachyon is
small, it is likely to condense and acquire large values in the infrared where
the branes meet. This takes the system far away from the perturbatively stable
minimum of the Sakai-Sugimoto model; (ii) The bifundamental coupling of the
tachyon to fermions of opposite chirality makes it a suitable candidate for the
quark mass and chiral condensate parameters. We show that the modified
Sakai-Sugimoto model with the tachyon present has a classical solution
satisfying all the desired consistency properties. In this solution chiral
symmetry breaking coincides with tachyon condensation. We identify the
parameters corresponding to the quark mass and the chiral condensate and also
briefly discuss the mesonic spectra.

However, one may envisage that in alternative theories of gravity, the

coupling of matter to metric perturbations, can run on the cosmological horizon
scale. In this letter, we study the consequences of a glitch in the Planck mass
from sub-horizon to super-horizon scales. We first give three examples of

form of a cubic equation in the (H^2,(\rho+\sigma)^2) plane, where \sigma is
the brane tension and \rho is the matter density. This allows us to conduct a
comprehensive pictorial analysis of cosmological evolution for the Gauss-Bonnet
brane. The many interesting properties of this braneworld include the
possibility of accelerated expansion at late times. For a finite region in
parameter space the accelerated expansion can be phantom-like so that w < -1.
At late times, this branch approaches de Sitter space (w = -1) and avoids the
big-rip singularities usually present in phantom models. For a time-like extra
dimension the Gauss-Bonnet brane can bounce and avoid the initial singularity.

ionization in the ejecta. Emergent spectra are different depending on viewing

global gravitational instability. The observed gas surface density is commonly
used to compute the strength of gravitational instability, but according to
this criterion star formation often appears to occur in gravitationally stable
regions. One possible reason is that the stellar contribution to the
instability has been neglected. We have examined the gravitational instability
of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) considering the gas alone, and considering
the combination of collisional gas and collisionless stars. We compare the
gravitationally unstable regions with the on-going star formation revealed by
Spitzer observations of young stellar objects. Although only 62% of the massive
young stellar object candidates are in regions where the gas alone is unstable,
some 85% lie in regions unstable due to the combination of gas and stars. The
combined stability analysis better describes where star formation occurs. In
agreement with other observations and numerical models, a small fraction of the
star formation occurs in regions with gravitational stability parameter Q > 1.
We further measure the dependence of the star formation timescale on the
strength of gravitational instability, and quantitatively compare it to the
exponential dependence expected from numerical simulations.

their continuous opinions as a result of random pairwise encounters whenever
their opinions differ not more than a given bound of confidence $\eps$. A high
$\eps$ leads to consensus, while a lower $\eps$ leads to a fragmentation into
several opinion clusters. We drop the random encounter assumption and ask: How
small may $\eps$ be such that consensus is still possible with a certain
communication plan for the entire group? Mathematical analysis shows that
$\eps$ may be significantly smaller than in the random pairwise case. On the
other hand we ask: How large may $\eps$ be such that preventing consensus is
still possible? In answering this question we prove Fortunato's simulation
result that consensus cannot be prevented for $\eps>0.5$ for large groups. %
Next we consider opinion dynamics under different individual strategies and
examine their power to increase the chances of consensus. One result is that
balancing agents increase chances of consensus, especially if the agents are
cautious in adapting their opinions. However, curious agents increase chances
of consensus only if those agents are not cautious in adapting their opinions.

ks) XMM-Newton data. The most obvious feature of the X-ray morphology of A3128
is the presence of two X-ray peaks separated by ~12'. By detecting the
redshifted Fe K line, we find that the Northeast (NE) X-ray peak observed
toward A3128 is a distant luminous cluster of galaxies at redshift z=0.44. Our
subsequent optical spectroscopic observation of a distant radio bright galaxy
in the centre of the NE X-ray peak with the Magellan telescope also revealed a
redshift of z=0.44, confirming the association of the galaxy with the cluster
seen in X-rays. We detect a gravitational arc around the galaxy. The properties
of this galaxy indicate that it is the cD galaxy of the cluster in the
background. The properties of the Southwest X-ray peak suggest that it is the
core of a group merging with A3128 along our line of sight. Based on 2D maps of
thermodynamic properties of the intra-cluster medium determined after
subtracting a model for the background cluster, we conclude that an enhanced
surface brightness region at a distance of ~2.8' from the centre of the galaxy
distribution is the centre of the gravitational potential of the cluster A3128.
The unrelaxed nature of A3128 can be attributed to its location in the high
density environment of the Horologium-Reticulum supercluster.

expressions involving unions and intersections of sets can be computed in a
worst-case efficient way. This problem has applications in e.g. information
retrieval and database systems. We mainly consider the RAM model of
computation, and sets of machine words, but also state our results in the I/O
model. On a RAM with word size $w$, a special case of our result is that the
intersection of $m$ (preprocessed) sets, containing $n$ elements in total, can
be computed in expected time $O(n (\log w)^2 / w + km)$, where $k$ is the
number of elements in the intersection. If the first of the two terms
dominates, this is a factor $w^{1-o(1)}$ faster than the standard solution of
merging sorted lists. We show a cell probe lower bound of time $\Omega(n/(w m
\log m)+ (1-\tfrac{\log k}{w}) k)$, meaning that our upper bound is nearly
optimal for small $m$. Our algorithm uses a novel combination of approximate
set representations and word-level parallelism.

low-mass star. Recently, a new class of these systems, known as symbiotic
$X$-ray binaries (with a neutron star with a M-type giant companion), has been
discovered. Here, we present long-duration ${\it XMM}$ observations of the
source 1RXS J180431.1-273932. Temporal and spectral analysis of the source was
performed along with a search for an optical counterpart. We used a
Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis for the period search and evaluated the
confidence level using Monte-Carlo simulations. The source is characterized by
regular pulses so that it is most likely a neutron star. A modulation of
$494.1\pm0.2$ s (3$\sigma$ error) was found with a confidence level of $>$99%.
Evidence of variability is also present, since the data show a rate of change
in the signal of $\sim -7.7\times 10^{-4}$ counts s$^{-1}$ hr$^{-1}$. A longer
observation will be necessary in order to determine if the source shows any
periodic behavior. The spectrum can be described by a power law with photon
index $\Gamma\sim 1$ and a Gaussian line at 6.6 keV. The X-ray flux in the
0.2--10 keV energy band is $5.4\times 10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. The
identification of an optical counterpart (possibly an M6III red-giant star with
an apparent visual magnitude of $\simeq 17.6$) allows a conservative distance
of $\sim 10$ kpc to be estimated. Other possibilities are also discussed. Once
the distance was estimated, we got an $X$-ray luminosity of $L_X\ut<6\times

of a symbiotic LMXB system.

associated with the horizon and flatness problems has recently been shown to be
exponentially small, within the context of classical general relativity. Here
this result is extended by considering loop quantum gravity effects, that are
significant at small scales. In addition to accounting for high-energy
departures from classicality, it is shown that, in contrast to the classical
case, the loop quantum cosmological probability measure is naturally finite, at
least in some well defined region. It is also shown that these loop quantum
gravity corrections can overcome the classical suppression of the probability
only for extremely unnatural choices of ambiguity parameters, implying that
single field, slow-roll inflation is exponentially unlikely.

a result of gas interactions between the bar orbits, whereas region C lies at
the edge of the bar and regions D and E are located further out from the
nucleus but heavily obscured. We derive extremely high interstellar densities,
corresponding to ISM pressures of P/k ~ 0.5-1.0 x 10^7 cm^-3 K, and discuss the
implications of the measured gas properties surrounding the nuclear star
clusters on the production and evolution of the galactic wind. Despite varying
pressures, the ionization parameter is uniform down to parsec-scales, and we
discuss why this might be so. Where the S/N of our spectra are high enough, we
identify multiple emission-line components. Through detailed Gaussian
line-fitting, we identify a ubiquitous broad (200-300 km/s) underlying
component to the bright H_alpha line, and discuss the physical mechanism(s)

of Monte Carlo simulations, Flory-type scaling theory, mean-field
approximations and lattice enumeration techniques, we obtain a phase diagram in
which collapsed and inflated phases are separated by a continuous transition.
The scaling properties of the averaged area as a function of the number of

the area is calculated for both discrete and lattice versions of the model. For
small pressures, the area is obtained through a mapping onto the quantum

gauge coupling. We show that a scalar unparticle of scaling dimension d
contributes to the \beta function a term that is (2-d) times that from a scalar
particle in the same representation. This result has important implications on
asymptotic freedom. An unparticle with d>2, in contrast to its matter
counterpart, can speed up the approach to asymptotic freedom for a non-Abelian
gauge theory and has the tendency to make an Abelian theory also asymptotically
free. For not spoiling the excellent agreement of the standard model (SM) with
precision tests, the infrared cut-off, m, of such an unparticle would be high
but might still be reachable at colliders such as LHC and ILC. Furthermore, if
the unparticle scale \Lambda_\calU is high enough, unparticles could
significantly modify the unification pattern of the SM gauge couplings. For
instance, with 3 scalar unparticles of d\sim 2.5 in the adjoint representation
of the strong gauge group but neutral under the electroweak one, the three
gauge couplings would unify at a scale of \sim 8\times 10^{12} {\rm GeV}, which
is several orders of magnitude below the supersymmetric unification scale.

total energy of the system fixed. It turns out that the relaxation rate

We study the X-ray emission from LSI +61 303 covering both short-term and

the orbital phase shows a clear modulation pattern at the 26.5 days period and
suggests that the X-ray peak occurs around phase 0.65. Moreover, the X-ray
emission appears to be variable on a timescale of ~1 ks. The cumulative
spectrum is well described by an absorbed power-law model, with hydrogen column

stationary sequence of Gaussian random variables, we give optimal conditions on
the spectral measure for our criteria to be applicable. In particular, we show
that under a certain assumption on the spectral density, our assumptions can be
checked in virtually the same way as one would check that the Markov process
obtained by replacing the driving sequence by a sequence of independent
identically distributed Gaussian random variables is strong Feller and
topologically irreducible. The results of the present article are based on
those obtained previously in the continuous time context of diffusions driven
by fractional Brownian motion.

combinatorial methods and results similar to Iarrobino's are proved for a

specialized partially ordered sets having interesting combinatorial properties,
is identified. For this class of L-Matrices, necessary and sufficient
