dynamical systems that extends rate distortion theory to use causal
shielding---a natural principle of learning. We study two distinct cases of
causal inference: optimal causal filtering and optimal causal estimation.
  Filtering corresponds to the ideal case in which the probability distribution
of measurement sequences is known, giving a principled method to approximate a
system's causal structure at a desired level of representation. We show that,
in the limit in which a model complexity constraint is relaxed, filtering finds
the exact causal architecture of a stochastic dynamical system, known as the
causal-state partition. From this, one can estimate the amount of historical
information the process stores. More generally, causal filtering finds a graded
model-complexity hierarchy of approximations to the causal architecture. Abrupt
changes in the hierarchy, as a function of approximation, capture distinct
scales of structural organization.
  For nonideal cases with finite data, we show how the correct number of
underlying causal states can be found by optimal causal estimation. A
previously derived model complexity control term allows us to correct for the
effect of statistical fluctuations in probability estimates and thereby avoid
over-fitting.

on the Lie algebra of the group and its Euler-Poincar\'e equations are defined
on the dual Lie algebra, where dual is defined by the operation of taking
variational derivative. On the Hamiltonian side, the Euler-Poincar\'e equations
are Lie-Poisson and they possess accompanying momentum maps, which encode both
their conservation laws and the geometry of their solution space.
  The standard Euler-Poincar\'e examples are treated, including particle
dynamics, the rigid body, the heavy top and geodesic motion on Lie groups.
Additional topics deal with Fermat's principle, the $\mathbb{R}^3$ Poisson
bracket, polarized optical traveling waves, deformable bodies (Riemann
ellipsoids) and shallow water waves, including the integrable shallow water
wave systems associated with geodesic motion on the diffeomorphisms. The

ideal fluid dynamics. This theorem introduces the Euler--Poincar\'e variational
principle for incompressible and compressible motions of ideal fluids, with
applications to geophysical fluids. It also leads to their Lie-Poisson
Hamiltonian formulation.

hamiltonians towards a band-diagonal form produce few-body interactions in
which low- and high-energy states are decoupled, which can greatly simplify
many-body calculations. One such transformation has been applied to
phenomenological and effective field theory nucleon-nucleon interactions with
success, but further progress requires consistent treatment of at least the
three-nucleon interaction. In this paper we demonstrate in an extremely simple
model how these renormalization group transformations consistently evolve two-
and three-body interactions towards band-diagonal form, and introduce a
diagrammatic approach that generalizes to the realistic nuclear problem.

regulates star formation in nearby cosmological halos at $z \sim$ 20 by
photoevaporation. Our models include nine-species primordial chemistry and
self-consistent multifrequency conservative transfer of UV photons with all
relevant radiative processes. Whether or not new stars form in halos clustered
around a Population III star ultimately depends on their core densities and
proximity to the star. Diffuse halos with central densities below 2 - 3
cm$^{-3}$ are completely ionized and evaporated anywhere in the cluster.
Evolved halos with core densities above 2000 cm$^{-3}$ are impervious to both
ionizing and Lyman-Werner flux at most distances from the star and collapse as
quickly as they would in its absence. Star formation in halos of intermediate
density can be either promoted or suppressed depending on how the I-front
remnant shock compresses, deforms and enriches the core with H$_2$. We find
that the 120 M$_\odot$ star photodissociates H$_2$ in most halos in the cluster
but that catalysis by H- restores it a few hundred kyr after the death of the
star, with little effect on star formation. Our models exhibit significant
departures from previous one-dimensional spherically-symmetric simulations,
which are prone to serious errors due to unphysical geometric focusing effects.

scattered from interstellar clouds can be mapped over large areas. The surface
brightness carries information on the line-of-sight dust column density.
Therefore, scattered light could provide an important tool to study mass
distribution in quiescent interstellar clouds at a high, even sub-arcsecond
resolution. We wish to confirm the assumption that light scattering dominates
the surface brightness in all NIR bands. Furthermore, we want to show that
scattered light can be used for an accurate estimation of dust column densities
in clouds with Av in the range 1-15mag. We have obtained NIR images of a
quiescent filament in the Corona Australis molecular cloud. The observations
provide maps of diffuse surface brightness in J, H, and Ks bands. Using the
assumption that signal is caused by scattered light we convert surface
brightness data into a map of dust column density. The same observations
provide colour excesses for a large number of background stars. These data are
used to derive an extinction map of the cloud. The two, largely independent
tracers of the cloud structure are compared. Results. In regions below Av=15m
both diffuse surface brightness and background stars lead to similar column
density estimates. The existing differences can be explained as a result of
normal observational errors and bias in the sampling of extinctions provided by
the background stars. There is no indication that thermal dust emission would
have a significant contribution even in the Ks band. The results show that,
below Av=15mag, scattered light does provide a reliable way to map cloud
structure. Compared with the use of background stars it can also in practice
provide a significantly higher spatial resolution.

solar spectra of the PI lines of Multiplet 1 at 1051-1068 nm are compared to
line formation computations performed on a co5bold solar model atmosphere.
results: We find A(P)=5.46+- 0.04, in good agreement with previous analysis
based on 1D model atmospheres, due to the fact that the PI lines of Mult. 1 are
little affected by 3D effects. We cannot confirm an earlier claim by other
authors of a downward revision of the solar P abundance by 0.1 dex employing a
3D model atmosphere. Concerning other stars, we found modest (<0.1 dex) 3D
abundance corrections for P among four F dwarf model atmospheres of different
metallicity, being largest at lowest metallicity. conclusions: We conclude that
3D abundance corrections are generally rather small for the PI lines studied in
this work. They are marginally relevant for metal-poor stars, but may be
neglected in the Sun.

for the production process of cosmic rays which accounts for such behavior in a
natural way either by assuming existence of temperature fluctuations in the

Both possibilities yield the so called Tsallis statistics and lead to the
power-like distribution. We argue that the ""knee"" structure arises as result of
abrupt change of fluctuations in the source of CR. Its possible origin is
briefly discussed.
