the abundances in EC2 and they indicate that: heavy element abundances may be
reduced by a factor of five relative to the solar neighbourhood (similar to
dwarf irregular galaxies and damped Lyman alpha systems); very low extinction
(Av < 4 mag) due to a very low dust-to-gas ratio; an enhanced cosmic ray
ionisation rate; and a higher UV field compared to local interstellar values.
The reduced abundances may be attributed to the low level of star formation in
this region and are probably also related to the continuing infall of
primordial (or low metallicity) halo gas since the Milky Way formed. Finally,
we note that shocks from the old supernova remnant GSH 138-01-94 may have
determined the morphology and dynamics of EC2.

We present a model for this material based on a quasi-quartet of Yb$^{3+}$
crystalline electric field (CEF) states and discuss its mean field solution.
Taking into account the broadening of the specific heat jump at $T_0$ for
magnetic field perpendicular to [001] and the decrease of $T_0$ with magnetic
field parallel to [001], it is shown that ferro-quadrupole order of either
O$_{2}^{2}$ or O$_{\rm xy}$ - type are prime candidates for the non-magnetic
transition. Considering the matrix element of these quadrupole moments, we show
that the lower CEF states of the level scheme consist of a $\Gamma_{6}$ and a
$\Gamma_{7}$ doublet. This leads to induced type of O$_{2}^{2}$ and O$_{\rm
xy}$ quadrupolar order parameters. The quadrupolar order introduces exchange
anisotropy for planar magnetic moments. This causes a spin flop transition at
low fields perpendicular [001] which explains the observed metamagnetism. We
also obtain a good explanation for the temperature dependence of magnetic
susceptibility and specific heat for fields both parallel and perpendicular to
the [001] direction.

supporting slowly varying discrete global lopsided modes, which can explain the
observed features of lopsidedness in the stellar discs. Using linearized fluid
dynamical equations with the softened self-gravity and pressure of the
perturbation as the collective effect, we derive self-consistently a quadratic
eigenvalue equation for the lopsided perturbation in the galactic disc. On
solving this, we find that the ground-state mode shows the observed
characteristics of the lopsidedness in a galactic disc, namely the fractional
Fourier amplitude A$_1$ increases smoothly with the radius. These lopsided
patterns precess in the disc with a very slow pattern speed with no preferred
sense of precession. We show that the lopsided modes in the stellar disc are
long-lived because of a substantial reduction ($\sim$ a factor of 10 compared
to the local free precession rate) in the differential precession. The
numerical solution of the equations shows that the ground-state lopsided modes
are either very slowly precessing stationary normal mode oscillations of the
disc or growing modes with a slow growth rate depending on the relative
importance of the collective effect of the self-gravity. N-body simulations are
performed to test the spontaneous growth of lopsidedness in a pure stellar
disc. Both approaches are then compared and interpreted in terms of long-lived
global $m=1$ instabilities, with almost zero pattern speed.

$K_{L}\to\pi^{0}\pi^{0}\gamma$ via the topology
$K_{L}\to\pi^{0}\pi^{0}_D\gamma$ (where $\pi^0_D\to\gamma e^+e^-$). Due to Bose
statistics of the $\pi^0$ pair and the real nature of the photon, the
$K_{L}\to\pi^{0}\pi^{0}\gamma$ decay is restricted to proceed at lowest order
by the CP conserving direct emission (DE) of an E2 electric quadrupole photon.
The rate of this decay is interesting theoretically since chiral perturbation
theory predicts that this process vanishes at level $O(p^4)$. Therefore, this
mode probes chiral perturbation theory at $O(p^6)$. In this paper we report a
determination of an upper limit of $2.43\times 10^{-7}$ (90% CL) for
$K_{L}\to\pi^{0}\pi^{0}\gamma$. This is approximately a factor of 20 lower than

of Clavel et al. (2000) galaxy sample, which is divided into 26 type 1 (< or =

resolution of the images allow us to separate the nuclear and the extended
contributions to the total emission after decomposing the brightness profiles
into different morphological components. The most common components are a
central point source (identified as the active nucleus) and an exponential
disk. In some cases a bulge, a bar or a ring are needed. The relative
contribution of the nucleus to the total emission appears larger in Seyfert 1
than in Seyfert 2. This result confirms that both types of Seyfert galaxies are
different in the mid-infrared and supports the existence of an structure which
produces anisotropic emission in this wavelength range. We have also explored
correlations between the mid-infrared and the radio and X-ray wavelength
ranges. The well established radio/infrared correlation is mantained in our
sample for the global emission of the galaxies. If only the nuclear infrared
emission is considered then a non-linear correlation is apparent in the
luminosity-luminosity scatter diagram. The ratio between the intrinsic hard
X-ray and the nuclear mid-infrared emission presents large scatter and slightly
larger values for type 2 Seyfert galaxies. These results seem to be consistent
with the presence of a clumpy dusty torus surrounding the active nucleus.

the protoypical LBV in our sample, we marginally resolve structure close to the
star, distinct from the well-studied detached nebula. The dust shells around
the two WC stars show fairly constant size in the 8-13 micron MIDI band, with
gaussian half-widths of ~ 25 to 40 mas. The compact dust we detect around NaSt1
and AG Car favors recent or ongoing dust formation.
  Using the measured visibilities, we build spherically symmetric radiative
transfer models of the WC dust shells which enable detailed comparison with
existing SED-based models. Our results indicate that the inner radii of the
shells are within a few tens of AU from the stars. In addition, our models
favor grain size distributions with large (~ 1 micron) dust grains. This
proximity of the inner dust to the hot central star emphasizes the difficulty
faced by current theories in forming dust in the hostile environment around WR
stars. Although we detect no direct evidence for binarity for these objects,
dust production in a colliding-wind interface in a binary system is a feasible
mechanism in WR systems under these conditions.

field. In this article we examine two metrics that can be considered the
general relativistic version of the infinite plane with finite mass per unit
area. The first metric is the 4D version of the 5D ""brane"" world models which
are the starting point for many current research papers. The second case is the
cosmological domain wall metric. We examine to what extent these different
metrics match or deviate from our Newtonian intuition about the gravitational
field of an infinite plane. These solutions provide the beginning student in
general relativity both computational practice and conceptual insight into
Einstein's field equations. In addition they do this by introducing the student
to material that is at the forefront of current research.

fundamentally a change in the topology of ionized regions. Before overlap,
ionized bubbles grew in isolation. During overlap, they merge into a
percolating ionized medium, which fills an ever-increasing volume and
eventually replaces neutral gas throughout the intergalactic medium. Overlap
can therefore be well studied using topological statistics, and in particular
the genus number of the neutral-ionized interface. The most promising
observational tools for applying such tests are (a) Lyman alpha galaxies, and
(b) 21 cm tomography. Lyman alpha galaxies will be detected whenever they
inhabit bubbles larger than 1 physical Mpc, and their presence can therefore be
used to map such bubbles. Such large bubbles are expected during the overlap
phase, and moreover, each one should contain a few detectably bright Lyman
alpha galaxies. The 21cm line in principle affords better spatial resolution,
but the required sensitivity and foreground subtraction may be an issue.
Upcoming Lyman alpha surveys in the near-infrared could thus provide our first
look at the topology of reionization.

proposed by Cai [arXiv:0707.4049] by relating the energy density of quantum

where $n\sim {\cal O}(1)$ and t is the cosmic time, to the present day dark
energy density. In this note, we show that the model can be adjusted to the
present values of dark energy density parameter $\Omega_q$ ($\simeq 0.73$) and
the equation of state ${\rm w}\Z{q}$ ($\simeq -1$) only if the numerical
coefficient $n$ takes a reasonably large value ($n\gtrsim 3$) or the present
value of the gravitational coupling of q-field to (dark) matter is also
nonzero, namely, $\tilde{Q}\simeq \frac{2}{n}(\Omega\Z{q0})^{3/2}>0$ where
$\Omega\Z{q0}$ is the present value of dark energy density fraction. We also
discuss some of the difficulties of this proposal as a viable dark energy model
with a constant $n$; especially, the bound imposed on the dark energy density
parameter $\Omega_q <0.1$ during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) requires $n<
1/6$. To overcome this drawback, we outline a few modifications where such
constraints can be weakened or relaxed. Finally, by establishing a
correspondence between the agegraphic dark energy scenario and the standard
scalar-field model, we also point out some interesting features of an
agegraphic quintessence model.

wants to locate a sync pattern at the output of a channel on the basis of

being emitted at a random time within some interval of size A, that
characterizes the asynchronism level between the transmitter and the receiver.
We show that a sequential decoder can optimally locate the sync pattern, i.e.,
exactly, without delay, and with probability approaching one as N tends to
infinity, if and only if the asynchronism level grows as O(exp(N*k)), with k
below the `synchronization threshold,' a constant that admits a simple
expression depending on the channel. This constant is the same as the one that
characterizes the limit for reliable asynchronous communication, as was
recently reported by the authors. If k exceeds the synchronization threshold,
any decoder, sequential or non-sequential, locates the sync pattern with an
error that tends to one as N tends to infinity. Hence, a sequential decoder can
locate a sync pattern as well as the (non-sequential) maximum likelihood
decoder that operates on the basis of output sequences of maximum length A+N-1,

that some types of galaxies in pairs have redder colors than ``field'' galaxies
is primarily a selection effect. We select galaxy pairs that are isolated in
their dark matter halos with respect to other massive subhalos (N=2 halos) and
a control sample of isolated galaxies (N=1 halos) for comparison. We then apply
these selection criteria to a volume-limited subset of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift
Survey with M_Bj <= -19 and obtain the first clean measure of the typical
fraction of galaxies affected by triggered star formation and the average
elevation in the star formation rate. We find that 24% (30.5%) of these L^\star

formation that is boosted by a factor of >~ 5 above their average past value,

enhancement. Thus, 14% (20 %) of the galaxies in these close pairs show clear

particularly at low metallicities, is still poorly understood. The latest-type
RSGs in the Magellanic Clouds are cooler than the current evolutionary tracks
allow, occupying the region to the right of the Hayashi limit where stars are
no longer in hydrodynamic equilibrium. We have discovered four Cloud RSGs in
this region that display remarkably similar unusual behavior. All of them show
considerable variations in their V magnitudes and effective temperatures (and
spectral types). Two of these stars, HV 11423 and [M2002] SMC 055188, have been
observed in an M4.5 I state, considerably later and cooler than any other
supergiant in the SMC. These stars suffer dramatic physical changes on
timescales of months - when they are at their warmest, they are also brighter,
more luminous, and show an increased amount of extinction. This variable
extinction is characteristic of the effects of circumstellar dust, and can be
connected with sporadic dust production from these stars in their cooler
states. We suggest that these unusual properties are indicative of an unstable
(and short-lived) evolutionary phase not previously associated with RSGs, and
consider the implications such behavior could have for our understanding of the
latest stages of massive star evolution in low-metallicity environments.

show that a thermal origin for the high brightness temperature, flat spectrum

region is hot and optically-thin. We hence demonstrate that optically-thin
bremsstrahlung from a slow, dense disk wind can make a significant contribution
to the observed levels of radio core emission. This is a much more satisfactory
explanation, particularly for sources where there is no evidence of a jet, than
a sequence of self-absorbed synchrotron components which collectively conspire
to give a flat spectrum. Furthermore, such core phenomena are already observed
directly via milli-arcsecond radio imaging of the Galactic microquasar SS433

be operating at some level in radio-loud quasars and radio galaxies as well

contaminated/dominated by synchrotron emission from jet knots). This
interpretation of radio core emission mandates mass accretion rates that are
substantially higher than Eddington. Moreover, acknowledgment of this mass-loss

mechanism (Begelman et al 2006) for varying the ejection speed and
anti-correlating it with polar angle variations is ruled out. (vii) The speed
of expansion of the plasma bolides in the jets is approximately 0.0024c. These
novel data carry a clear signature of speed variations. They have a simple and
natural interpretation in terms of both angular and speed fluctuations which
are identical on average in the two jets. They complement archival optical data

systematically investigate the jet-like breaks in the X-ray and optical
afterglow lightcurves. We find that not a single burst can be included in the
``Platinum'' sample, in which the data satisfy all the criteria of a jet break.
By releasing one or more requirements to define a jet break, some candidates of
various degrees could be identified. In the X-ray band, 42 out of the 103
well-sampled X-ray lightcurves have a decay slope of the post-break segment
>1.5 (``Bronze'' sample), and 27 of them also satisfy the closure relations of
the forward models (``Silver'' sample). The numbers of the ``Bronze'' and
``Silver'' candidates in the optical lightcurves are 27 and 23, respectively.
Thirteen bursts have well-sampled optical and X-ray lightcurves, but only seven
cases are consistent with an achromatic break, but even in these cases only one
band satisfies the closure relations (``Gold'' sample). The observed break time
in the XRT lightcurves is systematically earlier than that in the optical
bands. All these raise great concerns in interpreting the jet-like breaks as
jet breaks and further inferring GRB energetics from these breaks. By assuming
that these breaks are jet breaks, we perform a similar analysis as previous
work to calculate the jet opening angle (theta_j) and energetics (E_k) with the
``Silver'' and ``Gold'' jet break candidates. The derived E_K distribution
reveals a much larger scatter than the pre-Swift sample. A tentative
anti-correlation between theta_j and E_{K,iso} is found for both the pre-Swift
and Swift GRBs, indicating that the E_K could still be quasi-universal, if the
breaks in discussion are indeed jet breaks(abridge).

  Mechanisms?","26 pages, 4 figures, accepted by Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/522616",,"astro-ph",,"  It is known that there must be some weak form of transport (called cool
bottom processing, or CBP) acting in low mass RGB and AGB stars, adding nuclei,
newly produced near the hydrogen-burning shell, to the convective envelope. We
assume that this extra-mixing originates in a stellar dynamo operated by the
differential rotation below the envelope, maintaining toroidal magnetic fields
near the hydrogen-burning shell. We use a phenomenological approach to the
buoyancy of magnetic flux tubes, assuming that they induce matter circulation
as needed by CBP models. This establishes requirements on the fields necessary
to transport material from zones where some nuclear burning takes place,
through the radiative layer, and into the convective envelope. Magnetic field
strengths are determined by the transport rates needed by CBP for the model
stellar structure of a star of initially 1.5 solar mass, in both the AGB and
RGB phases. The field required for the AGB star in the processing zone is B_0 ~
5x10^6 G; at the base of the convective envelope this yields an intensity B_E <
10^4 G (approximately). For the RGB case, B_0 ~ 5x10^4 to 4x10^5 G, and the
corresponding B_E are ~ 450 to 3500 G. These results are consistent with
existing observations on AGB stars. They also hint at the basis for high field
sources in some planetary nebulae and the very large fields found in some white
dwarfs. It is concluded that transport by magnetic buoyancy should be
considered as a possible mechanism for extra mixing through the radiative zone,
as is required by both stellar observations and the extensive isotopic data on
circumstellar condensates found in meteorites.

commonly considered as a promising model of central engines of gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs). In this model a certain fraction of gravitational binding energy of
accreting matter is deposited to the energy of relativistic jets via neutrino
annihilation and/or magnetic fields. However, some recent studies have
indicated that the energy deposition rate by neutrino annihilation is somewhat
smaller than that needed to power a GRB. To overcome this difficulty,
Ramirez-Ruiz & Socrates (2005) proposed that high energy neutrinos from hot
corona above the accretion disk might enhance the efficiency of energy
deposition. We elucidate the disk corona model in the context of hypercritical
accretion flows. From the energy balance in the disk and the corona, we can
calculate the disk and coronal temperature, Td and Tc, and neutrino spectra,
taking into account the neutrino cooling processes by neutrino-electron
scatterings and neutrino pair productions. The calculated neutrino spectra
consist of two peaks; one by the neutrino emission from the disk and the other
by that from the corona. We find that the disk corona can enhance the
efficiency of energy release but only by a factor of 1.5 or so, unless the
height of the corona is very small, H<<r. This is because the neutrino emission
is very sensitive to the temperature of emitting region, and then the ratio
Tc/Td cannot be so large.

unconventional superconductors (SC) that was proposed in the previous papers.
In this model, the Cooper-pair (CP) field is defined on lattice links in order
to describe d-wave SC. The CP field can be regarded as a U(1) lattice gauge
field, and the SC phase transition takes place as a result of the phase
coherence of the CP field. Effects of the long-range Coulomb interactions
between the CP's and fluctuations of the electromagnetic field are taken into
account. We investigate the phase structure of the model and the critical
behavior by means of the Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the parameter,
which controls the fluxes (vortices) of the CP, strongly influences the phase
structure. In three-dimensional case, the model has rich phase structure. In
particular there is a ""monopole proliferation"" phase transition besides the SC
phase transition. Depending on the parameters, this transition exists within
the SC phase or takes place simultaneously with the SC transition. This new
type of transition is relevant for unconventional SC's with strong spatial
three-dimensionality and to be observed by experiments.

theoretical studies of molecular depletions and enhancements that accompany the
formation of protostars within dense cores. Beyond L1251B, single-dish data are
also presented of a dense core located ~150"" to the east that, in Paper I, was
detected at 850 micron but has no associated point sources at near- and
mid-infrared wavelengths. The relative brightness between molecules, which have
different chemical timescales, suggests it is less chemically evolved than
L1251B. This core may be a site for future star formation, however, since line
profiles of HCO+, CS, and HCN show asymmetry with a stronger blue peak, which
is interpreted as an infall signature.

numerical values of the cross section for the Coulomb scattering of the

approach is that this approach affords us to obtain the results with reliable
Z-dependence and \rho-dependence. The previous fully numerical approach has
made use of the numerical values of the cross section for the scattering of the

glottochronology, compute distance from the percentage of shared ``cognates''.
Cognates are words inferred to have a common historical origin, and subjective

closer the analogy with evolutionary biology and we introduce a genetic

distance among words with same meaning and averaging on all the words contained

reduced and the reproducibility is highly facilitated. We test our method

$\Lambda$ in other exotic possibilities, such as neutrino and boson stars, and
we compare our results to N-body simulations. The astrophysical properties and
configurations found in this article are specific features resulting from the
existence of a dark energy component. Hence, if found in nature would be an
independent probe of a cosmological constant, complementary to other
observations.

this case. Then, progressively, we consider the case where we are given a prior
probability distribution on this nuisance parameter. The marginal likelihood is
then the classical tool in this case. Then, we consider the case where we only
have a fixed number of its moments. Here, we may use the maximum entropy (ME)
principle to assign a prior law and thus go back to the previous case. Finally,
we consider the case where we know only its median. In our knowledge, there is
not any classical tool for this case. We propose then a new tool for this case
based on a recently proposed alternative distribution to the marginal
probability distribution. This new criterion is obtained by first remarking
that the marginal distribution can be considered as the mean value of the
original distribution over the prior probability law of the nuisance parameter,
and then, by using the median in place of the mean. In this paper, we first
summarize the classical tools used for the three first cases, then we give the
precise definition of this new criterion and its properties and, finally,
present a few examples to show the differences of these cases.

AKARI satellite. FIS has four photometric bands at 65, 90, 140, and 160 um, and
uses two kinds of array detectors. The FIS arrays and optics are designed to
sweep the sky with high spatial resolution and redundancy. The actual scan
width is more than eight arcmin, and the pixel pitch is matches the diffraction
limit of the telescope. Derived point spread functions (PSFs) from observations
of asteroids are similar to the optical model. Significant excesses, however,
are clearly seen around tails of the PSFs, whose contributions are about 30% of
the total power. All FIS functions are operating well in orbit, and its
performance meets the laboratory characterizations, except for the two longer
wavelength bands, which are not performing as well as characterized.
Furthermore, the FIS has a spectroscopic capability using a Fourier transform
spectrometer (FTS). Because the FTS takes advantage of the optics and detectors
of the photometer, it can simultaneously make a spectral map. This paper
summarizes the in-flight technical and operational performance of the FIS.

known or are good candidates to display the Struve-Sahade effect (defined as
the apparent strengthening of the secondary spectrum of the binary when the
star is approaching, and the corresponding weakening of the lines when it is
receding).
  We use high resolution optical spectra to determine new orbital solutions and
spectral types of HD 165052, HD 100213, HD 159176 and DH Cep. As good knowledge
of the fundamental parameters of the considered systems is necessary to examine
the Struve-Sahade effect. We then study equivalent width variations in the
lines of both components of these binaries during their orbital cycle.
  In the case of these four systems, variations appear in the equivalent widths
of some lines during the orbital cycle, but the definition given above can any
longer be valid, since it is now clear that the effect modifies the primary
spectrum as much as the secondary spectrum. Furthermore, the lines affected,
and the way in which they are affected, depend on the considered system. For at
least two of them (HD 100213 and HD 159176) these variations probably reflect
the ellipsoidal variable nature of the system.

observe a decrease of the integrated v_2 values above the highest RHIC energy.
Thus, we predict a decrease of v_2 at LHC energies compared to the RHIC
results. This drop is attributed to negative v_2 values for the underlying
parton distributions at low to moderate transverse momenta that develops if the
transverse flow velocity is high enough. At energies above the LHC regime, the
present approach predicts even negative values for the integrated v_2.

co-located multiple antenna setting need not be SSD in a distributed
cooperative communication setting. A relay network with N relays and a single
source-destination pair is called a partially-coherent relay channel (PCRC) if
the destination has perfect channel state information (CSI) of all the channels
and the relays have only the phase information of the source-to-relay channels.
In this paper, first, a new set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a
STBC to be SSD for co-located multiple antenna communication is obtained. Then,
this is extended to a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a
distributed STBC (DSTBC) to be SSD for a PCRC, by identifying the additional
conditions. Using this, several SSD DSTBCs for PCRC are identified among the
known classes of STBCs. It is proved that even if a SSD STBC for a co-located
MIMO channel does not satisfy the additional conditions for the code to be SSD
for a PCRC, single-symbol decoding of it in a PCRC gives full-diversity and
only coding gain is lost. It is shown that when a DSTBC is SSD for a PCRC, then
arbitrary coordinate interleaving of the in-phase and quadrature-phase
components of the variables does not disturb its SSD property for PCRC.
Finally, it is shown that the possibility of {\em channel phase compensation}
operation at the relay nodes using partial CSI at the relays increases the
possible rate of SSD DSTBCs from $\frac{2}{N}$ when the relays do not have CSI
to 1/2, which is independent of N.

the object's broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED). Methods: VHE
observations (~25h live time) of the BL Lac 1ES 0347-121 (redshift z=0.188)
were conducted with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) between
August and December 2006. Contemporaneous X-ray and UV/optical observations
from the SWIFT satellite are used to interpret the SED of the source in terms
of a synchrotron self Compton (SSC) model. Results: An excess of 327 events,
corresponding to a statistical significance of 10.1 standard deviations, is
detected from 1ES 0347-121. Its photon spectrum, ranging from ~250GeV to ~3TeV,
is well described by a power law with a photon index of Gamma = 3.10 +/-
0.23_stat +/- 0.10_sys. The integral flux above 250GeV corresponds to ~2% of
the flux of the Crab Nebula above the same threshold. No VHE flux variability
is detected within the data set. Conclusions: Constraints on the EBL density at
optical to near-infrared wavelengths derived from the photon spectrum of 1ES
0347-121 are close to the strongest limits derived previously. The strong EBL
limits confirm earlier findings, that the EBL density in the near-infrared is
close to the lower limits from source counts. This implies that the universe is
more transparent to VHE gamma-rays than previously believed. An SSC model
provides a reasonable description of the contemporaneous SED.

frustration and an external magnetic field is a system that is characterized by
two sorts of quantum criticalities, not only one. One criticality is the
consequence of intrinsic frustration, and the other one is a result of the
external magnetic field. So the behaviour of each of them in the presence of
the other deserves to be studied. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation in
dimensions higher than one and bond-mean-field theory we examine the interplay
between the field-induced and frustration-induced quantum criticalities in this
system. The present work could constitute a prototype for those systems showing
multiple, perhaps sometimes competing, quantum criticalities. We calculate
several physical quantities like the magnetization and spin susceptibility as
functions of field and temperature.

numerical estimates of the grand potential $\Omega(\beta,\mu)$ for a mixture of
nuclei at low or moderate temperatures $T=\beta^{-1}$ and at many chemical
potentials $\mu.$ The average nucleon number $<{\bf A} >(\beta,\mu)$ then
becomes a continuous variable, allowing extrapolations towards nuclear masses
closer to drip lines. We study the possible concavity of several
thermodynamical functions, such as the free energy and the average energy, as
functions of $<{\bf A} >.$ Concavity, when present in such functions, allows
trivial interpolations and extrapolations providing upper and lower bounds,
respectively, to binding energies. Such bounds define an error bar for the
prediction of binding energies. An extrapolation scheme for such concave
functions is tested. We conclude with numerical estimates of the binding
energies of a few nuclei closer to drip lines.

  D","Phys.Rev.D77:044013,2008","10.1103/PhysRevD.77.044013",,"gr-qc",,"  We present a method to integrate the equations of motion that govern bound,
accelerated orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime. At each instant the true
worldline is assumed to lie tangent to a reference geodesic, called an
osculating orbit, such that the worldline evolves smoothly from one such
geodesic to the next. Because a geodesic is uniquely identified by a set of
constant orbital elements, the transition between osculating orbits corresponds
to an evolution of the elements. In this paper we derive the evolution
equations for a convenient set of orbital elements, assuming that the force
acts only within the orbital plane; this is the only restriction that we impose
on the formalism, and we do not assume that the force must be small. As an
application of our method, we analyze the relative motion of two massive
bodies, assuming that one body is much smaller than the other. Using the hybrid
Schwarzschild/post-Newtonian equations of motion formulated by Kidder, Will,
and Wiseman, we treat the unperturbed motion as geodesic in a Schwarzschild
spacetime whose mass parameter is equal to the system's total mass. The force
then consists of terms that depend on the system's reduced mass. We highlight
the importance of conservative terms in this force, which cause significant
long-term changes in the time-dependence and phase of the relative orbit. From
our results we infer some general limitations of the radiative approximation to
the gravitational self-force, which uses only the dissipative terms in the
force.

As in the case of the air-water system, the bubble-burst gives birth to two
types of droplets: film drops and jet drops. The jet drop formation is observed
with high-speed video. The film drop aerosol is collected on filters and then
characterized by means of SEM, granulometric and gravimetric analyses. Results
are presented and discussed. The quantification of both types of projections
leads to the conclusion that the film drop projections represent the major
source of dust. The amount of film drops greatly decreases with the parent
bubble size. Under 4.5 mm in bubble diameter, no film drops are formed.
Decreasing enough the bubble size would therefore represent an effective
solution for reducing drastically the EAF dust emission.

characterized by their vorticity L. A crossover from a bulk-like to a
mesoscopic behaviour is demonstrated. $C_{\rm p}$ versus H plots exhibit
cascades of phase transitions as L increases or decreases by one unity, with a
strong hysteresis. Phase diagrams of giant vortex states inside the

regimes and phase transitions driven by temperature between vortex states are
thus predicted in the zero field cooled regime before being experimentally

addition to the Newtonian gravity exerted by a large central body, the particle
is subjected to an electromagnetic self-force that contains both a conservative
piece and a radiation-reaction piece. This toy problem shares many of the
features of the strong-field gravitational self-force problem, and it is
sufficiently simple that it can be solved exactly with numerical methods, and
approximately with analytical methods. We submit the equations of motion to a
multi-scale analysis, and we examine the roles of the conservative and
radiation-reaction pieces of the self-force. We show that the
radiation-reaction force drives secular changes in the orbit's semilatus rectum
and eccentricity, while the conservative force drives a secular regression of
the periapsis and affects the orbital time function; neglect of the
conservative term can hence give rise to an important phasing error. We next
examine what might be required in the formulation of a reliable adiabatic
approximation for the orbital evolution; this would capture all secular changes
in the orbit and discard all irrelevant oscillations. We conclude that such an
approximation would be very difficult to formulate without prior knowledge of
the exact solution.

the Taurus-Auriga T association that are members of the same moving group. We
use these new parallaxes to re-address the issue of the relationship between
classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) and weak-emission line T Tauri stars (WTTSs).
With the available spectroscopic and photometric information for 72 individual
stars or stellar systems among the Taurus-Auriga objects with known parallaxes,
we derived reliable photospheric luminosities, mainly from the Ic magnitude of
these objects. We then studied the mass and age distributions of the stellar
sample, using pre-main sequence evolutionary models to determine the basic
properties of the stellar sample. Statistical tests and Monte Carlo simulations
were then applied to studying the properties of the two T Tauri subclasses. We
find that the probability of CTTS and WTTS samples being drawn from the same
parental age and mass distributions is low; CTTSs are, on average, younger than
WTTSs. They are also less massive, but this is due to selection effects. The
observed mass and age distributions of both T Tauri subclasses can be
understood in the framework of a simple disk evolution model, assuming that the
CTTSs evolve into WTTSs when their disks are fully accreted by the stars.
According to this empirical model, the average disk lifetime in Taurus-Auriga
is 4 10**6 (Mstar/Msun)**0.75 yr.
