a homogeneous distribution of electrons that are injected as a power-law in
energy and evolve by interacting with radiation fields, magnetic fields and
particles in the source and by escaping. This problem is particularly
complicated if the radiation fields have higher energy density than the
magnetic field and are sufficiently energetic that inverse Compton scattering
is not limited to the Thomson regime. We present a simple, time-dependent,
semi-analytical solution of the electron kinetic equation that treats both
continuous and impulsive injection, cooling via synchrotron and inverse Compton
radiation, (taking into account Klein-Nishina effects) and energy dependent
particle escape. The kinetic equation for an arbitrary, time-dependent source
function is solved by the method of Laplace transformations. Using an
approximate expression for the energy loss rate that takes into account
synchrotron and inverse Compton losses including Klein-Nishina effects for
scattering off an isotropic photon field with either a power-law or black-body
distribution, we find explicit expressions for the cooling time and escape
probability of individual electrons. This enables the full, time-dependent
solution to be reduced to a single quadrature. From the electron distribution,
we then construct the time-dependent, multi-wavelength emission spectrum. We
compare our solutions with several limiting cases and discuss the general
appearance and temporal behaviour of spectral features (i.e., cooling breaks,
bumps etc.). As a specific example, we model the broad-band energy spectrum of
the open stellar association Westerlund-2 at different times of its evolution,
and compare it with observations.

Minor changes from version 1",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12570.x",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a simple and efficient empirical algorithm for constructing
dark-matter halo merger trees that reproduce the distribution of trees in the
Millennium cosmological $N$-body simulation. The generated trees are
significantly better than EPS trees. The algorithm is Markovian, and it
therefore fails to reproduce the non-Markov features of trees across short time
steps, except for an accurate fit to the evolution of the average main
progenitor. However, it properly recovers the full main progenitor distribution
and the joint distributions of all the progenitors over long-enough time steps,
$\Delta \omega \simeq \Delta z>0.5$, where $\omega \simeq 1.69/D(t)$ is the
self-similar time variable and $D(t)$ refers to the linear growth of density
fluctuations. We find that the main progenitor distribution is log-normal in
the variable $\sigma^2(M)$, the variance of linear density fluctuations in a
sphere encompassing mass $M$. The secondary progenitors are successfully drawn
one by one from the remaining mass using a similar distribution function. These
empirical findings may be clues to the underlying physics of merger-tree
statistics. As a byproduct, we provide useful, accurate analytic time-invariant
approximations for the main progenitor accretion history and for halo merger
rates.

type IIA string theory. In the naive large N limit of the IIB matrix model,
configurations consisting of simultaneously diagonalizable matrices form a
moduli space, although the unique vacuum would be determined by complicated
dynamics. This moduli space should correspond to a part of perturbatively
stable vacua of string theory. Actually, one point on the moduli space
represents type IIA string theory. Instead of integrating over the moduli space
in the path-integral, we can consider each of the simultaneously diagonalizable
configurations as a background and set the fluctuations of the diagonal
elements to zero. Such procedure is known as quenching in the context of the
large N reduced models. By quenching the diagonal elements of the matrices to
an appropriate configuration, we show that the quenched IIB matrix model is
equivalent to the two-dimensional large N N=8 super Yang-Mills theory on a
cylinder. This theory is nothing but matrix string theory and is known to be
equivalent to type IIA string theory. As a result, we find the manner to take

closely resembling those observed in NGC 2808 and Omega Centauri. We briefly
review the theoretical scenarios that have been suggested for interpreting this
observational feature. We also investigate the tilted horizontal branch
morphology and provide further evidence that supports early suggestions that
this feature cannot be interpreted as an effect of differential reddening. We
show that a possible solution of the puzzle is to assume that a small fraction
- ranging between 10-20% - of the stellar population in the two clusters is
strongly helium enriched (Y=0.40 in NGC 6388 and Y=0.35 in NGC 6441). The
occurrence of a spread in the He abundance between the canonical value (Y=0.26)

the Green function of the two-dimensional quantum field theory. The correction
term is exponentially small away from the horizon. If the volume of a geodesic
ball is growing to infinity with its radius then the Green function cannot be
approximated by a two-dimensional one.

Peierls idea of electronic instabilities in purely 1D metals and is now often
applied to charge ordering in real low-dimensional materials. The idea is that
if Fermi surface contours coincide when shifted along the observed CDW wave
vector, then the CDW is considered to be nesting-derived. We show that in most
cases this procedure has no predictive power, since Fermi surfaces either do
not nest at the right wave vector, or nest more strongly at the wrong vector.
We argue that only a tiny fraction, if any, of the observed charge ordering
phase transitions are true analogues of the Peierls instability because
electronic instabilities are easily destroyed by even small deviations from
perfect nesting conditions. Using prototypical CDW materials NbSe$_2$,
TaSe$_2$, and CeTe$_3$, we show that such conditions are hardly ever fulfilled,
and that the CDW phases are actually structural phase transitions, driven by
the concerted action of electronic and ionic subsystems, \textit{i.e.,}
\textbf{q}-dependent electron-phonon coupling plays an indispensable part. We
also show mathematically that the original Peierls construction is so fragile
as to be unlikely to apply to real materials. We argue that no meaningful
distinction between a CDW and an incommensurate lattice transition exists.

extrinsic factors that determine the mapping of game pay offs to individual
fitness. These factors may increase or decrease the fitness of a player
depending on its location on the spatial grid. We consider different
distributions of extrin sic factors that determine the social diversity of
players, and find that the power-law distribution enables the best promotion of
cooperation. The facilitation of the cooperative str ategy relies mostly on the
inhomogeneous social state of players, resulting in the formation of
cooperative clusters which are ruled by socially high-ranking players that are
able to prevail against the defectors even when there is a large temptation to
defect. To confirm this, we also study the impact of spatially correlated
social diversity and find that coopera tion deteriorates as the spatial
correlation length increases. Our results suggest that the distribution of

radiation was treated as the result of an infinitesimally thin polarization
sheet layer, and a three layer model was generally employed. The direct
consequence of this approach is that an apriori dielectric constant, which
still does not have a clear definition, has to be assigned to this polarization
layer. Because the Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) and the Sum-Frequency
Generation vibrational Spectroscopy (SFG-VS) have been proven as the sensitive
probes for interfaces with the submonolayer coverage, the treatment based on
the more realistic discrete induced dipole model needs to be developed. Here we
show that following the molecular optics theory approach the SHG, as well as
the SFG-VS, radiation from the monolayer or submonolayer at an interface can be
rigorously treated as the radiation from an induced dipole lattice at the
interface. In this approach, the introduction of the polarization sheet is no
longer necessary. Therefore, the ambiguity of the unaccounted dielectric
constant of the polarization layer is no longer an issue. Moreover, the
anisotropic two dimensional microscopic local field factors can be explicitly
expressed with the linear polarizability tensors of the interfacial molecules.
Based on the planewise dipole sum rule in the molecular monolayer, crucial
experimental tests of this microscopic treatment with SHG and SFG-VS are
discussed. Many puzzles in the literature of surface SHG and SFG spectroscopy
studies can also be understood or resolved in this framework. This new
treatment may provide a solid basis for the quantitative analysis in the
surface SHG and SFG studies.

consider both of these resilience modes and, in each case, derive explicit

neutron source within the same general stellar sites that undergo core collapse
to produce the neutron star. Observational data on low-metallicity stars in the
Galactic halo show that sites producing the heavy r-nuclei do not produce Fe or
any other elements between N and Ge. Insofar as a forming neutron star is key
to producing the heavy r-nuclei, then the only possible sources are supernovae
resulting from collapse of O-Ne-Mg cores or accretion-induced collapse of white

intermediate mass (above C and N). Using a template star with high enrichments

that the ground state of acenes that consist of more than seven fused benzene
rings is an antiferromagnetic (in other words, open-shell singlet) state, and
we show that this singlet is not necessarily a diradical, because the spatially
separated magnetizations for the spin-up and spin-down electrons increase with
the size of the acene. For example, our results indicate that there are about
four spin-up electrons localized at one zigzag edge of 20-acene. The reason
that both acenes and polyacene have the antiferromagnetic ground state is due
to the zigzag-shaped boundaries, which cause pi-electrons to localize and form
spin orders at the edges. Both wider graphene ribbons and large
rectangular-shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been shown to share
this antiferromagnetic ground state. Therefore, we demonstrate that the
pi-electronic structure of higher acenes and ployacene are still dictated by
the zigzag edges, and our results provide a consistent description of their
electronic ground state.

injury. The purpose of this study was to assess the neuroprotective effect and
the neurological outcome after pyruvate administration in a model of ischemic
stroke induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) in rats.
Three doses of pyruvate (250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle were
administered intraperitoneally 30 min after pMCAO. In other set of experiments,
pyruvate was given either before, immediately after ischemia or in a long-term
administration paradigm. Functional outcome, mortality and infarct volume were
determined 24 h after stroke. Even when the lowest doses of pyruvate reduced
mortality and neurological deficits, no concomitant reduction in infarct volume
was observed. The highest dose of pyruvate increased cortical infarction by 27%
when administered 30 min after pMCAO. In addition, when pyruvate was given
before pMCAO, a significant increase in neurological deficits was noticed.
Surprisingly, on the contrary of what was found in the case of transient global
ischemia, present findings do not support a great neuroprotective role for
pyruvate in permanent focal cerebral ischemia, suggesting two distinct

the spectral synthesis of two RuI (4080.574A and 4757.856A) and two HfII

the RuI 4758A observed transitions result in a unreasonably high solar
abundance, given certain known uncertainties, when fitted with laboratory
gf-values. For these two transitions we determined empirical gf-values by
fitting the observed line profiles of the spectra of the Sun and Arcturus. For
the sample stars, this procedure resulted in a good agreement of Ru and Hf
abundances given by the two available lines. The resulting Ru and Hf abundances
were compared to those of Y, Nd, Sm and Eu. In the solar system Ru, Sm and Eu
are dominated by the r-process and Hf, Nd and Y by the s-process, and all of
these elements are enhanced in barium stars since they lie inside the s-process
path. Ru abundances show large scatter when compared to other heavy elements,

and Nd, in good agreement with theoretical expectations. We also suggest a
possible, unexpected, correlation of Ru and Sm abundances. The observed

Submitted for publication to MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12578.x",,"astro-ph",,"  Absorption spectra of high redshift quasars exhibit an increasingly thick
Ly-alpha forest towards z~6. However, the interpretation of these spectra is
complicated by the fact that the Ly-alpha optical depth is already large for
neutral hydrogen fractions in excess of 10^-4, and also because quasars are
expected to reside in dense regions of the IGM. We present a model for the
evolution of the ionization state of the IGM which is applicable to the dense,
biased regions around high-redshift quasars as well as more typical regions in
the IGM, and combine this with numerical radiative transfer simulations. Our
model is able to simultaneously reproduce the observed Ly-alpha forest opacity
at 4<z<6, the ionizing photon mean-free-path at z~4 and the rapid evolution of
highly ionized near-zone sizes around high-redshift quasars at 5.8<z<6.4. We
find that within 5 physical Mpc of a high redshift quasar, the evolution of the
ionization state of the IGM precedes that in more typical regions by around 0.3
redshift units. More importantly, when combined with the rapid increase in the
ionizing photon mean-free-path expected shortly after overlap, this offset
results in an ionizing background near the quasar which exceeds the value in
the rest of the IGM by a factor of ~2-3. We further find that in the
post-overlap phase of reionization the size of the observed quasar near-zones
is not directly sensitive to the neutral hydrogen fraction of the IGM. Instead,
these sizes probe the level of the background ionization rate and the
temperature of the surrounding IGM. The observed rapid evolution of the quasar
near-zone sizes at 5.8<z<6.4 can thus be explained by the rapid evolution of
the ionizing background, which in our model is caused by the completion of
overlap at the end of reionization by 6<z<7.

that drives a variety of cellular and intracellular motions. During motility,
eukaryotic cells and intracellular pathogens are propelled by actin networks
organized by nucleation-promoting factors, which trigger the formation of
nascent filaments off the side of existing filaments in the network. A Brownian
ratchet (BR) mechanism has been proposed to couple actin polymerization to
cellular movements, whereby thermal motions are rectified by the addition of
actin monomers at the end of growing filaments. Here, by following
actin--propelled microspheres using three--dimensional laser tracking, we find
that beads adhered to the growing network move via an object--fluctuating BR.
Velocity varies with the amplitude of thermal fluctuation and inversely with
viscosity as predicted for a BR. In addition, motion is saltatory with a broad
distribution of step sizes that is correlated in time. These data point to a
model in which thermal fluctuations of the microsphere or entire actin network,
and not individual filaments, govern motility. This conclusion is supported by
Monte Carlo simulations of an adhesion--based BR and suggests an important role
for membrane tension in the control of actin--based cellular protrusions.

requiring a sizable negative orbital angular momentum component $L_z$. This

was undetectable in a shorter observation on 2005 August 22 --23, with an upper
limit of $1.7 \times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (90% confidence level).

$L_{\rm bol} = 4.4 \times 10^{39} \alpha$ erg s$^{-1}$, where $\alpha = (\cos
60^\circ / \cos i)$ and $i$ is the disk inclination. Therefore, the source is

innermost accretion disk temperature of $T_{\rm in} = 1.69_{-0.05}^{+0.06}$
keV. During the 2006 January observation, it varied by a factor of 2 in

It is inferred that the innermost disk radius $R_{\rm in}$ stayed constant at
$R_{\rm in} = 79_{-3.9}^{+4.0} \alpha^{1/2}$ km, suggesting the presence of a
standard accretion disk. Relating $R_{\rm in}$ with the last stable orbit
around a non-rotating black hole yields a rather low black hole mass, $\sim 9
\alpha^{1/2}$ solar masses, which would imply that the source is shining at a
luminosity of $\sim3 \alpha^{1/2} $ times the Eddington limit. These results
can be better interpreted by invoking sub-Eddington emission from a rapidly
spinning black hole with a mass of 20 -- 130 solar masses.

detector is composed of a series of scintillator counters arranged at the
extremities of a permanent magnet spectrometer to provide charge,

performed by a Silicon-Tungsten calorimeter and a Neutron detector placed at

Simulation to study the growth of galaxies in the De Lucia et al. (2006) model

aspects of the systematic properties and the clustering of real galaxies, both
in the nearby universe and at high redshift. It assumes the stellar masses of
galaxies to increase through three processes, major mergers, the accretion of
smaller satellite systems, and star formation. We show the relative importance
of these three modes to be a strong function of stellar mass and of redshift.
Galaxy growth through major mergers depends strongly on stellar mass, but only
weakly on redshift. Except for massive systems, minor mergers contribute more
to galaxy growth than major mergers at all redshifts and at all stellar masses.
For galaxies significantly less massive than the Milky Way, star formation
dominates the growth at all epochs. For galaxies significantly more massive
than the Milky Way, growth through mergers is the dominant process at all
epochs. At a stellar mass of $6\times 10^{10}M_\odot$, star formation dominates
at $z>1$ and mergers at later times. At every stellar mass, the growth rates
through star formation increase rapidly with increasing redshift. Specific star
formation rates are a decreasing function of stellar mass not only at $z=0$ but
also at all higher redshifts. For comparison, we carry out a similar analysis
of the growth of dark matter halos. In contrast to the galaxies, growth rates
depend strongly on redshift, but only weakly on mass. They agree qualitatively
with analytic predictions for halo growth.

center. The spectral energy distribution of the whole galaxy shows the presence
of the cold dust component (18 K) in addition to the warm dust component (55
K). The distribution of the cold dust is mostly concentrated near the center,
and exhibits smoothly distributed over the entire extent of the galaxy, whereas
the distribution of the warm dust indicates some correlation with the spiral

Since the energy required per weight or volume of processed material links
directly to the equipment size required, optimization of the process efficiency

zone in these stars and reflected close to the surface. The p-modes are trapped
inside an acoustic cavity, but the modes only stay trapped up to a given
frequency (known as the acoustic cut-off frequency) as modes with larger
frequencies are generally not reflected at the surface. This means that modes
with frequency larger than the acoustic cut-off frequency must be traveling
waves. The high-frequency modes may provide information about the physics in
the outer layers of the stars and the excitation source and are therefore
highly interesting as it is the estimation of these two phenomena that causes
some of the largest uncertainties when calculating stellar oscillations.
High-frequency modes have been detected in the Sun, beta Hydri and in alpha Cen
A & B by smoothing the so-called echelle diagram and the large frequency
separation as a function of frequency have been estimated. The large frequency
separation has been compared with a simple model of the acoustic cavity which
suggests that the reflectivity of the photosphere is larger at high frequency
than predicted by standard models of the solar atmosphere and that the depth of
the excitation source is larger than what has been estimated by other models
and might depend on the order n and degree l of the modes.

dwarf spheroidal galaxy (distance of 233 kpc) to search for evidence of tidal
deformation. The existing SDSS photometric catalogue contains gaps in regions
of high stellar crowding, hence we filled the area at the centre of Leo II
using the DAOPHOT algorithm applied to the SDSS images. The combined
DAOPHOT-SDSS dataset contains three-filter photometry over a 4x4 square degree
region centred on Leo II. By defining a mask in three-filter colour-magnitude
space, we removed the majority of foreground field stars. We have measured the
following Leo II structural parameters: a core radius of r_c = 2.64 +/- 0.19
arcmin (178 +/- 13 pc), a tidal radius of r_t = 9.33 +/- 0.47 arcmin (632 +/-
32 pc) and a total V-band luminosity of L_V = (7.4 +/- 2.0) times 10^5 L_sun
(M_V = -9.9 +/- 0.3). Our comprehensive analysis of the Leo II structure did
not reveal any significant signs of tidal distortion. The internal structure of
this object contains only mild isophotal twisting. A small overdensity was
discovered appoximately 4.5 tidal radii from the Leo II centre, however we
conclude it is unlikely to be material tidally stripped from Leo II based on
its stellar population, and is most likely a foreground overdensity of stars.
Our results indicate that the influence of the Galactic graviational field on
the structure of Leo II has been relatively mild. We rederived the
mass-to-light ratio of this system using existing kinematic data combined with
our improved structural measurements, and favour the scenario in which Leo II
is strongly dominated by dark matter with (M/L)_V ~ 100 in solar units.

region with the Infrared Camera (IRC) and the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) on
board the infrared astronomical satellite AKARI during its performance
verification phase. We obtained 7 band images from 7 to 160um with higher
spatial resolution and higher sensitivities than previous observations. The
mid-infrared color of the S9W (9um) and L18W (18um) bands shows a systematic
variation around the exciting sources. The spatial variation in the
mid-infrared color suggests that the star-formation in IC4954/4955 is
progressing from south-west to north-east. The FIS data also clearly resolve
two nebulae for the first time in the far-infrared. The FIS 4-band data from
65um to 160um allow us to correctly estimate the total infrared luminosity from
the region, which is about one sixth of the energy emitted from the existing
stellar sources. Five candidates for young stellar objects have been detected
as point sources for the first time in the 11um image. They are located in the
red S9W to L18W color regions, suggesting that current star-formation has been
triggered by previous star-formation activities. A wide area map of the size of
about 1 x 1 (deg^2) around the IC4954/4955 region was created from the AKARI
mid-infrared all-sky survey data. Together with the HI 21cm data, it suggests a
large hollow structure of a degree scale, on whose edge the IC4954/4955 region
has been created, indicating star formation over three generations in largely
different spatial scales.

criterion, at any side-to-central distortion ratio and any resolution. In the
optimal scheme, the infinite-order noise shaping filter must be minimum phase

important advantage of the proposed design is that it is symmetric in rate and
distortion by construction, so the coding rates of the descriptions are
identical and there is therefore no need for source splitting.

where C_{ij} is the correlation matrix and s_i = \sum_j W_{ij} the strength of

are ranked in descending order. In accord with the earlier observations the
first eigenvector stands for a measure of the market correlations. Its
components are to first approximation equal to the strengths of the nodes and
there is a second order, roughly linear, correction. The high ranking
eigenvectors, excluding the highest ranking one, are usually assigned to market
sectors and industrial branches. Our study shows that both for weight and
diffusion matrices the eigenpair analysis is not capable of easily deducing the
cluster structure of the network without a priori knowledge. In addition we
have studied the clustering of stocks using the asset graph approach with and
without spectrum based noise filtering. It turns out that asset graphs are
quite insensitive to noise and there is no sharp percolation transition as a
function of the ratio of bonds included, thus no natural threshold value for
that ratio seems to exist. We suggest that these observations can be of use for
other correlation based networks as well.

coli metabolism can be sustained against single-gene or even multiple-gene
mutations by using redundant or alternative pathways. Thus, only a limited
number of genes have been identified to be lethal to the cell. In this regard,
the reaction-centric gene deletion study has a limitation in understanding the
metabolic robustness. Here, we report the use of flux-sum, which is the
summation of all incoming or outgoing fluxes around a particular metabolite
under pseudo-steady state conditions, as a good conserved property for
elucidating such robustness of E. coli from the metabolite point of view. The
functional behavior, as well as the structural and evolutionary properties of
metabolites essential to the cell survival, was investigated by means of a
constraints-based flux analysis under perturbed conditions. The essential
metabolites are capable of maintaining a steady flux-sum even against severe
perturbation by actively redistributing the relevant fluxes. Disrupting the
flux-sum maintenance was found to suppress cell growth. This approach of
analyzing metabolite essentiality provides insight into cellular robustness and
concomitant fragility, which can be used for several applications, including
the development of new drugs for treating pathogens.

supergravity Kaehler potential that occur in flux compactifications of IIB
string theory on general Calabi-Yau three-folds. We give a low energy
interpretation for the conjecture of Berg, Haack and Pajer for the form of the
loop corrections to the Kaehler potential. We check the consistency of this
interpretation in several examples. We show that for arbitrary Calabi-Yaus, the
leading contribution of these corrections to the scalar potential is always
vanishing, giving an ""extended no-scale structure"". This result holds as long
as the corrections are homogeneous functions of degree -2 in the 2-cycle
volumes. We use the Coleman-Weinberg potential to motivate this cancellation
from the viewpoint of low-energy field theory. Finally we give a simple formula
for the 1-loop correction to the scalar potential in terms of the tree-level
Kaehler metric and the correction to the Kaehler potential. We illustrate our
ideas with several examples. A companion paper will use these results in the
study of Kaehler moduli stabilisation.

not sufficient to explain the observed magnitude of the quadrupole/octopole

an alternative adiabatic algorithm for the NP-complete problem {\em Exact Cover

The run-time of adiabatic algorithms is not just determined by the minimum
value of the fundamental energy gap (between the ground state and the exited
states), but also by its curvature at the critical point. The proposed
symmetry-restoring adiabatic quantum algorithm only contains contributions
linear and quadratic in the Pauli matrices and can be generalized to other
problem Hamiltonians which are decomposed of terms involving one and two
qubits. We show how the factoring problem can be cast into such a quadratic
form. These findings suggest that adiabatic quantum algorithms can solve a
large class of NP problems much faster than the Grover search routine (which
corresponds to a first-order transition and yields a quadratic enhancement

the entire range of temperatures studied (4.2K < T < 70K). However, for
stronger localization and a high density of Mn interstitials, we observe
Lorentzian noise spectra accompanied by random telegraph noise. Magnetic field
dependence and annealing studies suggest that interstitial Mn defects couple
with substitutional Mn atoms to form nanoscale magnetic clusters characterized
by a net moment of about 20 Bohr magnetons whose fluctuations modulate hole
transport.

the coupling strength $v$ to the two attached leads. The leads are identical
with only one propagating mode $\xi^E_C$ in each of them. Besides the
conductance $G$, we calculate the phase rigidity $\rho$ of the scattering wave
function $\Psi^E_C$ in the interior of the system. Most interesting results are
obtained in the regime of strongly overlapping resonance states where the
crossover from staying to traveling modes takes place. The crossover is
characterized by collective effects. Here, the conductance is plateau-like
enhanced in some energy regions of finite length while corridors with zero
transmission (total reflection) appear in other energy regions. This
transmission picture depends only weakly on the spectrum of the closed system.
It is caused by the alignment of some resonance states of the system with the
propagating modes $\xi^E_C$ in the leads. The alignment of resonance states
takes place stepwise by resonance trapping, i.e. it is accompanied by the
decoupling of other resonance states from the continuum of propagating modes.
This process is quantitatively described by the phase rigidity $\rho$ of the
scattering wave function. Averaged over energy in the considered energy window,
$<G>$ is correlated with $1-<\rho>$. In the regime of strong coupling, only two
short-lived resonance states survive each aligned with one of the channel wave
functions $\xi^E_C$. They may be identified with traveling modes through the
system. The remaining $M-2$ trapped narrow resonance states are well separated
from one another.

bubble of false vacuum of the type previously conjectured by Moss [I.G. Moss,

locally, in the self-similar region and globally, e.g. from the news function.

null infinity and along timelike lines. We argue that for astrophysical
observers the relevant falloff rate is that of future null infinity. We have
also investigated the behavior of quasinormal modes (QNM) in near-critical
evolutions. Although the perturbation theory underlying QNMs requires a fixed

edges. Roughly speaking, there is one model for each {\em kernel}, i.e., each
symmetric measurable function from $[0,1]^2$ to the non-negative reals,
although the details are much more complicated. A different connection between
kernels and random graphs arises in the recent work of Borgs, Chayes, Lov\'asz,
S\'os, Szegedy and Vesztergombi. They introduced several natural metrics on
dense graphs (graphs with $n$ vertices and $\Theta(n^2)$ edges), showed that
these metrics are equivalent, and gave a description of the completion of the
space of all graphs with respect to any of these metrics in terms of {\em
graphons}, which are essentially bounded kernels. One of the most appealing
aspects of this work is the message that sequences of inhomogeneous
quasi-random graphs are in a sense completely general: any sequence of dense
graphs contains such a subsequence.
  Our aim here is to briefly survey these results, and then to investigate to
what extent they can be generalized to graphs with $o(n^2)$ edges. Although
many of the definitions extend in a simple way, the connections between the
various metrics, and between the metrics and random graph models, turn out to
be much more complicated than in the dense case. We shall prove many partial
results, and state even more conjectures and open problems, whose resolution
would greatly enhance the currently rather unsatisfactory theory of metrics on
sparse graphs. This paper deals mainly with graphs with $o(n^2)$ but
$\omega(n)$ edges: a companion paper [arXiv:0812.2656] will discuss the (more
problematic still) case of {\em extremely sparse} graphs, with O(n) edges.
