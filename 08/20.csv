the thermal free-free radio emission. Subtracting from the observed 3.6 cm and
20 cm emission (Effelsberg and the VLA) this free-free emission, we obtain the
nonthermal maps. A constant electron temperature used to obtain the thermal
radio intensity seems appropriate for M~33 which, unlike the Milky Way, has a
shallow metallicity gradient. For the first time, we derive the distribution of
the nonthermal spectral index across a galaxy, M33. We detect strong nonthermal
emission from the spiral arms and star-forming regions. Wavelet analysis shows
that at 3.6 cm the nonthermal emission is dominated by contributions from
star-forming regions, while it is smoothly distributed at 20 cm. For the whole
galaxy, we obtain thermal fractions of 51% and 18% at 3.6 cm and 20 cm,
respectively. The thermal emission is slightly stronger in the southern than in
the northern half of the galaxy. We find a clear radial gradient of mean
extinction in the galactic plane. The nonthermal spectral index map indicates
that the relativistic electrons suffer energy-loss when diffusing from their
origin in star-forming regions towards interarm regions and the outer parts of
the galaxy. We also conclude that the radio emission is mostly nonthermal at R
$>$ 5 kpc in M33.

(b) one additive and two multiplicative colored noise. The case (b) is examined
with the relevance to a recent controversy on the stationary subthreshold
voltage distribution of an integrate-and-fire model including stochastic
excitatory and inhibitory synapses and a noisy input. We have studied the
stationary probability distribution and dynamical responses to time-dependent
(pulse and sinusoidal) inputs of the linear Langevin model. Model calculations
have shown that results of the FIM are in good agreement with those of direct
simulations (DSs). A comparison is made among various approximate analytic
solutions such as the universal colored noise approximation (UCNA). It has been
pointed out that dynamical responses to pulse and sinusoidal inputs calculated
by the UCNA are rather different from those of DS and the FIM, although they
yield the same stationary distribution.

  Let $\chi$ be the nontrivial character modulo 4. Euler wants to know what
$\sum_p \chi(p)/p$ is, either an exact expression or an approximation. He looks
for analogies to the harmonic series and the series of reciprocals of the
primes.
  Another reason he is interested in this is that if this series has a finite
value (which is does, the best approximation Euler gets is 0.3349816 in section
27) then there are infinitely many primes congruent to 1 mod 4 and infinitely
many primes congruent to 3 mod 4.

Davenport that the series $\sum_p \frac{\chi(p)}{p}$ converges. This involves
applications of summation by parts, and uses Chebyshev's estimate for the
second Chebyshev function (summing the von Mangoldt function).

substantiate the universal optimality of the S-DUDE, we show that when the

observations of RT Cru, the first of a new sub-class of symbiotic stars that
appear to contain white dwarfs (WDs) capable of producing hard X-ray emission
out to greater than 50 keV. The production of such hard X-ray emission from the
objects in this sub-class (which also includes CD -57 3057, T CrB, and CH Cyg)
challenges our understanding of accreting WDs. We find that the 0.3 -- 8.0 keV
X-ray spectrum of RT Cru emanates from an isobaric cooling flow, as in the
optically thin accretion-disk boundary layers of some dwarf novae. The
parameters of the spectral fit confirm that the compact accretor is a WD, and
they are consistent with the WD being massive. We detect rapid, stochastic
variability from the X-ray emission below 4 keV. The combination of flickering
variability and a cooling-flow spectrum indicates that RT Cru is likely powered
by accretion through a disk. Whereas the cataclysmic variable stars with the
hardest X-ray emission are typically magnetic accretors with X-ray flux
modulated at the WD spin period, we find that the X-ray emission from RT Cru is
not pulsed. RT Cru therefore shows no evidence for magnetically channeled
accretion, consistent with our interpretation that the Chandra spectrum arises
from an accretion-disk boundary layer.

naturally taken into account. The qubit decoherence, in particular, the
influence of the tunneling-electron fluctuation in the quantum point contact

Lorentzian-type spectral density to characterize the channel mixture of the
electron tunneling processes induced by the measurement and determine the
correlation time scale of the tunneling-electron fluctuation. The result shows
that as the quantum point contact is casted with a narrower profile of the
spectral density, tunneling electrons can propagate with a longer time
correlation and lead to the non-Markovian processes of the qubit dynamics. The
qubit electron in the charge qubit will be driven coherently. The quantum point
contact measurement with the minimum deviation of the electron tunneling
processes prevents the qubit state from the decoherence.

sources at low and intermediate redshifts (z < 0.7) that show evidence for a
substantial UV excess. These data were taken using the WHT and VLT to determine
the detailed properties of the young stellar populations (YSPs) in the host
galaxies as part of a larger project to investigate evolutionary scenarios for
the AGN host galaxies. The results of our spectral synthesis model fits to the
spectra highlight the importance of taking into account AGN-related components
(emission lines, nebular continuum, scattered light) and reddening of the
stellar populations in studies of this type. It is also clear that careful
examination of the fits to the spectra, as well consideration of auxilary
polarimetric and imaging data, are required to avoid degeneracies in the model
solutions. In 3/12 sources in our sample we find broad permitted line
components, and a combination of AGN-related continuum components and an old
(12.5 Gyr) stellar population provides an adequate fit to the data. In the
remaining 9 sources we find strong evidence for YSPs. In contrast to some
recent studies that suggest relatively old post-starburst ages for the YSPs in
radio galaxies (0.3-2.5 Gyr), we deduce a wide range of ages for the YSPs in
our sample objects (0.02-1.5 Gyr), with ~50% of the sample showing evidence for
young YSP ages (<~0.1 Gyr) in their nuclear regions. The nuclear YSPs are often
significantly reddened (0.2 < E(B-V) < 1.4) and make up a substantial fraction
(~1-35%) of the total stellar mass in the regions sampled by the spectroscopic
slits. Moreover, in all the cases in which we have sufficient spatial
resolution we find that the UV excess is extended across the full measureable
extent of the galaxy (typically 5-30 kpc), suggesting galaxy-wide starbursts.

However, the decay time of the slow component depends on gas purity and is a

impurities destroying the long-lived argon excimer states. The population ratio
between the slowly and the fast decaying excimer states is determined for
alpha-particles to be 5.5 +-0.6 in argon gas at 1100 mbar and room temperature.

which are classified in terms of triaxiality. We confirm that no linear
combination of $randomly$-distributed axis ratios of the three types can
reproduce the observed ARD. However, using Gaussian intrinsic distributions, we

oblate, prolate, and triaxial (triaxials in two axis ratios), $\mu_o=0.44,
\mu_p=0.72, \mu_{t,\beta}=0.92, \mu_{t,\gamma}=0.78$ where the fractions of
oblate, prolate and triaxial types are

found that the luminous sample ($-23.3 < M_r \leq -21.2$) tends to have more
triaxials than the less luminous ($-21.2 < M_r <-19.3$) sample does. Oblate is
relatively more abundant among the less luminous galaxies. Interestingly, the
preferences of axis ratios for triaxial types in the two luminosity classes are
remarkably similar. We have not found any significant influence of the local
galaxy number density on ARD. We show that the results can be seriously
affected by the details in the data selection and type classification scheme.
Caveats and implications on galaxy formation are discussed.

A*) has unique properties. The most striking feature is a suggestive periodic
sub-structure that has been observed in a couple of flares so far. Using
near-infrared polarimetric observations and modelling the quasi-periodicity in
terms of an orbiting blob, we try to constrain the three dimensional
orientation of the Sgr A* system. We report on so far unpublished polarimetric
data from 2003. They support the observations of a roughly constant mean
polarization angle of 60 degr \pm 20 degr from 2004-2006. Prior investigations
of the 2006 data are deepened. In particular, the blob model fits are evaluated
such that constraints on the position angle of Sgr A* can be derived.
Confidence contours in the position-inclination angle plane are derived. On a
3sigma level the position angle of the equatorial plane normal is in the range
60 degr - 108 degr (east of north) in combination with a large inclination
angle. This agrees well with recent independent work in which radio
spectral/morphological properties of Sgr A* and X-ray observations,
respectively, have been used. However, the quality of the presently available
data and the uncertainties in our model bring some ambiguity to our
conclusions.

hole solutions of it would be valuable for a number of endeavors ranging from
astrophysical modeling to investigations into the interrelation between gravity
and thermodynamics. Giannios has recently found a TeVeS analogue of the
Schwarzschild black hole solution. We proceed further with the program by
analytically solving the TeVeS equations for a static spherically symmetric and
asymptotically flat system of electromagnetic and gravity fields. We show that
one solution is provided by the Reissner-Nordstrom metric as physical metric,
the TeVeS vector field pointing in the time direction, and a TeVeS scalar field
positive everywhere (the last feature protects from superluminal propagation of
disturbances in the fields). We work out black hole thermodynamics in TeVeS
using the physical metric; black hole entropy, temperature and electric
potential turn out to be identical to those in general relativity. We find it
inconsistent to base thermodynamics on the Einstein metric. In light of this we
reconsider the Dubovsky-Sibiryakov scenario for violating the second law of

of the star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies with different metallicities by
comparing it to the (extinction corrected) Halpha luminosity. We carry out this
analysis in 2 steps: First, we compare the emission from HII regions in
different galaxies with metallicities between 12+log(O/H) = 8.1 and 8.9. We
find that the 24microns and the extinction corrected Halpha luminosities from
individual HII regions follow the same correlation for all galaxies,
independent of their metallicity. Second, the role of metallicity is explored
further for the integrated luminosity in a sample of galaxies with
metallicities in the range of 12+log(O/H) = 7.2 - 9.1. For this sample we
compare the 24microns and Halpha luminosities integrated over the entire
galaxies and find a lack of the 24microns emission for a given Halpha
luminosity for low metallicity objects, likely reflecting a low dust content.
These results suggest that the 24microns luminosity is a good metallicity
independent tracer for the SFR in individual HII regions. On the other hand,
metallicity has to be taken into account when using the 24microns luminosity as
a tracer for the SFR of entire galaxies.

model its mass using the spherical and isotropic Jeans equation. Assuming that
'mass follows light' we constrain a lower limit of the total mass of the dSph

transform in terms of reverse Bessel polynomials constitute the mathematical
framework of this approximation, from which an analytical expression for the

recovers the solution of the Percus-Yevick closure to the Ornstein-Zernike

go beyond by yielding solutions with thermodynamic consistency between the
virial and compressibility routes to any desired equation of state. Excellent

polymer fluids under flow play a prominent role in processing of manufactured
plastics, and have numerous other applications. Quantitative tracking of chain
conformation statistics on the Kuhn scale is essential for developing
computational models of such phenomena. For this purpose, we formulate here a
two-scale/two-mode model of entangled polymer chains under flow. Each chain is
partitioned by successive entanglements into strands that are in one of two
modes: entangled or dangling. On the strand scale, conformation statistics of
ideal (non-interacting) strands follows a differential evolution equation for
the second moment of its end-to-end distance. The latter regulates persistent
random walks sampling conformation statistics of ideal entangled strands on the
Kuhn scale, as follows from a generalized Green-Kubo relation and the Maximum
Entropy Principle. We test it numerically for a range of deformation rates at
the start-up of simple elongational and shear flows. A self-consistent
potential, representing segmental interactions, modifies strand conformation
statistics on the Kuhn scale, as it renormalizes the parameters controlling the
persistent random walk. The generalized Green-Kubo relation is then inverted to
determine how the second moment of the strand end-to-end distance is changed by
the self-consistent potential. This allows us to devise a two-scale propagation
scheme for the statistical weights of subchains of the entangled chain. The
latter is used to calculate local volume fractions for each chemical type of
Kuhn segments in entangled chains, thus determining the self-consistent
potential.

a turbulent mixing layer on the surface of cool gas knots, set up by the impact
of the fast-flowing cluster winds. We discuss the kinematic, electron density
and excitation maps of each region in detail and compare our results to
previous studies. Our analysis reveals a very complex environment with many
overlapping and superimposed components, including dissolving gas knots,
rapidly expanding shocked shells and embedded ionizing sources, but no evidence
for organised bulk motions. We conclude that the four IFU positions presented

the lack of substantial ordered gas flows, within the quasi-hydrostatic zone of
the wind interior to the sonic point. The net outflow occurs at radii beyond

novel accelerated Stokesian-dynamics algorithm relies on simplifications
associated with the Hele--Shaw asymptotic far-field form of the flow scattered
by the particles. The simulations reveal propagation of particle-displacement
waves, deformation and rearrangements of a particle lattice, propagation of
dislocation defects in ordered arrays, and long-lasting coexistence of ordered
and disordered regions.

with isothermal state of plasma are formulated. We consider the cases of
non-rotating and rotating backgrounds with non-magnetized and magnetized
plasmas. For these cases, the perturbed form of these equations are linearized
and Fourier analyzed by introducing plane wave type solutions. The determinant
of these equations in each case leads to two dispersion relations which give
value of the wave number $k$. Using the wave number, we obtain information like
phase and group velocities etc. which help to discuss the nature of the waves
and their characteristics. These provide interesting information about the
black hole magnetosphere near the horizon. There are cases of normal and
anomalous dispersion. We find a case of normal dispersion of waves when the
plasma admits the properties of Veselago medium. Our results agree with those
of Mackay et al. according to which rotation of a black hole is required for
negative phase velocity propagation.

brightened structure and unambiguous evidence for a faint 3 mas long
counter-feature which also appears limb brightened. Multi-epoch observations of
seven separate jet features show typical speeds of less than a few percent of
the speed of light, despite the highly asymmetric jet structure and the
implications of the canonical relativistic beaming scenario. The observed
morphology is consistent with a two stream spine-sheath velocity gradient
across the jet, as might be expected from the recently discovered strong and
variable TeV emission as well as from numerical modeling of relativistic jets.
Considering the large jet to counter-jet flux density ratio and lack of
observed fast motion in the jet, we conclude that either the inner part of the
M87 jet is intrinsically asymmetric or that the bulk plasma flow speed is much
greater than any propagation of shocks or other pattern motions.
