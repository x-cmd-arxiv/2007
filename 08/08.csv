the selection function, we compute the expected number of quasars lensed by
early-type galaxies and their image separation distribution assuming a flat

to derive constraints on dark energy under strictly controlled criteria. For a
cosmological constant model (w=-1) we obtain
\Omega_\Lambda=0.74^{+0.11}_{-0.15}(stat.)^{+0.13}_{-0.06}(syst.). Allowing w

w=-1.1\pm0.6(stat.)^{+0.3}_{-0.5}(syst.) when combined with the constraint from
the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations in the SDSS luminous red galaxy

obtained using radio lenses, and provide additional confirmation of the
presence of dark energy consistent with a cosmological constant, derived
independently of type Ia supernovae.

s and a quasi-sinusoidal pulse shape and pulsed fraction ~7-11%. We did not
detect statistically significant changes in the pulsation period on the time
scale of 4 years. The X-ray spectra of XMMU J004252.5+411540 are extremely soft
and can be approximated with an absorbed blackbody of temperature 62-77 eV and
a weak power law tail of photon index ~1.7-3.1 in the 0.2-3.0 keV energy band.
The X-ray properties of the source and the absence of an optical/UV counterpart
brighter than 19 mag suggest that it belongs to M31. The estimated bolometric
luminosity of the source varies between ~2e38 and ~8e38 ergs/s at 760 kpc,

spectrum of XMMU J004252.5+411540 imply that it is almost certainly an
accreting white dwarf, steadily burning hydrogen-rich material on its surface.
We interpret X-ray pulsations as a signature of the strong magnetic field of
the rotating white dwarf. Assuming that the X-ray source is powered by disk
accretion, we estimate its surface field strength to be in the range 4e5 G

  the limit of touching dimers",,"Optics Express 14, 9988-9999 (2006)","10.1364/OE.14.009988",,"cond-mat.other",,"  The response of gold nanoparticle dimers is studied theoretically near and
beyond the limit where the particles are touching. As the particles approach
each other, a dominant dipole feature is observed that is pushed into the
infrared due to interparticle coupling and that is associated with a large
pileup of induced charge in the interparticle gap. The redshift becomes
singular as the particle separation decreases. The response weakens for very
small separation when the coupling across the interparticle gap becomes so
strong that dipolar oscillations across the pair are inhibited.
Lower-wavelength, higher-order modes show a similar separation dependence in
nearly touching dimers. After touching, singular behavior is observed through
the emergence of a new infrared absorption peak, also accompanied by huge
charge pileup at the interparticle junction, if initial interparticle-contact
is made at a single point. This new mode is distinctly different from the
lowest mode of the separated dimer. When the junction is made by contact
between flat surfaces, charge at the junction is neutralized and mode evolution
is continuous through contact. The calculated singular response explains recent
experiments on metallic nanoparticle dimers and is relevant in the design of
nanoparticle-based sensors and plasmon circuits.

attempt is then made to fit our model to the observations of relativistic

profiles can be produced, this minimal model is insufficient for an accurate
match to the observational data. Consequently, we confirm that the emission
beam of PSR B1913+16 must deviate from circular symmetry, as first reported by
Weisberg and Taylor. However, the approximate fits obtained suggest that it may
be sufficient to consider only minimal deviations from a circular beam in order
to explain the data. We also comment on the applicability of our analysis
technique to other precessing pulsars, both binary and isolated.

mathematical derivation. It has been discovered that v(l') is a particular
solution of the ordinary differential equation (ODE) l'(1-l')d^2v/dl'^2=nv,
when the index n = 3/16. This ODE appears to be new in mathematical physics and
elliptic-function theory. The paper first uses an 1876 result from Cayley to
establish the boundary condition that dv/dl' satisfies as l' tends to zero. It
then uses the method of Frobenius to obtain two linearly independent series
solutions for the ODE, and hence derives the series expansion for v(l'). It is
shown that terms in ln{l'} are required in a mathematically correct solution,
but fractional powers of l' are not. The form of the ODE also implies that it
is mathematically impossible for simple Taylor expansion methods to generate
good approximation formulae valid over the whole range 0 =< l' =< 1; this
conclusion may also apply to barriers of other shapes. It is hoped that this
derivation might serve as a paradigm for the treatment of other tunnelling
barrier models for cold field electron emission, if in any particular case an

torque within a magnetic domain implies spin pumping of current within that
domain. This has experimental implications for samples both with conducting
leads and that are electrically isolated. These results are obtained by
deriving the dynamical equations for two models of non-uniform conducting
magnets: (1) a generic conducting magnet, with net conduction electron density
n and net magnetization $\vec{M}$; and (2) a two-band magnet, with up and down
spins each providing conduction and magnetism. For both models, in regions
where the equilibrium magnetization is non-uniform, voltage gradients can drive
adiabatic and non-adiabatic bulk spin torques. Onsager relations then ensure
that magnetic torques likewise drive adiabatic and non-adiabatic currents --
what we call bulk spin pumping. For a given amount of adiabatic and
non-adiabatic spin torque, the two models yield similar but distinct results
for the bulk spin pumping, thus distinguishing the two models. As in the recent
spin-Berry phase study by Barnes and Maekawa, we find that within a domain wall
the ratio of the effective emf to the magnetic field is approximately given by
$P(2\mu_{B}/e)$, where P is the spin polarization. The adiabatic spin torque
and spin pumping terms are shown to be dissipative in nature.

suggest that, in a real cloud, this transition marks the late and rapid
production of massive stars.
  We also offer an empirical prescription, akin to the Schmidt law, for
low-mass star formation in our contracting cloud. Applying this prescription to
the Orion Nebula Cluster, we are able to reproduce the accelerating star
formation previously inferred from the distribution of member stars in the HR

before becoming dynamically unstable. Over a cloud free-fall time, this figure
drops to 1 percent, consistent with the overall star formation efficiency of
molecular clouds in the Galaxy.

show that the locations of the melting and delocalization transitions are not

stress-energy can live on tensional codimension-2 branes, including
gravitational shockwaves and small Schwarzschild black holes. In this note we
generalize the earlier Schwarzschild results, and construct the exact
gravitational fields of small rotating black holes on a codimension-2 brane. We
focus on the phenomenologically interesting case of a three-brane embedded in a
spacetime with two compactified extra dimensions. For a nonzero tension on the
brane, we verify that these solutions also show the ``lightning rod'' effect
found in the Schwarzschild solutions, the net effect of which is to rescale the
fundamental Planck mass. This allows for larger black hole parameters, such as
the event horizon, angular momentum, and lifetime than would be naively
expected for a tensionless brane. It is also found that a black hole with
angular momentum pointing purely along the brane directions has a smaller
horizon angular velocity than the corresponding tensionless case, while a hole
with bulk components of angular momentum has a larger angular velocity.

cm (14.9 GHz), 3.6 cm (8.4 GHz), 6 cm (4.9 GHz), and 20 cm (1.5 GHz), with one
upper limit at 90 cm (0.3 GHz). In addition, one detection has been provided by
the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at 21 cm (1.4 GHz). SN 2001gd was
discovered in the optical well past maximum light, so that it was not possible
to obtain many of the early radio ""turn-on"" measurements which are important
for estimating the local circumstellar medium (CSM) properties. Only at 20 cm
were turn-on data available. However, our analysis and fitting of the radio
light curves, and the assumption that the Type IIb SN 2001gd resembles the much
better studied Type IIb SN 1993J, enables us to describe the radio evolution as
being very regular through day ~550 and consistent with a nonthermal-emitting
model with a thermal absorbing CSM. The presence of synchrotron-self absorption
(SSA) at early times is implied by the data, but determination of the exact
relationship between the SSA component from the emitting region and the
free-free absorption component from the CSM is not possible as there are
insufficient early measurements to distinguish between models. After day ~550,
the radio emission exhibits a dramatically steeper decline rate which, assuming
similarity to SN 1993J, can be described as an exponential decrease with an
e-folding time of 500 days. We interpret this abrupt change in the radio flux
density decline rate as implying a transition of the shock front into a more
tenuous region of circumstellar material. A similar change in radio evolution
has been seen earlier in other SNe such as SN 1988Z, SN 1980K, and SN 1993J.

expression is simply a surface integral, over the material interface, of the

the problem of field discontinuities and the challenge of constructing an

perturbation is infinitesimally localized around the boundary. Not only is our
result potentially useful in evaluating boundary perturbations, e.g. from
fabrication imperfections, in highly anisotropic media such as many

speaking, it is the property that the total number of jobs in the network
remains bounded as a function of time. One of the key questions related to the
stability issue is how to determine the exact conditions under which a given
queueing network operating under a given scheduling policy remains stable.
While there was much initial progress in addressing this question, most of the
results obtained were partial at best and so the complete characterization of
stable queueing networks is still lacking. In this paper, we resolve this open
problem, albeit in a somewhat unexpected way. We show that characterizing
stable queueing networks is an algorithmically undecidable problem for the case
of nonpreemptive static buffer priority scheduling policies and deterministic
interarrival and service times. Thus, no constructive characterization of
stable queueing networks operating under this class of policies is possible.
The result is established for queueing networks with finite and infinite buffer
sizes and possibly zero service times, although we conjecture that it also
holds in the case of models with only infinite buffers and nonzero service
times. Our approach extends an earlier related work [Math. Oper. Res. 27 (2002)
272--293] and uses the so-called counter machine device as a reduction tool.

(WIMPs) in the Sun's core. Solar-matter effects on the flavor propagation of
the resulting $\agt$ GeV neutrinos are studied analytically within a
density-matrix formalism. Matter effects, including mass-state level-crossings,
influence the flavor fluxes considerably. The exposition herein is somewhat
pedagogical, in that it starts with adiabatic evolution of single flavors from
the Sun's center, with $\theta_{13}$ set to zero, and progresses to fully
realistic processing of the flavor ratios expected in WIMP decay, from the
Sun's core to the Earth. In the fully realistic calculation, non-adiabatic
level-crossing is included, as are possible nonzero values for $\theta_{13}$
and the CP-violating phase $\delta$. Due to resonance enhancement in matter,
nonzero values of $\theta_{13}$ even smaller than a degree can noticeably
affect flavor propagation. Both normal and inverted neutrino-mass hierarchies
are considered. Our main conclusion is that measuring flavor ratios (in
addition to energy spectra) of $\agt$ GeV solar neutrinos can provide
discrinination between WIMP models. In particular, we demonstrate the flavor
differences at Earth for neutrinos from the two main classes of WIMP final
states, namely $W^+ W^-$ and 95% $b \bar{b}$ + 5% $\tau^+\tau^-$. Conversely,
if WIMP properties were to be learned from production in future accelerators,
then the flavor ratios of $\agt$ GeV solar neutrinos might be useful for
inferring $\theta_{13}$ and the mass hierarchy.

theories on which the scalar manifold is described by K\""ahler geometry and can
further be viewed as K\""ahler-Ricci soliton generating a one-parameter family
of K\""ahler geometries. All couplings and solutions, namely the BPS domain
walls and their supersymmetric Lorentz invariant vacua turn out to be evolved
with respect to the flow parameter related to the soliton. Two models are
discussed, namely N=1 theory on K\""ahler-Einstein manifold and U(n) symmetric
K\""ahler-Ricci soliton with positive definite metric. In the first case we find
that the evolution of the soliton causes topological change and
correspondingly, modifies the Morse index of the nondegenerate vacua realized
in the parity transformation of the Hessian matrix of the scalar potential
after hitting singularity, which is natural in the global theory and for
nondegenerate Minkowskian vacua of the local theory. However, such situation is
not trivial in anti de Sitter (AdS) vacua. In an explicit model, we find that
this geometric (K\""ahler-Ricci) flow can also change the index of the vacuum
before and after singularity. Finally in the second case, since around the
origin the metric is diffeomorphic to $ {\mathrm{\lC P}}^{n -1}$, we have to
consider it in the asymptotic region. Our analysis shows that no index
modification of vacua is present in both global and local theories.

formulated for the N-user discrete memoryless multiple-access channel (MAC).
The essence of the formulation is to invoke an {\em elementary} MAC where sizes
of input alphabets are not greater than the size of output alphabet. The main
objective is to demonstrate that the channel capacity of an MAC is achieved by
an elementary MAC included in the original MAC. The proof is quite
straightforward by the very definition of the elementary MAC. Moreover it is
proved that the Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the elementary MAC are strictly
sufficient and obviously necessary for the channel capacity. The latter proof
requires some steps such that for the elementary MAC every solution of the
Kuhn-Tucker conditions reveals itself as local maximum on the domain of all
possible input probability distributions and then it achieves the channel
capacity. As a result, in respect of the channel capacity, the MAC in general
can be regarded as an aggregate of a finite number of elementary MAC's.

The ammonia maps show two compact sources, one for each protostar, and they are
probably protostellar accretion disks. The disk associated with IRAS 4A2 is
seen nearly edge-on and shows an indication of rotation. The A2 disk is
brighter in the ammonia lines but dimmer in the dust continuum than its sibling
disk, with the ammonia-to-dust flux ratios different by about an order of
magnitude. This difference suggests that the twin disks have surprisingly
dissimilar characters, one gas-rich and the other dusty. The A2 disk may be
unusually active or hot, as indicated by its association with water vapor
masers. The existence of two very dissimilar disks in a binary system suggests
that the formation process of multiple systems has a controlling agent lacking

> 0.8, while spirals dominate the remainder at lower redshifts. (iii) We find

ones, in the images of 24 fields that were not included in the previous
studies. Combining these with previous data in the literature, we increase the
number of M33 star clusters found in the HST images to 242. We have derived BVI
integrated photometry of these star clusters from the CCD images taken with
CFH12k mosaic camera at CFHT. Integrated color-magnitude diagrams of the M33
star clusters are found to be similar in general to those of star clusters in
the Large Magellanic Cloud, except that M33 has a much lower fraction of blue
star clusters. We find 29 red star clusters with 0.5 <= (B-V)_0 <= 1.1 and 0.7
<=(V-I)_0 <= 1.2, which are old globular cluster candidates. We divide the
cluster sample into three groups according to their (B-V)_0 color: blue star
clusters with (B-V)_0 <= 0.3, intermediate color star clusters with 0.3 <
(B-V)_0 <0.5, and red star clusters with (B-V)_0 >= 0.5. Most of the new
clusters in M33 are located along the sequence that is consistent with the
theoretical evolutionary path for Z=0.004, Y=0.24 in the (B-V)_0--(V-I)_0
diagram, while a few of them are in the redder side in the (V-I)_0 color. The
red clusters are found relatively more in the outer region of M33 than the blue
and intermediate color clusters, and that many of the blue stars are located in
the HII regions. The luminosity function for the blue star clusters shows a
peak at Mv ~ -7.3 mag, while that for the intermediate color star cluster shows
a peak at the fainter magnitude Mv ~ -6.3 mag. The luminosity function for the
red star clusters shows also a peak at Mv ~ -6.8 mag, although the number of
the clusters is small.

superconducting film resistance has been observed when a metallic gate is
placed above the film. We study how the magnetic coupling between vortices in a
thin superconducting film and electrons in a remote unbiased gate suppresses
the tunneling rate of the vortices. We examine two general approaches to
analyze tunneling in the presence of slow low-energy degrees of freedom: the
functional-integral and scattering formalisms. In the first one, the response
of the electrons inside the metallic gate to a change in the vortex position is
described by the ""tunneling with dissipation"". We consider the Eddy current
induced in the gate by the magnetic flux of the vortex as a result of
tunneling. In the second approach, the response is given in terms of scattering
of the electrons by the magnetic flux of the vortex in a way similar to the
Aharonov-Bohm scattering. A sudden change in the vortex position leads to the
Orthogonality Catastrophe that opposes the vortex tunneling. We show that the
magnetic coupling between the vortices and the electrons inside the gate can
lead to a dramatic suppression of the vortex tunneling, restoring the
superconducting property in accord with the experiment.

control these dynamics therefore requires ultrafast sources of radiation
combined with efficient detection techniques. The generation of extreme
ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond (1 as = 10-18 s) pulses has, for the first time,
made direct measurements of electron dynamics possible. Nevertheless, while
various applications of attosecond pulses have been demonstrated
experimentally, no one has yet captured or controlled the full three
dimensional motion of an electron on an attosecond time scale. Here we
demonstrate an attosecond quantum stroboscope capable of guiding and imaging
electron motion on a sub-femtosecond (1 fs = 10-15 s) time scale. It is based
on a sequence of identical attosecond pulses which are synchronized with a
guiding laser field. The pulse to pulse separation in the train is tailored to
exactly match an optical cycle of the laser field and the electron momentum
distributions are detected with a velocity map imaging spectrometer (VMIS).
This technique has enabled us to guide ionized electrons back to their parent
ion and image the scattering event. We envision that coherent electron
scattering from atoms, molecules and surfaces captured by the attosecond
quantum stroboscope will complement more traditional scattering techniques
since it provides high temporal as well as spatial resolution.

Tago, on 2006 October 31 as a transient brightening, by ~4.5 mag during a ~15
day period, of a normal A-type star (GSC 3656-1328) in the Cassiopeia

indicates that this event was caused by gravitational microlensing rather than
an intrinsically variable star. Discovery of this single event over a 30 year
period is roughly consistent with the expected microlensing rate for the whole
sky down to V = 12 mag stars. However, the probability for finding events with
such a high magnification (~ 50) is much smaller, by a factor ~1/50, which
implies that the true event rate may be higher than expected. This discovery
indicates the potential of all sky variability surveys, employing frequent
sampling by telescopes with small apertures and wide fields of view, for
finding such rare transient events, and using the observations to explore
galactic disk structure and search for exo-planets.

strand which is complementary to a single-stranded DNA template. From the
perspective of physicists, an RNAP is a molecular motor that utilizes chemical
energy input to move along the track formed by a DNA. In many circumstances,
which are described in this paper, a large number of RNAPs move simultaneously
along the same track; we refer to such collective movements of the RNAPs as
RNAP traffic. Here we develop a theoretical model for RNAP traffic by
incorporating the steric interactions between RNAPs as well as the
mechano-chemical cycle of individual RNAPs during the elongation of the mRNA.
By a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we calculate the rates
of mRNA synthesis and the average density profile of the RNAPs on the DNA
track. We also introduce, and compute, two new measures of fluctuations in the
synthesis of RNA. Analyzing these fluctuations, we show how the level of {\it
intrinsic noise} in mRNA synthesis depends on the concentrations of the RNAPs
as well as on those of some of the reactants and the products of the enzymatic
reactions catalyzed by RNAP. We suggest appropriate experimental systems and
techniques for testing our theoretical predictions.

absorbs an ultraviolet photon leading to the formation of an attosecond

create free EWPs in the continuum, where they quickly disperse. In this paper
we use a train of attosecond pulses, synchronized to an infrared (IR) laser

helium. We show that the ionization probability then becomes a function of the
delay between the IR and attosecond fields. Calculations that reproduce the

scale estimates in a multivariate setting. The depth of an observation is a
measure of its centrality, with respect to a data set or a distribution. The
data depths of a set of multivariate observations translates to a
center-outward ordering of the data. Thus, data depth provides a generalization
of the median to a multivariate setting (the deepest observation), and can also
be used to screen for extreme observations or outliers (the observations with
low data depth). Data depth has been used in the development of a wide range of
robust and non-parametric methods for multivariate data, such as non-parametric
tests of location and scale [Li and Liu (2004)], multivariate rank-tests [Liu
and Singh (1993)], non-parametric classification and clustering [Jornsten
(2004)], and robust regression [Rousseeuw and Hubert (1999)]. Many different
notions of data depth have been developed for multivariate data. In contrast,
data depth measures for functional data have only recently been proposed
[Fraiman and Muniz (1999), L\'{o}pez-Pintado and Romo (2006a)]. While the
definitions of both of these data depth measures are motivated by the
functional aspect of the data, the measures themselves are in fact invariant
with respect to permutations of the domain (i.e. the compact interval on which
the functions are defined). Thus, these measures are equally applicable to
multivariate data where there is no explicit ordering of the data dimensions.
In this paper we explore some extensions of functional data depths, so as to
take the ordering of the data dimensions into account.

limits of neutrino mass are weakened by a factor of 2 (95% C.L.), say,

flavour content for these states. Adding that the \eta^\prime is not a

They connect the dressed-quark propagator to the topological susceptibility. It
is confirmed that in the chiral limit the \eta^\prime mass is proportional to
the matrix element which connects this state to the vacuum via the topological
susceptibility. The implications of the mass formulae are illustrated using an
elementary dynamical model, which includes an Ansatz for that part of the
Bethe-Salpeter kernel related to the non-Abelian anomaly. In addition to the

mass-scale. It is employed in an analysis of pseudoscalar- and vector-meson

breaking are emphasised, the five-flavour spectra are described. Despite its

performed with the IRAM 30 m telescope. This search was motivated by the recent
detection of cold dust emission in the HVCs of Complex C. Despite a spatial
resolution which is three times better and sensitivity twice as good compared
to previous studies, no CO emission is detected in the HVCs of Complex C down
to a best 5 sigma limit of 0.16 K km/s at a 22'' resolution. The CO emission
non-detection does not provide any evidence in favor of large amounts of
molecular gas in these HVCs and hence in favor of the infrared findings. We
discuss different configurations which, however, allow us to reconcile the
negative CO result with the presence of molecular gas and cold dust emission.
H2 column densities higher than our detection limit, N(H2) = 3x10^{19} cm^{-2},
are expected to be confined in very small and dense clumps with 20 times
smaller sizes than the 0.5 pc clumps resolved in our observations according to
the results obtained in cirrus clouds, and might thus still be highly diluted.
As a consequence, the inter-clump gas at the 1 pc scale has a volume density
lower than 20 cm^{-3} and already appears as too diffuse to excite the CO
molecules. The observed physical conditions in the HVCs of Complex C also play
an important role against CO emission detection. It has been shown that the
CO-to-H2 conversion factor in low metallicity media is 60 times higher than at
the solar metallicity, leading for a given H2 column density to a 60 times
weaker integrated CO intensity. And the very low dust temperature estimated in
these HVCs implies the possible presence of gas cold enough (< 20 K) to cause
CO condensation onto dust grains under interstellar medium pressure conditions
and thus CO depletion in gas-phase observations.

disc. Here, we focus here on the regime where the warp evolves diffusively. By
comparing the numerical results to a simple diffusion model, we are able to
determine the diffusion coefficient of the warp, $\alpha_2$, as a function of
the relevant disc parameters. We find that while in general the disc behaviour
is well reproduced by the diffusion model and for relatively large viscosities
the warp diffusion is well described by the linear theory (in particular
confirming that the warp diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to
viscosity), significant non-linear effects are present as the viscosity becomes
smaller, but still dominates over wave-propagation effects. In particular, we
find that the inverse dependence of the diffusion coefficient on viscosity
breaks down at low viscosities, so that $\alpha_2$ never becomes larger than a
saturation value $\alpha_{\rm max}$ of order unity. This can have major
consequences in the evolution of systems where a warped disc is present. In
particular, it affects the location of the warp radius in the Bardeen-Petterson
effect and therefore the spin up (or spin down) of supermassive black holes in
the nuclei of galaxies. Additionally, we also find that while the rate of warp
diffusion does not depend significantly on the detailed viscosity formulation,
the rate of internal precession generated by the warp is strongly affected by
it. Such effects should be considered with care when modeling the evolution of
warped discs. This emphasises the need to test the above results using
different numerical schemes, and with higher resolution, in order to
investigate the degree to which numerical simulations are able to provide
accurate modeling of the complex fluid dynamics of warped discs. (Abridged)

studied in inverse kinematics with the large-aperture setup SPALADIN at GSI.
Coincidences of residues with low-center-of-mass kinetic energy light particles
and fragments have been measured allowing the decomposition of the total
reaction cross-section into the different possible de-excitation channels.
Detailed information on the evolution of these de-excitation channels with
excitation energy has also been obtained. The comparison of the data with
predictions of several de-excitation models coupled to the INCL4 intra-nuclear
cascade model shows that only GEMINI can reasonably account for the bulk of
collected results, indicating that in a light system with no compression and
little angular momentum, multifragmentation might not be necessary to explain
the data.

quantum version of Prisoner's Dilemma, where the quantum circuit is realized by
a 4-qubit box-cluster configuration and the player's local strategies by
measurements performed on the physical qubits of the cluster. This
demonstration underlines the strength and versatility of the one-way model and
we expect that this will trigger further interest in designing quantum
protocols and algorithms to be tested in state-of-the-art cluster resources.

Yehuda was the chair of the Department of Statistics of Rutgers University when
he passed away unexpectedly on January 13, 2005. On October 21--22, 2005, some
150 leading scholars from many different fields, including statistics,
telecommunications, biomedical engineering, bioinformatics, biostatistics and
epidemiology, gathered at Rutgers in a conference in his honor. This conference
was on ``Complex Datasets and Inverse Problems: Tomography, Networks, and
Beyond,'' and was organized by the editors. The present collection includes
research work presented at the conference, as well as contributions from
Yehuda's colleagues. The theme of the conference was networks and other
important and emerging areas of research involving incomplete data and
statistical inverse problems. Networks are abundant around us: communication,
computer, traffic, social and energy are just a few examples. As enormous
amounts of network data are collected in this information age, the field has
attracted a great amount of attention from researchers in statistics and
computer engineering as well as telecommunication providers and various
government agencies. However, few statistical tools have been developed for
analyzing network data as they are typically governed by time-varying and
mutually dependent communication protocols sitting on complicated
graph-structured network topologies. Many prototypical applications in these
and other important technologies can be viewed as statistical inverse problems
with complex, massive, high-dimensional and possibly biased/incomplete data.
This unifying theme of inverse problems is particularly appropriate for a
conference and volume dedicated to the memory of Yehuda. Indeed he made
influential contributions to these fields, especially in medical tomography,
biased data, statistical inverse problems, and network tomography.

or larger, self-interacting via the mean field mechanism. We analyze the
long-time asymptotics of finite energy solutions and prove that, under certain
generic assumptions, each solution converges (as time goes to infinity) to the
two-dimensional set of all ``nonlinear eigenfunctions'' of the form
$\phi(x)e\sp{-i\omega t}$. This global attraction is caused by the nonlinear
energy transfer from lower harmonics to the continuous spectrum and subsequent
dispersive radiation.

of distant galaxies or quasars with the next generation of large telescope and
ultra-stable spectrographs (the so-called Sandage-Loeb test). Here we
investigate the possibility of observing the change in peculiar velocity in
nearby clusters and galaxies. This ``peculiar acceleration'' could help
reconstructing the gravitational potential without assuming virialization. We
show that the expected effect is of the same order of magnitude of the
cosmological velocity shift. Finally, we discuss how to convert the theoretical
predictions into quantities directly related to observations.

interactions with phonons was investigated using the formalism of
nonequilibrium Green's functions. The self-consistent Born approximation was
used to model the self-energies. Its validity was checked by comparison with
the results obtained by direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of
interacting electrons and longitudinal optical phonons. The nature of charge
transport at electron -- phonon resonances was investigated in detail and
contributions from scattering and coherent tunnelling to the current were
identified. It was found that at larger values of the structure period the main
peak in the current -- field characteristics exhibits a doublet structure which
was shown to be a transport signature of polaron effects. At smaller values of
the period, electron -- phonon resonances cause multiple peaks in the
characteristics. A phenomenological model for treatment of nonuniformities of a
realistic quantum dot ensemble was also introduced to estimate the influence of
nonuniformities on current -- field characteristics.

forming the channels of field effect transistors. We measure the current in
these devices as a function of source-drain voltage, gate voltage and
temperature. Annealing is necessary to observe measurable current after which a
simple model of hopping between intrinsic localized states describes the
transport properties of the nanocrystal solid. We find that the majority
carriers are holes, which are thermally released from acceptor states. At low
source-drain voltages, the activation energy for the conductivity is given by
the energy required to generate holes plus the activation over barriers
resulting from site disorder. At high source-drain voltages the activation
energy is given by the former only. The thermal activation energy of the
zero-bias conductance indicates that the Fermi energy is close to the
highest-occupied valence level, the 1Sh state, and this is confirmed by
field-effect measurements, which give a density of states of approximately
eight per nanocrystal as expected from the degeneracy of the 1Sh state.

by static or dynamic disorder. Quantum interference for static disorder can
lead to Anderson localization which completely hinders the quantum walk and it
is contrasted with the decoherence effect of dynamic disorder having strength
W, where a quantum to classical crossover at time $t_{c}\propto W^{-2}$
transforms the quantum walk into an ordinary random walk with diffusive
spreading. We demonstrate these localization and decoherence phenomena in
quantum carpets of the observed time evolution and examine in detail a dimer
lattice which corresponds to a single qubit subject to randomness.
