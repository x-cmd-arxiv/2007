inter-galactic hydrogen will provide an unprecedented probe of the reionization
era. Conventional wisdom assumes that this 21cm signal disappears as soon as
reionization is complete, when little atomic hydrogen is left through most of
the volume of the inter-galactic medium (IGM). However observations of damped
Ly-alpha absorbers indicate that the fraction of hydrogen in its neutral form
is significant by mass at all redshifts. Here we use a physically-motivated
model to show that residual neutral gas, confined to dense regions in the IGM
with a high recombination rate, will generate a significant post-reionization
21cm signal. We show that the power-spectrum of fluctuations in this signal
will be detectable by the first generation of low-frequency observatories at a
signal-to-noise that is comparable to that achievable in observations of the
reionization era. The statistics of 21cm fluctuations will therefore probe not
only the pre-reionization IGM, but rather the entire process of HII region
overlap, as well as the appearance of the diffuse ionized IGM.

line, significantly contributed to the generation of magnetic shear. Signatures
of these shear flows are strongly curved penumbral filaments, which are almost
tangential to sunspot umbrae rather than exhibiting the typical radial
filamentary structure. Solar active region NOAA 10756 was a moderately complex,

are a common phenomenon in complex active regions and delta spots. However,

density range from gas to jamming. Driven wet granular matter exhibits a
van-der-Waals-like unstable branch at granular temperatures T<T_c corresponding
to a first order segregation transition of clusters. For the realistic rupture
length of the liquid bridge, s_crit=0.07 d, the critical point is located at

length, the critical density phi_c is shown to scale with s_crit according to
s_crit = 4d (sqrt(phi_J / phi_c) -1). The segregation transition is closely
related to the precipitation of granular droplets reported for the free cooling
of one-dimensional wet granular matter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 078001 (2006)],

of sticky bonds, E_cb >> T, is of relevance for aggregation in general,

ground-based interferometers focus essentially on two types of waveforms: short
unmodeled bursts and chirps from inspiralling compact binaries. There is room
for other types of searches based on different models. Our objective is to fill
this gap. More specifically, we are interested in GW chirps with an arbitrary
phase/frequency vs. time evolution. These unmodeled GW chirps may be considered
as the generic signature of orbiting/spinning sources. We expect quasi-periodic
nature of the waveform to be preserved independent of the physics which governs
the source motion. Several methods have been introduced to address the
detection of unmodeled chirps using the data of a single detector. Those
include the best chirplet chain (BCC) algorithm introduced by the authors. In
the next years, several detectors will be in operation. The joint coherent
analysis of GW by multiple detectors can improve the sight horizon, the
estimation of the source location and the wave polarization angles. Here, we
extend the BCC search to the multiple detector case. The method amounts to
searching for salient paths in the combined time-frequency representation of
two synthetic streams. The latter are time-series which combine the data from
each detector linearly in such a way that all the GW signatures received are
added constructively. We give a proof of principle for the full sky blind
search in a simplified situation which shows that the joint estimation of the
source sky location and chirp frequency is possible.

We consider a superconducting lattice with a magnetic impurity inserted at its

we observe a sudden drop of the fidelity between two one-site partial states

two-site states, the fidelity reveals the transition point as long as one of
the two electron sites is located at the impurity, while the other lies
elsewhere in the lattice. We also determine the Uhlmann mixed state geometric
phase, recently introduced in the study of the structural change of the system
state eigenvectors in the vicinity of the lines of thermal phase transitions,

when an electron site is at the impurity. This means that the system partial
state eigenvectors do not contribute significantly to the enhanced state
distinguishability around the point of this quantum phase transition. Finally,
we use the fidelity to analyze the total amount of correlations contained

then tree-level Kaluza-Klein number is not conserved in the Yukawa
interactions. This leads to mixing between zero-mode fermions and their
associated Kaluza-Klein excitations. The effect can be quite large for the top
quark, since its mass (171.4 plus or minus 2.1 GeV) is approximately one-half
the current Tevatron mass bound (about 350-400 GeV) for Kaluza-Klein
excitations of quarks with one universal extra dimension. In contrast to the
SM, the bi-unitary transformation that diagonalizes the mass matrix does not
diagonalize the effective 4D Yukawa coupling matrix because of the presence of
the 5D kinetic terms. This leads to violation of tree-level Kaluza-Klein number
conservation in the gauge sector due to a unique feature of the 5D theory. This
allows Kaluza-Klein excitations of the fermions to be produced singly, and
opens up new decay channels in the gauge sector. We compute the cross section
for the production of the lowest-lying Kaluza-Klein excitations of the top and
bottom quarks in the non-universal Higgs model at the Large Hadron Collider,
and consider their subsequent decays. The effect is quite large: For example,
pair production of Kaluza-Klein excitations of the bottom quark will lead to a
pair of top quarks plus a pair of charged weak gauge bosons. Since the
production is via the strong interaction, such final states stand out well
against the Standard Model background, and are observable at the LHC for a wide
range of compactification scales. Finally, we discuss the effects that such a
model has on the T- parameter, and propose a model with maximal mixing where

the meaning of the fine structure constant. The reasoning is based on a
discrete self-similar cosmological paradigm that has shown promise in
explaining the general scaling properties of nature's global hierarchy. The
discrete scale invariance of the paradigm implies that ""strong gravity"" governs

gravitational coupling constant and Planck mass, one can demonstrate that the

the colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) properties of manganese oxides. The
application of a magnetic field may indeed trigger large magnetoresistance
effects due to the percolation between clusters allowing the movement of the
charge carriers. However, this macroscopic phase separation is mainly related
to extrinsic defects or impurities, which hinder the long-ranged charge-orbital
order of the system. We show in the present article that rather than the
macroscopic phase separation, an homogeneous short-ranged charge-orbital order
accompanied by a spin glass state occurs, as an intrinsic result of the
uniformity of the random potential perturbation induced by the solid solution
of the cations on the $A$-sites of the structure of these materials. Hence the
phase separation does occur, but in a more subtle and interesting nanoscopic
form, here referred as ``homogeneous''. Remarkably, this ``nanoscale phase
separation'' alone is able to bring forth the colossal magnetoresistance in the
perovskite manganites, and is potentially relevant to a wide variety of other
magnetic and/or electrical properties of manganites, as well as many other
transition metal oxides, in bulk or thin film form as we exemplify throughout

resource-constrained network communications (e.g., sensor networks), in which
one or many deprived encoders communicate a Markov source against bit errors
and erasure errors to many heterogeneous decoders, some powerful and some
deprived. To keep the encoder complexity at minimum, the source is coded into K
descriptions by a simple multiple description quantizer (MDQ) with neither
entropy nor channel coding. The code diversity of MDQ and the path diversity of
the network are exploited by decoders to correct transmission errors and
improve coding efficiency. A key design objective is resource scalability:
powerful nodes in the network can perform JSC-MD distributed
estimation/decoding under the criteria of maximum a posteriori probability
(MAP) or minimum mean-square error (MMSE), while primitive nodes resort to
simpler MD decoding, all working with the same MDQ code. The application of
JSC-MD to distributed estimation of hidden Markov models in a sensor network is
demonstrated. The proposed JSC-MD MAP estimator is an algorithm of the longest
path in a weighted directed acyclic graph, while the JSC-MD MMSE decoder is an
extension of the well-known forward-backward algorithm to multiple
descriptions. Both algorithms simultaneously exploit the source memory, the
redundancy of the fixed-rate MDQ, and the inter-description correlations. They
outperform the existing hard-decision MDQ decoders by large margins (up to
8dB). For Gaussian Markov sources, the complexity of JSC-MD distributed MAP
sequence estimation can be made as low as that of typical single description
Viterbi-type algorithms.

  An improved one for three-dimensional material point method is presented in
this paper. The improved algorithm emphasizes the energy conservation of the
system and faithfully recovers opposite acting forces between contacting
bodies. Contrasted to the one by Bardenhagen, both the normal and tangential
contacting forces are more appropriately applied to the contacting bodies via
the contacting nodes of the background mesh; Contrasted to the one by Hu and
Chen, not only the tangential velocities but also the normal ones are handled
separately in respective individual mesh. This treatment ensures not only the
contact/sliding/separation procedure but also the friction between contacting
bodies are recovered. The presented contact algorithm is validated via
numerical experiments including rolling simulation, impact of elastic spheres,
impact of a Taylor bar and impact of plastic spheres. The numerical results
show that the multi-mesh material point method with the improved contact
algorithm is more suitable for solving collision problems.

to ill-conditioned systems of equations. In this paper we investigate for the
interior Helmholtz problem on analytic domains how the singularities (charge
points) of the MFS basis functions have to be chosen such that approximate
solutions can be represented by the MFS basis in a numerically stable way. For
Helmholtz problems on the unit disc we give a full analysis which includes the
high frequency (short wavelength) limit. For more difficult and nonconvex
domains such as crescents we demonstrate how the right choice of charge points
is connected to how far into the complex plane the solution of the boundary
value problem can be analytically continued, which in turn depends on both
domain shape and boundary data. Using this we develop a recipe for locating
charge points which allows us to reach error norms of typically 10^{-11} on a
wide variety of analytic domains. At high frequencies of order only 3 points
per wavelength are needed, which compares very favorably to boundary integral
methods.

phase-averaged spectra in the energy range above 10 keV are well fitted by
``Negative and Positive power-law times EXponential (NPEX)'' model, multiplied
by a fundamental cyclotron resonance scattering feature at ~36 keV which
appears very significantly in the HXD-PIN data. The resonance profiles were

than by a Gaussian type alternative. The pulse phase-averaged HXD-GSO data,

provide a simple interpretation of these travel times. We study the interaction
of surface-gravity waves with horizontal flows in an incompressible,
plane-parallel solar atmosphere. We show that for uniform flows less than
roughly 250 m s$^{-1}$, the travel-time shifts are linear in the flow
amplitude. For stronger flows, perturbation theory up to third order is needed
to model waveforms. The case of small-amplitude spatially-varying flows is
treated using the first-order Born approximation. We derive two-dimensional
Fr\'{e}chet kernels that give the sensitivity of travel-time shifts to local
flows. We show that the effect of flows on travel times depends on wave damping
and on the direction from which the observations are made. The main physical
effect is the advection of the waves by the flow rather than the advection of
wave sources or the effect of flows on wave damping. We compare the
two-dimensional sensitivity kernels with simplified three-dimensional kernels
that only account for wave advection and assume a vertical line of sight. We
find that the three-dimensional f-mode kernels approximately separate in the
horizontal and vertical coordinates, with the horizontal variations given by
the simplified two-dimensional kernels. This consistency between quite
different models gives us confidence in the usefulness of these kernels for
interpreting quiet-Sun observations.

theory permits a treatment of general margin losses, convex or nonconvex, in
presence or absence of a dominating class. Three main results are established.
First, for any fixed margin loss, there may be a trade-off between the ideal
and actual generalization performances with respect to the choice of the class
of candidate decision functions, which is governed by the trade-off between the
approximation and estimation errors. In fact, different margin losses lead to
different ideal or actual performances in specific cases. Second, we
demonstrate, in a problem of linear learning, that the convergence rate can be
arbitrarily fast in the sample size $n$ depending on the joint distribution of
the input/output pair. This goes beyond the anticipated rate $O(n^{-1})$.
Third, we establish rates of convergence of several margin classifiers in
feature selection with the number of candidate variables $p$ allowed to greatly
exceed the sample size $n$ but no faster than $\exp(n)$.

that local projective measurements and classical communication are as powerful
as the most general local measurements and classical communication. Remarkably,
this indicates that the local distinguishability of multi-qubit states can be
decided efficiently. Another useful consequence is that a set of orthogonal
$n$-qubit states is locally distinguishable only if the summation of their
orthogonal Schmidt numbers is less than the total dimension $2^n$. When $n=2$
such a condition is also sufficient. Employing these results, we show that any
orthonormal basis of a subspace spanned by arbitrary three-qubit orthogonal
unextendible product bases (UPB) cannot be exactly distinguishable by local
operations and classical communication. This not only reveals another intrinsic
property of three-qubit orthogonal UPB, but also provides a class of locally
indistinguishable subspaces with dimension 4. We also explicitly construct
locally indistinguishable subspaces with dimensions 3 and 5, respectively. In
particular, 3 is the minimal possible dimension of locally indistinguishable

can be seen in the whole region of the curvature modulus \alpha, which is the
coefficient of the deficit angle term in the Hamiltonian. The bending energy,
which is not included in the Hamiltonian, remains large even at sufficiently
large \alpha in the tubular phase. On the other hand, the surface is
spontaneously compactified into a one-dimensional smooth curve in the linear

estimation is investigated. First, by searching into the family of nearest
neighbor decoders, which can be easily implemented on most practical coded
modulation systems, we derive a decoding metric that minimizes the average of
the transmission error probability over all channel estimation errors. Next, we
specialize our general expression to obtain the corresponding decoding metric
for fading MIMO channels. According to the notion of estimation-induced outage
(EIO) capacity introduced in our previous work and assuming no channel state
information (CSI) at the transmitter, we characterize maximal achievable
information rates, using Gaussian codebooks, associated to the proposed
decoder. In the case of uncorrelated Rayleigh fading, these achievable rates
are compared to the rates achieved by the classical mismatched
maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder and the ultimate limits given by the EIO
capacity. Numerical results show that the derived metric provides significant
gains for the considered scenario, in terms of achievable information rates and
bit error rate (BER), in a bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) framework,
without introducing any additional decoding complexity.

is applied at one site while a static potential is applied in a different

order in the oscillation amplitude and exactly in the oscillation frequency.
For low frequency, the charge pumped per cycle is proportional to the frequency
and therefore vanishes in the adiabatic limit. If the static potential has a
bound state, we find that such a state has a significant effect on the pumped
charge if the oscillating potential can excite the bound state into the
continuum states or vice versa. Finally, we use the equation of motion for the
density matrix to numerically compute the pumped current for any value of the
amplitude and frequency. The numerical results confirm the unusual effect of a

  welcome",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  An alternative cosmological model is presented, which avoids the requirement
of dark energy and dark matter. Based on the proposition that energy
conservation should be valid not only locally but also globally, the energy
tensor of general relativity has to be corrected, including potential energy of
matter explicitly. This leads to the consequence that a homogeneous universe
must be static, as potential energy acts as a field with negative pressure. In
this static universe cosmological red shift can be understood as energy loss by
gravitational radiation. There exists a continuous matter cycle, beginning from
hot intergalactic plasma, which is replenished by the jets of quasars, the
formation of large web-like structures, the formation of galaxies and stars, to
the final collapse into quasars again. The model is confirmed qualitatively by
the observed size distribution of cosmic structures. Quantitative confirmation
is obtained from the diffuse x-ray background and from observations of
supernovas. As the total energy content of the universe (trace of the energy
tensor) is zero in this model, creation ex nihilo is possible, but requires
changes of our elementary particle models. An idea of a modified model is

Observational evidence suggests that the GB is our closest star formation

work we analyze the fractal structure of the stellar component of the GB. In
order to do this, we tailor and apply an algorithm that estimates the fractal
dimension in a precise and accurate way, avoiding both boundary and small data
set problems. We find that early OB stars (of spectral types earlier than B4)
in the GB have a fractal dimension very similar to that of the gas clouds in
our Galaxy. On the contrary, stars in the GB of later spectral types show a
larger fractal dimension, similar to that found for OB stars of both age groups
in the local Galactic disk (LGD). This result seems to indicate that while the
younger OB stars in the GB preserve the memory of the spatial structure of the
cloud where they were born, older stars are distributed following a similar
morphology as that found for the LGD stars. The possible causes for these
differences are discussed.

Employing the Tomimura-Eriguchi scheme to construct the equilibrium
configurations. we study the basic physical properties of the sequences in the
framework of Newton gravity. In addition we newly take into account a general
relativistic effect to the magnetized rotating configurations. With these
computations, we find that the properties of the Newtonian magnetized stars,
e.g., structure of magnetic field, highly depends on the EOSs.
  The toroidal magnetic fields concentrate rather near the surface for Shen and
LS EOSs than those for SLy and FPS EOSs. The poloidal fields are also affected
by the toroidal configurations. Paying attention to the stiffness of the EOSs,
we analyze this tendency in detail. In the general relativistic stars, we find
that the difference due to the EOSs becomes small because all the employed EOSs
become sufficiently stiff for the large maximum density, typically greater than
$10^{15}\rm{g} \rm{cm}^{-3}$. The maximum baryon mass of the magnetized stars
with axis ratio $q\sim 0.7$ increases about up to twenty percents for that of
spherical stars. We furthermore compute equilibrium sequences at finite
temperature, which should serve as an initial condition for the hydrodynamic
study of newly-born magnetars. Our results suggest that we may obtain

the cell. Moreover, it is increasingly recognized that these enzymes can also
be spatially separated, leading to gradients of the active form of the
messenger protein. Here, we investigate the consequences of the spatial
distributions of the enzymes for the amplification properties of push-pull
networks. Our calculations reveal that enzyme localization by itself can have a
dramatic effect on the gain. The gain is maximized when the two enzymes are
either uniformly distributed or colocalized in one region in the cell.
Depending on the diffusion constants, however, the sharpness of the response
can be strongly reduced when the enzymes are spatially separated. We discuss
how our predictions could be tested experimentally.

Its solution may be associated with supersymmetry which is a fundamental
space-time symmetry that has not been verified experimentally so far. In many
supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, the
lightest supersymmetric particle cannot decay and is hence a promising dark
matter candidate. The lightest neutralino, which appears already in the minimal
supersymmetric model, can be identified as such a candidate in indirect and
direct dark matter searches and at future colliders. As the superpartner of the
graviton, the gravitino is another candidate for the lightest superparticle
that provides a compelling explanation of dark matter. While it will neither be
detected in indirect or direct searches nor be produced directly at
accelerators, the analysis of late-decaying charged particles can allow for an
experimental identification of the gravitino at future accelerators. In this
way, the upcoming experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider may become a
key to the understanding of our Universe.

The LDA model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of

LDA is the inability to model topic correlation even though, for example, a
document about genetics is more likely to also be about disease than X-ray
astronomy. This limitation stems from the use of the Dirichlet distribution to
model the variability among the topic proportions. In this paper we develop the
correlated topic model (CTM), where the topic proportions exhibit correlation
via the logistic normal distribution [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 44 (1982)

posterior inference in this model, which is complicated by the fact that the
logistic normal is not conjugate to the multinomial. We apply the CTM to the
articles from Science published from 1990--1999, a data set that comprises 57M
words. The CTM gives a better fit of the data than LDA, and we demonstrate its

strongly clamped to those of the substrate and the films remain strained up to
well above t=100 nm, the (110) films relax much earlier. Accurate determination
of the in-plane and out-of-plane interplanar distances has allowed concluding
that in all cases the unit cell volume of the manganite reduces gradually when
increasing thickness, approaching the bulk value. It is observed that the
magnetic properties (Curie temperature and saturation magnetization) of the

observations, combined with 55Mn-nuclear magnetic resonance data and X-ray

deformation of the perovskite lattice but rather due to the electronic and
chemical phase separation caused by the substrate-induced strain. On the
contrary, the thickness dependence of the magnetic properties of the less

the secondary is replaced by a spherical star with a space-dependent Coriolis
force that mimics the effect of the Roche geometry. The Euler equations are
solved in spherical coordinates with the TVD-MacCormack scheme. We show that
the Coriolis force leads to the formation of a circulation flow from high
latitude region to the close vicinity of the $L_1$ point. However no heat can
be efficiently transported to the $L_1$ region due to the rapid radiative
cooling of the hot material as it enters the equatorial belt shadowed from
irradiation. Under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, the Coriolis
force could lead to a moderate increase of the mass transfer rate by pushing
the gas in the vertical direction at the $L_1$ point, but only during the
initial phases of the outburst (about 15 -- 20 orbital periods). We conclude
that the Coriolis force does not prevent a flow from the heated regions of the
secondary towards the $L_1$ region, at least during the initial phase of an
outburst, but the resulting increase of the mass transfer rate is moderate, and
it is unlikely to be able to account for the duration of long outbursts.

made of the usual Friedmann-Robertson-Walker solution and the holes are
constructed from a Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi solution of Einstein's equations. The
observables on which we focus are the changes in the redshift, in the
angular-diameter--distance relation, in the luminosity-distance--redshift
relation, and in the corresponding distance modulus. We find that redshift
effects are suppressed when the hole is small because of a compensation effect
acting on the scale of half a hole resulting from the special case of spherical
symmetry. However, we find interesting effects in the calculation of the
angular distance: strong evolution of the inhomogeneities (as in the approach
to caustic formation) causes the photon path to deviate from that of the FRW
case. Therefore, the inhomogeneities are able to partly mimic the effects of a
dark-energy component. Our results also suggest that the nonlinear effects of
caustic formation in cold dark matter models may lead to interesting effects on
photon trajectories.

collapse with dynamics represented by a stochastic differential equation driven
by general Gaussian noises, not necessarily white in time. In particular, we
show that the non-Schrodinger terms of the equation induce the collapse of the
wave function to one of the common eigenstates of the collapsing operators, and
that the collapse occurs with the correct quantum probabilities. We also
develop a perturbation expansion of the solution of the equation with respect
to the parameter which sets the strength of the collapse process; such an
approximation allows one to compute the leading order terms for the deviations
of the predictions of collapse models with respect to those of standard quantum
mechanics. This analysis shows that to leading order, the ``imaginary'' noise
trick can be used for non-white Gaussian noise.

improved eikonal mini-jet model, where soft gluon radiation tames the fast

our predictions and provide a handy parametrization of our results for the LHC.
We find that our model predictions span the range $\sigma_{tot}^{LHC}=100
^{+10}_{-13} mb$. While this matches nicely with the range of most other
models, it does not agree with recent ones which include a ""hard"" Pomeron, even
though our model does include hard scattering. We compute the survival
probability for Large Rapidity Gap (LRG) events at the LHC and at the Tevatron.
These events are relevant, for example, for Higgs signal in the $WW$ fusion
process. We also explore whether measurements of the total cross-sections at
the LHC can help us sharpen the model parameters and hence estimates for these
survival probabilities, further.

applied to nucleus-nucleus scattering, boundary conditions for the classical
field equations are discussed. Correspondence with the QCD diagrams at the
boundary rapidities requires pomeron interaction with the participating nuclei
to be exponential and non-local. Commonly used 'eikonal' boundary conditions,
local and linear in fields, follow in the limit of small QCD pomeron-nucleon
coupling. Numerical solution of the classical field equations, which sum all
tree diagrams for central gold-gold scattering, demonstrates that corrected
boundary conditions lead to substantially different results, as compared to the
eikonal conditions studied in earlier publications. A breakdown of
projectile-target symmetry for particular solutions discovered earlier in
  \cite{bom} is found to occur at roughly twice lower rapidity. Most important,
due to a high non-linearity of the problem, the found asymmetric solutions are
not unique but form a family growing in number with rapidity. The minimal value
for the action turns out to be much lower than with the eikonal boundary
conditions and saturates at rapidities around 10.
