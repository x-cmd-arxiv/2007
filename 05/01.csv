consequence of maximal phase correlation of the sources mediated by

the character of a strong version of the van der Waals force, whose superior
strength can be attributed to relatively coherent primary fields (compared with
the totally incoherent effects of the ZPF). The model also predicts the
existence of a background having some of the character of dark energy.

in which the source signal arrives at the destination through N independent
relaying hops in series. The main concern of this work is to design relaying
strategies that utilize efficiently the relays in such a way that the diversity
is maximized. In part I, we focus on the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy with
which the relays simply scale the received signal and retransmit it. More
specifically, we characterize the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the
AF scheme in a general multihop channel with arbitrary number of antennas and
arbitrary number of hops. The DMT is in closed-form expression as a function of
the number of antennas at each node. First, we provide some basic results on
the DMT of the general Rayleigh product channels. It turns out that these
results have very simple and intuitive interpretation. Then, the results are
applied to the AF multihop channels which is shown to be equivalent to the
Rayleigh product channel, in the DMT sense. Finally, the project-and-forward
(PF) scheme, a variant of the AF scheme, is proposed. We show that the PF
scheme has the same DMT as the AF scheme, while the PF can have significant
power gain over the AF scheme in some cases. In part II, we will derive the
upper bound on the diversity of the multihop channels and show that it can be
achieved by partitioning the multihop channel into AF subchannels.

Angstrom were observed for U/Fe and U/Co samples, consistent with a picture of
interdiffused interfaces. A large reduction in the magnetic moment, constant
over a wide range of Gd layer thicknesses, was found for the U/Gd system (about
4 Bohr magnetons compared with 7.63 for the bulk metal). This could be
understood on the basis of a pinning of Gd moments arising from a column-like
growth mechanism of the Gd layers. A study of the effective anisotropy suggests
that perpendicular magnetic anisotropy could occur in multilayers consisting of
thick U and thin Gd layers. A reduction in the Curie temperature was observed
as a function of Gd layer thickness, consistent with a finite-size scaling
behaviour.

joint action of the Hanle and Zeeman effects offers a unique opportunity to
obtain empirical information about hidden aspects of solar and stellar
magnetism. To this end, it is important to achieve a complete understanding of
the sensitivity of the emergent spectral line polarization to the presence of a
magnetic field. Here we present a detailed theoretical investigation on the
role of resonance scattering and magnetic fields on the polarization signals of
the Ba II D1 and D2 lines of the Fraunhofer spectrum, respectively at 4934 \AA\
and 4554 \AA. We adopt a three-level model of Ba II, and we take into account
the hyperfine structure that is shown by the $^{135}$Ba and $^{137}$Ba
isotopes. Despite of their relatively small abundance (18%), the contribution
coming from these two isotopes is indeed fundamental for the interpretation of
the polarization signals observed in these lines. We consider an optically thin
slab model, through which we can investigate in a rigorous way the essential
physical mechanisms involved (resonance polarization, Zeeman, Paschen-Back and
Hanle effects), avoiding complications due to radiative transfer effects. We
assume the slab to be illuminated from below by the photospheric solar
continuum radiation field, and we investigate the radiation scattered at 90
degrees, both in the absence and in the presence of magnetic fields,
deterministic and microturbulent. We show in particular the existence of a
differential magnetic sensitivity of the three-peak Q/I profile that is
observed in the D2 line in quiet regions close to the solar limb, which is of
great interest for magnetic field diagnostics.

basic equations for dynamical diffraction from volume diffractive optics, which
enable us to study the focusing property of these optics with various grating
profiles. We study volume diffractive optics that satisfy the Bragg condition
to various degrees, namely flat, tilted and wedged geometries, and derive the
curved geometries required for ultimate focusing. We show that the curved
geometries satisfy the Bragg condition everywhere and phase requirement for
point focusing, and effectively focus hard x-rays to a scale close to the
wavelength.

points of this flow having conformally invariant boundary conditions. Simple
running solutions include the paper-clip and the hair-pin (or grim-reaper)

closed curves and the decay of two intersecting lines. Stability analysis is
performed in several cases while searching for transitions among different
brane configurations. The combination of Ricci with the mean curvature flow is
examined in detail together with several explicit examples of deforming curves
on curved backgrounds. Some general aspects of the mean curvature flow in
higher dimensional ambient spaces are also discussed and obtain consistent

structures (a new notion; D. Pauksztello has independently introduced them as
co-t-structures). This axiomatizes the properties of stupid truncations of
complexes in $K(B)$. We also construct weight structures for Voevodsky's
categories of motives and for various categories of spectra. A weight structure
$w$ defines Postnikov towers of objects; these towers are canonical and
functorial 'up to morphisms that are zero on cohomology'. For $Hw$ being the
heart of $w$ (in $DM_{gm}$ we have $Hw=Chow$) we define a canonical
conservative 'weakly exact' functor $t$ from our $C$ to a certain weak category
of complexes $K_w(Hw)$. For any (co)homological functor $H:C\to A$ for an
abelian $A$ we construct a weight spectral sequence $T:H(X^i[j])\implies
H(X[i+j])$ where $(X^i)=t(X)$; it is canonical and functorial starting from
$E_2$. This spectral sequences specializes to the 'usual' (Deligne's) weight
spectral sequences for 'classical' realizations of motives and to
Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences for spectra. Under certain restrictions,
we prove that $K_0(C)\cong K_0(Hw)$ and $K_0(End C)\cong K_0(End Hw)$.
  The definition of a weight structure is almost dual to those of a
t-structure; yet several properties differ. One can often construct a certain
$t$-structure which is 'adjacent' to $w$ and vice versa. This is the case for
the Voevodsky's $DM^{eff}_-$ (one obtains certain new Chow weight and
t-structures for it; the heart of the latter is 'dual' to $Chow^{eff}$) and for
the stable homotopy category. The Chow t-structure is closely related to
unramified cohomology.

145 K are studied, as well as binary and tertiary mixtures containing H2O, CO,
CO2 and CH3OH. The mixture concentrations are varied from 50:50% to ~10:90% for
HCOOH:H2O. Binary mixtures of HCOOH:X and tertiary mixtures of HCOOH:H2O:X with
X = CO, CO2, and CH3OH, are studied for concentrations of ~10:90% and
~7:67:26%, respectively. Results: Pure HCOOH ice spectra show broad bands which
split around 120 K due to the conversion of a dimer to a chain-structure. Broad
single component bands are found for mixtures with H2O. Additional spectral
components are present in mixtures with CO, CO2 and CH3OH. The resulting peak
position, full width at half maximum and band strength depend strongly on ice
structure, temperature, matrix constituents and the HCOOH concentration.
Comparison of the solid HCOOH 5.9, 7.2, and 8.1 micron features with
astronomical data toward the low mass source HH 46 and high mass source W 33A
shows that spectra of binary mixtures do not reproduce the observed ice
features. However, our tertiary mixtures especially with CH3OH match the
astronomical data very well. Thus interstellar HCOOH is most likely present in
tertiary or more complex mixtures with H2O, CH3OH and potentially also CO or
CO2, providing constraints on its formation.

from the planet's atmosphere are Doppler shifted by of order the planet's
rotational velocity (~1-2 km/s) relative to where they would be if the planet
were not rotating. We focus in particular on the case of HD209458b, which ought
to be at least as good a target as any other known transiting planet. For
HD209458b, this shift should give rise to a small net centroid shift of ~60
cm/s on the stellar absorption lines. Using a detailed model of the
transmission spectrum due to a rotating star transited by a rotating planet
with an isothermal atmosphere, we simulate the effect of the planet's rotation
on the shape of the spectral lines, and in particular on the magnitude of their
width and centroid shift. We then use this simulation to determine the expected
signal-to-noise ratio for distinguishing a rotating from a non-rotating planet,
and assess how this S/N scales with various parameters of HD209458b. We find
that with a 6 m telescope, an equatorial rotational velocity of ~2 km/s could
be detected with a S/N~5 by accumulating the signal over many transits over the
course of several years. With a 30 m telescope, the time required to make such
a detection reduces to less than 2 months.

TeV J2032+4130 with \textit{XMM-Newton} has been obtained. The contribution of
point sources to the observed X-ray emission from TeV J2032+4130 is subtracted

function constructed in this way has the unique capability to probe the mass

density, nevertheless may place important constraints on the mass distribution

points are restricted to lie on a line. For genus 0, the Janus solution with 16
supersymmetries and 6 real parameters is recovered; its topology coincides with
that of $AdS_5 \times S^5$. The genus $g\geq 1$ solutions are parametrized by a
total of $4g+6$ real numbers, $2g-1$ of which are the real moduli of $\Sigma$.
The solutions have $2g+2$ asymptotic $AdS_5 \times S^5$ regions, $g$
three-spheres with RR 3-form charge, and another $g$ with NSNS 3-form charge.
Collapse of consecutive branch points of $\Sigma $ yields singularities which
correspond to D5 and NS5 branes in the probe limit. It is argued that the
AdS/CFT dual gauge theory to each of our solutions consists of a
2+1-dimensional planar interface on which terminate $2g+2$ half-Minkowski
3+1-dimensional space-time $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theories.
Generally, the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ theory in each Minkowski half-space-time may
have an independent value of the gauge coupling, and the interface may support
various operators, whose interface couplings are further free parameters of the
dual gauge theory.

Recently, there has been growing evidence that a peculiar type of supernovae,
called hypernovae, are associated with sub-energetic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs),
such as SN1998bw/GRB980425 and SN2003lw/GRB031203. Such hypernovae appear to
have high (up to mildly relativistic) velocity ejecta, which may be linked to
the sub-energetic GRBs. Assuming a continuous distribution of the kinetic
energy of the hypernova ejecta as a function of its velocity $E_k\propto
(\Gamma\beta)^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha\sim 2$, we find that 1) the external
shock wave produced by the high velocity ejecta of a hypernova can accelerate
protons up to energies as high as $10^{19} {\rm eV}$; 2) the cosmological
hypernova rate is sufficient to account for the energy flux above the second
knee; and 3) the steeper spectrum of CRs at these energies can arise in these
sources. In addition, hypernovae would also give rise to a faint diffuse UHE
neutrino flux, due to $p\gamma$ interactions of the UHE CRs with hypernova
optical-UV photons.

very well with the experimental estimate of $\sim0.15$ eV. Further, a brief

coordinate where there is no coordinate singularity at the event horizon. We
use two types of the causal viscosity prescription, and the boundary conditions
for the transonic accretion flows are given at the sonic point. For one type of
the causal viscosity prescription we also add the boundary conditions at the
viscous point where the accreting radial velocity is nearly equal to the
viscous diffusion velocity. Based on the formalism for the transonic accretion
disks, after we present the calculation method of the transonic solutions, the
horizon-penetrating transonic solutions which smoothly pass the event horizon
are calculated for several types of the accretion flow models: the ideal
isothermal flows, the ideal and the viscous polytropic flows, the advection
dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) with the relativistic equation of state, the
adiabatic accretion disks, the standard accretion disks, the supercritical
accretion disks. These solutions are obtained for both non-rotating and
rotating black holes. The calculated accretion flows plunge into black hole
with finite three velocity smaller than the speed of light even at the event
horizon or inside the horizon, and the angular velocities of the accretion flow
at the horizon are generally different from the angular velocity of the
frame-dragging due to the black hole's rotation. These features contrast to the
results obtained by using the Boyer-Lindquist coordinate with the coordinate

detailed view of the aftermath of a core-collapse explosion. The supernova
ejecta initially coasted outward at more than 10% of the speed of light, but in
1990 were observed to decelerate rapidly as they began to encounter dense
circumstellar material expelled by the progenitor star. The resulting shock has
subsequently produced steadily brightening radio synchrotron emission, which is
resolved by the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) into an expanding
limb-brightened shell. Here we present 15 years of ATCA imaging of Supernova
1987A, at an effective angular resolution of 0.4 arcsec. We find that the radio
remnant has accelerated in its expansion over this period, from approx 3600
km/s in 1992 to approx 5200 km/s at the end of 2006. The published diameters of
the evolving X-ray shell have been ~15% smaller than the corresponding radio
values, but a simultaneous Fourier analysis of both radio and X-ray data
eliminates this discrepancy, and yields a current diameter for the shell in
both wave-bands of approx 1.7 arcsec. An asymmetric brightness distribution is
seen in radio images at all ATCA epochs: the eastern and western rims have
higher fluxes than the northern and southern regions, indicating that most of
the radio emission comes from the equatorial plane of the system, where the
progenitor star's circumstellar wind is thought to be densest. The eastern lobe
is brighter than and further from the supernova site than the western lobe,
suggesting an additional asymmetry in the initial distribution of supernova
ejecta.

demonstrated that the exact Floquet states appear when the external

The balance region of parameters is divided into a phase-continuing region and
a phase-jumping one. In the latter region, the Floquet states are
spatiotemporal vortices of nontrivial phase structures and zero-density cores.
Due to the velocity singularities of vortex cores and the blowing-up of
perturbed solutions, the spatiotemporal vortices are unstable periodic states
embedded in chaos. The stability and instability of these Floquet states are
numerically explored by the time evolution of fidelity between the exact and
numerical solutions. It is numerically illustrated that the stable Floquet
states could be prepared from the uniformly initial states by slow growth of
the external potential.

Procedures were devised to measure trace potassium concentrations in the
inorganic salt CsI as well as in organic liquid scintillator (LS) with
Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS), giving, respectively, the
$\k40$-contamination levels of $\sim 10^{-10}$ and $\sim 10^{-13}$ g/g.
Measurement flexibilities and sensitivities are improved over conventional

had been observed over background are $8 \times 10^{-13}$ g/g and $3 \times

combined with observations on the baryonic mass density of the Universe and
constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis to set boundary conditions on the
Intergalactic Medium (IGM) at the epoch of z=2.5. The Universe is considered a
closed system and allowed to expand adiabatically from the epoch when QSOs
first ionized the IGM (5 <= z_on <= 20). The average kinetic energy of a gas is
calculated in the region where the gas transitions from relativistic to
non-relativistic behavior. All of the above measurements are then used to
determine the thermal history of the IGM in the redshift range 2.5 <= z <=
z_on. The hot IGM is assumed to inverse Compton scatter photons from the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMBR) and consequently distort the CMBR as seen at the
present epoch. The temperature of the IGM at z=2.5 and the epoch z_on are
adjusted, within the constraints defined above, to give the best overall
agreement with published data on the temperature of the IGM. We find that the
model of the IGM proposed here does not grossly distort the CMBR, and in fact
agrees quite closely with the preliminary results from the Cosmic Background
Explorer (COBE) satellite. However, our model of the IGM cannot explain the

the only decay mechanism is collapse. The stability of a bright solitary wave

perturber moving on a circular orbit in a uniform gaseous medium using a
semi-analytic method. This work is a straightforward extension of Ostriker
(1999) who studied the case of a straight-line trajectory. The circular orbit
causes the bending of the wake in the background medium along the orbit,
forming a long trailing tail. The wake distribution is thus asymmetric, giving
rise to the drag forces in both opposite (azimuthal) and lateral (radial)
directions to the motion of the perturber, although the latter does not
contribute to orbital decay much. For subsonic motion, the density wake with a
weak tail is simply a curved version of that in Ostriker and does not exhibit
the front-back symmetry. The resulting drag force in the opposite direction is
remarkably similar to the finite-time, linear-trajectory counterpart. On the
other hand, a supersonic perturber is able to overtake its own wake, possibly
multiple times, and develops a very pronounced tail. The supersonic tail
surrounds the perturber in a trailing spiral fashion, enhancing the perturbed
density at the back as well as far front of the perturber. We provide the
fitting formulae for the drag forces as functions of the Mach number, whose
azimuthal part is surprisingly in good agreement with the Ostriker's formula,
provided Vp t=2 Rp, where Vp and Rp are the velocity and orbital radius of the
perturber, respectively.

Rev. E 76, 021405 (2007)","10.1103/PhysRevE.76.021405",,"cond-mat.soft",,"  The relaxation dynamics of a model fluid of platelike colloidal particles is
investigated by means of a phenomenological dynamic density functional theory.
The model fluid approximates the particles within the Zwanzig model of
restricted orientations. The driving force for time-dependence is expressed
completely by gradients of the local chemical potential which in turn is
derived from a density functional -- hydrodynamic interactions are not taken
into account. These approximations are expected to lead to qualitatively
reliable results for low densities as those within the isotropic-nematic
two-phase region. The formalism is applied to model an initially spatially
homogeneous stable or metastable isotropic fluid which is perturbed by
switching a two-dimensional array of Gaussian laser beams. Switching on the
laser beams leads to an accumulation of colloidal particles in the beam
centers. If the initial chemical potential and the laser power are large enough
a preferred orientation of particles occurs breaking the symmetry of the laser
potential. After switching off the laser beams again the system can follow
different relaxation paths: It either relaxes back to the homogeneous isotropic
state or it forms an approximately elliptical high-density core which is
elongated perpendicular to the dominating orientation in order to minimize the
surface free energy. For large supersaturations of the initial isotropic fluid
the high-density cores of neighboring laser beams of the two-dimensional array
merge into complex superstructures.

should be noted, however, that in models with more than one sterile neutrino
the MiniBooNE results are in perfect agreement with the LSND appearance
evidence, thanks to the possibility of CP violation available in such

themselves in Galactic nuclei. This thesis uses single-dish and interferometric
radio continuum, radio recombination line, polarized radio continuum, and
mid-IR observations to study the wide variety of physical processes seen in the

provide one of the most sensitive studies of the radio continuum emission in

satisfied by several types of orthogonal and biorthogonal polynomials. The
relevance of formulae obtained to the study of the large degree asymptotics for
these polynomials is indicated.

resistance in compressively strained (Ga0.95, Mn0.05)As epilayers were measured
for the first time down to temperatures as low as 30 mK. Below temperatures of
3K the conductivity decreases ~ T^1/3 over two orders of magnitude in
temperature. The conductivity can be well described within the framework of a
3D scaling theory of Anderson's transition in the presence of spin scattering
in semiconductors. It is shown that the samples are on the metallic side but
very close to the metal-insulator transition (MIT). At lowest temperatures a
decrease in the AMR effect is observed, which is assigned to changes in the
coupling between the remaining itinerant carriers and the local Mn 5/2-spin
moments.

by a low noise two-stage SQUID amplifier and operated at a temperature of 5 K.
We characterized the detector performance in terms of thermal and electrical
noise in the system output sygnal. We measured a peak strain sensitivity of
$1.5\cdot 10^{-20} Hz^{-1/2}$ at 2942.9 Hz. A strain sensitivity of better than
$5\cdot 10{-20}Hz{-1/2}$ has been obtained over a bandwidth of 30 Hz. We expect
an improvement of more than one order of magnitude when the detector will
operate at 50 mK. Our results represent the first step towards the development
of an ultracryogenic omnidirectional detector sensitive to gravitational
radiation in the 3kHz range.

  Information Theory",,"10.1109/ISIT.2007.4557387",,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  In this paper, the bit energy requirements of training-based transmission
over block Rayleigh fading channels are studied. Pilot signals are employed to
obtain the minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) estimate of the channel fading
coefficients. Energy efficiency is analyzed in the worst case scenario where
the channel estimate is assumed to be perfect and the error in the estimate is
considered as another source of additive Gaussian noise. It is shown that bit
energy requirement grows without bound as the snr goes to zero, and the minimum
bit energy is achieved at a nonzero snr value below which one should not
operate. The effect of the block length on both the minimum bit energy and the
snr value at which the minimum is achieved is investigated. Flash training
schemes are analyzed and shown to improve the energy efficiency in the low-snr
regime. Energy efficiency analysis is also carried out when peak power
constraints are imposed on pilot signals.

Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fading channels is analyzed when hard-decision
detection is employed at the receiver. Closed-form expressions for the first

spectral-efficiency/bit-energy tradeoff in the low-snr regime is analyzed by
finding the wideband slope and the bit energy required at zero spectral
efficiency. Practical design guidelines are drawn from the
information-theoretic analysis. The fading channel analysis is conducted for
both coherent and noncoherent cases, and the performance penalty in the
low-power regime for not knowing the channel is identified.

transiting the bright (V = 8.7) F8 star HD 147506, with an orbital period of
5.63341+/-0.00013 days and an eccentricity of e = 0.520+/-0.010. From the
transit light curve we determine that the radius of the planet is Rp =
0.982^{+0.038}_{0.105}RJup. HD 147506b (also coined HAT-P-2b) has a mass about
9 times the average mass of previously-known transiting exoplanets, and a
density of rho = 11.9 g cm-3, greater than that of rocky planets like the
Earth. Its mass and radius are marginally consistent with theories of structure
of massive giant planets composed of pure H and He, and may require a large
(~100 Earth mass) core to account for. The high eccentricity causes a 9-fold
variation of insolation of the planet between peri- and apastron. Using
follow-up photometry, we find that the center of transit is Tmid =
2,454,212.8559 +/- 0.0007 (HJD), and the transit duration is 0.177 +/-0.002 d.
