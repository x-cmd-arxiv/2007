a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for
24um-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z=2 was larger by a factor
of ~4 and ~30 relative to that in star forming galaxies at z=1 and z=0,
respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z=2 are
relatively 'transparent' to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived
(~400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high redshift
submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation
in massive galaxies at z=2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers
are not the dominant trigger for this activity.Current galaxy formation models
underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of
4, and the space density of ULIRGs by an orderof magnitude, but give better
agreement for z>1.4 quiescent galaxies.

obscured AGNs predicted by synthesis models of the X-ray background. The

function due to wave breaking and found that it depends very sharply on the
parameter of nonlinearity (the surface steepness). The onset of white-capping
can be compared to a second-order phase transition. This result corroborates

moisture content for the constant equilibrium flux, which is the product of the
two. However where an isolated zone of fixed saturation degree exists
representing a boundary condition, the flow speed immediately upslope is

(product of signaling duration and bandwidth). Sparsity is captured by the
number of resolvable paths in delay and Doppler. Our analysis is based on a
training and communication scheme that employs signaling over orthogonal
short-time Fourier (STF) basis functions. STF signaling naturally relates
sparsity in delay-Doppler to coherence in time-frequency. We study the impact
of multipath sparsity on two fundamental metrics of spectral efficiency in the
wideband/low-SNR limit introduced by Verdu: first- and second-order optimality
conditions. Recent results by Zheng et. al. have underscored the large gap in
spectral efficiency between coherent and non-coherent extremes and the
importance of channel learning in bridging the gap. Building on these results,
our results lead to the following implications of multipath sparsity: 1) The
coherence requirements are shared in both time and frequency, thereby
significantly relaxing the required scaling in coherence time with SNR; 2)
Sparse multipath channels are asymptotically coherent -- for a given but large
bandwidth, the channel can be learned perfectly and the coherence requirements
for first- and second-order optimality met through sufficiently large signaling
duration; and 3) The requirement of peaky signals in attaining capacity is
eliminated or relaxed in sparse environments.

  the Wideband Regime","in the proceedings of the 2nd Information Theory and Applications
  (ITA) Workshop, San Diego, Jan. 2007",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  In contrast to the prevalent assumption of rich multipath in information
theoretic analysis of wireless channels, physical channels exhibit sparse
multipath, especially at large bandwidths. We propose a model for sparse
multipath fading channels and present results on the impact of sparsity on
non-coherent capacity and reliability in the wideband regime. A key implication
of sparsity is that the statistically independent degrees of freedom in the
channel, that represent the delay-Doppler diversity afforded by multipath,
scale at a sub-linear rate with the signal space dimension (time-bandwidth
product). Our analysis is based on a training-based communication scheme that
uses short-time Fourier (STF) signaling waveforms. Sparsity in delay-Doppler
manifests itself as time-frequency coherence in the STF domain. From a capacity
perspective, sparse channels are asymptotically coherent: the gap between
coherent and non-coherent extremes vanishes in the limit of large signal space
dimension without the need for peaky signaling. From a reliability viewpoint,
there is a fundamental tradeoff between channel diversity and learnability that
can be optimized to maximize the error exponent at any rate by appropriately
choosing the signaling duration as a function of bandwidth.

choose the path over which it traverses the random field (e.g., noisy image or
video sequence), thus it is natural to ask what is the best achievable
performance and how sensitive this performance is to the choice of the scan. We
formally define the problem of scanning and filtering, derive a bound on the
best achievable performance and quantify the excess loss occurring when
non-optimal scanners are used, compared to optimal scanning and filtering.
  We then discuss the problem of sequential scanning and prediction of noisy
random fields. This setting is a natural model for applications such as
restoration and coding of noisy images. We formally define the problem of
scanning and prediction of a noisy multidimensional array and relate the
optimal performance to the clean scandictability defined by Merhav and
Weissman. Moreover, bounds on the excess loss due to sub-optimal scans are
derived, and a universal prediction algorithm is suggested.

However, so far only a handful of Compton thick AGNs have been possibly
detected using even the deepest Chandra and XMM surveys. Compton-thick AGNs can
be recovered thanks to the reprocessing of the AGN UV emission in the infrared
by selecting sources with AGN luminosity's in the mid-infrared and faint
near-infrared and optical emission. To this purpose, we make use of deep HST,
VLT, Spitzer and Chandra data on the Chandra Deep Field South to constrain the
number of Compton thick AGN in this field. We show that sources with high
24$\mu$m to optical flux ratios and red colors form a distinct source
population, and that their infrared luminosity is dominated by AGN emission.

The number of infrared selected, Compton thick AGNs with 5.8$\mu$m luminosity

wires. The existence of an azimuthally nonsymmetric guided wave at low
frequencies in a bundle of a large number of finite-length CNTs stands in
contrast to the characteristics of guided-wave propagation in a single CNT. The
equivalent-multishell approach yields the polarizability scalar and the antenna
efficiency of a bundle of finite-length CNTs in the long-wavelength regime over
a wide frequency range spanning the terahertz and the near-infrared regimes.
Edge effects give rise to geometric resonances in such bundles.

  PIRT Publications",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, it is shown that the cosmological model that was introduced in
a sequence of three earlier papers under the title, A Dust Universe Solution to
the Dark Energy Problem can be used to analyse and solve the Cosmological
Coincidence Problem. The generic coincidence problem that appears in the
original Einstein universe model is shown to arise from a misunderstanding
about the magnitude of dark energy density and the epoch time governing the
appearance of the integer relation between dark energy and normal energy
density. The solution to the generic case then clearly points to the source of
the time coincidence integer problem in the Friedman dust universe model. It is
then possible to eliminate this coincidence by removing a degeneracy between
different measurement epoch times. In this paper's first appendix, a
fundamental time dependent relation between dark mass and dark energy is
derived with suggestions how this relation could explain cosmological voids and
the clumping of dark mass to become visible matter. In this paper's second
appendix, it is shown that that dark energy is a conserved with time substance
that is everywhere and for all time permeable to the dark mass and visible mass
of which the contracting or expanding universe is composed. The last two
appendices involve detailed studies of cosmology, quantum dark energy related
issues. There are more detailed abstracts given with all four appendices.

correlated random variables. This extension allows (just as the original
Stollmann's lemma does) to obtain Wegner-type estimates even in some problems
of spectral analysis of random operators where the Wegner's lemma is
inapplicable (e.g. for multi-particle Hamiltonians).

physical parameters of previously rarely or un-studied open star clusters with
good quality CMDs using Near-IR JHK photometry. Here we present a morphological
analysis of the 2MASS database (the digital Two Micron All Sky Survey) for the
open cluster Pismis 3. Some of the physical parameters are estimated for the
first time, and some others, re-determined.
