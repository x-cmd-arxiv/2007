"0705.0368","Lifan Wang","Lifan Wang","Cosmic Streaming Field at Low Redshift","ApJ, submitted (Figures reformated to fit the pages, a new table is
  added)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We study the expansion of the nearby Universe using a sample of Type Ia
supernovae at redshifts below 0.08. These supernovae allow peculiar velocities
to be measured at unprecedented precision. We have investigated in detail the
possibility of a varying Hubble constant with redshift and found no evidence of
a monopole term for the nearby Universe. A large scale streaming motion is
found at an amplitude of about $340^{63}_{-71}$ km/sec, aligned in the
direction of $(l_0, b_0) = (312^{\rm o}.0^{13.5}_{-7.4}, 25^{\rm
o}.7^{8.0}_{-9.2})$, which is close to the direction of the center of Shapley
supercluster of galaxies. The large scale streaming motion is best fit by a
function involving a strong bipolar term. The streaming velocity field extends
from the lowest redshift ($\sim 0.007$) to beyond 0.025 and likely out to even
higher redshifts. The velocity field at redshift below 0.01 can be equally well
described by a dipole field or by the same bipolar streaming velocity field
that reaches out to beyond $z \sim 0.025$. We are also able to deduce a robust
estimate of the random velocity component of the peculiar velocity field.
Within the volume of redshift below 0.01 (weighted average redshift of $\sim$
0.067), this thermal component is found to be about 270 km/sec. After
correcting this smooth streaming motion, we are able to significantly improve
the Hubble expansion fits of these supernovae. The CMAGIC method gives a
dramatic decrease of $\chi^2$ from 90 to 63 for 69 degrees of freedom, and
yields a residual scatter of only 0.12 magnitude; the maximum light method
gives also a moderate improvement.

analysis of photoemission and diffusion voltage experiments, which locate the
Fermi level of manganites above the bottom of the upper Hubbard band of some
cuprate parent compounds. A diagram with the relative location of Fermi levels
and gaps for several oxides is presented. The procedure discussed here is
generic, allowing for the qualitative prediction of the charge flow direction
at several oxide interfaces. The addition of electrons to antiferromagnetic Cu
oxides may lead to a superconducting state at the interface with minimal
quenched disorder. Model calculations using static and dynamical mean-field
theory, supplemented by a Poisson equation formalism to address charge
redistribution at the interface, support this view. The magnetic state of the
manganites could be antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic. The former is better to
induce superconductivity than the latter, since the spin-polarized charge
transfer will be detrimental to singlet superconductivity. It is concluded that
in spite of the robust Hubbard gaps, the electron doping of undoped cuprates at

research in oxide heterostructures.

plant root activity in the soil profile. Its measurement is difficult in field

quantify soil bulk density with possible field applications in the future. The
AC electrical conductivity of soil was measured using a pair of blade-like
electrodes while exposing the soil to periodic vibration. The blades were
positioned longitudinally and transversally to the direction of the induced
vibration to enable the calculation of a normalized index. The normalized index
was expected to provide data independent from the vibration strength and to
reduce the effect of soil salinity and water content. The experiment was
conducted on natural and salinized fine sand at two moisture conditions and
four bulk densities. The blade-shaped electrodes improved electrode-soil
contact compared to cylindrical electrodes, and thereby, reduced measurement
noise. Simulations on a simplified resistor lattice indicate that the
transversal effect increases as soil bulk density decreases. Measurement of dry
sand showed a negative correlation between the normalized conductivity
fluctuation and soil bulk density for both longitudinal and transversal
settings. The decrease in the transversal signal was smaller than expected. The
wet natural and salinized soils performed very similarly as hypothesized, but
their normalized VICOF response was not significant to bulk density changes.

is the relative timing of the reionization history of a region and its halo

region, the properties and radial distribution of its stellar halo, globular
cluster population and its satellite galaxies. We distinguish two basic cases
for the reionization of a halo - internal reionization, whereby the stars
forming in situ reionize their host galaxy, and external reionization, whereby
the progenitor of a galaxy is reionized by external radiation before its own
stars are able to form in sufficient numbers. We use a set of large-scale
radiative transfer and structure formation simulations, based on cosmologies
derived from both WMAP 1-year and WMAP 3-year data, to evaluate the mean
reionization redshifts and the probability of internal/external reionization
for Local Group-like systems, galaxies in the field and central cD galaxies in
clusters. We find that these probabilities are strongly dependent on the
underlying cosmology and the efficiency of photon production, but also on the
halo mass. There is a rapid transition between predominantly external and
predominantly internal reionization at a mass scale of 1.0e12 Msun
(corresponding roughly to L*galaxies), with haloes less massive than this being
reionized preferentially from distant sources. We provide a fit for the
reionization redshift as a function of halo mass, which could be helpful to
parameterize reionization in semi-analytical models of galaxy formation on
cosmological scales. We find no statistical correlation between the

the EVLA and ALMA should be able to detect massive protostellar disks and
measure their rotation curves, at least in the nearest massive star-forming

in the disks, and in some cases may be able to detect star-disk velocity
offsets of a few km s^-1, both of which are the result of strong gravitational
instability in massive disks. We use our simulations to explore the strengths
and weaknesses of different observational techniques, and we also discuss how
observations of massive protostellar disks may be used to distinguish between

consistent with those of non-BAL quasars of comparable luminosity. In
particular, the optical-to-mid-infrared luminosity ratios of the two
populations are indistinguishable. We also measure or place upper limits on the
contribution of star formation to the far-infrared power. Of 22 (57%) upper
limits, seven quasars have sufficiently sensitive constraints to conclude that
star formation likely contributes little (<20%) to their far-infrared power.
The 17 BAL quasars (45%) with detected excess far-infrared emission likely host
hyperluminous starbursts with L_fir,SF=10^{13-14} L_sun. Mid-infrared through
X-ray composite BAL quasar SEDs are presented, incorporating all of the
available photometry. Overall, we find no compelling evidence for inherent
differences between the SEDs of BAL vs. non-BAL quasars of comparable

whereby the wind covers a large fraction of the sky is not supported by the

to study the influence of the He/H abundance ratio on the emergent radiation of

temperatures, surface gravities and bolometric absolute magnitudes of He-weak

based on several different methods. The mean discrepancy between the visual
absolute magnitudes derived using the Hipparcos parallaxes and the BCD values
is on average 0.3 mag for He-weak stars, while it is 0.5 mag for He-strong
stars. For He-strong stars, we note that the BCD calibration, based on stars in
the solar environment, leads to overestimated values of Teff. By means of model
atmosphere calculations with enhanced He/H abundance ratios we show that larger
He/H ratios produce smaller BD which naturally explains the Teff
overestimation. We take advantage of these calculations to introduce a method

Paper III will extend the current FK formalism to a higher order. Use of the FK
equation of state is limited to physical conditions for which more than 90% of

the solar radius. Despite this limitation, in the parts of the Sun where it is

equations of state currently used in solar modeling. The FK approach is
especially suited to study physical effects such as Coulomb screening, bound
states, the onset of recombination of fully ionized species, as well as
diffraction and exchange effects. The localizing power of helioseismology
allows a test of the FK equation of state. Such a test will be beneficial both

random graph chosen from a given ensemble of networks, (c) FZRP on a dynamical
network whose topology continuously changes during the process in a way which
depends on the current distribution of particles. The case (a) provides a very
simple realization of the phenomenon of condensation which manifests as the
appearance of a condensate of particles on the node with maximal degree. The
case (b) is very interesting since the averaging over typical ensembles of

identical from the point of view of the FZRP. In the case (c), the distribution

strength of this coupling depends on the ratio of two time scales: for changes
of the topology and of the FZRP. We will discuss a specific example of that

has been developed. Using this simulator, the performance of carbon nanoribbon
(CNR) MOSFETs is examined in the ballistic limit. The impact of quantum effects
on device performance of CNR MOSFETs is also studied. We found that 2D
semi-infinite graphene contacts provide metal-induced-gap-states (MIGS) in the
CNR channel. These states would provide quantum tunneling in the short channel
device and cause Fermi level pining. These effects cause device performance
degradation both on the ON-state and the OFF-state. Pure 1D devices (infinite
contacts), however, show no MIGS. Quantum tunneling effects are still playing
an important role in the device characteristics. Conduction due to band-to-band
tunneling is accurately captured in our simulations. It is important in these
devices, and found to dominate the off-state current. Based on our simulations,
both a 1.4nm wide and a 1.8nm wide CNR with channel length of 12.5nm can
outperform ultra scaled Si devices in terms of drive current capabilities and
electrostatic control. Although subthreshold slopes in the forward-bias
conduction are better than in Si transistors, tunneling currents are important
and prevent the achievement of the theoretical limit of 60mV/dec.

evolution and gravitational collapse of isothermal molecular cloud cores. A
compressive wave is set up in a constant sub-Jeans density distribution of
radius r = 1 pc. As the wave travels through the simulation grid, a
shock-bounded spherical shell is formed. The inner shock of this shell reaches
and bounces off the center, leaving behind a central core with an initially
almost uniform density distribution, surrounded by an envelope consisting of
the material in the shock-bounded shell, with a power-law density profile that
at late times approaches a logarithmic slope of -2 even in non-collapsing
cases. The resulting density structure resembles a quiescent core of radius <
0.1 pc, with a Bonnor-Ebert-like (BE-like) profile, although it has significant
dynamical differences: it is initially non-self-gravitating and confined by the
ram pressure of the infalling material, and consequently, growing continuously
in mass and size. With the appropriate parameters, the core mass eventually
reaches an effective Jeans mass, at which time the core begins to collapse.
Thus, there is necessarily a time delay between the appearance of the core and
the onset of its collapse, but this is not due to the dissipation of its
internal turbulence as it is often believed. These results suggest that
pre-stellar cores may approximate Bonnor-Ebert structures which are however of
variable mass and may or may not experience gravitational collapse, in
qualitative agreement with the large observed frequency of cores with BE-like
profiles.

decreases with higher masses as M_vir^(-0.4) and suggests that the majority of

point-like or an extended radio-loud AGN reveals that the steepening of the

presence of central radio objects with extended jets and/or lobe structures. In
the latter case, L_X\propto T^(4) while for point-like sources one recovers an
approximately self-similar relation L_X\propto T^(2.3). Monte Carlo simulations
show that the steepening of the L_X-T relation is not caused by clusters being
under-luminous in the X-ray band, but rather by overheating, most likely caused
by the interplay between the extended radio structures and the intracluster
medium. In the case of low-mass systems, we also find a tight correlation
between radio luminosity and cluster temperature. The effects of the central
radio source on the thermal state of a cluster become less important with
increasing cluster mass. (Abridged) The luminosity distribution of the cluster
radio population differs from that of all radio sources, as there is a deficit

the square lattice near half filling and at zero temperature are investigated
on the basis of the self-consistent projection operator method. The method
guarantees a high accuracy of the spectra with high energy and high momentum
resolutions. It takes into account long-range intersite correlations as well as
the strong on-site correlations. Effects of nonlocal excitations are clarified
by comparing the results with those of the single-site approximation. The
calculated spectra verify the quantum Monte-Carlo results for finite
temperatures. The spectra at the Fermi level yield a hole-like Fermi surface in
the underdoped region and an electron-like Fermi surface in the overdoped
region. From a numerical analysis of the momentum dependent effective mass and
self-energy, it is concluded that a marginal Fermi-liquid like state persists
even at finite doping concentrations in the strongly correlated region because
a van Hove singularity is pinned to the Fermi surface. It is also found that a
kink structure appears in the quasiparticle energy band in the same region. The
kink is shown to be caused by a mixing between the quasiparticle band and an
excitation band with strong short-range antiferromagnetic correlations. These
results suggest an explanation for some of the unusual properties of the normal
state in high-$T_{\rm c}$ cuprates.

reverberation experiments with model continuum flares and emission-line

observed optical spectral variability of NGC 4151. The time behaviour of NGC

paper frequent patterns are subsets that occur a minimal number of times in a
stream of itemsets. However, the discovery of frequent patterns in streams has
always been problematic. Because streams are potentially endless it is in
principle impossible to say if a pattern is often occurring or not. Furthermore
the number of patterns can be huge and a good overview of the structure of the
stream is lost quickly. The proposed approach will use clustering to facilitate
the analysis of the structure of the stream.
  A clustering on the co-occurrence of patterns will give the user an improved
view on the structure of the stream. Some patterns might occur so much together
that they should form a combined pattern. In this way the patterns in the
clustering will be the largest frequent patterns: maximal frequent patterns.
  Our approach to decide if patterns occur often together will be based on a
method of clustering when only the distance between pairs is known. The number
of maximal frequent patterns is much smaller and combined with clustering
methods these patterns provide a good view on the structure of the stream.

The evolution of magnetic flux in the quiet region is much faster than that in
the coronal hole, as the flux appeared in the form of ephemeral regions in the
quiet region is 4.3 times as large as that in the coronal hole, and the flux
disappeared in the form of flux cancellation, 2.9 times as fast as in the

region are connected by arch filaments, estimating from magnetograms and
H${\alpha}$ images. (3) We measured the magnetic flux of about 1000 magnetic
elements in each observing region. The flux distribution of network and
intranetwork (IN) elements is similar in both polarities in the quiet region.
For network fields in the coronal hole, the number of negative elements is much
more than that of positive elements. However for the IN fields, the number of
positive elements is much more than that of negative elements. (4) In the
coronal hole, the fraction of negative flux change obviously with different
threshold flux density. 73% of the magnetic fields with flux density larger
than 2 Gauss is negative polarity, and 95% of the magnetic fields is negative,
if we only measure the fields with their flux density larger than 20 Gauss. Our
results display that in a coronal hole, stronger fields is occupied by one
predominant polarity; however the majority of weaker fields, occupied by the
other polarity.

changes somewhat sharply and this change becomes sharper as the system size
increases. For $\kappa < 0.5 $, the low temperature phase is ferromagnetic and
we study energy and magnetization. For $\kappa > 0.5 $, the low temperature
phase is antiphase and we study energy, layer magnetization, length of domain
walls running along the direction of frustration, number of domain-intercepts
that are of length 2 along the direction of frustration, and the number of
domain walls that do not touch the upper and/or lower boundary. In agreement
with some previous studies, our final conclusion is that, the floating phase

  2007 (2007)",,,"cs.NE",,"  The assessment of highly-risky situations at road intersections have been
recently revealed as an important research topic within the context of the
automotive industry. In this paper we shall introduce a novel approach to
compute risk functions by using a combination of a highly non-linear processing
model in conjunction with a powerful information encoding procedure.
Specifically, the elements of information either static or dynamic that appear
in a road intersection scene are encoded by using directed positional acyclic
labeled graphs. The risk assessment problem is then reformulated in terms of an
inductive learning task carried out by a recursive neural network. Recursive
neural networks are connectionist models capable of solving supervised and
non-supervised learning problems represented by directed ordered acyclic
graphs. The potential of this novel approach is demonstrated through well
predefined scenarios. The major difference of our approach compared to others
is expressed by the fact of learning the structure of the risk. Furthermore,
the combination of a rich information encoding procedure with a generalized
model of dynamical recurrent networks permit us, as we shall demonstrate, a
sophisticated processing of information that we believe as being a first step
for building future advanced intersection safety systems

it second order at a critical anomaly strength. The anomaly strength at the

S0 galaxies at z < 0.006 are used to measure the absorption-line indices,
Hdelta, Hgamma, Mgb, Fe5270 and Fe5335 within the central r_e/8. By inverting
single-stellar population models, luminosity-weighted mean ages, metallicities
and alpha-element abundance ratios are derived. We estimate the amount of
fading a galaxy has undergone by comparing each galaxy's S_N with its deviation
from the mean spiral S_N. Galaxies with higher S_N have older stellar
populations. Moreover, we find that the zero-point and amount of fading is
consistent with a scenario where lenticulars are formed by the quenching of
star formation in spiral galaxies. Our data also rule out any formation method
for S0s which creates a large number of new globular clusters. We confirm that
previous results showing a relationship between S_N and color are driven by the
S_N - Age relation. Five galaxies show detectable Hbeta, [OIII], Halpha or
[NII] emission lines. However, only in the two youngest galaxies is this
emission unambiguously from star formation. Our results are consistent with the
theory that S0 galaxies are formed when gas in normal spirals is removed,
possibly as a result of a change in environment. The on-going star formation in
the youngest galaxies hints that the timescale of quenching is ~< 1 Gyr. We
speculate, therefore, that the truncation of star formation is a rather gentle
process unlikely to involve a rapid burst of star formation.

emission data are consistent with photoionization. Using the CLOUDY
photoionization code, we found that, while a two-component, high column density
model (10e23 cm-2) with low covering factor proved adequate in reproducing all
detected Lyman series lines, it proved insufficient in modeling He-like
triplets observed (neon, oxygen, and nitrogen). If resonance line data were
ignored, the two-component model was sufficient to match flux from
intercombination and forbidden lines. However, with the inclusion of resonance
line data, He-like triplets could no longer be modeled with only two
components. We found that observed oxygen G and R ratios especially were
anomalous in parameter space investigated. We investigated, and were forced to
dismiss, the possibility that a third purely collisional component could be
responsible for enhanced resonance line contributions. We succeeded in modeling
the observed spectrum with the addition of a third, lower column density
(10e20.5 cm-2) component with non-zero microturbulence and high covering
factor. While sufficient to reproduce observed soft X-ray flux, our model faces
certain shortcomings, particularly in a less-than-ideal visual fit to the line

and their normal derivatives are required to be continuous across the
interface. A complete basis of homogeneous solutions for the interior and
exterior regions, corresponding to all possible Dirichlet boundary values at
the interface, are calculated in a preprocessing step. This basis is used to
construct the influence matrix which serves to transform the coupled boundary
conditions into conditions on the interior problem. Chebyshev approximations
are used to represent both the interior solutions and the boundary values. A
standard Chebyshev spectral method is used to calculate the interior solutions.
The exterior harmonic solutions are calculated as the convolution of the
free-space Green's function with a surface density; this surface density is
itself the solution to an integral equation which has an analytic solution when
the boundary values are given as a Chebyshev expansion. Properties of Chebyshev
approximations insure that the basis of exterior harmonic functions represents
the external near-boundary solutions uniformly. The method is tested by
calculating the electrostatic potential resulting from charge distributions in
a rectangle. The resulting influence matrix is well-conditioned and solutions
converge exponentially as the resolution is increased. The generalization of
this approach to three-dimensional problems is discussed, in particular the
magnetohydrodynamic equations in a finite cylindrical domain surrounded by a

leads in the regime of weak tunnel coupling. A finite source-drain voltage
generates a nonequilibrium spin on the otherwise non-magnetic quantum dot. This
spin accumulation leads to magnetoresistance. A ferromagnetic but current-free
base electrode influences the quantum-dot spin via incoherent spin-flip
processes and coherent spin precession. As the dot spin determines the
conductance of the device, this allows for a purely magnetic transistor-like
operation. We analyze the effect of both types of processes on the electric
current in different geometries.

Born approximation. Results for Landau level width and optical absorption are
presented. A disorder activated forbidden transition becomes significant in the
vicinity of crossings of Landau levels which belong to different subbands. A
study of the time dependent survival probability in the lowest Landau level of
the excited subband is performed. It is shown that at resonance the population
relaxation occurs in a subpicosecond scale.

--CH$_3$ and --CF$_3$ terminated short-chain alkanethiolates on Ag(111) is
studied by means of density functional theory calculations. The interface
dipoles are characterized by monitoring the change in the surface work function
upon adsorption of the SAM. We compare results obtained for SAMs in structures
with a different packing density of molecules, i.e. {$(\sqrt{7}\times\sqrt{7})
R19.1^{\circ}$}, {$(\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}) R30^{\circ}$}, and {p(2$\times$2)}.
The work function of alkanethiolate SAMs on silver depends weakly on the
packing density; that of fluorinatedalkanethiolates shows a stronger
dependance. The results are analyzed in terms of two nearly independent
contributions to the interface dipole. These originate respectively from the
molecular dipoles and from a charge transfer between the metal surface and the
molecules. The charge transfer is determined by the silver--sulfur bond and it
is independent of the electronegativity of the molecules.

(1+1)-dimensional solid-on-solid interfaces in an Ising lattice-gas model,
which are driven far from equilibrium by an applied force, such as a magnetic
field or a difference in (electro)chemical potential, are studied by an
analytic nonlinear-response approximation together with kinetic Monte Carlo
simulations. Here we consider the case that the system is coupled to a
two-dimensional phonon bath. In the resulting dynamic, transitions that
conserve the system energy are forbidden, and the effects of the applied force
and the interaction energies do not factorize (a so-called hard dynamic). In
full agreement with previous general theoretical results we find that the local
interface width changes dramatically with the applied force. However, in
contrast with other hard dynamics, this change is nonmonotonic in the driving
force. However, significant differences between theory and simulation are found
near two special values of the driving force, where certain transitions allowed
by the solid-on-solid model become forbidden by the phonon-assisted dynamic.
Our results represent a significant step toward providing a solid physical
foundation for kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.
