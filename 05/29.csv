density was 1.23$\pm$0.07 mJy, corresponding to an isotropic luminosity at
8.4GHz of (4.45$\pm$0.3)$\times10^{25}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ and a brightness
temperature of (1.3$\pm$0.3)$\times10^{8}$ K. We also provide an improved

shows a clear asymmetry. From model fitting of the size of the radio emission,
we estimate a minimum expansion velocity of 15,700$\pm$2,000 km s$^{-1}$. This
velocity is more than twice the expected mean expansion velocity estimated from
a synchrotron self-absorbed emission model, thus suggesting that synchrotron
self-absorption is not relevant for this supernova. With the benefit of an

  Complexity and Speed of Molecular Evolution",,,,,"q-bio.BM q-bio.PE",,"  Classical population genetics a priori assigns fitness to alleles without
considering molecular or functional properties of proteins that these alleles
encode. Here we study population dynamics in a model where fitness can be
inferred from physical properties of proteins under a physiological assumption
that loss of stability of any protein encoded by an essential gene confers a
lethal phenotype. Accumulation of mutations in organisms containing Gamma genes
can then be represented as diffusion within the Gamma dimensional hypercube
with adsorbing boundaries which are determined, in each dimension, by loss of a
protein stability and, at higher stability, by lack of protein sequences.
Solving the diffusion equation whose parameters are derived from the data on
point mutations in proteins, we determine a universal distribution of protein
stabilities, in agreement with existing data. The theory provides a fundamental
relation between mutation rate, maximal genome size and thermodynamic response
of proteins to point mutations. It establishes a universal speed limit on rate
of molecular evolution by predicting that populations go extinct (via lethal
mutagenesis) when mutation rate exceeds approximately 6 mutations per essential
part of genome per replication for mesophilic organisms and 1 to 2 mutations
per genome per replication for thermophilic ones. Further, our results suggest
that in absence of error correction, modern RNA viruses and primordial genomes
must necessarily be very short. Several RNA viruses function close to the
evolutionary speed limit while error correction mechanisms used by DNA viruses
and non-mutant strains of bacteria featuring various genome lengths and
mutation rates have brought these organisms universally about 1000 fold below
the natural speed limit.

direction-dependent: $\epsilon \to - \infty$ when we approach the singular
point along a $t =$ const hypersurface and $\epsilon \to + \infty$ when we
approach that point along the center of symmetry. The appearance of

likely to be originated from the magnetic moment transition from active to

We examine the prospects for the SNO+ experiment to address this important
issue and to distinguish between the two classes of solar models which are
currently identified as corresponding to a high (SSM I) and a low (SSM II)
heavy element abundance. We also evaluate the predictions from these two models
for the Chlorine experiment event rate in the standard LMA and LMA+Spin Flavour
Precession (SFP) scenarios. It is found that after three years of SNO+ data
taking, the pep flux measurement will be able to discriminate between the
standard LMA and LMA+SFP scenarios, independently of which is the correct solar
model. If the LMA rate is measured, SFP with $B_0 \sim 280kG$ for the resonant
$\Delta m^2_{01}$ can be excluded at more than $4\sigma$. A low rate would
signal new physics, excluding all the 90% allowed range of the standard LMA
solution at 3$\sigma$, and a time variability would be a strong signature of
the SFP model. The CNO fluxes are the ones for which the two SSM predictions
exhibit the largest differences, so their measurement at SNO+ will be important
to favour one or the other. The distinction will be clearer after LMA or SFP
are confirmed with pep, but still, a CNO measurement at the level of SSM I/LMA
will disfavour SSM II at about $3 \sigma$. We conclude that consistency between
future pep and CNO flux measurements at SNO+ and Chlorine would either favour
an LMA+SFP scenario or favour SSM II over SSM I.

the energy ratio $E_1/E_2 \to \infty$ is discussed. This limit corresponds to
the maximum observable turbulent energy gradient for a given $E_1$ and is
obtained through the limit $E_2 \to 0$. A field with $E_1/E_2 \to \infty$
represents a mixing which could be observed near a surface subject to a very
small velocity gradient separating two turbulent fields, one of which is nearly
quiescent. In this condition the turbulent penetration is maximum and reaches a
value equal to 1.2 times the nominal mixing layer width. The experiment shows
that the presence of a turbulent energy gradient is sufficient for the
appearance of intermittency and that during the mixing process the pressure
transport is not negligible with respect to the turbulent velocity transport.
These findings may open the way to the hypothesis that the presence of a
gradient of turbulent energy is the minimal requirement for Gaussian departure
in turbulence.

Building on the same construction, but with some additional technical effort

QMA-complete; QMA is a quantum analogue of NP. This is in striking contrast to
the fact that the analogous classical problem, namely, one-dimensional
MAX-2-SAT with nearest neighbor constraints, is in P. The proof of the
QMA-completeness result requires an additional idea beyond the usual techniques
in the area: Not all illegal configurations can be ruled out by local checks,
so instead we rule out such illegal configurations because they would, in the
future, evolve into a state which can be seen locally to be illegal. Our
construction implies (assuming the quantum Church-Turing thesis and that
quantum computers cannot efficiently solve QMA-complete problems) that there
are one-dimensional systems which take an exponential time to relax to their
ground states at any temperature, making them candidates for being
one-dimensional spin glasses.

patterns are distributed as evenly as possible: they maximize the sum of the
Euclidean distances between all pairs of onsets, viewing onsets as points on a
circle. Indeed, Euclidean rhythms are the unique rhythms that maximize this
notion of \emph{evenness}. We also show that essentially all Euclidean rhythms
are \emph{deep}: each distinct distance between onsets occurs with a unique
multiplicity, and these multiplicies form an interval $1,2,...,k-1$. Finally,
we characterize all deep rhythms, showing that they form a subclass of
generated rhythms, which in turn proves a useful property called shelling. All
of our results for musical rhythms apply equally well to musical scales. In

absorption lines by invoking non-thermal excitation; and, to investigate
possible spectral signatures of hydrogen, especially a feature around 6200
Angstrom, which has been attributed to high velocity $H_\alpha$. Our models
assume an atmosphere with uniform composition devoid of any hydrogen. Our model
spectra fit the observed spectra well, successfully reproducing most of the
features, including the prominent He I absorptions. The most plausible
alternative to $H_\alpha$ as the source of the 6200 Angstrom feature is a blend
of Fe II and Si II lines, which can be made stronger to fit the observed
feature better by increasing the metallicity of the ejecta. High-metallicity
models fit well at early epochs, but not as well as solar-metallicity models
after maximum light. While this blend of metal lines is a reasonable
explanation of the source of the 6200 Angstrom feature, it is still important
to investigate hydrogen as the source; therefore, a second paper will present
models that include a thin shell of hydrogen around the main composition
structure.

amorphous-semiconductor/oxide interface. A wide distribution of spin-flip times
is derived from the single-phonon cross-relaxation mechanism for a
dangling-bond interacting with the tunneling two-level systems of the amorphous
interface. The temperature and frequency dependence is sensitive to three
energy scales: The dangling-bond spin Zeeman energy delta, as well as the
minimum (E_min) and maximum (E_max) values for the energy splittings of the
tunneling two-level systems. We compare and fit our model parameters to a
recent experiment probing spin coherence of antimony donors implanted in
nuclear-spin-free silicon [T. Schenkel {\it et al.}, Appl. Phys. Lett. 88,
112101 (2006)], and conclude that a dangling-bond area density of the order of
10^{14}cm^{-2} is consistent with the data. This enables the prediction of
single spin qubit coherence times as a function of the distance from the
interface and the dangling-bond area density in a real device structure. We
apply our theory to calculations of magnetic flux noise affecting SQUID devices
due to their Si/SiO_2 substrate. Our explicit estimates of flux noise in SQUIDs
lead to a noise spectral density of the order of 10^{-12}Phi_{0}^{2} {Hz}^{-1}
at f=1Hz. This value might explain the origin of flux noise in some SQUID
devices. Finally, we consider the suppression of these effects using surface
passivation with hydrogen, and the residual nuclear-spin noise resulting from a
perfect silicon-hydride surface.

of massive field galaxies experiencing more massive/intense starbursts at

young elliptical fraction among sub-L*/2 early-type galaxies compared to their

logarithmic value of 21.0--21.2 cm^-2 and the weak metal lines of Ni, S and Fe
show that the metallicity is in excess of a tenth of solar which is far above
the metallicities in damped Lyman alpha absorbers at high redshift. The
tightest constraint is from the Fe lines which place [Fe/H] in excess of -0.8.

compare black-hole masses, Mbh, in high-redshift galaxies selected by nuclear
activity to Mbh in local galaxies selected by luminosity L, or stellar velocity
dispersion sigma. Because AGN luminosity is likely to depend on Mbh, selection
effects are different for high-redshift and local samples, potentially
producing a false signal of evolution. This bias arises because cosmic scatter
in the Mbh-sigma and Mbh-L relations means that the mean log(L) or log(sigma)
among galaxies that host a black hole of given Mbh, may be substantially
different than the log(L) or log(sigma) obtained from inverting the Mbh-L or
Mbh-sigma relations for the same nominal Mbh. The bias is particularly strong
at high Mbh, where the luminosity and dispersion functions of galaxies are
falling rapidly. The most massive black holes occur more often as rare outliers
in galaxies of modest mass than in the even rarer high-mass galaxies, which
would otherwise be the sole location of such black holes in the absence of
cosmic scatter. Because of this bias, Mbh will typically appear to be too large
in the distant sample for a given L or sigma. For the largest black holes and
the largest plausible cosmic scatter, the bias can reach a factor of 3 in Mbh
for the Mbh-sigma relation and a factor of 9 for the Mbh-L relation.
Unfortunately, the actual cosmic scatter is not known well enough to correct
for the bias. Measuring evolution of the Mbh and galaxy property relations
requires object selection to be precisely defined and exactly the same at all
redshifts.

regions of galaxies and dark matter haloes are typically mildly to
significantly radially anisotropic. The inner regions can be significantly
non-isotropic, depending on the dynamical formation and evolution processes. In
an attempt to break the lack of simple dynamical models that can reproduce this
behaviour, we explore a technique to construct dynamical models with an
arbitrary density and an arbitrary anisotropy profile. We outline a general
construction method and propose a more practical approach based on a
parameterized anisotropy profile. This approach consists of fitting the density
of the model with a set of dynamical components, each of which have the same
anisotropy profile. Using this approach we avoid the delicate fine-tuning
difficulties other fitting techniques typically encounter when constructing
radially anisotropic models. We present a model anisotropy profile that
generalizes the Osipkov-Merritt profile, and that can represent any smooth
monotonic anisotropy profile. Based on this model anisotropy profile, we
construct a very general seven-parameter set of dynamical components for which
the most important dynamical properties can be calculated analytically. We use
the results to look for simple one-component dynamical models that generate
simple potential-density pairs while still supporting a flexible anisotropy
profile. We present families of Plummer and Hernquist models in which the
anisotropy at small and large radii can be chosen as free parameters. We also
generalize these two families to a three-parameter family that
self-consistently generates the set of Veltmann potential-density pairs.

system designer, we examine the effect of the money supply on social welfare
and show that social welfare is maximized by increasing the money supply up to
the point that the system experiences a ``monetary crash,'' where money is
sufficiently devalued that no agent is willing to perform a service. We also
examine the implications of the presence of altruists and hoarders on the
performance of the system. While a small number of altruists may improve social
welfare, too many can also cause the system to experience a monetary crash,
which may be bad for social welfare. Hoarders generally decrease social welfare
but, surprisingly, they also promote system stability by helping prevent
monetary crashes. In addition, we provide new technical tools for analyzing and

complementarities, which implies that there exist equilibria in pure strategies

random component in the so-called stochastic volatility models. We study these
models under an assumption, akin to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, in
which the volatility has already relaxed to its equilibrium distribution and
acts as a background to the evolution of the price process. In this
approximation, we show that all models of stochastic volatility should exhibit
a scaling relation in the time lag of zero-drift modified log-returns. We
verify that the Dow-Jones Industrial Average index indeed follows this scaling.
We then focus on two popular stochastic volatility models, the Heston and
Hull-White models. In particular, we show that in the Hull-White model the
resulting probability distribution of log-returns in this approximation
corresponds to the Tsallis (t-Student) distribution. The Tsallis parameters are
given in terms of the microscopic stochastic volatility model. Finally, we show
that the log-returns for 30 years Dow Jones index data is well fitted by a
Tsallis distribution, obtaining the relevant parameters.

distinct spatial scales and are fortuitously almost orthogonal in their
influences. The nearest, which is distinguished by a velocity discontinuity at
~7 Mpc, arises from the evacuation of the Local Void. We lie in the Local Sheet
that bounds the void. Random motions within the Local Sheet are small. Our
Galaxy participates in the bulk motion of the Local Sheet away from the Local
Void. The component of our motion on an intermediate scale is attributed to the
Virgo Cluster and its surroundings, 17 Mpc away. The third and largest
component is an attraction on scales larger than 3000 km/s and centered near
the direction of the Centaurus Cluster. The amplitudes of the three components
are 259, 185, and 455 km/s, respectively, adding collectively to 631 km/s in
the reference frame of the Local Sheet. Taking the nearby influences into
account causes the residual attributed to large scales to align with observed
concentrations of distant galaxies and reduces somewhat the amplitude of motion
attributed to their pull. On small scales, in addition to the motion of our
Local Sheet away from the Local Void, the nearest adjacent filament, the Leo
Spur, is seen to be moving in a direction that will lead to convergence with
our filament. Finally, a good distance to an isolated galaxy within the Local
Void reveals that this dwarf system has a motion of at least 230 km/s away from
the void center. Given the velocities expected from gravitational instability
theory in the standard cosmological paradigm, the distance to the center of the
Local Void must be at least 23 Mpc from our position. The Local Void is large!

cosmology. Since our own Universe is supposed to be of this kind, bubble
cosmology should supply definite answers to the long-standing questions
regarding cosmological initial conditions. In particular, it must explain how
an initial singularity is avoided, and also how the initial conditions for
Inflation were established. We argue that the simplest non-anthropic approach
to these problems involves a requirement that the spatial sections defined by
distinguished bubble observers should not be allowed to have arbitrarily small
volumes. Casimir energy is a popular candidate for a quantum effect which can
ensure this, but [because it violates energy conditions] there is a danger that
it could lead to non-perturbative instabilities in string theory. We make a
simple proposal for the initial conditions of a bubble universe, and show that
our proposal ensures that the system is non-perturbatively stable. Thus,
low-entropy conditions can be established at the beginning of a bubble universe
without violating the Second Law of thermodynamics and without leading to
instability in string theory. These conditions are inherited from the ambient
spacetime.

all-sky survey at 9 and 18um. It comprises three channels. The NIR channel
(1.8--5.5um) employs a 512 x 412 InSb array, whereas both the MIR-S
(4.6--13.4um) and MIR-L (12.6--26.5um) channels use 256 x 256 Si:As impurity
band conduction arrays. Each of the three channels has a field-of-view of about
10' x 10' and are operated simultaneously. The NIR and MIR-S share the same
field-of-view by virtue of a beam splitter. The MIR-L observes the sky about
$25' away from the NIR/MIR-S field-of-view. IRC gives us deep insights into the
formation and evolution of galaxies, the evolution of planetary disks, the
process of star-formation, the properties of interstellar matter under various

the early Universe offers us one of the most intriguing and fascinating
questions in cosmology. Indeed, the role played by the latent ""heat"" or energy
released in the phase transition is highly nontrivial and may lead to some
surprising, important results. In this paper, we take the wisdom that the
cosmological QCD phase transition, which happened at a time between 10^(-5) sec
and 10^(-4) sec or at the temperature of about 150 MeV and accounts for
confinement of quarks and gluons to within hadrons, would be of first order. To
get the essence out of the scenario, it is sufficient to approximate the true
QCD vacuum as one of degenerate theta-vacua and when necessary we try to model
it effectively via a complex scalar field with spontaneous symmetry breaking.
We examine how and when ""pasted"" or ""patched"" domain walls are formed, how long
such walls evolve in the long run, and we believe that the significant portion
of dark matter could be accounted for in terms of such domain-wall structure
and its remnants. Of course, the cosmological QCD phase transition happened in
the way such that the false vacua associated with baryons and many other
color-singlet objects did not disappear (that is, using the bag-model language,
there are bags of radius 1.0 fermi for the baryons) - but the amount of the
energy remained in the false vacua is negligible. The latent energy released
due to the conversion of the false vacua to the true vacua, in the form of
""pasted"" or ""patched"" domain walls in the short run and their numerous evolved
objects, should make the concept of the ""radiation-dominated"" epoch, or of the
""matter-dominated"" epoch to be re-examined.

There is a substantial amount of literature proving that, quite generally,
PA-graphs possess power-law degree sequences with a power-law exponent \tau>2.
  We prove that the diameter of the PA-model is bounded above by a constant
times \log{t}, where t is the size of the graph. When the power-law exponent
\tau exceeds 3, then we prove that \log{t} is the right order, by proving a
lower bound of this order, both for the diameter as well as for the typical
distance. This shows that, for \tau>3, distances are of the order \log{t}. For
\tau\in (2,3), we improve the upper bound to a constant times \log\log{t}, and
prove a lower bound of the same order for the diameter. Unfortunately, this
proof does not extend to typical distances. These results do show that the
diameter is of order \log\log{t}.
  These bounds partially prove predictions by physicists that the typical
distance in PA-graphs are similar to the ones in other scale-free random

""lower"" basis states correspond exactly via the $W^\pm$ transitions in the weak

conservation by making all matrix elements real. In addition, we impose a
""hidden symmetry"" (invariance under simultaneous translations of all three
basis quark states in each sector), which ensures a zero mass eigenstate in
each sector.
  Next, we simultaneously break the hidden symmetry and T invariance by
introducing a phase factor e^{i\chi} in the interaction for each sector. The
Jarlskog invariant J_{CKM}, as well as the light quark masses are evaluated in
terms of the parameters of the model. We find a simple relation with
J_{CKM}=(m_dm_s/m_b^2)^{1/2}A\lambda^3\cos(\chi/2), with A and \lambda the
Wolfenstein parameters. Setting J_{CKM}=3.08 \times 10^{-5}, m_b=4.7GeV,
m_s=95MeV, A=0.818 and \lambda=0.227, we find m_d\cos^2(\chi/2) \simeq 2.4MeV,
consistent with the accepted value m_d=3-7MeV.
  We make a parallel proposal for the lepton sectors. With the hidden symmetry
and in the approximation of T invariance, both the masses of e and \nu_1 are
zero. The neutrino mapping matrix V_\nu is shown to be of the same
Harrison-Scott form which is in agreement with experiments. We also examine the

explain the dynamics of the neutral hydrogen clouds at large distances from the
galactic center, could be in the form of a Bose-Einstein condensate. To study
the condensate we use the non-relativistic Gross-Pitaevskii equation. By
introducing the Madelung representation of the wave function, we formulate the
dynamics of the system in terms of the continuity equation and of the
hydrodynamic Euler equations. Hence dark matter can be described as a
non-relativistic, Newtonian Bose-Einstein gravitational condensate gas, whose
density and pressure are related by a barotropic equation of state. In the case
of a condensate with quartic non-linearity, the equation of state is polytropic
with index $n=1$. To test the validity of the model we fit the Newtonian
tangential velocity equation of the model with a sample of rotation curves of
low surface brightness and dwarf galaxies, respectively. We find a very good
agreement between the theoretical rotation curves and the observational data
for the low surface brightness galaxies. The deflection of photons passing
through the dark matter halos is also analyzed, and the bending angle of light
is computed. The bending angle obtained for the Bose-Einstein condensate is
larger than that predicted by standard general relativistic and dark matter
models. Therefore the study of the light deflection by galaxies and the
gravitational lensing could discriminate between the Bose-Einstein condensate

photoionisation by the AGN. The stellar kinematics of all galaxies in the

kinematic axes which are well aligned with those derived from the outer

nodes. After removal of the non-gravitational components due to e.g. AGN-driven
outflows, the ionised gas kinematics in both the Seyfert and inactive galaxies

most galaxies. This result is consistent with previous findings from
photometric studies that the large-scale light distribution of Seyfert hosts
are similar to inactive hosts. However, fully exploiting the two-dimensional

more disturbed at small radii in the Seyfert galaxies compared with the

polarization in five radio bands between 3cm and 21cm. At the inner edge of the
inner gas spiral arm the ordered magnetic field is only mildly compressed and
turns smoothly, to become aligned along the gas arm. Hence the field is not
shocked and is probably connected to the warm, diffuse gas. At larger radii,
two bright magnetic arms between the optical arms are visible in polarized
intensity. The field in the northern magnetic arm is almost totally aligned.
Faraday rotation measures (RM) in these arms are consistent with the
superposition of two low azimuthal dynamo modes. Three more magnetic arms are
discovered in the outer galaxy, located between HI arms. Due to strong Faraday
depolarization the galaxy is not transparent to polarized waves at 18cm and
20cm. The large-scale asymmetry in depolarization with respect to the major
axis may be another indication of large-scale helical fields. Three
depolarization rings of almost zero polarization seen at 20cm are probably

minimize the dipole potential. We show that the two assumptions are

simplicity, all interactions among the particles have been switched off and the

is shown that the probability distribution of the possible conformations in

with the partition function of a field theory which is a generalization of the
nonlinear sigma model in two dimensions. Both the probability distribution and

compelling object to study in the context of disk evolution across different
spectral types, as it is an M dwarf whose near edge-on disk may be directly
compared to that of its A5V sibling beta Pic. We resolve the disk from 8-60 AU
in the near-IR JHK' bands at high resolution with the Keck II telescope and
adaptive optics, and develop a novel data reduction technique for the removal
of the stellar point spread function. The point source detection sensitivity in
the disk midplane is more than a magnitude less sensitive than regions away
from the disk for some radii. We measure a blue color across the near-IR bands,
and confirm the presence of substructure in the inner disk. Some of the
structural features exhibit wavelength-dependent positions. The disk
architecture and characteristics of grain composition are inferred through
modeling. We approach the modeling of the dust distribution in a manner that
complements previous work. Using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, we
compare a relatively simple model of the distribution of porous grains to a
broad data set, simultaneously fitting to midplane surface brightness profiles
and the spectral energy distribution. Our model confirms that the large-scale
architecture of the disk is consistent with detailed models of steady-state
grain dynamics. Here, a belt of parent bodies from 35-40 AU is responsible for
producing dust that is then swept outward by the stellar wind and radiation
pressures. We infer the presence of very small grains in the outer region, down
to sizes of ~0.05 micron. These sizes are consistent with stellar mass-loss
rates Mdot_* << 10^2 Mdot_sun.

rise, at simple commensurate electronic densities, to exotic insulating phases
of matter. Such a phenomenon is illustrated using an extended t--J model on a
planar pyrochlore lattice for which the work on the quarter-filled case
[cond-mat/0702367] is complemented and extended to 1/8- and 3/8-fillings. The
location of the metal-insulator transition as a function of the Coulomb
repulsion is shown to depend strongly on the sign of the hopping. Quite
generally, the metal-insulator transition is characterized by lattice symmetry
breaking but the nature of the insulating Mott state is more complex than a
simple Charge Density Wave. Indeed, in the limit of large Coulomb repulsion,
the physics can be described in the framework of (extended) quantum
fully-packed loop or dimer models carrying extra spin degrees of freedom.
Various diagonal and off-diagonal plaquette correlation functions are computed
and the low-energy spectra are analyzed in details in order to characterize the
nature of the insulating phases. We provide evidence that, as for an electronic
density of n=1/2 (quarter-filling), the system at $n=1/4$ or $n=3/4$ exhibits
also plaquette order by forming a (lattice rotationally-invariant)
Resonating-Singlet-Pair Crystal, although with a quadrupling of the lattice
unit cell (instead of a doubling for $n=1/2$) and a 4-fold degenerate ground
state. Interestingly, qualitative differences with the bosonic analog (e.g.
known to exhibit columnar order at n=1/4) emphasize the important role of the
spin degrees of freedom in e.g. stabilizing plaquette phases w.r.t. rotational
symmetry-breaking phases.

semiclassically the surface polariton and provide analytical expressions for

We use a mean-field model of electrons with a pure forward scattering
interaction on a square lattice. When either the majority or the minority spin
band is tuned close to the van Hove filling by a magnetic field, the Fermi
surface symmetry breaking occurs in both bands, but with a different magnitude
of the order parameter. The transition is typically of second order at high
temperature and changes to first order at low temperature; the end points of
the second order line are tricritical points. This qualitative picture does not
change even in the limit of a large magnetic field, although the magnetic field
substantially suppresses the transition temperature at the van Hove filling.
The field produces neither a quantum critical point nor a quantum critical end
point in our model. In the weak coupling limit, typical quantities
characterizing the phase diagram have a field-independent single energy scale
while its dimensionless coefficient varies with the field. The field-induced
Fermi surface symmetry breaking is a promising scenario for the bilayer

special cases of initial state, instead of undergoing strong oscillation as
found previously, the evolution is found to go on very steadily in a very long
duration.

of the isentropic compressible Navier--Stokes equations, or $p$-system with
real viscosity. We first revisit the work of Matsumura and Nishihara, extending
the known parameter regime for which small-amplitude viscous shocks are
provably spectrally stable by an optimized version of their original argument.
Next, using a novel spectral energy estimate, we show that there are no purely
real unstable eigenvalues for any shock strength.
  By related estimates, we show that unstable eigenvalues are confined to a
bounded region independent of shock strength. Then through an extensive
numerical Evans function study, we show that there is no unstable spectrum in
the entire right-half plane, thus demonstrating numerically that
large-amplitude shocks are spectrally stable up to Mach number $M\approx 3000$
for $1 \le \gamma \leq 3$. This strongly suggests that shocks are stable
independent of amplitude and the adiabatic constant $\gamma$. We complete our
study by showing that finite-difference simulations of perturbed
large-amplitude shocks converge to a translate of the original shock wave, as
expected.

  weak-field coherent optical transients","11 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.optics physics.class-ph physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study theoretically the propagation of a step-modulated optical field as
it passes through a dispersive dielectric made up of a dilute collection of
oscillators characterized by a single narrow-band resonance. The propagated
field is given in terms of an integral of a Fourier type, which cannot be
evaluated even for simple models of the dispersive dielectric. The fact that
the oscillators have a low number density (dilute medium) and have a
narrow-band resonance allows us to simplify the integrand. In this case, the
integral can be evaluated exactly, although it is not possible using this
method to separate out the transient part of the propagated field known as
optical precursors. We also use an asymptotic method (saddle-point method) to
evaluate the integral. The contributions to the integral related to the
saddle-points of the integrand give rise to the optical precursors. We obtain
analytic expressions for the precursor fields and the domain over which the
asymptotic method is valid. When combined to obtain the total transient field,
we find that the agreement between the solutions obtained by the asymptotic and
the exact methods is excellent. Our results demonstrate that precursors can
persist for many nanoseconds and the chirp in the instantaneous frequency of
the precursors can manifest itself in beats in the transmitted intensity. Our
work strongly suggests that precursors have been observed in many previous
experiments.

perturbation on large scales represents an alternative to the standard
slow-roll scenario of inflation in which the observed density perturbations are
due to fluctuations of the inflaton field itself. Its basic assumption is that
the initial curvature perturbation due to the inflaton field is negligible.
This is attained by lowering the energy scale of inflation, thereby highly
suppressing the amount of gravitational waves produced during inflation. We
compute the power-spectrum of the gravitational waves generated at second order
in perturbation theory by the curvaton (isocurvature) perturbations between the
end of inflation and the curvaton decay. An interesting property of this
contribution to the tensor perturbations is that it is directly proportional to
the amount of non-Gaussianity predicted within the curvaton scenario. We show
that the spectrum of gravitational waves may be in the range of future
gravitational wave detectors.

expression, due to Helmholtz, is not discussed here : it corresponds to the
most common model of a lip-type valve, when the valve is assumed to be a one
degree of freedom oscillator. The presented work is an extension of the works
done by Wilson and Beavers (1974), Tarnopolsky (2000). The range of the playing
frequencies is investigated. The first results are analytical : when no losses
are present in the resonator, it is proven that the ratio between the threshold
frequency and the reed resonance frequency is found to be necessarily within
the interval between unity and the square root of 3. This is a musical sixth.
Actually the interval is largely smaller, and this is in accordance with e.g.
the results by Cullen et al.. The smallest blowing pressure is found to be
directly related to the quality factor of the reed. Numerical results confirm
these statements, and are discussed in comparison with previous ones by Cullen
et al (2000).

analytically), and (ii) for $M\ge 2,500$, $\gamma\in [1,2.5]$ (demonstrated
numerically). This builds on and completes earlier studies by
Matsumura--Nishihara and Barker--Humpherys--Rudd--Zumbrun establishing
stability for low and intermediate Mach numbers, respectively, indicating
unconditional stability, independent of shock amplitude, of viscous shock waves
for $\gamma$-law gas dynamics in the range $\gamma \in [1,2.5]$. Other
$\gamma$-values may be treated similarly, but have not been checked
numerically. The main idea is to establish convergence of the Evans function in
the high-Mach number limit to that of a pressureless, or ``infinitely
compressible'', gas with additional upstream boundary condition determined by a
boundary-layer analysis. Recall that low-Mach number behavior is
incompressible.
