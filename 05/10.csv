bilayers that consist of low spin-polarized Ni80Fe20 exhibiting in-plane but no
uniaxial anisotropy and low-Tc Nb. We reveal a magnetoresistance effect that is
pronounced. In our trilayers the magnetoresistance exhibits an increase of two
orders of magnitude when the superconducting state is reached: from the
conventional normal-state values 0.6 % it goes up to 1000 % for temperatures
below Tc. In contrast, in the bilayers the effect is only minor since from 3%
in the normal state increases only to 70 % for temperatures below Tc.
Magnetization data of both the longitudinal and transverse magnetic components
are presented. Most importantly, we present data not only for the normal state
of Nb but also in its superconducting state. Strikingly, these data show that
below its Tc SC the Nb interlayer under the influence of the outer Ni80Fe20
layers attains a magnetization component transverse to the external field. By
comparing the transport and magnetization data we propose a candidate mechanism
that could motivate the pronounced magnetoresistance effect observed in the
trilayers. Adequate magnetostatic coupling of the outer Ni80Fe20 layers is
motivated by stray fields that emerge naturally in their whole surface due to
the multidomain magnetic structure that they attain near coercivity. Atomic
force microscopy is employed in order to examine the possibility that such
magnetostatic coupling could be promoted by interface roughness. Referring to
the bilayers, although out-of-plane rotation of the magnetization of the single
Ni80Fe20 layer is still observed, in these structures magnetostatic coupling
does not occur due to the absence of a second Ni80Fe20 one so that the observed
magnetoresistance peaks are only modest.

the same result as the effective theory. By doing the threshold expansion of

observed keV X-ray spectra of magnetic cataclysmic variables, the inclusion of

for white-dwarf masses when compared with masses inferred from models excluding

various MIMO systems and channels in terms of the two main advantages they
provide (i.e. high data rate and/or low error rate). This tradeoff was
characterized asymptotically (SNR-> infinity) for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading
channel by Zheng and Tse [1]. The asymptotic DMT overestimates the finite-SNR
one [2]. In this paper, using the recent results on the asymptotic (in the
number of antennas) outage capacity distribution, we derive and analyze the
finite-SNR DMT for a broad class of channels (not necessarily Rayleigh fading).
Based on this, we give the convergence conditions for the asymptotic DMT to be
approached by the finite-SNR one. The multiplexing gain definition is shown to
affect critically the convergence point: when the multiplexing gain is defined
via the mean (ergodic) capacity, the convergence takes place at realistic SNR
values. Furthermore, in this case the diversity gain can also be used to
estimate the outage probability with reasonable accuracy. The multiplexing gain
definition via the high-SNR asymptote of the mean capacity (as in [1]) results
in very slow convergence for moderate to large systems (as 1/ln(SNR)^2) and,
hence, the asymptotic DMT cannot be used at realistic SNR values. For this
definition, the high-SNR threshold increases exponentially in the number of
antennas and in the multiplexing gain. For correlated keyhole channel, the
diversity gain is shown to decrease with correlation and power imbalance of the
channel. While the SNR-asymptotic DMT of Zheng and Tse does not capture this
effect, the size-asymptotic DMT does.

the emission arises from the inverse-Compton process, it must be

V-BLAST algorithm and its comparative performance analysis are presented.
Compact closed-form approximations for the optimum power allocation are
derived, based on average total and block error rates. The choice of the
criterion has little impact on the power allocation and, overall, the optimum
strategy is to allocate more power to lower step transmitters and less to
higher ones. High-SNR approximations for optimized average block and total
error rates are given. The SNR gain of optimization is rigorously defined and
studied using analytical tools, including lower and upper bounds, high and low
SNR approximations. The gain is upper bounded by the number of transmitters,
for any modulation format and type of fading channel. While the average
optimization is less complex than the instantaneous one, its performance is
almost as good at high SNR. A measure of robustness of the optimized algorithm
is introduced and evaluated. The optimized algorithm is shown to be robust to
perturbations in individual and total transmit powers. Based on the algorithm
robustness, a pre-set power allocation is suggested as a low-complexity
alternative to the other optimization strategies, which exhibits only a minor
loss in performance over the practical SNR range.

in the realm of message passing due to its optimality (for a tree code) with
respect to the {\em block error} probability \cite{Wiberg}. There also seems to
be a fundamental relationship of MS decoding with the linear programming
decoder \cite{Koetter}. Despite its importance, its fundamental properties have
not nearly been studied as well as those of the sum-product (also known as BP)
algorithm.
  We address two questions related to the MS rule. First, we characterize the
stability condition under MS decoding. It turns out to be essentially the same
condition as under BP decoding. Second, we perform a degree distribution
optimization. Contrary to the case of BP decoding, under MS decoding the
thresholds of the best degree distributions for standard irregular LDPC
ensembles are significantly bounded away from the Shannon threshold. More
precisely, on the AWGN channel, for the best codes that we find, the gap to
capacity is 1dB for a rate 0.3 code and it is 0.4dB when the rate is 0.9 (the
gap decreases monotonically as we increase the rate).
  We also used the optimization procedure to design codes for modified MS
algorithm where the output of the check node is scaled by a constant
$1/\alpha$. For $\alpha = 1.25$, we observed that the gap to capacity was
lesser for the modified MS algorithm when compared with the MS algorithm.
However, it was still quite large, varying from 0.75 dB to 0.2 dB for rates
between 0.3 and 0.9.
  We conclude by posing what we consider to be the most important open
questions related to the MS algorithm.

all situations, the critical behavior at asymptotically low temperatures is
three-dimensional, but the corresponding crossover scale may be tiny. Magnetic
ordering in case (B) can be discussed in terms of two condensates; remarkably,
perfect frustration renders the proximity effect ineffective. Then, the
ordering transition will be generically split, with clear signatures in
measurable properties. Using a generalized bond-operator method, we calculate
the low-temperature magnetic properties in the paramagnetic and

leads to jet energy dependence of $\hat{q}$. We study this dependence for both
a conformal gauge theory in weak and strong coupling limit and for (pure gluon)
QCD. The energy dependence can be used to extract the shear viscosity $\eta$ of
the medium since $\eta$ can be related to the transport parameter for thermal
partons in a transport description. We also derive upper bounds on the

sources at 18um in an area of 50.2 arcmin^2 in the AKARI/IRC monitor field

probable redshifts z>~ 0.5 are selected with a single colour cut (N2-N3>0.1)
for a detailed SED analysis with ground-based BVRi'z'JK data. Using an SED
radiative transfer model of starbursts covering the wavelength range UV --
submm, we derive photometric redshifts from the optical-MIR SEDs of
18um-selected galaxies. From the best-fit SED models, we show that the IRC
all-band photometry is capable of tracing the steep rise in flux at the blue
side of the PAH 6.2um emission feature. This indicates that the IRC all-band
photometry is useful to constrain the redshift of infrared galaxies,
specifically for dusty galaxies with a less prominent 4000A break. Also, we
find that the flux dip between the PAH 7.7 and 11.2um emission feature is
recognizable in the observed SEDs of galaxies at z~1. By using such a colour
anomaly due to the PAH and silicate absorption features, unique samples of
ULIRGs at z~1, `silicate-break' galaxies, can be constructed from large
cosmological surveys of AKARI towards the NEP, i.e. the NEP-Deep and NEP-Wide
survey. This pilot study suggests the possibility of detecting many interesting
galaxy properties in the NEP-Deep and Wide surveys, such as a systematic
difference in SEDs between high- and low-z ULIRGs, and a large variation of the
PAH inter-band strength ratio in galaxies at high redshifts. [abridged]

black hole is sometimes inferred from the X-ray spectral parameters of its
accretion disk; specifically, from the temperature and normalization of a
disk-blackbody model fit. Suitable corrections have to be introduced when the
accretion rate approaches or exceeds the Eddington limit. We summarize
phenomenological models that can explain the very high state, with apparently
higher disk temperatures and lower inner-disk radii. Conversely, ultraluminous
X-ray sources often contain cooler disks with large characteristic radii. We
introduce another phenomenological model for this accretion state. We argue
that a standard disk dominates the radiative output for radii larger than a
characteristic transition radius R_c ~ mdot x R_{ISCO}, where mdot is the
accretion rate in Eddington units and R_{ISCO} is the innermost stable orbit.
For R_{ISCO} < R < R_c, most of the accretion power is released via non-thermal
processes. We predict the location of such sources in a luminosity-temperature
plot. We conclude that black holes with masses ~ 50-100 Msun accreting at mdot

E 76, 021107 (2007)","10.1103/PhysRevE.76.021107",,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  The dynamic scaling properties of the one dimensional Burgers equation are
expected to change with the inclusion of additional conserved degrees of
freedom. We study this by means of 1-D driven lattice gas models that conserve
both mass and momentum. The most elementary version of this is the
Arndt-Heinzel-Rittenberg (AHR) process, which is usually presented as a two
species diffusion process, with particles of opposite charge hopping in
opposite directions and with a variable passing probability.
  From the hydrodynamics perspective this can be viewed as two coupled Burgers
equations, with the number of positive and negative momentum quanta
individually conserved. We determine the dynamic scaling dimension of the AHR
process from the time evolution of the two-point correlation functions, and
find numerically that the dynamic critical exponent is consistent with simple
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) type scaling. We establish that this is the result of
perfect screening of fluctuations in the stationary state. The two-point
correlations decay exponentially in our simulations and in such a manner that
in terms of quasi-particles, fluctuations fully screen each other at coarse
grained length scales. We prove this screening rigorously using the analytic
matrix product structure of the stationary state. The proof suggests the
existence of a topological invariant. The process remains in the KPZ
universality class but only in the sense of a factorization, as $({KPZ})^2$.

$\Lambda_b$ is composed of a heavy quark and a scalar light diquark. In the
present work, we apply this model to calculate $\mu_\pi^2$ for $\Lambda_b$, the
average kinetic energy of the heavy quark inside $\Lambda_{b}$. This quantity
is particularly interesting since it can be measured in experiments and since
it contributes to the inclusive semileptonic decays of $\Lambda_b$ when
contributions from higher order terms in $1/M_b$ expansions are taken into
account and consequently influences the determination of the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements $V_{ub}$ and $V_{cb}$. We find that
$\mu_\pi^2$ for $\Lambda_b$ is $0.25GeV^2$ $\sim$ $0.95GeV^2$, depending on the
parameters in the model including the light diquark mass and the interaction
strength between the heavy quark and the light diquark in the kernel of the BS
equation. We also find that this result is consistent with the value of
$\mu_\pi^2$ for $\Lambda_b$ which is derived from the experimental value of
$\mu_\pi^2$ for the $B$ meson with the aid of the heavy quark effective theory.

resonance (NMR) experiments in the k-(ET)2X family of organic charge transfer
salts by using the phenomenological spin fluctuation model of Moriya, and
Millis, Monien and Pines (M-MMP). For temperatures above T_nmr ~ 50 K, the
model gives a good quantitative description of the data in the metallic phases
of several k-(ET)2X materials. These materials display antiferromagnetic
correlation lengths which increase with decreasing temperature and grow to
several lattice constants by T_nmr. It is shown that the fact that the
dimensionless Korringa ratio is much larger than unity is inconsistent with a
broad class of theoretical models (such as dynamical mean-field theory) which
neglects spatial correlations and/or vertex corrections. For materials close to
the Mott insulating phase the nuclear spin relaxation rate, the Knight shift
and the Korringa ratio all decrease significantly with decreasing temperature
below T_nmr. This cannot be described by the M-MMP model and the most natural
explanation is that a pseudogap, similar to that observed in the underdoped
cuprate superconductors, opens up in the density of states below T_nmr. Such a
pseudogap has recently been predicted to occur in the dimerised organic charge
transfer salts materials by the resonating valence bond (RVB) theory. We
propose specific new experiments on organic superconductors to elucidate these
issues. For example, measurements to see if high magnetic fields or high

adequate description also in the region of small {\em strictly positive} values
of $\beta>0$. This hypothesis is tested in the present paper on a
two-dimensional Coulomb gas of pointlike $+/-$ unit charges interacting via a
logarithmic potential which is equivalent to an integrable sine-Gordon field
model. In particular, we apply a form factor method to obtain the exact
asymptotic large-distance behavior of particle correlation functions,
considered in the charge and number density combinations. We first determine
the general forms of the leading and subleading asymptotic terms at strictly
positive $\beta>0$ and then evaluate their high-temperature $\beta\to 0$ forms.
In the case of the {\em charge} correlation function, the leading asymptotic
term at a strictly positive $\beta>0$ is also the leading one in the
high-temperature $\beta\to 0$ regime. On the contrary, the $\beta\to 0$
behavior of the {\em number density} correlation function is accompanied by an
interference between the first two asymptotic terms. Consequently, the
large-distance behavior of this function exhibits a discontinuity when going
from strictly positive values of $\beta>0$ to the Debye-H\""uckel limit
$\beta\to 0$. This is the crucial conclusion of the paper: the large-distance
asymptotics and the high-temperature limit do not commute for the density
correlation function of the two-dimensional Coulomb gas.

experiments have been conducted in a rotating sphere filled with liquid sodium,
with an imposed dipolar magnetic field (the DTS setup). The field is produced
by a permanent magnet enclosed in an inner sphere, which can rotate at a
separate rate, producing a spherical Couette flow. The flow properties are
investigated by measuring electric potentials on the outer sphere, the induced
magnetic field in the laboratory frame, and velocity profiles inside the liquid
sodium using ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry. The present article focuses on the
time-averaged axisymmetric part of the flow. The Doppler profiles show that the
angular velocity of the fluid is relatively uniform in most of the fluid shell,
but rises near the inner sphere, revealing the presence of a magnetic wind, and
gently drops towards the outer sphere. The transition from a magnetostrophic
flow near the inner sphere to a geostrophic flow near the outer sphere is
controlled by the local Elsasser number. For Rossby numbers up to order 1, the
observed velocity profiles all show a similar shape. Numerical simulations in
the linear regime are computed, and synthetic velocity profiles are compared
with the measured ones. In the geostrophic region, a torque-balance model
provides very good predictions. We find that the induced magnetic field varies
in a consistent fashion, and displays a peculiar peak in the counter-rotating
regime. This happens when the fluid rotation rate is almost equal and opposite
to the outer sphere rotation rate. The fluid is then almost at rest in the
laboratory frame, and the Proudman-Taylor constraint vanishes, enabling a
strong meridional flow. We suggest that dynamo action might be favored in such
a situation.

long-range tail of the Coulomb potential gives rise to the Stillinger-Lovett
sum rules for the charge correlation functions. For the jellium model of mobile
particles of charge $q$ immersed in a neutralizing background, the fixing of
one of the $q$-charges induces a screening cloud of the charge density whose
zeroth and second moments are determined just by the Stillinger-Lovett sum
rules. In this paper, we generalize these sum rules to the screening cloud
induced around a pointlike guest charge $Z q$ immersed in the bulk interior of
the 2D jellium with the coupling constant $\Gamma=\beta q^2$ ($\beta$ is the
inverse temperature), in the whole region of the thermodynamic stability of the
guest charge $Z>-2/\Gamma$. The derivation is based on a mapping technique of
the 2D jellium at the coupling $\Gamma$ = (even positive integer) onto a
discrete 1D anticommuting-field theory; we assume that the final results remain
valid for all real values of $\Gamma$ corresponding to the fluid regime. The
generalized sum rules reproduce for arbitrary coupling $\Gamma$ the standard
Z=1 and the trivial Z=0 results. They are also checked in the Debye-H\""uckel
limit $\Gamma\to 0$ and at the free-fermion point $\Gamma=2$. The generalized
second-moment sum rule provides some exact information about possible sign

frequencies. At 1.4 GHz and 610 MHz it appears to have two distinct lobes. We
also did optical spectroscopy of the galaxy nucleus; the spectrum did not show
any strong emission lines associated with AGN activity but the presence of a
weak AGN cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, comparison of the H$\alpha$ flux and
radio continuum at 1.4 GHz suggests that a significant fraction of the emission
is non-thermal in nature. Hence we conclude that a weak or hidden AGN may be
present in PGC 045080. The extended radio emission represents lobes/jets from

activity. We also mapped the HI gas disk and velocity field in PGC 045080. The

the removal of outliers. We draw attention to the dependence of the results on

to integrate data mining methods within the framework of traditional database

equations yield transient solutions, lasting for long time intervals, during
which the length of deviation vectors of nearby orbits grows in time almost as
a power-law. The associated power exponent can be simply related to the
entropic exponent for which the q-entropy exhibits a constant rate of increase.
This analysis leads to the definition of a new sensitive indicator
distinguishing regular from weakly chaotic orbits, that we call `Average Power

orientated holes are optically created in the lowest orbital state of each dot

measured as a function of external magnetic field and lattice temperature. We
show that hole spin relaxation can occur over remarkably long timescales in
strongly confined quantum dots (up to ~270 us), as predicted by recent theory.
Our findings are supported by calculations that reproduce both the observed

  Methods: A radiative transfer model, including scattering, have been used to
decompose each image into a stellar disk, a bulge, and a dust disk. The
parameters describing the distributions have been obtained through standard X^2
minimization techniques.
  Results: The dust disks fitted to the V-band images are consistent with
previous work in literature: the radial scalelength of dust is larger than that
for stars (h_d/h_s ~ 1.5); the dust disk has a smaller vertical scalelength
than the stellar (z_d/z_s ~ 1/3); the dust disk is almost transparent when seen
face-on (central, face-on, optical depth tau_0 =0.5-1.5). Faster radiative
transfer models which neglect scattering can produce equivalent fits, with
changes in the derived parameters within the accuracy of full fits including
scattering. In the K'-band, no trace is found of a second, massive, dust disk

sphere packings in high Euclidean dimensions is one of the most fascinating and
challenging problems in discrete geometry. One century ago, Minkowski obtained
a rigorous lower bound that is controlled asymptotically by $1/2^d$, where $d$
is the Euclidean space dimension. An indication of the difficulty of the
problem can be garnered from the fact that exponential improvement of
Minkowski's bound has proved to be elusive, even though existing upper bounds
suggest that such improvement should be possible. Using a
statistical-mechanical procedure to optimize the density associated with a
""test"" pair correlation function and a conjecture concerning the existence of
disordered sphere packings [S. Torquato and F. H. Stillinger, Experimental
Math. {\bf 15}, 307 (2006)], the putative exponential improvement was found
with an asymptotic behavior controlled by $1/2^{(0.77865...)d}$. Using the same
methods, we investigate whether this exponential improvement can be further
improved by exploring other test pair correlation functions correponding to
disordered packings. We demonstrate that there are simpler test functions that
lead to the same asymptotic result. More importantly, we show that there is a
wide class of test functions that lead to precisely the same exponential
improvement and therefore the asymptotic form $1/2^{(0.77865...)d}$ is much
more general than previously surmised.

limit. There we have addressed the issue of conformal invariance imposing the
theory to be finite and we have found that finiteness requires reality of the

look for a theory that in the planar limit has vanishing beta functions. We
perform explicit calculations up to five loop order: we find that the
conditions of beta function vanishing can be achieved with a complex
deformation parameter, but the theory is not finite and the result depends on
the arbitrary choice of the subtraction procedure. Therefore, while the
finiteness condition leads to a scheme independent result, so that the
conformal invariant theory with a real deformation is physically well defined,
the condition of vanishing beta function leads to a result which is scheme
dependent and therefore of unclear significance. In order to show that these
findings are not an artefact of dimensional regularization, we confirm our
results within the differential renormalization approach.

of elliptic equations (O(N)), which means that effort is proportional to the
number of points at which the solution is evaluated). Thus this is an ideal
method to solve the initial data/constraint equations in General Relativity for
(for instance) black hole interactions, or for other strong-field gravitational
configurations. Recent efforts have produced finite difference multigrid
solvers for domains with holes (excised regions). We present here the extension
of these concepts to higher order (fourth-, sixth- and eigth-order). The high
order convergence allows rapid solution on relatively small computational
grids. Also, general relativity evolution codes are moving to typically
fourth-order; data have to be computed at least as accurately as this same
order for straightfoward demonstration of the proper order of convergence in
the evolution.
  Our vertex-centered multigrid code demonstrates globally high-order-accurate
solutions of elliptic equations over domains containing holes, in two spatial
dimensions with fixed (Dirichlet) outer boundary conditions, and in three
spatial dimensions with {\it Robin} outer boundary conditions. We demonstrate a
``real world'' 3-dimensional problem which is the solution of the conformally
flat Hamiltonian constraint of General Relativity. The success of this method
depends on: a) the choice of the discretization near the holes; b) the
definition of the location of the inner boundary, which allows resolution of
the hole even on the coarsest grids; and on maintaining the same order of
convergence at the boundaries as in the interior of the computational domain.

measured by standard deviations. Most of the DDG values are nearly zero (about
32% of the DDG data set ranges from -0.5 to 0.5 Kcal/mol) and both the value
and sign of DDG may be either positive or negative for the same mutation

spectroscopy showed that all 18 objects we observed have large equivalent
widths (EWs) exceeding 100 A. For about 30% of our sample (five objects), we
identified conspicuous asymmetry on the profiles of the Ly-alpha line. They
show broad wing emission components on the red side, and sharp cut-off on the
blue side of the Ly-alpha line. Such asymmetry is often seen in superwind
galaxies known to date, and also consistent with a theoretical prediction of
superwind activity. There are eight objects (8/18 ~ 40%) that have large EWs
exceeding 200 A, and no clear signature of superwind activities. Such large EWs
cannot be explained in terms of photo-ionization by a moderately old (>10^7
yrs) stellar population, even with a top-heavy IMF or an extremely low
metallicity. These eight objects clearly show a positive correlation between
the Ly-alpha luminosity and the velocity width. This suggests that these eight
objects are good candidates for forming-galaxies in a gas-cooling phase.

performed Monte Carlo studies of Drell-Yan pair production of doubly charged
Higgs boson \Phi^{++} followed by its leptonic decays which branching ratios
are fixed from the neutrino oscillation data. We propose appropriate selection
rules for the four-lepton signal, including reconstructed taus, which are
optimized for the discovery of \Phi^{++} with the lowest LHC luminosity. As the
Standard Model background can be effectively eliminated, an important aspect of
our study is the correct statistical treatment of the LHC discovery potential.
Adding detection efficiencies and measurement errors to the Monte Carlo
analyses, \Phi^{++} can be discovered up to the mass 250 GeV in the first year
of LHC, and 700 GeV mass is reachable for the integrated luminosity L=30
fb^{-1}.

they are expected to be the dominant population of extragalactic sources in the
hard X-ray and gamma-ray bands and have been shown to be the largest
contaminant of CMB fluctuation maps. So far the number of known blazars is of
the order of several hundreds, but the forthcoming AGILE, GLAST and Planck
space observatories will detect several thousand of objects of this type. Aims.
In preparation for these missions it is necessary to identify new samples of
blazars to study their multi-frequency characteristics and statistical
properties. Methods. We compiled a sample of objects with blazar-like
properties via a cross-correlation between large radio (NVSS, ATCAPMN) and X-
ray surveys (RASS) using the SDSS-DR4 and 2dF survey data to spectroscopically
identify our candidates and test the validity of the selection method. Results.
We present the Radio - Optical - X-ray catalog built at ASDC (ROXA), a list of
816 objects among which 510 are confirmed blazars. Only 19% of the candidates
turned out to be certainly non-blazars demonstrating the high efficiency of our
selection method. Conclusions. Our catalog includes 173 new blazar
identifications, or about 10% of all presently known blazars. The relatively
high flux threshold in the X-ray energy band (given by the RASS survey)
preferentially selects objects with high fx / fr ratio leading to the discovery
of new High Energy Peaked BL Lac (HBLs). Our catalog therefore includes many
new potential targets for GeV-TeV observations.

the gauge bosons of theories with an extended strong interaction sector such as
axigluons or flavour universal colorons. Such constraints are found to be
competitive with those obtained from the dijet data. The current $t \bar t$
data from the Tevatron rule out axigluon masses ($m_A$) up to 900 GeV and 850
GeV at 2 $\sigma$ and 4 $\sigma$ levels respectively. For the case of flavour
universal colorons the data rule out a mass ($m_C$) below 800 GeV (780 GeV) at
the $2 (4) \sigma $ level and also the mass range between 900 GeV to 2.1 TeV at
2 $\sigma$ level, for $\cot \xi = 1$, where $\xi$ is the mixing angle. For
$\cot \xi =2$ on the other hand, the excluded range is $m_C \lsim 950 (920)$
GeV and $m_C \gsim 1.02 (1.15 \lsim m_C \lsim 1.8)$ TeV at $2 \sigma$ ($4
\sigma $) level. We point out that for higher axigluon/coloron masses, even for
the dijet channel, the limits on the coloron mass, for $\cot \xi = 1$, may be
different than those for the axigluon. We also compute the expected
forward-backward asymmetry for the case of the axigluons which would allow it
to be discriminated against the SM as also the colorons. We further find that
at the LHC, the signal should be visible in the $t \bar t$ invariant mass
spectrum for a wide range of axigluon and coloron masses that are still
allowed. We point out how top polarisation may be used to further discriminate
the axigluon and coloron case from the SM as well as from each other.

are compared to the predictions of the zero range Bethe-Peierls model in
continuous space, where the interaction is replaced by contact conditions. The
numerical computation, combined with analytical arguments, shows the absence of
negative energy solution, and a rapid convergence of the lattice model towards
the Bethe-Peierls model for a vanishing lattice period. This establishes for
this system the universality of the zero interaction range limit.
