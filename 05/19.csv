on the temperature and ionisation structure of HII regions, via the
construction of 3D photoionisation models using the 3D Monte Carlo
photoionisation code MOCASSIN. We find that the true temperature fluctuations
due to the stellar distribution (as opposed to the large-scale temperature
gradients due to other gas properties) are small in all cases and not a
significant cause of error in metallicity studies. Strong emission lines from
HII regions are often used to study the metallicity of star-forming regions. We
compare integrated emission line spectra from our models and quantify any
systematic errors caused by the simplifying assumption of a single, central
location for all ionising sources. We find that the dependence of the
metallicity indicators on the ionisation parameter causes a clear bias, due to
the fact that models with a fully distributed configuration of stars always
display lower ionisation parameters than their fully concentrated counterparts.
The errors found imply that the geometrical distribution of ionisation sources

for a long time to trap charged particles in source-free regions. It has been
argued that the motion of a particle in such a potential can be approximately
described by a time independent effective potential, which does not depend upon
the initial phase of the oscillating potential. However, here we show that the
motion of a particle and its trapping condition significantly depend upon this
initial phase for arbitrarily high frequencies of the potential's oscillation.
We explain this novel phenomenon by showing that the motion of a particle is
determined by the effective potential stated in the literature only if its
initial conditions are transformed according to a transformation which we show
to significantly depend on the potential's initial phase for arbitrarily high
frequencies. We confirm our theoretical findings by numerical simulations.
Further, we demonstrate that the found phenomenon offers new ways to manipulate

  Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters",,"10.1086/519791",,"astro-ph",,"  We report depolarization of extragalactic sources in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey
(NVSS) by local structures in the interstellar medium. The sky density of
polarized sources drops by a factor 2 - 4 in regions with angular scales
approx. 10 degrees, implying up to 40% depolarization on average per source.
Some of these polarization shadows are associated with HII regions, but three
are associated with regions of depolarized diffuse Galactic emission. The
absence of a correlation between the depth of polarization shadows and H-alpha
intensity suggests that some shadows are related to structure in the magnetic
field. At least some polarization shadows are caused by partial bandwidth
depolarization in the NVSS. Alternatively, some may be caused by regions with
small scale (< 1 arcsec) variations in rotation measure.

central role in organometallic chemistry, these compounds represent a
paradigmatic case where LDA, GGA, and common hybrid functionals fail to
reproduce the experimental magnetic splittings. In particular, the imidazole
pentacoordinated heme is incorrectly described as a triplet by all usual DFT
flavors. In this study we show that a U parameter close to 4 eV leads to spin
transitions and molecular geometries in quantitative agreement with
experiments, and that DFT+U represents an appealing tool in the description of
iron porphyrin complexes, at a much reduced cost compared to correlated
quantum-chemistry methods. The possibility of obtaining the U parameter from
first-principles is explored through a self-consistent linear-response

  Evolution in Collisional Nuclei","21 pages",,"10.1086/522691",,"astro-ph",,"  [Abridged] In galactic nuclei with sufficiently short relaxation times,
binary supermassive black holes can evolve beyond their stalling radii via
continued interaction with stars. We study this ""collisional"" evolutionary
regime using both fully self-consistent N-body integrations and approximate
Fokker-Planck models. The N-body integrations employ particle numbers up to
0.26M and a direct-summation potential solver; close interactions involving the
binary are treated using a new implementation of the Mikkola-Aarseth chain
regularization algorithm. Even at these large values of N, two-body scattering
occurs at high enough rates in the simulations that they can not be simply
scaled to the large-N regime of real galaxies. The Fokker-Planck model is used
to bridge this gap; it includes, for the first time, binary-induced changes in
the stellar density and potential. The Fokker-Planck model is shown to
accurately reproduce the results of the N-body integrations, and is then
extended to the much larger N regime of real galaxies. Analytic expressions are
derived that accurately reproduce the time dependence of the binary semi-major
axis as predicted by the Fokker-Planck model. Gravitational wave coalescence is
shown to occur in <10 Gyr in nuclei with velocity dispersions below about 80
km/s. Formation of a core results from a competition between ejection of stars
by the binary and re-supply of depleted orbits via two-body scattering. Mass
deficits as large as ~4 times the binary mass are produced before coalescence.
After the two black holes coalesce, a Bahcall-Wolf cusp appears around the
single hole in one relaxation time, resulting in a nuclear density profile
consisting of a flat core with an inner, compact cluster, similar to what is
observed at the centers of low-luminosity spheroids.

to ``prepare'' the photon, long after it has escaped, in either of two
complementary states. Consistency requires that the corresponding box
measurements be complementary as well. At first sight it seems, however, that
these measurements can be jointly performed with arbitrary precision: they
pertain to different systems (the center of mass of the box and an internal
clock, respectively). But this is deceptive. As we show by explicit
calculation, although the relevant quantities are simultaneously measurable,
they develop non-vanishing commutators when calculated back to the time of
escape of the photon. This justifies Bohr's qualitative arguments in a precise
way; and it illustrates how the details of the dynamics conspire to guarantee
the requirements of complementarity. In addition, our calculations exhibit a
``fine structure'' in the distribution of the uncertainties over the
complementary quantities: depending on \textit{when} the box measurement is
performed, the resulting quantum description of the photon differs. This brings

EPR-experiment: by performing suitable measurements on the box it is possible
to ``prepare'' the photon, long after it has escaped, in either of two
complementary states. Consistency requires that the corresponding box
measurements be complementary as well. At first sight it seems, however, that
these measurements can be jointly performed with arbitrary precision: they
pertain to different systems (the center of mass of the box and an internal
clock, respectively). But this is deceptive. As we show by explicit
calculation, although the relevant quantities are simultaneously measurable,
they develop non-vanishing commutators when calculated back to the time of
escape of the photon. This justifies Bohr's qualitative arguments in a precise
way; and it illustrates how the details of the dynamics conspire to guarantee
the requirements of complementarity. In addition, our calculations exhibit a
``fine structure'' in the distribution of the uncertainties over the
complementary quantities: depending on when the box measurement is performed,
the resulting quantum description of the photon differs. This brings us close
to the argumentation of the later EPR thought experiment.

earlier [B.L. Hu, J.P. Paz, Y. Zhang, Phys. Rev. D 45, 2843 (1992)] with
coefficients obtained from solutions of integro-differential equations can
assume closed functional forms for a fairly general class of spectral densities
of the environment at arbitrary temperature and coupling strength. As an
illustration of these new results we solve the corresponding master equation
and calculate, among other physical quantities, the uncertainty function whose
late time behavior can be obtained fully. This produces a formula for
investigating the standard quantum limit which is central to addressing many
theoretical issues in macroscopic quantum phenomena and experimental concerns
related to low temperature precision measurements. We find that any initial
state always settles down to a Gaussian density matrix whose covariance is
determined by the thermal reservoir and whose mean is determined by the
external force. For more general spectra we show that the solution of the
master equation can be reduced to solving for the motion of a classical
parametric oscillator with parametric frequency determined by the unsolved for

is parametrically similar to the simpler evolution explicitly determined for in

report a comparative X-ray emission and absorption study of diffuse hot gas
along the sight lines toward 3C 273 and Mrk 421, on and off the enhancement,
but at similar Galactic latitudes. The diffuse 3/4-keV emission intensity, as
estimated from the ROSAT All Sky Survey, is about three times higher toward 3C

these two AGNs, we detect X-ray absorption lines (e.g., OVII Kalpha, Kbeta, and
OVIII Kalpha transitions at z~0) and find that the mean hot gas thermal and
kinematic properties along the two sight lines are significantly different. By
subtracting the foreground and background contribution, as determined along the

generalize the method to incorporate multiple independent variables,
non-detections, and selection effects (e.g., Malmquist bias). A Gibbs sampler
is described for simulating random draws from the probability distribution of
the parameters, given the observed data. I use simulation to compare the method

mixture model outperforms other common estimators and can effectively give

a discrete energy level coincides with its energy, in the magnetic field a
potential barrier is a constant in the direction of tunneling. Along the
tunneling path the certain regions are formed, where, in the classical
language, the kinetic energy of the motion perpendicular to tunneling is
negative. These regions play a role of potential wells, where a discrete energy

scenario, we analyse the continuum, line and dust spectra by means of SUMA, a

the coupled effect of ionization from an external radiation source and shocks.
We find that the UV lines are emitted from high density gas between the stars
downstream of the reverse shock, while the optical lines are emitted downstream
of the shock propagating outwards the system. As regards with the continuum
SED, three shells are identified in the IR, at 850K, 320 K and 200 K with radii
r = 2.8 10^13 cm, 4 10^14$ cm, and 10^15 cm, respectively, adopting a distance
to Earth d=2.3 kpc: interestingly, all these shells appear to be circumbinary.
The analysis of the unexploited ISO-SWS spectrum reveals that both PAHs and
crystalline silicates coexist in HD330036, with PAHs associated to the internal
shell at 850 K, and crystalline silicates stored into the cool shells at 320 K
and 200 K. Strong evidence that crystalline silicates are shaped in a disk-like
structure is derived on the basis of the relative band strengths. Finally, we
suggest that shocks can be a reliable mechanism in activating the annealing and
the consequent crystallization processes. We show that a consistent
interpretation of gas and dust spectra emitted by SS can be obtained by models
which accounts for the coupled effect of the photoionizing flux and of shocks.

the different slopes of the radio profile and the turnover frequency, as well

connected to the characteristics of the single pulse and may give rise to
strong instabilities (the Floquet exponent being proportional to the network
size). Finally, as a side result, we find that the splay state can be stable
even for inhibitory coupling.

constants of InN epilayers grown on c-plane sapphire substrates under various
conditions by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy we find that the films are under

higher energy. The effect is significant, and may be responsible for some of
the variations in InN bandgap reported in the literature.

flux/current to limited scale self-affine random fractals is presented and
compared with experimentally measured electrochemical current for such
roughness. The theory explains the several experimental findings of the
temporal scale invariance as well as deviation from this of current transients
in terms of three dominant fractal parameters for the limited-length scales of
roughness. This theoretical method is based on limited scale power-law
characterization of the interfacial roughness spectrum and the solution of
diffusion equation under the diffusion-limited boundary conditions on rough
interfaces. More broadly, these calculations challenges the earlier belief that
the anomalous behavior is solely dependent on fractal dimension of roughness
and highlight the potential to apply this equation for the scale invariant
roughness determination. Finally, the validity of theoretical result is tested
with extensive experimental data.

invariant imbedding in the continuum limit, and the resulting transport
equation is found to correspond exactly to the Lloyd model. The latter has been
a subject of much interest in recent years. This conversion of the random phase
into the random Cauchy potential is a notable feature of our work. It is
further argued that our phase-randomizing reservoir, as distinct from the well
known phase-breaking reservoirs, induces no decoherence, but essentially
destroys all interference effects other than the coherent back scattering.

quantum electromagnetic fluctuations produced by elementary charge carriers in
external electric field. It is suggested that deviations of the frequency
exponent \gamma from unity, observed in thin metal films, can be attributed to
quantum backreaction of the conducting medium on the fluctuating field of the
charge carrier. This backreaction is described phenomenologically in terms of
the effective momentum space dimensionality, D. Using the dimensional
continuation technique, it is shown that the combined action of the photon heat
bath and external field results in a 1/f^gamma-contribution to the spectral
density of the two-point correlation function of electromagnetic field. The
frequency exponent is found to be equal to 1 + delta, where delta = 3 - D is a
reduction of the momentum space dimensionality. This result is applied to the
case of a biased conducting sample, and a general expression for the voltage
power spectrum is obtained which possesses all characteristic properties of
observed flicker noise spectra. The range of validity of this expression covers
well the whole measured frequency band. Gauge independence of the power
spectrum is proved. It is shown that the obtained results naturally resolve the
problem of divergence of the total noise power. A detailed comparison with the
experimental data on flicker noise measurements in metal films is given.

description of the requested flow as well as already admitted flows. Since
802.11 WLAN capacity is shared between flows belonging to all stations,
admission control requires knowledge of all flows in the WLAN. Further,
estimation of the load-dependent WLAN capacity through analytical model
requires inputs about channel data rate, payload size and the number of
stations. These factors combined point to a centralized admission control
whereas for 802.11 DCF it is ideally performed in a distributed manner. The use
of measurements from the channel avoids explicit inputs about the state of the
channel described above. BUFFET, a model based measurement-assisted distributed
admission control scheme for DCF proposed in this paper relies on measurements
to derive model inputs and predict WLAN saturation, thereby maintaining average

BUFFET is able to ensure average delay under 7ms at a near-optimal throughput.

first (n-1) standard generators of the group act by (-q)-multiplication, while
the last one acts by (-t)-multiplication. The proof uses some technical results

some well-known inclusions: we obtain the rational cohomology of the Artin
group of affine type \tilde{A}_{n} as well as the cohomology of the classical
