behaviour of the error between appropriately smooth functions and their
interpolants, as the interpolation points fill out a bounded domain in R^d. In
all of these cases, the analysis takes place in a natural function space
dictated by the choice of radial basis function - the native space. In many
cases, the native space contains functions possessing a certain amount of
smoothness. We address the question of what can be said about these error
estimates when the function being interpolated fails to have the required
smoothness. These are the rough functions of the title. We limit our discussion
to surface splines, as an exemplar of a wider class of radial basis functions,
because we feel our techniques are most easily seen and understood in this

stars and extrasolar planets shrank by 1-2 orders of magnitude after formation:
(i) the physical radius of a star shrinks by a large factor from birth to the
main sequence, yet many main-sequence stars have companions orbiting only a few
stellar radii away, and (ii) in current theories of planet formation, the
region within ~0.1 AU of a protostar is too hot and rarefied for a Jupiter-mass
planet to form, yet many ""hot Jupiters"" are observed at such distances. We
investigate orbital shrinkage by the combined effects of secular perturbations
from a distant companion star (Kozai oscillations) and tidal friction. We
integrate the relevant equations of motion to predict the distribution of
orbital elements produced by this process. Binary stars with orbital periods of
0.1 to 10 days, with a median of ~2 d, are produced from binaries with much
longer periods (10 d to 10^5 d), consistent with observations indicating that
most or all short-period binaries have distant companions (tertiaries). We also
make two new testable predictions: (1) For periods between 3 and 10 d, the
distribution of the mutual inclination between the inner binary and the
tertiary orbit should peak strongly near 40 deg and 140 deg. (2) Extrasolar
planets whose host stars have a distant binary companion may also undergo this
process, in which case the orbit of the resulting hot Jupiter will typically be
misaligned with the equator of its host star.

associate an entropy related to the number of underlying microstates. We find a

We see that this entropy function is zero for the original microstate
geometries and maximized for a certain ``typical state'' geometry, which we
argue is the gravity dual to the zero-temperature limit of the thermal state of
the corresponding field theory. Finally, we note that the coarse-grained

a number of observations for local and high-z galaxies, without changing the
original model parameters but introducing a physically-motivated modelling to
describe the escape fraction of Lya photons from host galaxies (f_esc). Though
a previous study using a hierarchical clustering model simply assumed a
constant and universal value of f_esc, we incorporate two new effects on f_esc:
extinction by interstellar dust and galaxy-scale outflow induced as a star
formation feedback. It is found that the new model nicely reproduces all the
observed Lya LFs of the Lya emitters (LAEs) at different redshifts in z ~ 3-6.
Especially, the rather surprisingly small evolution of the observed LAE Lya LFs
compared with the dark halo mass function is naturally reproduced. Our model
predicts that galaxies with strong outflows and f_esc ~ 1 are dominant in the
observed LFs. This is also consistent with available observations, while the
simple universal f_esc model requires f_esc << 1 not to overproduce the
brightest LAEs. On the other hand, we found that our model significantly
overpredicts LAEs at z > 6, and absorption of Lya photons by neutral hydrogen
in intergalactic medium (IGM) is a reasonable interpretation for the
discrepancy. This indicates that the IGM neutral fraction x_HI rapidly evolves
from x_HI << 1 at z < 6 to a value of order unity at z ~ 6-7, which is broadly
consistent with other observational constraints on the reionization history.

consistency of the particle approximation can be enforced. RBFs further appeal
as they allow one to dispense with the smoothing-length -- the parameter in the
SPH method which governs the number of particles within the support of the
shape function. Currently, only ad hoc methods for choosing the
smoothing-length exist. We ensure that any enhancement retains the conservative

evolution of the nova remnant can be explained by the diffusive shock
acceleration of particles at the blast wave and the subsequent escape of the
highest energy ions from the shock region. Nonlinear particle acceleration can
also account for the difference of shock velocities deduced from the IR and
X-ray data. The maximum energy that accelerated electrons and protons can have
achieved in few days after outburst is found to be as high as a few TeV. Using
the semi-analytic model of nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration developed by

to chemical/physical sub-grouping of amino acids . Amino acids (aa) are divided
into sub-groups with successive derivations, that result in a clustering based
on the considered property. The properties can be user defined or chosen
between default schemes, like those used in the analysis described here.
Starting from an initial set of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, they
are successively divided on the basis of their polarity/hydrophobic index, with
increasing resolution up to four level of subdivision. Other schemes of
subdivision are possible: in this thesis work it was employed also a scheme
based on physical/structural properties (solvent exposure, lateral chain
mobility and secondary structure tendency), that have been compared to the
chemical scheme with testing purposes. In the method described in this chapter,
the total score for each position in the alignment accounts for different
degree of similarity between amino acids. The scoring value result form the
contribution of each level of selectivity for every individual property
considered. Simply the method (called M_Al) analyse the n sequence alignment
position per position and assigns a score which have contributes by aa identity
plus a composed valuation of the chemical or of the structural affinity between
the n aligned amino acids. This method has been implemented in a series of
programs written in python language; these programs have been tested in some
biological cases, with benchmark purposes.

couples the Sun to the Heliosphere. Although the details of this coupling
depend on the quantitative properties of the field, many important aspects of
the corona - solar wind connection can be understood by considering only the
general topological properties of those regions on the Sun where the field
extends from the photosphere out to interplanetary space, the so-called open
field regions that are usually observed as coronal holes. From the simple
assumptions that underlie the standard quasi-steady corona-wind theoretical
models, and that are likely to hold for the Sun, as well, we derive two
conjectures on the possible structure and dynamics of coronal holes: (1)
Coronal holes are unique in that every unipolar region on the photosphere can
contain at most one coronal hole. (2) Coronal holes of nested polarity regions
must themselves be nested. Magnetic reconnection plays the central role in
enforcing these constraints on the field topology. From these conjectures we
derive additional properties for the topology of open field regions, and
propose several observational predictions for both the slowly varying and
transient corona/solar wind.

of the first-order Fermi particle acceleration (Niemiec & Ostrowski 2006,
Niemiec et al. 2006). The models of the turbulent magnetic field near the shock
considered in these simulations include realistic features of the perturbed
magnetic field structures at the shock, which allow us to study all the field
and particle motion characteristics that are important for cosmic-ray
acceleration. Our results show that turbulent conditions near the shock, that
are consistent with the shock jump conditions, lead to substantial
modifications of the acceleration process with respect to the simplified
models, that produce wide-range power-law energy distributions, often with the
""universal"" spectral index. Relativistic shocks are essentially always
superluminal, and thus they preferentially generate steep particle spectra with
cutoffs well below the maximum scattering energy, often not exceeding the
energy of the compressed background plasma ions. Thus, cosmic-ray acceleration
to very high energies at relativistic shock waves is inefficient, and such
shocks are not expected to be the sources of ultra-high-energy particles.

Bell (2004, 2005) of a strong amplification of short-wavelength nonresonant
wave modes and at studying the subsequent evolution of the magnetic turbulence
and its backreaction on cosmic ray trajectories. The detailed knowledge of the
upstream turbulence properties is crucial to ascertain all aspects of the shock
acceleration process - the transport properties of cosmic rays, the shock
structure, thermal particle injection and heating processes. An amplification
of magnetic field would also facilitate the acceleration of particles beyond
the ""knee"" in the cosmic-ray spectrum. Our kinetic approach is particularly
suited to address the backreaction on the cosmic rays, and it allows us to test
Bell's prediction of the eventual formation of extended filamentary structure
in the cosmic-ray distribution and also to arrive at a reliable estimate of the
total saturation magnetic-field level. The parameters chosen for the
simulations are favorable for the rapid excitation of purely growing modes. We
confirm the generation of the turbulent magnetic field due to the drift of
cosmic-ray ions in the upstream plasma, but show that the growth rate of the
field perturbations is much slower than estimated using the MHD approach and
the amplitude of the turbulence saturates at about dB/B~1. The magnetic field
also remains below equipartition with the upstream plasma.

detonation and deflagration models have been used to explain the majority of
SNe Ia, they do not predict a long velocity plateau in the SiII minimum with an
unvarying line profile. Pulsating delayed detonations and merger scenarios form
shell-like density structures with properties mostly related to the mass of the
shell, M_shell, and we discuss how these models may explain the observed SiII
line evolution; however, these models are based on spherical calculations and
other possibilities may exist. SN 2005hj is consistent with respect to the
onset, duration, and velocity of the plateau, the peak luminosity and, within
the uncertainties, with the intrinsic colors for models with M_shell=0.2 M_sun.
Our analysis suggests a distinct class of events hidden within the

confirmed, they may provide a way to separate these two groups. We discuss the

behavior of the system close to coexistence upon the application of a periodic
signal of the form $\mu(t) = \mu_{coex} + \mu_{o}sin(2\Pi t/\tau) $, where
$\mu_{o}$ and $\tau$ are the amplitude and the period of the sweep,
respectively. For relatively short periods and small enough amplitudes the
system becomes trapped either at low or high Ag coverage states, as evidenced
by recording hysteresis loops. This scenario is identified as dynamically
ordered states (DOS), such that the relaxation time $(\tau_{relax})$ of the
corresponding metastable state obeys $\tau_{relax} > \tau $. On the other hand,
by properly increasing $\mu_{o}$ or/and $\tau$, one finds that the $Ag$
coverage gently follows the external drive (here $\tau_{relax} < \tau $) and
the system is said to enter into dynamically disordered states (DDS), where
hysteresis loops show almost symmetric limiting cycles. This symmetry breaking
between limiting cycles driven by an external signal is discussed in terms of
the concept of (out-of-equilibrium) Dynamic Phase Transitions between DOS and
DDS, similar to those encountered when a magnetic system is placed in the
presence of a variable external magnetic field. However, a careful finite-size
scaling study reveals that, at least at $T = 300K$, the $Ag/Au(100)$ system
does not exhibit true second-order phase transitions but rather a crossover
behavior between states. A diagram showing the location of the ordered and

competing magnetic fields ($h$) acting at opposite walls, is studied by means
of Monte Carlo simulations. Due to the presence of the fields, the film
undergoes a wetting transition at a well defined critical temperature $T_w(h)$.
In fact, the competing fields causes the occurrence of an interface between
magnetic domains of different orientation. For $T < T_w(h)$ ($T > T_w(h)$) such
interface is bounded (unbounded) to the walls, while right at $T_w(h)$ the
interface is essentially located at the center of the film.

considerably enhanced by the presence of the interface, which act as a
''catalyst'' of the damage causing an enhancement of the total damaged area.
The critical points for damage spreading are evaluated by extrapolation to the
thermodynamic limit using a finite-size scaling approach. Furthermore, the
wetting transition effectively shifts the location of the damage spreading
critical points, as compared with the well known critical temperature of the
order-disorder transition characteristic of the Ising model. Such a critical

all scales of mobility. Thus these breakdowns appear to be generalized
phenomena, in contrast with the view where only the most mobile molecules are
the origin of the breakdown of the SE and SED relations, embedded in an
inactive background where these relations hold. At low temperature, the SE and
SED relations in both subsets of molecules are replaced with ``fractional'' SE
and SED relations, $D_t\sim(\tau/T)^{-\xi_t}$ and $D_r\sim(\tau/T)^{-\xi_r}$
where $\xi_t\approx0.84<1$ and $\xi_r\approx0.75<1$. We also find that there is
a decoupling between rotational and translational motion, and that this
decoupling occurs in both fastest and slowest subsets of molecules. We also
find that when the decoupling increases, upon cooling, the probability of a
molecule being classified as both translationally and rotationally fastest also
increases. To study the effect of time scale for SE and SED breakdown and
decoupling, we introduce a time-dependent version of the SE and SED relations,
and a time-dependent function that measures the extent of decoupling. Our
results suggest that both the decoupling and SE and SED breakdowns are
originated at the time scale corresponding to the end of the cage regime, when
diffusion starts. This is also the time scale when the DH are more relevant.

Constant (LCDM) with an Open CDM (OCDM) model with the same matter density
Omega_m =0.3 and the same Hubble constant h=0.7. Already by the time the scale
factor increased by a factor of 6 (29 Gyr from now in LCDM; 78 Gyr from now in
OCDM) the comoving position of the Local Group is frozen. Well before that
epoch the two most massive members of the Local Group, the Milky Way and
Andromeda, will merge. However, as the expansion rates of the scale factor in
the two models are different, the Local Group will be receding in physical
coordinates from Virgo exponentially in a LCDM model and at a roughly constant
velocity in an OCDM model. More generally, in comoving coordinates the future
large scale structure will look like a sharpened image of the present
structure: the skeleton of the cosmic web will remain the same, but clusters
will be more `isolated' and the filaments will become thinner. This implies
that the long-term fate of large scale structure as seen in comoving
coordinates is determined primarily by the matter density. We conclude that
although the LCDM model is accelerating at present due to its Dark Energy
component while the OCDM model is non accelerating, their large scale structure
in the future will look very similar in comoving coordinates.

temporal and azimuthal variability of the Io plasma torus observed during the
Cassini encounter with Jupiter. Over a period of three months, the Cassini
Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) observed a dramatic variation in the
average torus composition. Superimposed on this long-term variation, is a
10.07-hour periodicity caused by an azimuthal variation in plasma composition
subcorotating relative to System III longitude. Quite surprisingly, the
amplitude of the azimuthal variation appears to be modulated at the beat
frequency between the System III period and the observed 10.07-hour period.
Previously, we have successfully modeled the months-long compositional change
by supposing a factor of three increase in the amount of material supplied to
Io's extended neutral clouds. Here, we extend our torus chemistry model to
include an azimuthal dimension. We postulate the existence of two azimuthal
variations in the number of super-thermal electrons in the torus: a primary
variation that subcorotates with a period of 10.07 hours and a secondary
variation that remains fixed in System III longitude. Using these two hot
electron variations, our model can reproduce the observed temporal and
azimuthal variations observed by Cassini UVIS.

medium in which to test the consistency of Single Stellar Population (SSP)
models as they should be our best analogue to a homogeneous (single) stellar
population. Here we present age, metallicity and $\alpha$-element abundance
measurements for 48 Galactic globular clusters (GCs) as determined from
integrated spectra using Lick indices and SSP models from Thomas, Maraston &
Korn, Lee & Worthey and Vazdekis et al. By comparing our new measurements to

derive consistent results -- a key requirement before application to
heterogeneous stellar populations like galaxies.

agreement for all models examined here, including a range of enhancement
methods. Ages and $\alpha$-element abundances are accurate for a subset of our
models, with the caveat that the range of these parameters in Galactic GCs is
limited. We are able to show that the application of published Lick index
response functions to models with fixed abundance ratios allows us to measure
reasonable $\alpha$-element abundances from a variety of models. We also
examine the age-metallicity and [$\alpha$/Fe]-metallicity relations predicted

of early structure formation is the cooling of primordial gas to allow for
small mass objects to form. As the neutral primordial gas is a poor radiator at
temperatures (T\le10^4\unit{K}), molecular hydrogen is needed for further
cooling down to temperatures (T\sim100\unit{K}). The formation of molecular
hydrogen is catalyzed by the presence of free electrons, which could be
provided by the ionization due to an early population of cosmic rays. In order
to investigate this possibility we developed a code to study the effects of
ionizing cosmic rays on the thermal and chemical evolution of primordial gas.
We found that cosmic rays can provide enough free electrons needed for the
formation of molecular hydrogen, and therefore can increase the cooling ability
of such primordial gas under following conditions: A dissociating photon flux
with (F<10^{-18}\unit{erg cm^{-2} Hz^{-1} s^{-1}}), initial temperature of the
gas (\sim10^{3}\unit{K}), total gas number densities (n\ge1\unit{cm^{-3}}),

rotational modulation of the X-ray emission, despite extensive searches. The
situation changed recently with XMM-Newton observations that uncovered 7 s

be reduced to solving a simple example like the STU model. For attractors with
D0-D4 brane charges, determining stability requires expanding the effective
potential to quartic order in the massless fields. We obtain the full set of
these terms. For attractors with D0-D6 brane charges, we find that there is a
moduli space of solutions and the resulting attractors are stable. Our analysis
is restricted to the two derivative action.

and apply it to data that are being expected from the CoRoT mission. Methods:
The procedure proposed for the detection of planetary transits in light curves
works in two steps: 1) a continuous wavelet transformation of the detrended
light curve with posterior selection of the optimum scale for transit
detection, and 2) a period search in that selected wavelet transformation. The
detrending of the light curves are based on Fourier filtering or a discrete
wavelet transformation. TRUFAS requires the presence of at least 3 transit
events in the data. Results: The proposed algorithm is shown to identify
reliably and quickly the transits that had been included in a standard set of
999 light curves that simulate CoRoT data. Variations in the pre-processing of
the light curves and in the selection of the scale of the wavelet transform
have only little effect on TRUFAS' results. Conclusions: TRUFAS is a robust and
quick transit detection algorithm, especially well suited for the analysis of
very large volumes of data from space or ground-based experiments, with long
enough durations for the target-planets to produce multiple transit events.

The original motivation to study finite covers is in the Ladder theorem of
Zilber which describes how totally categorical structures are built from
strictly minimal sets by a sequence of covers.
  Let W be a first-order structure and r be an Aut(W)-congruence on W. In this
paper we define the almost-free finite covers of W with respect to r, and we
show how to construct them. These are a generalization of free finite covers. A
consequence of a result of Evans and Hrushovski in the paper ""On the
automorphism groups of finite covers"" is that any finite cover of W with
binding groups all equal to a simple non-abelian permutation group is
almost-free with respect to some r on W. Our main result gives a description
(up to isomorphism) in terms of the Aut(W)-congruences on W of the kernels of
principal finite covers of W with bindings groups equal at any point to a
simple non-abelian regular permutation group G. Then we analyze almost-free
finite covers of the set of ordered n-tuples of distinct elements from a
countable set Omega, regarded as a structure with automorphism group equal to
the Sym(Omega) and we show a result of biinterpretability.

topic of current interest in applied mathematics. In fact, for non-selfadjoint
operators the resolvent could be very large outside the spectrum, making the
numerical computation of the complex eigenvalues very hard. This has
importance, for example, in quantum mechanics, random matrix theory and fluid
dynamics.
  The occurence of pseudospectra for non-selfadjoint semiclassical differential
operators is due to the existence of quasimodes, i.e., approximate local
solutions to the eigenvalue problem. For scalar operators, the quasimodes
appear since the bracket condition is not satisfied for topological reasons,
see the paper by Dencker, Sjostrand and Zworski in Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 57

  In this paper we shall investigate how these result can be generalized to
square systems of semiclassical differential operators of principal type. These
are the systems whose principal symbol vanishes of first order on its kernel.
We show that the resolvent blows up as in the scalar case, except in a nowhere
dense set of degenerate values. We also define quasi-symmetrizable systems and
systems of subelliptic type for which we prove estimates on the resolvent.

the extended SM gauge group $G_{SM}^{ex}=SU(2)_{L} \times U(1)_{Y} \times
SO(3)_{F}$. The group $SO(3)_{F}$ is treated as a chiral gauged flavour
symmetry. Electroweak-, flavour- and Higgs interactions are unified in one
single gauge group SU(7) which is broken again down to $G_{SM}^{ex}$ by
orbifolding and imposing additional boundary conditions. The compactification
scale is O(1) TeV. The orbifold $S^{1}/Z_{2}$ is put on a lattice. This setting
gives a staring point for RG-transformations. As a result the bulk is
integrated out and the extra dimension consist of only two points: the orbifold
fixed points. Parallel transporters (PT) in the extra dimension become
nonunitary as a result of the blockspin transformations. In addition, a Higgs
potential emerges naturally. The PTs can be written as a product $e^{A_{y}}
e^{\eta} e^{A_{y}}$ of unitary factors $e^{A_{y}}$ and a selfadjoint factor
$e^{\eta}$. The reduction $48 \to 35 + 6 + \bar{6} + 1$ of the adjoint reps of
SU(7) with respect to $SU(6) \supset G_{SM}^{ex}$ leads to three $SU(2)_{L}$
Higgs doublets: one for each flavour. Their zero modes serve as a substitute
for the SM Higgs. When $G_{SM}^{ex}$ is spontaneously broken down to
$U(1)_{em}$, an exponential gauge boson mass splitting occurs naturally. This
breaking leads to $SO(3)_{F}$ flavour gauge boson masses much above the
compactification scale. Thus tree-level FCNC are naturally suppressed. Making
some simplifying assumptions we also calculate fermion masses and CKM mixing
angles. As for the gauge bosons an exponential fermion mass splitting occurs
naturally. The model predicts a large Higgs sector consisting of 30 Higgs
particles and in its simplest form the weak mixing angle $\theta=0.125$.

interactions. Starting from the Klimontovich equation and using a quasilinear
theory, we obtain a general kinetic equation that can be applied to spatially
inhomogeneous systems and that takes into account memory effects. This equation
is valid at order 1/N in a proper thermodynamic limit and it coincides with the
kinetic equation obtained from the BBGKY hierarchy. For N tending to infinity,
it reduces to the Vlasov equation describing collisionless systems. We describe
the process of phase mixing and violent relaxation leading to the formation of
a quasi stationary state (QSS) on the coarse-grained scale. We interprete the
physical nature of the QSS in relation to Lynden-Bell's statistical theory and
discuss the problem of incomplete relaxation. In the second part of the paper,
we consider the relaxation of a test particle in a thermal bath. We derive a
Fokker-Planck equation by directly calculating the diffusion tensor and the
friction force from the Klimontovich equation. We give general expressions of
these quantities that are valid for possibly spatially inhomogeneous systems
with long correlation time. We show that the diffusion and friction terms have
a very similar structure given by a sort of generalized Kubo formula. We also
obtain non-markovian kinetic equations that can be relevant when the
auto-correlation function of the force decreases slowly with time. An interest
of our approach is to develop a formalism that remains in physical space
(instead of Fourier space) and that can deal with spatially inhomogeneous
systems.

that for an incident state that is not circularly polarized so that the two

nonzero Pancharatnam phase shift between them which depends on the incident
polarization state and on the solid angle subtended by the track of the

theory from the field of epidemiology to do this seems natural and appealing.
We will address the feasibility of such a prospect, first by considering some
basic measures used in epidemiology, then by pointing out the differences
between real world epidemics and virtual plagues. We also suggest directions
for MMOG developer control through epidemiological modeling. Our aim is
understanding the properties of virtual plagues, rather than trying to

perturbation equations with the integration of a suitable phase-function for a
complex valued radial coordinate, we reformulate the standard outgoing-wave
boundary condition as a zero Dirichlet condition. This has a number of
important advantages over previous strategies. The characteristic formulation
permits coordinate compactification, which means that we can impose the
boundary condition at future null infinity. The phase function avoids
oscillatory behaviour in the solution, and the use of a complex radial variable
allows a clean distinction between out- and ingoing waves. We demonstrate that
the method is easy to implement, and that it leads to high precision numerical
results. Finally, we argue that the method should generalise to the important
problem of rapidly rotating neutron star spacetimes.

studying interactions of galaxies with the cluster environment. Both the
high-velocity tidal interactions and effects of ram pressure stripping by the
intracluster gas can be investigated. Optical and/or \ion{H}{i} observations do
not always show effects of weak interactions between galaxies and their
encounters with the cluster medium. For this reason we searched for possible
anomalies in the magnetic field structure in Virgo Cluster spirals which could
be attributed to perturbations in their gas distribution and kinematics. Five
angularly large Virgo Cluster spiral galaxies (NGC 4501, NGC 4438, NGC 4535,
NGC 4548 and NGC 4654) were the targets for a sensitive total power and
polarization study using the 100-m radio telescope in Effelsberg at 4.85 GHz.
For two objects polarization data at higher frequencies have been obtained
allowing Faraday rotation analysis. Distorted magnetic field structures were
identified in all galaxies. Interaction-induced magnetized outflows were found
in NGC 4438 (due to nuclear activity) and NGC 4654 (a combination of tidal
tails and ram pressure effects). Almost all objects (except the anaemic NGC
4548) exhibit distortions in polarized radio continuum attributable to
influence of the ambient gas. For some galaxies they agree with observations of
other species, but sometimes (NGC 4535) the magnetic field is the only tracer
of the interaction with the cluster environment. The cluster environment
clearly affects the evolution of the galaxies due to ram pressure and tidal
effects. Magnetic fields provide a very long-lasting memory of past
interactions. Therefore, they are a good tracer of weak interactions which are
difficult to detect by other observations.

maximum mass of cold neutron stars is low, M_max ~ 1.5M_sun. Such a low M_max,
due to a kaon condensation in the stellar core, implies collapse of a too
massive deleptonized protoneutron star into a black hole. This would naturally
explain the lack of a neutron star in the SN1987A remnant. On the other hand,
recent evaluation of mass of PSR J0751+1807 gives M_max > 2M_sun. This
contradicts the original Bethe-Brown model, but can be reconciled within
scenarios proposed in the present Letter. We consider two types of dense matter
models with high-density softening, due to a transition from a non-strange
N-phase of matter to a strangeness carrying phase S: kaon condensation and
deconfinement of quarks. Two scenarios of neutron star formation in stellar
core collapse are considered. In the first scenario, realized in sufficiently
hot and dense supernova cores, nucleation of an S-phase is sufficiently rapid
so as to form an S-phase core, and implying M_max = M^S_max =~ 1.5M_sun. In the
second scenario, nucleation of the S-phase at neutron star birth is too slow to
materialize, and the star becomes cold without forming an S-phase core. Then,
stellar mass can increase via accretion, until central density \rho_crit is
reached, and the S phase forms. This N branch of neutron stars ends at
M=M_crit. We select several models of N-phase satifying the necessary condition
M^N_max > 2M_sun and combine them with models of kaon condensation and quark
deconfinement. For kaon condensation, we get M_crit =~ M^S_max =~ 1.5M_sun,
which is ruled out by PSR J0751+1807. On the contrary, for the EOSs with quark
deconfinement we get M_crit =~ M^N_max > 2M_sun, which reconciles SN1987A and
PSR J0751+1807.

a bounded temporal logic over timed runs. The algorithm consists of three
elements. First, the bounded temporal formula to be verified is translated into
a monadic first-order logic over difference inequalities, which we call monadic
difference logic. Second, at each step of the timed run, the monadic difference
formula is modified by computing a quotient with the state and time of that
step. Third, the resulting formula is checked for being a tautology or being
unsatisfiable by a decision procedure for monadic difference logic.
  We further provide a simple decision procedure for monadic difference logic
based on the data structure Difference Decision Diagrams. The algorithm is
complete in a very strong sense on a subclass of temporal formulae
characterized as homogeneously monadic and it is approximate on other formulae.
The approximation comes from the fact that not all unsatisfiable or
tautological formulae are recognised at the earliest possible time of the
runtime verification.
  Contrary to existing approaches, the presented algorithms do not work by
syntactic rewriting but employ efficient decision structures which make them
applicable in real applications within for instance business software.

investigated under the framework of a coarse-grained model, using Langevin
dynamics simulations. The chain size, studied by the radius of gyration, shows
three different variational behaviors with salt concentration, depending on the
chain stiffness. According to these behaviors, polyelectrolytes of fixed chain
length are classified into three categories: flexible chain, semiflexible
chain, and rigid chain. The worm-like chain model with persistence length
predicted by the Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman theory is found to be able to
qualitatively describe the end-to-end distance at low salt concentration. In a
low-salt region, a flexible polyelectrolyte extends more significantly than a
semiflexible chain, and in a high-salt region, regardless of chain stiffness, a
chain attains a dimension comparable to that of its neutral polymer. The chain
stiffness influences both the local and the global chain structures. A flexible
chain exhibits a zigzagged local structure in the presence of salt ions and the
condensed structure is a disordered, random globule. A semiflexible chain is
locally smooth, and the condensed structure is orderly packed, taking a form
such as hairpin or toroid. Moreover, the chain stiffness can also affect the
nature of the coil-globule transition. The transition is occurred in a discrete
manner for semiflexible chain, whereas in a continuous way for flexible chain.
This discrete feature is happened not only at low salt concentration when a
semiflexible chain is collapsed, but also at high salt concentration when the
collapsed chain is reexpanded. At the end, the effects of chain stiffness and
salt concentration on the conformation of single polyelectrolytes are
summarized in a schematic state diagram.

allows the user to find efficiently a fixed number k of documents in the data

with a specific vector space. The problem is more complex when we also allow
each such vector space to have an associated user-defined dynamic weight that
influences its contribution to the overall dynamic aggregated and weighted
similarity. This dynamic problem has been tackled in a recent paper by
Singitham et al. in in VLDB 2004. Their proposed solution, which we take as
baseline, is a variant of the cluster-pruning technique that has the potential
for scaling to very large corpora of documents, and is far more efficient than
the naive exhaustive search. We devise an alternative way of embedding weights
in the data structure, coupled with a non-trivial application of a clustering
algorithm based on the furthest point first heuristic for the metric k-center
problem. The validity of our approach is demonstrated experimentally by showing
significant performance improvements over the scheme proposed in Singitham et

propagates freely, and this makes it possible to analyze the walks in terms of

leaving from another can be found from the scattering matrix of the graph. We
show how the scattering matrix of a graph that is an automorphic image of the
original is related to the scattering matrix of the original graph, and we show
how the scattering matrix of the reverse graph is related to that of the
original graph. Modifications of graphs and the effects of these modifications
are then considered. In particular we show how the scattering matrix of a graph
is changed if we remove two tails and replace them with an edge or cut an edge
and add two tails. This allows us to combine graphs, that is if we connect two
graphs we can construct the scattering matrix of the combined graph from those
of its parts. Finally, using these techniques, we show how two graphs can be
compared by constructing a larger larger graph in which the two original graphs
are in parallel, and performing a quantum walk on the larger graph. This is a

phase-dependent continuum photospheric angular diameters between about 7.9 mas

Al2O3 grains using phase-dependent inner boundary radii between 1.8 and 2.4

unambiguously from the data for each multipole state. We discuss the validity
of our empirical formula by comparing our results with those of other studies
and also by estimating the average and the dispersion of the logarithmic errors
of the calculated excitation energies with respect to the measured ones.

occurrence of intra-night optical variability (INOV) in radio-quiet quasars is
still debated, primarily since only a handful of INOV events with good
statistical significance, albeit small amplitude, have been reported so far.
This has motivated us to continue intra-night optical monitoring of bona-fide
radio-quiet quasars (RQQs). Here we present the results for a sample of 11 RQQs
monitored by us on 19 nights. On 5 of these nights a given RQQ was monitored
simultaneously from two well separated observatories. In all, two clear cases
and two probable case of INOV were detected. From these data, we estimate an
INOV duty cycle of $\sim$8% for RQQs which would increase to 19% if the
`probable variable' cases are also included. Such comparatively small INOV duty
cycles for RQQs, together with the small INOV amplitudes ($\sim$1%), are in
accord with the previously deduced characteristics of this phenomenon.

discovered faint Milky Way satellites Boo, UMaI, UMaII and Wil1. Using the
DEIMOS spectrograph on Keck, we have obtained samples that contain from 15 to
85 probable members of these satellites for which we derive radial velocities
precise to a few km/s down to i~21-22. About half of these stars are observed
with a high enough S/N to estimate their metallicity to within \pm0.2 dex. From
this dataset, we show that UMaII is the only object that does not show a clear
radial velocity peak. However, the measured systemic radial velocity
(v_r=115\pm5 km/s) is in good agreement with recent simulations in which this
object is the progenitor of the recently discovered Orphan Stream. The three
other satellites show velocity dispersions that make them highly dark-matter
dominated systems. In particular the Willman 1 object is not a globular cluster
given its metallicity scatter over -2.0<[Fe/H]<-1.0 and is therefore almost
certainly a dwarf galaxy or dwarf galaxy remnant. We measure a radial velocity
dispersion of only 4.3_{-1.3}^{+2.3} km/s around a systemic velocity of
-12.3\pm2.3 km/s which implies a mass-to-light ratio of ~700 and a total mass
of ~5x10^5 Msun for this satellite, making it the least massive satellite
galaxy known to date. Such a low mass could mean that the 10^7 Msun limit that
had until now never been crossed for Milky Way and Andromeda satellite galaxies
may only be an observational limit and that fainter, less massive systems exist
within the Local Group. However, more modeling and an extended search for
potential extra-tidal stars are required to rule out the possibility that these
systems have not been significantly heated by tidal interaction.

destroyed by pests (bruchids). These bruchids are always associated with
several entomophagous species of hymenoptera. Four entomophagous species were
listed : an egg parasitoid (U lariophaga Stephan), and three solitary larval
and pupal ectoparasitoids (D. Basalis Rondoni, Pteromalidae; E. vuilleti
Crawford and E. orientalis Crawford, Eupelmidae). The survey of the populations
shows that at the beginning of storage, E orientalis is the most abundant
specie (72 %) whereas E. vuilleti and D. Basalis respectively represent 12 %
and 16 % of the hymenoptera. During storage, the E orientalis population
decreases gradually and it disappears completely in less than two months after
the beginning of storage. E. Vuilleti population becomes gradually more
important than D. basalis population which regress until less than 10 % of the
emerging parasitoids. E vuilleti adopts ovicide and larvicide behaviour against
D. Basalis. This behaviour explains its population regression inside granaries.
If the aggressive behaviour of this Eupelmidae is a constant, that could also
explain the disappearance of E orientalis. However if this species is
maintained in stocks, it would be an effective control agent of bruchids
according to their parasitic capacities. This study shows that ovicide and
larvicide behaviour of E vuilleti is not expressed against E orientalis. When
the females have exclusively the hosts already parasitized by E orientalis,
they do not lay eggs. The disappearance of E orientalis could not thus be
explained by the presence of E. vuilleti.

charged-particle number density is small as a result of decoupling, we shall
consider the magnetic and electric fields essentially to be imposed, neglecting
the feedback from any minority accelerated population.
  We find that the electromagnetic treatment of this phase transition can
produce energetic electrons scattered throughout the Universe. Such particles
could have a significant effect on cosmic evolution in several ways: (i) their
presence could delay the effective end of the recombination era; (ii) they
could give rise to plasma concentrations that could enhance early gravitational
collapse of matter by opposing cosmic expansion to a greater degree than
neutral matter could; (iii) they could continue to be accelerated, and become

population while leaving the other members relatively unaffected. The concept
of selective control is developed using cell death or apoptosis in
heterogeneous cell populations as an example. Apoptosis signaling in
heterogeneous cells is described by an ensemble of gene networks with identical
topology but different link strengths. Selective control depends on the
statistics of signaling in the ensemble of networks and we analyse the effects
of superposition, non-linearity and feedback on these statistics. Parallel
pathways promote normal statistics while series pathways promote skew
distributions which in the most extreme cases become log-normal. We also show
that feedback and non-linearity can produce bimodal signaling statistics, as
can discreteness and non-linearity. Two methods for optimizing selective
control are presented. The first is an exhaustive search method and the second
is a linear programming based approach. Though control of a single gene in the
signaling network yields little selectivity, control of a few genes typically
yields higher levels of selectivity. The statistics of gene combinations
susceptible to selective control is studied and is used to identify general
control strategies. We found that selectivity is promoted by acting on the
least sensitive nodes in the case of weak populations, while selective control
of robust populations is optimized through perturbations of more sensitive
nodes. High throughput experiments with heterogeneous cell lines could be
designed in an analogous manner, with the further possibility of incorporating
the selectivity optimization process into a closed-loop control system.
