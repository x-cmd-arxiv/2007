relativistic electrons. In the absence of disorder or external doping the Fermi
energy lies at the Dirac point where the density of states vanishes. Although
transport measurements at high carrier densities indicate rather high
mobilities, many questions pertaining to disorder remain unanswered. In
particular, it has been argued theoretically, that when the average carrier
density is zero, the inescapable presence of disorder will lead to electron and
hole puddles with equal probability. In this work, we use a scanning single
electron transistor to image the carrier density landscape of graphene in the
vicinity of the neutrality point. Our results clearly show the electron-hole
puddles expected theoretically. In addition, our measurement technique enables
to determine locally the density of states in graphene. In contrast to
previously studied massive two dimensional electron systems, the kinetic
contribution to the density of states accounts quantitatively for the measured
signal. Our results suggests that exchange and correlation effects are either
weak or have canceling contributions.

prove that there is an open set, corresponding to the simple bundles with
minimal cohomology, which is irreducible of dimension 19 and bimeromorphic to

from the AGB before the onset of the third dredge-up. However, the Fe
abundances derived from the HST spectra are lower than those expected from the

B-type stars in environments of known metallicity, such as the Magellanic
Clouds. These results indicate that the Fe III ultraviolet lines may yield
abundance values which are systematically too low by typically 0.6 dex and

octamers, the H1 histones in front of the nucleosomes and the vertical distance
$d$ between the in and outgoing DNA strands. Factoring these chromatin features
in, one gets essential changes in the chromatin phase diagram: Not only the
shape of the excluded-volume borderline changes but also the vertical distance
$d$ has a dramatic influence on the forbidden area. Furthermore, we examined
the influence of H1 defects on the properties of the chromatin fiber. Thus we
present two possible strategies for chromatin compaction: The use of very dense
states in the phase diagram in the gaps in the excluded volume borderline or
missing H1 histones which can lead to very compact fibers. The chromatin fiber
might use both of these mechanisms to compact itself at least locally. Line

molecular dynamics simulations to generate precise thermodynamic and kinetic
data for the equilibrium hard-sphere fluid confined between smooth hard walls.
These simulations show that the pronounced inhomogeneous structuring of the
fluid normal to the confining walls, often the primary focus of density
functional theory studies, has a negligible effect on many of its average
properties over a surprisingly broad range of conditions. We present one
consequence of this insensitivity to confinement: a simple analytical equation
relating the average density of the confined fluid to that of the bulk fluid
with equal activity. Nontrivial implications of confinement for average fluid
properties do emerge in this system, but only when the fluid is both (i) dense
and (ii) confined to a gap smaller than approximately three particle diameters.
For this limited set of conditions, we find that ""in-phase"" oscillatory
deviations in excess entropy and self-diffusivity (relative to the behavior of
the bulk fluid at the same average density) occur as a function of gap size.
These paired thermodynamic/kinetic deviations from bulk behavior appear to
reflect the geometric packing frustration that arises when the confined space
cannot naturally accommodate an integer number of particle layers.

feedback processes that for the first time allows cosmological simulations of
structure formation to self-consistently follow the build up of the cosmic
population of galaxies and active galactic nuclei. Our model assumes that seed
black holes are present at early cosmic epochs at the centres of forming halos.
We then track their growth from gas accretion and mergers with other black
holes in the course of cosmic time. For black holes that are active, we
distinguish between two distinct modes of feedback, depending on the black hole
accretion rate itself. Black holes that accrete at high rates are assumed to be
in a `quasar regime', where we model their feedback by thermally coupling a
small fraction of their bolometric luminosity to the surrounding gas. For black
holes with low accretion rates, we conjecture that most of their feedback
occurs in mechanical form, where AGN-driven bubbles are injected into a gaseous
environment. Using our new model, we carry out TreeSPH cosmological simulations
on the scales of individual galaxies to those of massive galaxy clusters, both
for isolated systems and for cosmological boxes. We demonstrate that our model
produces results for the black hole and stellar mass densities in broad
agreement with observational constraints. We find that the black holes
significantly influence the evolution of their host galaxies, changing their
star formation history, their amount of cold gas, and their colours. Also, the
properties of intracluster gas are affected strongly by the presence of massive
black holes in the cores of galaxy clusters, leading to shallower metallicity
and entropy profiles, and to a suppression of strong cooling flows. [Abridged]

superconductors to the high-frequency c-axis electric field. We found a simple
relation connecting the dynamic dielectric constant with the perturbation of
the superconducting phase, induced by oscillating electric field. Numerically
solving equations for the oscillating phases, we computed the frequency
dependences of the loss function at different magnetic fields, including
regions of both dilute and dense Josephson vortex lattices. The overall
behavior is mainly determined by the c-axis and in-plane dissipation
parameters, which is inversely proportional to the anisotropy. The cases of
weak and strong dissipation are realized in
$\mathrm{Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{x}}$ and underdoped $\mathrm{YBa_{2}Cu_{3}
O_{x}}$ correspondingly. The main feature of the response is the
Josephson-plasma-resonance peak. In the weak-dissipation case additional
satellites appear in the dilute regime mostly in the higher-frequency region
due to excitation of the plasma modes with the wave vectors set by the lattice
structure. In the dense-lattice limit the plasma peak moves to higher frequency
and its intensity rapidly decreases, in agreement with experiment and
analytical theory. Behavior of the loss function at low frequencies is well
described by the phenomenological theory of vortex oscillations. In the case of
very strong in-plane dissipation an additional peak in the loss function
appears below the plasma frequency. Such peak has been observed experimentally
in underdoped $\mathrm{YBa_{2}Cu_{3} O_{x}}$. It is caused by frequency
dependence of in-plane contribution to losses rather then a definite mode of
phase oscillations.

outer edges of the globule and reaches a maximum of ~32 visual magnitudes at
the center. The corresponding mass of CB190 is ~10 Msun. Our 12CO and 13CO J =
2-1 data over a 10 arcmin X 10 arcmin region centered on the shadow show a
temperature ~10 K. The thermal continuum indicates a similar temperature for
the dust. The molecular data also show evidence of freezeout onto dust grains.
We estimate a distance to CB190 of 400 pc using the spectroscopic parallax of a
star associated with the globule. Bonnor-Ebert fits to the density profile, in
conjunction with this distance, yield xi_max = 7.2, indicating that CB190 may
be unstable. The high temperature (56 K) of the best fit Bonnor-Ebert model is
in contradiction with the CO and thermal continuum data, leading to the
conclusion that the thermal pressure is not enough to prevent free-fall
collapse. We also find that the turbulence in the cloud is inadequate to
support it. However, the cloud may be supported by the magnetic field, if this
field is at the average level for dark globules. Since the magnetic field will
eventually leak out through ambipolar diffusion, it is likely that CB190 is
collapsing or in a late pre-collapse stage.

2390 (3.7 sigma), and the strongest absorption feature, toward 4C+39.25 (3.8
sigma), might be expected from theoretical models. The emission feature would
require ~1E10 Msolar of 1E6 K gas, which is inconsistent with X-ray limits for
the O VII Kalpha line, so it is unlikely to be real. The NVII absorption
feature requires a NVII column of 6E16 cm^-2, higher than model predictions by

early-type galaxies and spheroidal subsystems of spiral ones (spheroids). The
color-mass trend is often converted to a metallicity-mass trend under the
assumption that age effects are small or negligible. While direct estimates of
the ages of MRGC populations neither can rule out nor reliably support the
populations' age trend, key data on timing of the formation of spheroids and
other indirect evidence imply it in the sense: the more massive spheroid the
older on average its MRGC population. We show that the contribution of an
allowable age trend of the MRGC populations to their peak color trend can
achieve up to ~50 % or so. In this event the comparable value of the color
trend, ~30 %, is due to alpha-element ratio systematic variations of the order
of Delta[alpha/Fe] ~ 0.1 to 0.2 dex because of a correlation between the
[alpha/Fe] ratios and age. Hence a systematic variation of exactly [Fe/H]
ratios may turn out to be less significant among the contributors, and its

temperature superfluid density in two slave-particle theories of the tt't''J
model -- the slave-boson theory and doped-carrier theory. In the slave-boson
theory, the nodal quasiparticle current renormalization factor $\alpha$
vanishes proportionally to the zero temperature superfluid density $\rho_S(0)$;
however, we find that away from the $\rho_S(0) \to 0$ limit $\alpha$ displays a
much weaker doping dependence than $\rho_S(0)$. A similar conclusion applies to
the doped-carrier theory, which differentiates the nodal and antinodal regions
of momentum space. Due to its momentum space anisotropy, the doped-carrier
theory enhances the value of $\alpha$ in the hole doped regime, bringing it to
quantitative agreement with experiments, and reproduces the asymmetry between
hole and electron doped cuprate superconductors. Finally, we use the
doped-carrier theory to predict a specific experimental signature of local
staggered spin correlations in doped Mott insulator superconductors which, we
propose, should be observed in STM measurements of underdoped high-Tc
compounds. This experimental signature distinguishes the doped-carrier theory
from other candidate mean-field theories of high-Tc superconductors, like the
slave-boson theory and the conventional BCS theory.

lower redshift and evolves more strongly at high redshift than the star

shows only a moderate evolution at low redshifts. We find strong correlations
between black hole masses and properties of the stellar systems, agreeing well
with the measured local M_BH-sigma and M_BH -M_* relationships, but also
suggesting (dependent on the mass range) a weak evolution with redshift in the
normalization and the slope. Our simulations also produce massive black holes
at high redshift, due to extended periods of exponential growth in regions that
collapse early and exhibit strong gas inflows. These first supermassive BH
systems however are not necessarily the most massive ones today, since they are
often overtaken in growth by quasars that form later. (abridged)

dimension n and p. The unique contribution is the derivation of a closed-form
formula for the volume of a metric ball in the Grassmann manifold when the
radius is sufficiently small. This volume formula holds for Grassmann manifolds
with arbitrary dimension n and p, while previous results are only valid for
either p=1 or a fixed p with asymptotically large n. Based on the volume

on the squared chordal distance, tight lower and upper bounds are established
for the distortion rate tradeoff. Simulation results match the derived results.
As an application of the derived quantization bounds, the information rate of a

turned on (denoted by on-beam) with a constant power or turned off. We prove
that the ratio of the optimal number of on-beams and the number of antennas
converges to a constant for a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the number
of transmit and receive antennas approaches infinity simultaneously and when
beamforming is perfect. Based on this result, a near optimal strategy, i.e.,
power on/off strategy with a constant number of on-beams, is discussed. For
such a strategy, we propose the power efficiency factor to quantify the effect
of imperfect beamforming. A formula is proposed to compute the maximum power
efficiency factor achievable given a feedback rate. The information rate of the
overall MIMO system can be approximated by combining the asymptotic results and
the formula for power efficiency factor. Simulations show that this

and m single-antenna users, where each user has perfect channel knowledge and
the base station obtains channel information through a finite rate feedback.
The key observation of this paper is that the optimal number of on-users (users
turned on), say s, is a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and other
system parameters. Towards this observation, we use asymptotic analysis to
guide the design of feedback and transmission strategies. As L, m and the
feedback rates approach infinity linearly, we derive the asymptotic optimal
feedback strategy and a realistic criterion to decide which users should be
turned on. Define the corresponding asymptotic throughput per antenna as the
spatial efficiency. It is a function of the number of on-users s, and
therefore, s should be appropriately chosen. Based on the above asymptotic
results, we also develop a scheme for a system with finite many antennas and
users. Compared with other works where s is presumed constant, our scheme
achieves a significant gain by choosing the appropriate s. Furthermore, our
analysis and scheme is valid for heterogeneous systems where different users
may have different path loss coefficients and feedback rates.

which a source in G_{n,p}(L) is quantized through a code in G_{n,q}(L), where p
and q are not necessarily the same. It is different from most works in
literature where p\equiv q. The analysis for unequal dimensional quantization
is based on the volume of a metric ball in G_{n,p}(L) whose center is in
G_{n,q}(L). Our chief result is a closed-form formula for the volume of a
metric ball when the radius is sufficiently small. This volume formula holds
for Grassmann manifolds with arbitrary n, p, q and L, while previous results
pertained only to some special cases. Based on this volume formula, several
bounds are derived for the rate distortion tradeoff assuming the quantization
rate is sufficiently high. The lower and upper bounds on the distortion rate
function are asymptotically identical, and so precisely quantify the asymptotic
rate distortion tradeoff. We also show that random codes are asymptotically
optimal in the sense that they achieve the minimum achievable distortion with
probability one as n and the code rate approach infinity linearly. Finally, we
discuss some applications of the derived results to communication theory. A
geometric interpretation in the Grassmann manifold is developed for capacity
calculation of additive white Gaussian noise channel. Further, the derived
distortion rate function is beneficial to characterizing the effect of
beamforming matrix selection in multi-antenna communications.

state among them is the resonating valence bond (RVB) state in which every pair
of neighboring quantum spins form entangled spin singlets (valence bonds) and
the singlets are quantum mechanically resonating amongst all the possible
highly degenerate pairing states. Here we provide experimental evidence for
such quantum paramagnetic states existing in frustrated antiferromagnets,
ZnxCu4-x(OD)6Cl2, where the S = 1/2 magnetic Cu2+ moments form layers of a
two-dimensional kagome lattice. We find that in Cu4(OD)6Cl2, where distorted
kagome planes are weakly coupled to each other, a dispersionless excitation
mode appears in the magnetic excitation spectrum below ~ 20 K, whose
characteristics resemble those of quantum spin singlets in a solid state, known
as a valence bond solid (VBS), that breaks translational symmetry. Doping
nonmagnetic Zn2+ ions reduces the distortion of the kagome lattice, and weakens
the interplane coupling but also dilutes the magnetic occupancy of the kagome
lattice. The VBS state is suppressed and for ZnCu3(OD)6Cl2 where the kagome
planes are undistorted and 90% occupied by the Cu2+ ions, the low energy spin
fluctuations in the spin liquid phase become featureless.

1-dimensional basic equations of accretion flows to account for the effects of
viscous stresses in both the azimuthal and radial directions. Our method is
verified by reproducing the best results obtained previously by Szuszkiewicz &
Miller on the limit-cycle behavior of thermally unstable accretion disks with
moderate viscosity. A new finding is that, according to our computations, the
Bernoulli function of the matter in such disks is always and everywhere
negative, so that outflows are unlikely to originate from these disks. We are
encouraged to study the more difficult case of thermally unstable accretion
disks with strong viscosity, and wish to report our results in a subsequent
paper.

discuss a ``natural'' refinement equation whose solution (a refinable function)
is the characteristic function of the unit disc. This equation reflects the
fact that the characteristic function of the unit disc is a sum of $p$
characteristic functions of mutually disjoint discs of radius $p^{-1}$. This
refinement equation generates a MRA. The case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our
MRA is a 2-adic analog of the real Haar MRA. But in contrast to the real
setting, the refinable function generating our Haar MRA is 1-periodic, which
never holds for real refinable functions. This fact implies that there exist
infinity many different 2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\cL}^2(\bQ_2)$
generated by the same Haar MRA. All of these bases are described. We also
constructed multidimensional 2-adic Haar orthonormal bases for
${\cL}^2(\bQ_2^n)$ by means of the tensor product of one-dimensional MRAs. A
criterion for a multidimensional $p$-adic wavelet to be an eigenfunction for a

NGC 1883 a genuine outer disk intermediate-age open cluster. We confirm that in

layer. Synthetic brightness temperature maps are calculated on basis of
three-dimensional radiation (magneto-)hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. While the
millimetre continuum at 0.3mm originates mainly from the upper photosphere, the
longer wavelengths considered here map the low and middle chromosphere. The
effective formation height increases generally with wavelength and also from
disk-centre towards the solar limb. The average intensity contribution
functions are usually rather broad and in some cases they are even
double-peaked as there are contributions from hot shock waves and cool
post-shock regions in the model chromosphere. Taking into account the
deviations from ionisation equilibrium for hydrogen gives a less strong
variation of the electron density and with it of the optical depth. The result
is a narrower formation height range. The average brightness temperature
increases with wavelength and towards the limb. The relative contrast depends
on wavelength in the same way as the average intensity but decreases towards
the limb. The dependence of the brightness temperature distribution on
wavelength and disk-position can be explained with the differences in formation
height and the variation of temperature fluctuations with height in the model
atmospheres.

present. A variety of empirical or theoretical formulae with different
parameterisations are available in the literature and the agreement between
them is anything but good. These simple mass loss prescriptions are nontheless
used in many models of stellar evolution without much consideration of their
applicability in various cases. We present here an on-going project aiming at a
better description of the mass loss, that could be used to improve stellar
evolution models -- especially the evolution during the TP-AGB phase. As a
first step, we have considered the mass loss evolution during a He-shell flash.
Using stellar parameters sampled from a stellar evolutionary track, we have
computed the time evolution of the atmospheric layers and wind acceleration
region during a flash event with detailed frequency-dependent
radiation-hydrodynamical models including dust formation. Based on these
results, we have also simulated the subsequent long-term dynamical evolution of
the circumstellar envelope (CSE), including the formation of a detached shell.
We find that existing simple mass loss prescriptions imply different mass loss
evolutions compared with our model. The second step of the project deals with
the dependence of mass loss on the basic stellar parameters. At the moment we
are computing a large grid of wind models for C-rich AGB stars. Preliminary
results show that simple parameterisations are difficult to obtain in certain
regions of the parameter space considered, due to strong non-linearities in the
wind mechanism.

and temperature. Specifically, we analyzed VLT/UVES spectra of members of NGC
2516, the Hyades, and M 67 to determine their Be and Li abundances. In the
first two clusters we focused on stars cooler than 5400 K, while the M 67
sample includes stars warmer than 6150 K, as well as two subgiants and two blue
stragglers. We also computed the evolution of Be for a 0.9 Mo star based on
standard evolutionary models. We find different emprical behaviours for stars
in different temperature bins and ages. Stars warmer than 6150 K show Be
depletion and follow a Be vs. Li correlation while Be is undepleted in stars in
the ~6150-5600 K range. NGC 2516 members cooler than 5400 K have not depleted
any Be, but older Hyades of similar temperature do show some depletion. Be is
severely depleted in the subgiants and blue stragglers. The results for warm
stars are in agreement with previous studies, supporting the hypothesis that
mixing in this temperature regime is driven by rotation. The same holds for the
two subgiants that have evolved from the ""Li gap"". This mechanism is instead
not the dominant one for solar-type stars. We show that Be depletion of cool
Hyades cannot simply be explained by the effect of increasing depth of the
convective zone. Finally, the different Be content of the two blue stragglers
suggests that they have formed by two different processes (i.e., collisions vs.
binary merging).

both a diffuse, extended, flux of gamma rays above ~0.4 TeV and discrete

explanation in terms of the diffusion of cosmic ray protons from a succession
of supernova remnants (SNR) in the SgrA* region of the Galaxy plus a
contribution from SNR in the rest of the Galactic Centre Region, to be called
the Galactic Centre Ridge (GCR). Protons are favoured over electrons because
the mG magnetic fields in the Region will attenuate energetic electrons
severely. Prominent features are the need for 'anomalous diffusion' of the
protons in the whole region and the adoption of low efficiency for SNR
acceleration in the high density regions. The latter is related by us to the
well-known low 'cosmic ray gradient' in the Galaxy. A corroborating feature is
the close correlation of inferred cosmic ray intensity with the smoothed
intensity of 5 GHZ radio radiation. We attribute this to the presence of the
SNR in the GCR.

depends both on whether their time separation is small or large compared to a
dephasing scale defined in terms of the chemical potential difference between

smaller than a decoherence scale defined in terms of the current flowing from
one reservoir to another. A renormalization group transformation appropriate to
the nonequilibrium problem is defined. An important feature is the presence in
the model of a new coupling, essentially the decoherence rate, which acquires
an additive renormalization similar to that of the energy in equilibrium
problems. The method is used to study interplay between the dephasing-induced
formation of independent resonances tied to the two chemical potentials and the
decoherence which cuts off the scaling and leads to effectively classical
long-time behavior. We determine the effect of departures from equilibrium on

limit of the string and supersymmetric sigma models. The tensionless limit is
used to find a IIB supergravity background generated by a tensionless string.
Quantization of the tensionless string in a pp-wave background is performed and
the tensionless limit is found to commute with quantization. Further, the sigma
model with N=(2,2) extended world-sheet supersymmetry is considered and the
requirement on the target space to have a bi-Hermitean geometry is reviewed. It
is shown that the equivalence between bi-Hermitean geometry and generalized
Kahler follows, in this context, from the equivalence between the Lagrangian-
and Hamiltonian formulation of the model. Moreover, the explicit T-duality
transformation in the Hamiltonian formulation of the sigma model is constructed
and shown to be a symplectomorphism. Under certain assumptions, the amount of
extended supersymmetry present in the sigma model is shown to be preserved
under T-duality. Further, by requiring N=(2,2) extended supersymmetry in a
first order formulation of the sigma model an intriguing geometrical structure
arises and in a special case generalized complex geometry is found to be
contained in the new framework.

quantum mechanics which does not refer to a classical spacetime manifold. It
follows as a consequence that quantum mechanics as we know it is a limiting
case of a more general nonlinear quantum theory, with the nonlinearity becoming
significant at the Planck mass/energy scale. This nonlinearity is responsible
for a dynamically induced collapse of the wave-function, during a quantum
measurement, and it hence falsifies the many-worlds interpretation of quantum
mechanics. We illustrate this conclusion using a mathematical model based on a
generalized Doebner-Goldin equation. The non-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian

  representation. Extensions of the continuous time random walk approach","12 pages, RevTex",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.77.031130",,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft",,"  Some specific features and extensions of the continuous time random walk
(CTRW) approach are analyzed in detail within the Markovian representation (MR)
and CTRW-based non-Markovian stochastic Liouville equation (SLE). In the MR
CTRW processes are represented by multidimensional Markovian ones. In this
representation the probability distribution function (PDF) W(t) of fluctuation
renewals is associated with that of reoccurrences in a certain jump state of
some Markovian controlling process. Within the MR the non-Markovian SLE, which
describes the effect of CTRW-like noise on relaxation of dynamic and stochastic
systems, is generalized to take into account the influence of relaxing systems
on statistical properties of noise. The generalized non-Markovian SLE is
applied to study two modifications of the CTRW approach. One of them considers
the cascaded CTRWs in which the controlling process is actually CTRW-like one
controlled by another CTRW process, controlled in turn by the third one, etc.
Within the MR simple expression for the PDF W(t) of total controlling process
is obtained in terms of Markovian variants of controlling PDFs in the cascade.
The expression is shown to be especially simple and instructive in the case of
anomalous processes determined by long time tailed W(t). The cascaded CTRWs can
model the effect of complexity of a system on relaxation kinetics (in glasses,
fractals, branching media, ultrametric structures, etc.). Another
CTRW-modification describes the kinetics of processes governed by fluctuating
W(t). Within the MR the problem is analyzed in a general form without
restrictive assumptions on correlations of PDFs of consecutive renewals. The
analysis shows that W(t) can strongly affect the kinetics of the process.
Possible manifestations of this effect are discussed.

through the study of the extremals of action functionals defined on piecewise

start with, the kinematical foundations, culminating in the so called
variational equation, are put on geometrical grounds, via the introduction of
the concept of infinitesimal control . On the same basis, the usual
classification of the extremals of a variational problem into normal and
abnormal ones is also rationalized, showing the existence of a purely
kinematical algorithm assigning to each admissible curve a corresponding
abnormality index, defined in terms of a suitable linear map. The whole
machinery is then applied to constrained variational calculus. The argument
provides an interesting revisitation of Pontryagin maximum principle and of the

Monte Carlo phase space calculations performed to simulate the formation and
decay of $\eta$-mesic nuclei suggest that its decay particles, the protons and
pions are emitted with an opening angle of 150$^\circ \pm 20^\circ$, and with
energies in the range of 25 to 300 MeV and 225 to 450 MeV respectively. The
detailed GEANT simulations show that $\sim$ 80 % of the decay particles
(protons and pions) can be detected within ENSTAR. Several test measurements
using alpha source, cosmic-ray muons etc. have been carried out to study the
response of ENSTAR scintillator pieces. The in-beam tests of fully assembled
detector with proton beam of momentum 870 MeV/c from the Cooler synchrotron
COSY have been performed. The test results show that the scintillator fiber
design chosen for the detector has performed satisfactorily well. The present
article describes the detector design, simulation studies, construction details
and test results.
