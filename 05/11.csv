systems, at 0.7<z<1.1, three of which are confirmed Damped Lyman-alpha systems.
A significant excess of galaxies is found within 6""0 (~50kpc) from the absorber
line-of-sight. The excess galaxies are preferentially luminous compared to the
population of field galaxies. A model in which field galaxies possess a
luminosity-dependent cross-section for CaII absorption of the form (L/L*)^0.7
reproduces the observations well. The luminosity-dependent cross-section for
the CaII absorbers appears to be significantly stronger than the established
(L/L*)^0.4 dependence for MgII absorbers. The associated galaxies lie at large
physical distances from the CaII-absorbing gas; we find a mean impact parameter
of 24kpc (H0=70km\s\Mpc). Combined with the observed number density of CaII
absorbers the large physical separations result in an inferred filling factor
of only ~10 per cent. The physical origin of the strong CaII absorption remains
unclear, possible explanations vary from very extended disks of the luminous
galaxies to associated dwarf galaxy neighbours, remnants of outflows from the
luminous galaxies, or tidal debris from cannibalism of smaller galaxies.

description of black holes that are in equilibrium with their (possibly
dynamic) environment. Over the past several years, the framework has been
extended to include matter fields (dilaton, Yang-Mills etc) in D=4 dimensions
and cosmological constant in $D\geq3$ dimensions. In this article we present a
further extension of the framework that includes black holes in
higher-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity. In particular, we
construct a covariant phase space for EGB gravity in arbitrary dimensions which
allows us to derive the first law. We find that the entropy of a weakly
isolated and non-rotating horizon is given by
$\mathcal{S}=(1/4G_{D})\oint_{S^{D-2}}\bm{\tilde{\epsilon}}(1+2\alpha\mathcal{R})$.
In this expression $S^{D-2}$ is the $(D-2)$-dimensional cross section of the
horizon with area form $\bm{\tilde{\epsilon}}$ and Ricci scalar $\mathcal{R}$,
$G_{D}$ is the $D$-dimensional Newton constant and $\alpha$ is the Gauss-Bonnet
parameter. This expression for the horizon entropy is in agreement with those
predicted by the Euclidean and Noether charge methods. Thus we extend the
isolated horizon framework beyond Einstein gravity.

log-normal or normal, and its isotropic X-ray energy (E_{iso,X}) is linearly
correlated with the prompt gamma-ray energy, but with a steeper photon spectrum
except for some X-ray flashes. No significant spectral evolution is observed
from this phase to the follow-up phase, and the follow-up phase is usually
consistent with the external shock models, implying that this segment likely
due to a refreshed external shock. Within this scenario, the data are generally
consistent with a roughly constant injection luminosity up to the end of this
phase $t_b$. A positive correlation between E_{iso, X} and t_b also favors this
scenario. Among the 13 bursts that have well-sampled optical light curves, 6
have an optical break around t_b and the breaks are consistent with being
achromatic. However, the other 7 bursts either do not show an optical break or
have a break at a different epoch than t_b. This raises a concern to the energy
injection scenario, suggesting that the optical and X-ray emissions may not be
the same component at least for a fraction of bursts. There are 4 significant
outliers in the sample, and this shallow decau phase in these bursts is
immediately followed by a very steep decay after t_b, which is inconsistent
with any external shock model. The optical data of these bursts evolve
independently from the X-ray data. These X-ray plateaus likely have an internal
origin and demand continuous operation of a long-term GRB central engine. We
conclude that the observed shallow decay phase likely has diverse physical
origins(Abridged).

Starting from the category of (4|4N)-dimensional complex superconformal
supermanifolds, the categories of (4|2N)-dimensional complex quaternionic,
quaternionic Kaehler and hyper-Kaehler right-chiral supermanifolds are
introduced and discussed. We then present a detailed twistor description of
these types of supermanifolds. In particular, we construct supertwistor spaces
associated with complex quaternionic right-chiral supermanifolds, and explain
what additional supertwistor data allows for giving those supermanifolds a
hyper-Kaehler structure. In this way, we obtain a supersymmetric generalization
of Penrose's nonlinear graviton construction. We furthermore give an
alternative formulation in terms of a supersymmetric extension of LeBrun's
Einstein bundle. This allows us to include the cases with nonvanishing
cosmological constant. We also discuss the bundle of local supertwistors and
address certain implications thereof. Finally, we comment on a real version of
the theory related to Euclidean signature.

~6000 galaxies in 48 clusters. A salient feature of this model is the
possibility of treating dust extinction as a function of age, allowing younger
stars to be more obscured than older ones. Our technique, for the first time,
takes into account this feature in a spectral fitting code. A set of template
spectra spanning a wide range of star formation histories is built, with
features closely resembling those of typical spectra in our sample in terms of
spectral resolution, noise and wavelength coverage. Our method of analyzing
these spectra allows us to test the reliability and the uncertainties related
to each physical parameter we are inferring. The well-known degeneracy problem,
i.e. the non-uniqueness of the best fit solution (mass and extinction in
different age bins), can be addressed by assigning adequate error bars to the
recovered parameters. The values found in this way, together with their error
bars, identify the region of parameter space which contains all the possible
solutions for a given spectrum. A comparison test was also performed on a WINGS
subsample, containing objects in common with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,
yielding excellent agreement. We find that the stellar content as a function of
age is reliably recovered in four main age bins and that the uncertainties only
mildly depend on the S/N ratio. The metallicity of the dominant stellar
population is not always recoverable unambiguosly, depending on the Star

new generation of detectors of gravitational radiation. The existence of
gravitational radiation was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, however
gravitational waves have not yet been directly observed. One source of
gravitation radiation is binary inspiral. Two compact bodies orbiting each
other, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation.
As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causes
their orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase,
producing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. In
this thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for low
mass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way.
Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the Large
Magellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo may
be in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It has
been proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be a
component of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOs
will be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHO
binary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitive
band around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency,
sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds. By using
evidence from microlensing events and theoretical predictions of the population
an upper limit is placed on the rate of black hole MACHO inspirals in the
galactic halo.

simulations, we demonstrate that in addition to the oscillations of the
propagating wave type, there exist also two localized oscillation modes. The
first localized mode has a relatively homogeneous magnetization structure of
its kernel and corresponds to the so called 'bullet' predicted analytically by
Slavin and Tiberkevich (Phys. Rev. Lett., 95 (2005) 237201). Magnetization
pattern of the second localized mode kernel is highly inhomogeneous, leading to
a much smaller power of magnetoresistance oscillations caused by this mode. We
have also studied the influence of a non-linear damping for this system and
have found the following main qualitative effects: (i) the appearance of
frequency jumps within the existence region of the propagating wave mode and
(ii) the narrowing of the current region where the 'bullet' mode exists, until
this mode completely disappears for a sufficiently strong non-linear damping.

We identify a red clump population in this galaxy, the first time this feature

significant intermediate age populations. We construct radial profiles for the
various stellar populations and show that the horizontal branch has a nearly
constant density spatial distribution out to large radius, whereas the reddest
red giant branch stars are centrally concentrated in an exponential profile. We
argue that these populations trace two distinct structural components in And II
and show that this assumption provides a good match to the overall radial
profile of this galaxy. The extended component dominates the stellar
populations at large radius, whereas the exponential component dominates the
inner few arcminutes. We show that the two components have very different
stellar populations; the exponential component has an average age of $\sim 7 -
10$ Gyrs old, is relatively metal-rich ([Fe/H] $\sim -1$) but with a
significant tail to low metallicities, and possesses a red clump. The extended
component, on the other hand, is ancient ($\sim 13$ Gyrs), metal-poor ([Fe/H]
$\sim -1.5$) with a narrower dispersion $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]} \simeq 0.28$, and
has a well developed blue horizontal branch. The extended component contains

regions in the Galaxy, Large Magellanic Cloud, and other satellite galaxies.
These gamma-ray sources have been detected already with EGRET (Energetic Gamma
Ray Experiment Telescope) as extended sources (eg. LMC and Orion clouds) and
GLAST-LAT will detect many more with a higher spatial resolution and in a wider
spectral range. We have developed a novel image restoration technique based on
the Richardson-Lucy algorithm optimized for GLAST-LAT observation of extended
sources. Our algorithm calculates PSF (point spread function) for each event.
This step is very important for GLAST-LAT and EGRET image analysis since PSF
varies more than one order of magnitude from one gamma ray to another depending
on its energy as well as its impact point and angle in the instrument. The
GLAST-LAT and EGRET image analysis has to cope with Poisson fluctuation due to
low number of detected photons for most sources. Our technique incorporates
wavelet filtering to minimize effects due to the fluctuation. Preliminary
studies on some EGRET sources are presented, which shows potential of this
novel image restoration technique for the identification and characterisation
of extended gamma-ray sources.

the spin gap, the superconductor and the strange metallic phases. The behavior
of three kinds of topological defects -- holon and spinon vortices and
monopoles - is explored in various phases. We also observe a new effect, the
strong enhancement of the phase transition strength reflected in a lower order
of the transition: at sufficiently strong gauge coupling the two second order
phase transitions -- corresponding to spinon-pair and holon condensation lines
- join partially in the phase diagram and become a first order phase transition
in that region. The last observation may have an analogue in Quantum
Chromodynamics at non-zero temperature and finite baryon density. We argue that

operation. A complex detector, made of 8 micro fission-chambers, has been built
and installed in the core of the target, few tens of centimeters from the
proton/Pb-Bi interaction zone. This detector is designed to measure the
absolute neutron flux inside the target, to give its spatial distribution and
to correlate its temporal variations with the beam intensity. Moreover,
integral information on the neutron energy distribution as a function of the
position along the beam axis could be extracted, giving integral constraints on
the neutron production models implemented in transport codes such as MCNPX.

While quasars accreting near the Eddington limit are more likely to show BALs
than lower $L/L_{Edd}$ systems, BALs are present in quasars accreting at only a
few percent Eddington. We find a stronger effect with bolometric luminosity,
such that the most luminous quasars are more likely to show BALs. There is an
additional effect, previously known, that BAL quasars are redder on average
than unabsorbed quasars. The strongest effects involving the quasar physical
properties and BAL properties are related to terminal outflow velocity. Maximum
observed outflow velocities increase with both the bolometric luminosity and
the blueness of the spectral slope, suggesting that the ultraviolet luminosity
to a great extent determines the acceleration. These results support the idea
of outflow acceleration via ultraviolet line scattering.

Swift and HETE satellites have led to the observation of the first afterglows
and the measurement of the first redshifts from this type of burst. Detection
of >100 GeV counterparts would place powerful constraints on GRB mechanisms.
Seventeen short duration (< 5 s) GRBs detected by satellites occurred within
the field of view of the Milagro gamma-ray observatory between 2000 January and
2006 December. We have searched the Milagro data for >100 GeV counterparts to
these GRBs and find no significant emission correlated with these bursts. Due
to the absorption of high-energy gamma rays by the extragalactic background
light (EBL), detections are only expected for redshifts less than ~0.5. While
most long duration GRBs occur at redshifts higher than 0.5, the opposite is
thought to be true of short GRBs. Lack of a detected VHE signal thus allows
setting meaningful fluence limits. One GRB in the sample (050509b) has a likely
association with a galaxy at a redshift of 0.225, while another (051103) has
been tentatively linked to the nearby galaxy M81. Fluence limits are corrected
for EBL absorption, either using the known measured redshift, or computing the
corresponding absorption for a redshift of 0.1 and 0.5, as well as for the case
of z=0.

Schwartz. In this theory, the graviton becomes massive when general covariance
is spontaneously broken through the introduction of a field that links two
metrics, one of the which will eventually decouple. The excitation of this
""link"" field acts like a Goldstone boson in giving mass to the graviton. We
work out the graviton and Goldstone boson propagators explicitly by means of
gauge fixing terms similar to the renormalizability gauges used in gauge
theories. With these propagators, we calculate the lowest order tree-level
interaction between two external energy momentum tensors. The result is
independent of the gauge parameter, but different from the prediction of
massless gravity theory, i.e., general relativity. This difference remains even
if the mass of the graviton goes to zero, in which case it gives the van
Dam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity between the propagators of a massive
and massless linearized graviton. Moreover, we show that the Fierz-Pauli
graviton mass term can be considered as the ``unitary gauge'' of a more general
theory with an extra scalar field. We explicitly construct such a theory in
which the vDVZ discontinuity arises with a graviton mass term that is different
from the Fierz-Pauli mass term. This theory has a local Weyl symmetry under
conformal transformations of the metric. In the case when the mass goes to
zero, the Weyl summetry becomes a global symmetry. It is possible that the
local Weyl symmetry will give a hint as to the form of the corresponding fully
nonlinear theory having a nonzero graviton mass.

modeling the evolution of the gas and solid content of protostellar disks from

paper, I present a new set of simplified equations modeling the growth and
migration of various species of grains in a gaseous protostellar disk evolving
as a result of the combined effects of viscous accretion and photo-evaporation
from the central star. Using the assumption that the grain size distribution
function always maintains a power-law structure approximating the average
outcome of the exact coagulation/shattering equation, the model focuses on the
calculation of the growth rate of the largest grains only. The coupled
evolution equations for the maximum grain size, the surface density of the gas
and the surface density of solids are then presented and solved
self-consistently using a standard 1+1 dimensional formalism. I show that the
global evolution of solids is controlled by a leaky reservoir of small grains
at large radii, and propose an empirically derived evolution equation for the
total mass of solids, which can be used to estimate the total heavy element
retention efficiency in the planet formation paradigm. Consistency with
observation of the total mass of solids in the Minimum Solar Nebula augmented
with the mass of the Oort cloud sets strong upper limit on the initial grain
size distribution, as well as on the turbulent parameter $\alphat$. Detailed

mass is introduced to treat the infrared divergence caused by the soft
collinear approximation in the endpoint regions, and the Cutkosky rule is
adopted to deal with a physical-region singularity of the on mass-shell quark
propagators. When the dynamical gluon mass $\mu_g$ is regarded as a universal
scale, it is extracted to be around $\mu_g = 440$ MeV from one of the

in 4+1-d. Assuming this to be so, we require the gauge symmetry to be SU(5)in
the bulk, spontaneously breaking to SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) inside the domain wall,
thus dynamically localising the standard model gauge bosons provided that the
SU(5) theory in the bulk exhibits confinement. The wall is created jointly by a
real singlet-Higgs field eta configured as a kink, and an SU(5) adjoint-Higgs
field chi that takes nonzero values inside the wall. Chiral 3+1-dimensional
quarks and leptons are confined and split along the bulk direction via their
Yukawa couplings to eta and chi. The Higgs doublet and its colour triplet SU(5)
partner are similarly localised and split. The splittings suppress
coloured-Higgs-induced proton decay and, because of the different localisation
profiles, the usual SU(5) mass relation m_e = m_d does not arise. Localised

opposite to those observed in the particles prepared in forming gas. The

universal mass function for astronomical objects on all scales. The object
classes considered are: solar system planets and small bodies, exoplanets,
brown dwarfs, stars and stellar remnants, open and globular clusters, molecular
clouds, galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies. For comparison we also
include CDM halos taken from numerical simulations. We show that the mass
functions of individual object classes, when properly normalized, can indeed be
concatenated to build a surprisingly continuous mass function of the universe,
from approximately M = 10^(-20)Msun (sub-kilometer size asteroids) up to M =
10^(16)Msun (rich clusters of galaxies), covering 36 orders of magnitude in
mass. Most individual mass functions roughly follow a power law of the form
phi(M) propto M^(-2). A notable exception are planets and small bodies which
seem to obey a flatter distribution. CDM halos from high-resolution numerical
simulations show a very similar relation, again of universal slope -2, from
clusters of galaxies all the way down to the planetary mass scale. On the scale
of stars and star clusters this is a remarkable coincidence, as the formation
processes involved are thought to be totally different (bottom-up gravitational
clustering of DM halos versus top-down gravoturbulent fragmentation of gas
clouds).

perfect SPS in reality. Therefore, probabilistic SPS where probability of
simultaneous emission of two, three, four and more photon is less than the
emission of a single photon are used. Since classical photon always comes in
bunch, the required single photon source must be nonclassical. In the
well-known antibunched state the rate of simultaneous emission of two photon is
less than that of single photon. But the requirement of quantum cryptography is
a multiphoton version of the antibunched state or the higher order antibunched
state. Recently we have reported a mathematical criterion for higher order
antibunching. Here we have shown that any proposal for SPS to be used in
quantum cryptography should satisfy this criterion. We have studied four wave
mixing as a possible candidate of single photon source.

distributions, whose decoding threshold on the binary erasure channel (BEC)

subset of the check regular distributions (i.e. all the check nodes have the
same degree), and are referred to as $p$-positive distributions. It is given
proof that the threshold for a $p$-positive distribution is simply expressed by
$[\lambda'(0)\rho'(1)]^{-1}$. Besides this closed form threshold expression,
the $p$-positive distributions exhibit three additional properties. First, for
given code rate, check degree and maximum variable degree, they are in some
cases characterized by a threshold which is extremely close to that of the best
known check regular distributions, under the same set of constraints. Second,
the threshold optimization problem within the $p$-positive class can be solved
in some cases with analytic methods, without using any numerical optimization
tool. Third, these distributions can achieve the BEC capacity. The last
property is shown by proving that the well-known binomial degree distributions
belong to the $p$-positive family.

observed 12 HMCs in 21 bands, centered at frequencies from 86250 to 258280 MHz.
The rotational temperatures obtained range from ~100 to ~150 K in these HMCs.
Single Gaussian fits performed to unblended lines show a marginal difference in
the line peak velocities of the C2H5CN and CH3OCH3 lines, indicating a possible
spatial separation between the region traced by the two molecules. On the other
hand, neither the linewidths nor the rotational temperatures and column
densities confirm such a result. By comparing the abundance ratio of the pair
C2H5CN/C2H3CN with the predictions of theoretical models, we derive that the
age of our cores ranges between 3.7 and 5.9x10^{4} yrs. The abundances of
C2H5CN and C2H3CN are strongly correlated, as expected from theory which
predicts that C2H3CN is formed through gas phase reactions involving C2H5CN. A

transmitter, a single receiver and the symmetric and asymmetric interference
channels. Both dynamical and thermodynamical transitions from the ferromagnetic
solution of perfect decoding to a non-ferromagnetic solution are identified for
the cases considered, marking the practical and theoretical limits of the

the typical level of improvement/deterioration achieved with respect to the

on a torus and the massless free Majorana fermion living on the same lattice. A
loop expansion of the fermion determinant is performed, where the loops turn
out to be compositions of two perfect matchings. These loop states are sorted
into co-chain groups using categorification techniques similar to the ones used
for categorifying knot polynomials. The Euler characteristic of the resulting
co-chain complex recovers the Newton polynomial of the dimer model. We
re-interpret this system as supersymmetric quantum mechanics, where
configurations with vanishing net winding number form the ground states.
Finally, we make use of the quiver gauge theory - dimer model correspondence to
obtain an interpretation of the loops in terms of the physics of D-branes
probing a toric Calabi-Yau singularity.

  External System","32 pages, 6 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A small quantum scattering system (the microsystem) is studied in interaction
with a large system (the macrosystem) described by unknown stochastic
variables. The interaction between the two systems is diagonal for the
microsystem in a certain orthonormal basis, and the interaction gives an
imprint on the macrosystem. Moreover, the interaction is assumed to involve
only small transfers of energy and momentum between the two systems (as
compared to typical energies/momenta within the microsystem). The analysis is
carried out within scattering theory. Calculated in the conventional way, the
transition amplitude for the whole system factorizes. The interaction taking
place within the macrosystem is assumed to depend on the stochastic variables
in such a way that, on the average, no particular basis vector state of the
microsystem is favoured. The density matrix is studied in a formalism which
includes generation of the ingoing state and absorption of the final state.
Then the dependence of the final state on the conventional scattering amplitude
for the microsystem is highly non-linear.
  In the thermodynamic limit of the macrosystem, the density matrix of the
ensemble (of microsystem plus macrosystem) develops into a final state which
involves a set of macroscopically distinguishable states, each with the
microsystem in one of the basis vector states and the macrosystem in an
entangled state.
  For an element of the ensemble, i.e., for a single measurement, the result is
instead a random walk, where the microsystem ends up in one of the basis vector
states (reduction of the wave packet).

chemical evolution models. We determine in this paper the star formation
properties of six additional DLA galaxies. The derived results confirm that no
single star formation history explains the diverse sets of abundance patterns
in DLAs. We demonstrate that the various star formation histories reproducing
the DLA abundance patterns are typical of local irregular, dwarf starburst and
quiescent spiral galaxies. Independent of the star formation history, the DLAs
have a common characteristic of being weak star forming galaxies; models with
high star formation efficiencies are ruled out. All the derived DLA star
formation rates per unit area are moderate or low, with values between -3.2 <
log SFR < -1.1 M_sol yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}. The DLA abundance patterns require a
large spread in ages ranging from 20 Myr up to 3 Gyr. The oldest DLA in our
sample is observed at z_DLA=1.864 with an age estimated to more than 3 Gyr; it
nicely indicates that galaxies were already forming at z_f>10. But, most of the
DLAs show ages much younger than that of the Universe at the epoch of
observation. Young galaxies thus seem to populate the high redshift Universe at
z>2, suggesting relatively low redshifts of formation (z~3) for most
high-redshift galaxies. The DLA star formation properties are compared with
those of other high-redshift galaxies identified in deep imaging surveys with
the aim of obtaining a global picture of high-redshift objects.

self-avoidance forces. The GS polymer model is able to describe chromatin
folding in as well the highly expressed domains as the lowly expressed ones,

of genomic domain constitutes an ensemble of relatively compact globular

otherwise identical cells. We present evidence for different polymer folding

of the emission-line bar between the BCG nucleus and the companion galaxy
provides strong evidence for an interaction between the two in the last ~50

the properties of quasi-1D dipolar condensates, even for situations in which
the dipolar interaction would be completely overwhelmed by the short-range

variational schemes have fail points, at where the variational schemes fail to
provide a lower energy (or a lower free energy at $T\neq0$) than the
displaced-oscillator ground state and therefore the variational ground state
becomes unstable, which results in a transition from a variational ground state
to a displaced oscillator ground state when the fail point is reached. Such
transitions are always misidentied as crossover from a delocalized to localized
phases in variational calculations, leading to an artifact of phonon-induced
localization. Physics origin of the fail points and explanations for different
transition behaviors with different spectral functions are found by studying
the fail points of the variational schemes in the single mode case.

$\pi/4\times(2.5)^2\times1 \textrm{cm}^3$, 2 Torr $N_2$ buffered cell. A fully
optical sensor is connected through an optical fiber to the laser head allowing

Component Analysis (PCA) and the Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) based
on Mac-Kay's evidence framework. The PCA takes all the input data and projects
it onto a lower dimension space, thereby reduc-ing the dimension of the input
space. This input reduction method often results with parameters that have
significant influence on the dynamics of the data being diluted by those that
do not influence the dynamics of the data. The ARD selects the most relevant
input parameters and discards those that do not contribute significantly to the
dynamics of the data being modelled. The ARD sometimes results with important
input parameters being discarded thereby compromising the dynamics of the data.
The PCA and ARD methods are implemented together with a Multi-Layer-Perceptron
(MLP) network for fault identification in structures and the performance of the
two methods is as-sessed. It is observed that ARD and PCA give similar
accu-racy levels when used as input-selection schemes. There-fore, the choice
of input-selection scheme is dependent on the nature of the data being
processed.

perform favourably for image registration. SA is the most precise, GA is the
most accurate. PSO is a good mix of both and the Simplex method returns local
minima the most. A pre-processing stage should be investigated for the
evolutionary methods in order to improve performance. Discrete versions of the

abundance of lithium, log n(Li) = 2.91 +/- 0.05. These parameters suggests an
age for the system of 1-3 Gyr and a stellar mass of 1.25-1.35 M_sun. This means
that WASP-1 has properties very similar to those of HD 149026, the host star
for the highest density planet yet detected. Moreover, their planets orbit at
comparable distances and receive comparable irradiating fluxes from their host
stars. However, despite the similarity of WASP-1 with HD 149026, their planets
have strongly different densities. This suggests that gas-giant planet density
is not a simple function of host-star metallicity or of radiation environment
at ages of ~2 Gyr.
