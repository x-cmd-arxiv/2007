(nonintegrable) constrained Ricci flows can be modelled by exact solutions of
Einstein equations with nonhomogeneous (anisotropic) cosmological constants. We
develop two geometric methods for constructing such solutions: The first
approach applies the formalism of nonholonomic frame deformations when the
gravitational evolution and field equations transform into systems of nonlinear
partial differential equations which can be integrated in general form. The
second approach develops a general scheme when one (two) parameter families of
exact solutions are defined by any source-free solutions of Einstein's
equations with one (two) Killing vector field(s). A successive iteration
procedure results in a class of solutions characterized by an infinite number
of parameters for a non-Abelian group involving arbitrary functions on one
variable. We also consider nonlinear superpositions of some mentioned classes
of solutions in order to construct more general integral varieties of the Ricci
flow and Einstein equations depending on infinite number of parameters and
three/ four coordinates on four/ five dimensional (semi) Riemannian spaces.

mode/MAP estimate of a probability distribution. While it has been successfully
employed in a wide variety of applications, there are relatively few
theoretical guarantees of convergence and correctness for general loopy graphs
that may have many short cycles. Of these, even fewer provide exact ``necessary
and sufficient'' characterizations.
  In this paper we investigate the problem of using max-product to find the
maximum weight matching in an arbitrary graph with edge weights. This is done
by first constructing a probability distribution whose mode corresponds to the
optimal matching, and then running max-product. Weighted matching can also be
posed as an integer program, for which there is an LP relaxation. This
relaxation is not always tight. In this paper we show that \begin{enumerate}
\item If the LP relaxation is tight, then max-product always converges, and
that too to the correct answer. \item If the LP relaxation is loose, then
max-product does not converge. \end{enumerate} This provides an exact,
data-dependent characterization of max-product performance, and a precise
connection to LP relaxation, which is a well-studied optimization technique.
Also, since LP relaxation is known to be tight for bipartite graphs, our
results generalize other recent results on using max-product to find weighted
matchings in bipartite graphs.

intensity variation between different (intensity ratios {>300). In addition,
the brightness of the lamps is insufficient to illuminate a spectrograph via an
integrating sphere, which in turn is important to calibrate a long-slit
spectrograph, as this is the only way to assure a uniform illumination of the
spectrograph pupil.
  Laboratory precision laser spectroscopy has experienced a major advance with
the development of optical frequency combs generated by pulsed femto-second

research performs this action for 1-tensor and 2-tensors. This research makes
it possible to develop a new general method for any rank of CKT. This method
can also be applied to other types of Killing equations, as well as to
overdetermined systems constrained by some other conditions.
  The major methodological apparatus of the research is a decomposition of the
section bundles where the covariant derivatives of the CKT land via generalized
gradients. This decomposition generates a tree in which each row represents a
higher derivative. After using the conformal Killing equation, just a few
components (branches) survive, which means that most of them can be expressed
in terms of lower order terms. This results in a finite number of independent
jets. Thus, any higher covariant derivative can be written in terms of these
jets.
  The findings of this work are significant methodologically and, more
specifically, in the potential for the discovery of symmetries. First, this
work has uncovered a new method that could be used to close overdetermined
systems arising from conformal Killing tensors (CKT). Second, through an
application of this method, this research finds higher symmetry operators of
first and second degree, which are known by other means, for the Laplace
operator. The findings also reveal the first order symmetry operators for the
Yamabe case. Moreover, the research leads to conjectures about the second order
symmetries of the Yamabe operator.

fail to explain the high luminosity of Sgr A* a few hundred years ago implied

complete system of metric and matter fields. We propose a complete revision of
the treatment of boundary conditions. An ideal star in our terminology has
spherical symmetry and an isentropic equation of state. In our first work on
this subject it was assumed that the density vanishes beyond a finite distance
from the origin. But it is difficult to decide what the proper boundary
conditions should be and we are consequently skeptical of the concept of a
fixed boundary. In this paper we investigate the double polytrope,
characterized by a polytropic index n less than 5 in the bulk of the star and a
value larger than 5 in an outer atmosphere that extends to infinity. It has no
fixed boundary but a region of critical density where the polytropic index
changes from a value that is appropriate for the bulk of the star to a value
that provides a crude model for the atmosphere. The existence of a relation
between mass and radius is confirmed, as well as an upper limit on the mass.
The principal conclusion is that all the static configurations are stable.

Quantum algorithm finds the target item in a database faster than any classical

sharing some common feature as the target item. This problem is in general
formulated as search for a part of the database [a block] containing the target
item, instead of the item itself. This is partial search. Partial search trades
accuracy for speed, i.e. it works faster than a full search. Partial search
algorithm was discovered by Grover and Radhakrishnan. We shall consider
optimized version of the algorithm and call it GRK. It can be applied
successively [in a sequence]. First the database is partitioned into blocks and
we use GRK to find the target block. Then this target block is partitioned into
sub-blocks and we use GRK again to find the target sub-block. [We can call it
binary quantum search.] Another possibility is to partition the database into
sub-blocks directly and use GRK to find the target sub-block in one time. In

Unlike their equilibrated counterparts, the dynamics of out-of- equilibrium

Here we investigate a system that straddles the boundary between glass and
crystal: a Bragg glass formed by vortices in a superconductor. We find that the
response to an applied force evolves according to a stretched exponential, with
the exponent reflecting the deviation from equilibrium. After the force is
removed, the system ages with time and its subsequent response time scales
linearly with its age (simple ageing), meaning that older systems are slower
than younger ones. We show that simple ageing can occur naturally in the
presence of sufficient quenched disorder. Moreover, the hierarchical
distribution of timescales, arising when chunks of loose vortices cannot move
before trapped ones become dislodged, leads to a stretched-exponential

show that chemical pollution of GC-forming GMCs by stellar winds from massive

(e.g., C, N, and O) of stars in GCs. The present model with a canonical initial
mass function (IMF) also shows a C-N anticorrelation that stars with smaller

context of massive star formation preceding low-mass one within GC-forming GMCs
(``bimodal star formation scenario''). We also show that although almost all
stars (~97%) show normal He abundances (Y) of ~0.24 some stars later formed in
GMCs can have Y as high as ~0.3 in some models. The number fraction of He-rich

networks through a game theoretic approach. The case considered is that in
which each user is allowed to vary its transmit power, spreading code, and
uplink receiver in order to maximize its own utility, which is here defined as
the ratio of data throughput to transmit power. In particular, the case in
which linear multiuser detectors are employed at the receiver is treated first,
and, then, the more challenging case in which non-linear decision feedback
multiuser receivers are adopted is addressed. It is shown that, for both
receivers, the problem at hand of utility maximization can be regarded as a
non-cooperative game, and it is proved that a unique Nash equilibrium point
exists. Simulation results show that significant performance gains can be
obtained through both non-linear processing and spreading code optimization; in
particular, for systems with a number of users not larger than the processing
gain, remarkable gains come from spreading code optimization, while, for
overloaded systems, the largest gainscome from the use of non-linear
processing. In every case, however, the non-cooperative games proposed here are
shown to outperform competing alternatives.

model can be reinterpreted as an obstruction to a global definition of the
associated sheaf of vertex superalgebras derived from the free conformal field
theory describing the model locally on $X$. In addition, one can also obtain a
novel understanding of the sigma model one-loop beta function solely in terms
of holomorphic data. At the $(2,2)$ locus, one can describe the resulting
half-twisted variant of the topological B-model in terms of a $\it{mirror}$

the sheaf cohomology of the mirror CDR to that of the original CDR on pairs of
Calabi-Yau mirror manifolds. An analysis of the half-twisted model on a
non-K\""ahler group manifold with torsion also allows one to draw conclusions
about the corresponding sheaves of CDR (and its mirror) that are consistent

emphasizing the vital role played by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stresses in
transporting angular momentum. The apparent universality of accretion-related
outflow phenomena is a strong indicator that large-scale MHD torques facilitate
vertical transport of angular momentum. This leads to an enhanced overall rate
of angular momentum transport and allows accretion of matter to proceed at an
interesting rate. Furthermore, we argue that when vertical transport is
important, the radial structure of the accretion disk is modified at small
radii and this affects the disk emission spectrum. We present a simple model
demonstrating how energetic, magnetically-driven outflows modify the emergent
disk emission spectrum with respect to that predicted by standard accretion
disk theory. A comparison of the predicted spectra against observations of
quasar spectral energy distributions suggests that mass accretion rates
inferred using the standard disk model may severely underestimate their true

An analytical version of this condition is derived for the case of $(D-1)$ pure

consideration. A number of interesting consequences of this result are then
carefully investigated. Remarkably, we show there exists a large class of

classical communication. Before our work only a class of $3\otimes 3$ nonlocal
separable operations was known [Bennett et al, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{59}, 1070

states, i.e., has an orthogonal Schmidt number not less than 3, thus generalize
the recent work about indistinguishable bipartite subspaces [Watrous, Phys.

decay rate is obtained after an integration over the energy of one of the
emitted photons. Here, we investigate cases with a virtual state having an
energy intermediate between the initial and the final state of the decay
process, and we show that due to non-uniform convergence, only a careful
treatment of the singularities infinitesimally displaced from the photon
integration contour leads to consistent and convergent results.

involving light scalar mesons. Our analysis using the vector meson dominance
model at tree level indicates that it may be difficult to distinguish
$qq\bar{q}\bar{q}$ picture and $q\bar{q}$ picture for the light scalar nonet.
Our result on the process of $\phi \to \pi^0 \eta \gamma$ shows that the
derivative-type $f_0 K\bar{K}$ interaction reproduces experimental data below
950 GeV well, but gives a poor fit above 950 GeV, i.e., in the energy region
around the mass of $a_0(980)$, but that the discrepancy can be compensated by
the effect of the $K$ loop.

in view of the recent observation at the B-factories, where both $\jp$
inclusive and exclusive production rates are found to be about an order of
magnitude larger than the leading order estimates of non-relativistic QCD. The
charm quark fragmentation to $\jp$, which is the dominant color-singlet process
at high $p_T$, is normalized by the B-factory measurements. The process
receives further enhancement due to the charm sea contribution which has so far
been ignored in most analyses. After summing up all sub-process contributions,
we find that the color-singlet mechanism alone can account for 20% to 90% of
the observed direct $\jp$ high $p_T$ production. The polarization rate of the
directly produced $\jp$ is sensitive to the fraction of the color-octet
contribution, which is employed to fill the gap between the color-singlet
prediction and experimental data. With a bigger $K$-factor for the charm quark
fragmentation probability, we envisage a smaller matrix element for the
color-octet $^3S_1^{(8)}$ state, and this can be examined at the LHC in near
future.

integrals of an integrable system is compact and connected, then it is a torus.
However, in some important examples of integrable systems the topology of a
level surface of integrals is quite complicated. This is due to the fact that
in these examples the phase space has points where either the Hamiltonian is
singular or the symplectic form is singular or degenerate. In such situations
the Liouville-Arnold theorem does not apply. However, sometimes it is possible
to define the corresponding flow on the whole level surface of integrals and
use this flow to investigate the topology. Tomei (1982) and Fried (1986) used
the Toda lattice to study the topology of the isospectral variety of Jacobi
matrices. We recall these results and we also expose new results concerning the
topology of the isospectral variety of zero-diagonal Jacobi matrices. This
topology is studied using the Volterra system.

  the title of the article has been modified). To appear in the J. of Algebra","J. Algebra 321 (2009), No. 10, 2705-2715",,,"math.AC",,"  We conjecture that the set of all Hilbert functions of (artinian) level
algebras enjoys a very natural form of regularity, which we call the {\em
Interval Conjecture} (IC): If, for some positive integer $\alpha $,
$(1,h_1,...,h_i,...,h_e)$ and $(1,h_1,...,h_i+\alpha ,...,h_e)$ are both level
$h$-vectors, then $(1,h_1,...,h_i+\beta ,...,h_e)$ is also level for each
integer $\beta =0,1,..., \alpha .$ In the Gorenstein case, i.e. when $h_e=1$,
we also supply the {\em Gorenstein Interval Conjecture} (GIC), which naturally
generalizes the IC, and basically states that the same property simultaneously
holds for any two symmetric entries, say $h_i$ and $h_{e-i}$, of a Gorenstein
$h$-vector.
  These conjectures are inspired by the research performed in this area over
the last few years. A series of recent results seems to indicate that it will
be nearly impossible to characterize explicitly the sets of all Gorenstein or
of all level Hilbert functions. Therefore, our conjectures would at least
provide the existence of a very strong - and natural - form of order in the
structure of such important and complicated sets.
  We are still far from proving the conjectures at this point. However, we will
already solve a few interesting cases, especially when it comes to the IC, in
this paper. Among them, that of Gorenstein $h$-vectors of socle degree 4, that
of level $h$-vectors of socle degree 2, and that of non-unimodal level
$h$-vectors of socle degree 3 and any given codimension.

Electric and magnetic polarization densities of the medium are defined in terms
of the ladder operators of the medium and eigenmodes of the cavity. Maxwell and
constitutive equations of the medium together with the equation of motion of
the charged particles have been obtained from the Heisenberg equations using a
minimal coupling scheme. Spontaneous emission of a two level atom embedded in a

susceptibilities of the medium and the Green function of the cubic cavity as an
application of the model.

the associated chains and Gibbs measures. As an application, we determine
uniqueness and non-uniqueness regimes in one-sided versions of ferromagnetic
Ising models with long range interactions. Our study shows that the interplay
between chain and Gibbsian theories yields more information than that contained
within the known theory of each separate framework. In particular: (i) A
Gibbsian construction due to Dyson yields a new family of chains with phase
transitions; (ii) these transitions show that a square summability uniqueness
condition of chains is false in the general non-shift-invariant setting, and
(iii) an uniqueness criterion for chains shows that a Gibbsian conjecture due
