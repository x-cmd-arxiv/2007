Nebula with the MAGIC telescope. The gamma-ray flux from the nebula was
measured between 60 GeV and 9 TeV. The energy spectrum can be described with a
curved power law dF/dE=f0 (E/300 GeV)^(a+b*log10(E/300 GeV)) with a flux
normalization f0 of(6.0+-0.2)*10^-10 1/(cm^2 s TeV), a=-2.31+-0.06 and
b=-0.26+-0.07. The position of the IC-peak is determined at (77+-47) GeV.
Within the observation time and the experimental resolution of the telescope,
the gamma-ray emission is steady and pointlike. The emission's center of
gravity coincides with the position of the pulsar. Pulsed gamma-ray emission
from the pulsar could not be detected. We constrain the cutoff energy of the
spectrum to be less than 27 GeV, assuming that the differential energy spectrum
has an exponential cutoff. For a super-exponential shape, the cutoff energy can
be as high as 60 GeV.

Pa-alpha line emission, although neither relationship is linear. Simple models
of stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproduce
the observed non-linear trend of the 24 um emission versus number of ionizing
photons, including the modest deficiency of 24 um emission in the low
metallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dust
opacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. Conversely, the trend of the
8 um emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not well
reproduced by the same models. The 8 um emission is contributed, in larger
measure than the 24 um emission, by dust heated by non-ionizing stellar
populations, in agreement with previous findings. Two SFR calibrations, one
using the 24 um emission and the other using a combination of the 24 um and
H-alpha luminosities (Kennicutt et al. 2007), are presented. No calibration is
presented for the 8 um emission, because of its significant dependence on both
metallicity and environment. The calibrations presented here should be directly
applicable to systems dominated by on-going star formation.

binary orbiting one of the stars, preferably the more massive primary. The
dynamical influence of the second companion alters firstly the orbital elements
of the forming protoplanet directly and secondly the structure of the disk from
which the planet formed which in turn will modify the planet's evolution. We
present detailed analysis of these effects and present new hydrodynamical
simulations of the evolution of protoplanets embedded in circumstellar disks in
the presence of a companion star, and compare our results to the system
$\gamma$ Cep. To analyse the early formation of planetary embryos, we follow
the evolution of a swarm of planetesimals embedded in a circumstellar disk.
Finally, we study the evolution of planets embedded in circumbinary disks.

premetric axiomatic approach based on the experimentally well established
conservation laws of electric charge and magnetic flux, the Maxwell equations
are the same irrespective of the presence or absence of gravity. In this sense,
one can say that the charge ""substratum"" and the flux ""substratum"" are not
influenced by the gravitational field directly. However, the interrelation
between these fundamental substrata, formalized as the {\it spacetime relation}
H=H(F) between the 2-forms of the electromagnetic excitation H and the
electromagnetic field strength F, is affected by gravity. Thus the validity of
the equivalence principle for electromagnetism depends on the form of the
spacetime relation. We discuss the nonlocal and local linear constitutive
relations and demonstrate that the spacetime metric can be accompanied also by
skewon, dilaton, and axion fields. All these premetric companions of the metric
may eventually lead to a violation of the equivalence principle.

  The passage Euler is referring to is the ""Excerpta"" in part 6, p. 6 of
Descartes' 1701 ""Opuscula posthuma"".
  Before reading this paper I had not heard of the ""quadratrix"" before, and I
recommend learning a bit about it before reading this. I found Thomas Heath, ""A
history of Greek mathematics"", vol. I, chapter VII to be helpful, in particular
pp. 226-230. The quadratrix is a ""mechanical curve"" that can be used to rectify
the circle. The usual problem of squaring the circle is to construct a square
with the same area (or perimeter) as a given circle, in a finite number of
steps using compass and straightedge. Descartes worked in the reverse
direction: from a given square he constructed the radius of a circle with the
same perimeter, but in an infinite number of steps.
  In this paper Euler reconstructs Descartes' argument and develops some
consequences of it. Euler finds that \[ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} \tan
\frac{1}{2^n}\phi = \frac{1}{\phi} - 2\cot 2\phi. \] Integrating this yields \[
\prod_{n=1}^\infty \sec \frac{1}{2^n} \phi = \frac{2\phi}{\sin 2\phi}. \]

the MARCS stellar atmosphere models, we determine their physical properties and
place them on the H-R diagram for comparison with the predictions of current

they are likely all members of the Clouds rather than foreground dwarfs or halo
giants. Their locations in the H-R diagram also show us that those stars are
cooler than the current evolutionary tracks allow, appearing to the right of
the Hayashi limit, a region in which stars are no longer in hydrodynamic
equilibrium. These stars exhibit considerable variability in their V
magnitudes, and three of these stars also show changes in their effective
temperatures (and spectral types) on the time-scales of months. One of these
stars, [M2002] SMC 055188, was caught in an M4.5 I state, as late as that seen
in HV 11423 at its recent extreme: considerable later, and cooler, than any
other supergiant in the SMC. In addition, we find evidence of variable
extinction due to circumstellar dust and changes in the stars' luminosities,
also consistent with our recent findings for HV 11423 - when these stars are
hotter they are also dustier and more luminous. We suggest that these stars

numerical simulations of the final stages of terrestrial planet formation -
from Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos to planets - in main-sequence binary
star systems. We examine planetary accretion around both stars ('P-type'
circumbinary orbits) or individual stars ('S-type' orbits) in binary systems,
including terrestrial planet formation around each star in Alpha Centauri AB,
the closest binary star system to the Sun. For comparison, we also simulate
planetary growth from the same initial disk placed in the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn
system and also around the Sun with neither giant planets nor a stellar
companion perturbing the system. Our simulations show that giant and stellar
companions not only truncate the disk, but hasten the accretion process by
stirring up the planetary embryos to higher eccentricities and inclinations.
Terrestrial planets similar to those in our Solar System formed around
individual stars in simulations with the binary periastron (closest approach)
greater than about 5 AU. Terrestrial planet growth within circumbinary disks
was uninhibited around inner binary star systems with binary apastrons (maximum
separation) less than ~0.2 AU. Results from our simulations can be scaled for
different stellar and disk parameters. Approximately 50 - 60% of binary star
systems - from contact binaries to separations of nearly a parsec - satisfy
these constraints. Given that the galaxy contains more than 100 billion star
systems, a large number of systems remain habitable based on the dynamic
considerations of this research.

simulations, we find that this model is in excellent agreement with the results
of our simulations. This suggests that preheated efficiently smoothes the
accreted gas, and therefore a shift in the unmodified profile is a good
approximation even with a realistic accretion history. When we examine the
simulation results in detail, we do not find strong evidence for entropy
amplification, at least for the high-redshift preheating model adopted here. In
the second section of the paper, we compare the results of the preheating
simulations to recent observations. We show -- in agreement with previous work
-- that for a reasonable amount of preheating, a satisfactory match can be
found to the mass-temperature and luminosity-temperature relations. However --
as noted by previous authors -- we find that the entropy profiles of the
simulated groups are much too flat compared to observations. In particular,
while rich clusters converge on the adiabatic self--similar scaling at large
radius, no single value of the entropy input during preheating can
simultaneously reproduce both the core and outer entropy levels. As a result,
we confirm that the simple preheating scenario for galaxy cluster formation, in
which entropy is injected universally at high redshift, is inconsistent with
observations.

that of gauge invariant dynamical variables with massive excitations. The
second is that of a decoupled TFT. Through canonical quantization, a
factorization of quantum states arises, enabling the projection from TMGT onto
topological quantum field theories in a most transparent way.

considerable attention because of its simplicity, ease of implementation, and
good space efficiency. Linear tabling is a framework from which different
methods can be derived based on the strategies used in handling looping
subgoals. One decision concerns when answers are consumed and returned. This
paper describes two strategies, namely, {\it lazy} and {\it eager} strategies,
and compares them both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicate
that, while the lazy strategy has good locality and is well suited for finding
all solutions, the eager strategy is comparable in speed with the lazy strategy
and is well suited for programs with cuts. Linear tabling relies on depth-first
iterative deepening rather than suspension to compute fixpoints. Each cluster
of inter-dependent subgoals as represented by a top-most looping subgoal is
iteratively evaluated until no subgoal in it can produce any new answers. Naive
re-evaluation of all looping subgoals, albeit simple, may be computationally
unacceptable. In this paper, we also introduce semi-naive optimization, an
effective technique employed in bottom-up evaluation of logic programs to avoid
redundant joins of answers, into linear tabling. We give the conditions for the
technique to be safe (i.e. sound and complete) and propose an optimization
technique called {\it early answer promotion} to enhance its effectiveness.
Benchmarking in B-Prolog demonstrates that with this optimization linear
tabling compares favorably well in speed with the state-of-the-art
implementation of SLG.

NRAO Green Bank Telescope (GBT). The sample was taken from a larger parent
sample drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Here, the GBT data and
initial results are discussed. Over half (19 out of 30) of all observed
galaxies have detectable 21-cm emission. It was found that both the K+A and
star forming early-type (SFE) galaxies were on average more gas poor than disk
galaxies at the same luminosity while being more gas rich than more typical E
and S0 galaxies with detected 21-cm emission. The gas richness of K+A galaxies
appears to be similar to that of SFE galaxies. The star formation rates and
estimated star formation time scales of the SFE galaxies imply that they are
capable of only marginally changing their atomic hydrogen content. Follow-up
observations are required to explore these same issues in terms of molecular
gas, which is more likely to actively participate in the star formation
process. Kinematic data for the HI gas, the warm ionised gas, and the stars
within the galaxies combined with the SDSS $g$ and $i$ band surface brightness
profiles imply that the atomic hydrogen is most likely spatially coincident
with the star forming regions within ~1 kpc of the galaxies' centres.

limits from the days before discovery combined with the initial rapid

breakout. Optical spectra obtained about 2 days after breakout exhibit narrow
emission lines corresponding to HeII 4200, HeII 4686, and CIV 5805 in the rest
frame, and these features persist in a second observation obtained 5 hours
later; however, these emission lines are not detected the following night nor
in subsequent observations. We suggest that these lines emanate from material
close to the explosion site, possibly in the outer layers of the progenitor
that have been ionized by the high energy photons released at shock breakout. A
P-Cygni profile is observed around 4450 A in the +2 and +3 day spectra.
Previous studies have attributed this feature to high velocity H-beta, but we
discuss the possibility that this profile is instead due to HeII 4687. Further
HET observations (14 nights in total) covering the spectral evolution across
the photometric plateau up to 73 days after breakout and during the nebular
phase around day +340 are presented, and expansion velocities are derived for
key features. The measured decay slope for the unfiltered light curve is 0.0073
+/- 0.0004 mag/day between days +121 and +335, which is significantly slower
than the decay of rate 56Co. We combine our HET measurements with published
X-ray, UV, and optical data to obtain a quasi-bolometric light curve through
day +60. We see a slow cooling over the first 25 days, but no sign of an early
sharp peak; any such feature from the shock breakout must have lasted less than

involving birefringent layers. Previously we have shown that the presence of
birefringent layers with misaligned in-plane anisotropy can dramatically
enhance the performance of the photonic-crystal Fabry-Perot resonator. It
allows to reduce its size by an order of magnitude without compromising on its
performance. The key characteristic of the enhanced photonic-crystal cavity is
that its Bloch dispersion relation displays a degenerate photonic band edge,
rather than only regular ones. This can be realized in specially arranged
stacks of misaligned anisotropic layers. On the down side, the presence of
birefringent layers results in the Fabry-Perot resonance being coupled only
with one (elliptic) polarization component of the incident wave, while the
other polarization component is reflected back to space. In this paper we show
how a small modification of the periodic layered array can solve the above
fundamental problem and provide a perfect impedance match regardless of the
incident wave polarization, while preserving the giant transmission resonance,
characteristic of a degenerate photonic band edge. Both features are of
critical importance for a variety of practical applications, including
antennas, light amplification, optical and microwave filters, etc.

soft X-ray spectral energy distributions using composite models which account
for the photoionizing radiation from HII regions, starbursts, or AGNs, and for
shocks. The models are limited to a set which broadly reproduces the mid-IR
fine structure line ratios of local, IR bright, starburst galaxies. The results
show that two types of clouds contribute to the IR emission. Those
characterized by low shock velocities and low preshock densities explain the
far-IR dust emission, while those with higher velocities and densities
contribute to mid-IR dust emission. An AGN is found in nearly all of the
ultraluminous IR galaxies and in half of the luminous IR galaxies of the

however, most hyperluminous IR galaxies show dust-to-gas ratios much lower than
those calculated for the luminous and ultraluminous IR galaxies.

bed as well as their `minimal size' scales on the flux saturation length. This
length is by definition the relaxation length of the slowest mode toward
equilibrium transport. The model presented by Parteli, Duran and Herrmann
[Phys. Rev. E 75, 011301 (2007)] predicts that the saturation length decreases
to zero as the inverse of the wind shear stress far from the threshold. We
first show that their model is not self-consistent: even under large wind, the
relaxation rate is limited by grain inertia and thus can not decrease to zero.
A key argument presented by these authors comes from the discussion of the
typical dune wavelength on Mars (650 m) on the basis of which they refute the
scaling of the dune size with the drag length evidenced by Claudin and
Andreotti [Earth Pla. Sci. Lett. 252, 30 (2006)]. They instead propose that
Martian dunes, composed of large grains (500 micrometers), were formed in the
past under very strong winds. We show that this saltating grain size, estimated
from thermal diffusion measurements, is not reliable. Moreover, the microscopic
photographs taken by the rovers on Martian aeolian bedforms show a grain size
of 87 plus or minus 25 micrometers together with hematite spherules at
millimetre scale. As those so-called ``blueberries'' can not be entrained by
reasonable winds, we conclude that the saltating grains on Mars are the small
ones, which gives a second strong argument against the model of Parteli et al.

no wipeout effect is observed and the nuclear spin relaxation rate is reduced.

the following conclusions:
  - There cannot exist elementary particles of spin $\hbar/2$ with a mass
inferior to $1m_e$ or with a radius greater than $1l_e$.
  - The electrostatic force derives from the centrifugal forces inherent to the
spin and are propagated by photons.
  - The derivation of the electrostatic force explains the existence of
positive and negative charges and Coulomb's law.
  - The enormous differences between the centrifugal forces and the centripetal
forces at the surface of the protons give rise to quantic fluctuations of space
which generate the energy flows necessary for equilibrium. These energy flows
can explain gravitation and the strong force.
  - The mass of the proton, $m_p$, and the mass of the neutron, $m_n$, must
each have a concrete value required for the cohesion of the atomic nuclei. The
suggested hypoteses show that the relation $m_n/m_p$ must be very slightly

more difficult to reason with than classical constraints, because quantifier
alternation makes the usual notion of solution inappropriate. As a consequence,
basic properties of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), such as consistency

These properties are important because they are the basis of most of the
reasoning methods used to solve classical (existentially quantified)
constraints, and one would like to benefit from similar reasoning methods in
the resolution of quantified constraints. In this paper, we show that most of
the properties that are used by solvers for CSP can be generalized to

particular, we propose a notion of outcome that generalizes the classical
notion of solution and on which all definitions are based. We propose a
systematic study of the relations which hold between these properties, as well
as complexity results regarding the decision of these properties. Finally, and
since these problems are typically intractable, we generalize the approach used
in CSP and propose weaker, easier to check notions based on locality, which
allow to detect these properties incompletely but in polynomial time.

complex than expected from simplified 'quasi-static' theories based upon an
apparent contact angle. Linear stability analysis reveals that below the
critical capillary number of entrainment, Ca_c, the contact line is linearly
stable at all wavenumbers. Away from the critical point the dispersion relation
has an asymptotic behaviour sigma~|q| and compares well to a quasi-static
approach. Approaching Ca_c, however, a different mechanism takes over and the
dispersion evolves from |q| to the more common q^2. These findings imply that
contact lines can not be treated as universal objects governed by some
effective law for the macroscopic contact angle, but viscous effects have to be
treated explicitly.

which exploits a mirror inverting spin chain. Within this scheme the spin chain
is used repeatedly as an entanglement bus (EB) to create multi-partite
entanglement. The noise model we consider comprises of each spin of this EB
being exposed to independent local noise which degrades the capabilities of the
EB. Here we concentrate on quantifying its performance as a single-qubit
channel and as a mediator of a two-qubit entangling gate, since these are basic
operations necessary for graph state generation using the EB. In particular,
for the single-qubit case we numerically calculate the average channel fidelity
and whether the channel becomes entanglement breaking, i.e., expunges any
entanglement the transferred qubit may have with other external qubits. We find
that neither local decay nor dephasing noise cause entanglement breaking. This
is in contrast to local thermal and depolarizing noise where we determine a
critical length and critical noise coupling, respectively, at which
entanglement breaking occurs. The critical noise coupling for local
depolarizing noise is found to exhibit a power-law dependence on the chain
length. For two qubits we similarly compute the average gate fidelity and
whether the ability for this gate to create entanglement is maintained. The
concatenation of these noisy gates for the construction of a five qubit linear
cluster state and a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state indicates that the level
of noise that can be tolerated for graph state generation is tightly
constrained.

state transitions, that of the near-infrared (NIR) flux (which most likely
originates in the jets) versus X-ray flux. We find, looking at existing data
sets, that the infrared emission of black hole X-ray transients appears to be
weaker in the low/hard state rise of an outburst than the low/hard state
decline of an outburst at a given X-ray luminosity. We discuss how this effect
may be caused by a shift in the radiative efficiency of the inflowing or
outflowing matter, or variations in the disc viscosity or the spectrum/power of
the jet. In addition we show that there is a correlation (in slope but not in
normalisation) between infrared and X-ray luminosities on the rise and decline,
for all three low-mass black hole X-ray binaries with well-sampled infrared and
X-ray coverage: L_NIR propto L_x^(0.5-0.7). In the high/soft state this slope
is much shallower; L_NIR propto Lx^(0.1-0.2), and we find that the NIR emission
in this state is most likely dominated by the viscously heated (as opposed to
X-ray heated) accretion disc in all three sources.

objects in the Universe. They exhibit extremely high star formation rates, and
most of them seem to harbour an AGN. They are unique laboratories to
investigate utmost star formation, and its connection to super-massive black
hole growth. X-ray studies of HLIRGs have the potential to unravel the AGN
contribution to the bolometric output from these bright objects.
  We have selected a sample of 14 HLIRGs observed by XMM-Newton (type 1, type 2
AGN and starburst), 5 of which are candidates to be Compton-thick objects. This
is the first time that a systematic study of this type of objects is carried
out in the X-ray spectral band. Their X-ray spectral properties have been
correlated with their IR luminosities, estimated by IRAS, ISO and sub-mm data.
  The X-ray spectra of HLIRGs present heterogeneous properties. All our X-ray
detected HLIRGs (10) have AGN-dominated X-ray spectra. The hard X-ray
luminosity of 8 of them is consistent with a pure AGN contribution, while in
the remaining 2 sources both an AGN and a starburst seem to contribute to the
overall emission. We found soft excess emission in 5 sources. In one of them it
is consistent with a pure starburst origin, while in the other 4 sources it is
consistent with an AGN origin. The observed X-ray emission is systematically
below the one expected for a standard local QSO of the same IR luminosity,
suggesting the possible presence of absorption in type 2 objects and/or a
departure from a standard spectral energy distribution of QSO. The
X-ray-to-IR-luminosity ratio is constant with redshift, indicating similar
evolutions for the AGN and starburst component, and that their respective power
sources could be physically related.

cloning, which can prove costly and time consuming, even with current
sequencing techniques. Our overall objective is to address questions such as:
(i) (Genome detection) Is a known genome sequence present, at least in part, in
an environmental sample? (ii) (Sequence query) Is a specific fragment sequence
present in a sample? (iii) (Similarity discovery) How similar in terms of
sequence content are two unsequenced samples? We propose a method involving
multiple filtering criteria that result in ""pools"" of DNA of high or very high
purity. Because our method is similar in spirit to hashing in computer science,
we call it DNA hash pooling. To illustrate this method, we describe protocols
using pairs of restriction enzymes. The in silico empirical results we present
reflect a sensitivity to experimental error. Our method will normally be
performed as a filtering step prior to sequencing in order to reduce the amount
of sequencing required (generally by a factor of 10 or more). Even as
sequencing becomes cheaper, an order of magnitude remains important.
