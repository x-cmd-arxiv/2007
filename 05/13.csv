transition temperature TC in many high temperature superconductors, is the
center of much debate. Recently, this discussion has focused on the number of
energy gaps in these materials. Some experiments indicate a single energy gap,
implying that the pseudogap is a precursor state. Others indicate two,
suggesting that it is a competing or coexisting phase. Here we report on
temperature dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy of Pb-Bi2Sr2CuO6+x. We
have found a new, narrow, homogeneous gap that vanishes near TC, superimposed
on the typically observed, inhomogeneous, broad gap, which is only weakly
temperature dependent. These results not only support the two gap picture, but
also explain previously troubling differences between scanning tunneling
microscopy and other experimental measurements.

size in order to maximize its own utility while satisfying its delay
quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. The utility function used here measures
the number of reliable bits transmitted per joule of energy consumed, and is
particularly suitable for energy-constrained networks. The best-response

is shown that in order to maximize its utility (in bits per joule), a user must
choose the lowest constellation size that can accommodate the user's delay

efficiency. Using this framework, the tradeoffs among energy efficiency, delay,

finite thickness around a rotating black hole using a novel code. The line is
thought to be produced by iron fluorescence of a relatively cold X-ray
illuminated material in the innermost parts of the accretion disc and provides
an excellent diagnostic of accretion flows in the vicinity of black holes.
Previous studies have concentrated on the case of a thin, Keplerian accretion
disc. This disc must become thicker and sub-Keplerian with increasing accretion
rates. These can affect the line profiles and in turn can influence the
estimation of the accretion disc and black hole parameters from the observed
line profiles. We here embark on, for the first time, a fully relativistic
computation which offers key insights into the effects of geometrical thickness
and the sub-Keplerian orbital velocity on the line profiles. We include all
relativistic effects such as frame-dragging, Doppler boost, time dilation,
gravitational redshift and light bending. We find that the separation and the
relative height between the blue and red peaks of the line profile diminish as
the thickness of the disc increases. This code is also well-suited to produce
accretion disc images. We calculate the redshift and flux images of the
accretion disc and find that the observed image of the disc strongly depends on
the inclination angle. The self-shadowing effect appears remarkable for a high
inclination angle, and leads to the black hole shadow being completely hidden
by the disc itself.

the h-index has a universal growth rate for large numbers of papers, allowing

distinct internal cultures, with different typical rates of publication and

powerful techniques. Recently developed methods, such as the time-dependent
density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) approach or the embedded-cluster
approximation (ECA), rely on the numerical solution of clusters of finite size.
For the interpretation of numerical results, it is therefore crucial to
understand finite-size effects in detail. In this work, we present a careful
finite-size analysis for the examples of one quantum dot, as well as three
serially connected quantum dots. Depending on odd-even effects, physically
quite different results may emerge from clusters that do not differ much in
their size. We provide a solution to a recent controversy over results obtained
with ECA for three quantum dots. In particular, using the optimum clusters
discussed in this paper, the parameter range in which ECA can reliably be
applied is increased, as we show for the case of three quantum dots. As a
practical procedure, we propose that a comparison of results for static
quantities against those of quasi-exact methods, such as the ground-state
density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method or exact diagonalization,
serves to identify the optimum cluster type. In the examples studied here, we
find that to observe signatures of the Kondo effect in finite systems, the best
clusters involving dots and leads must have a total z-component of the spin
equal to zero.

overcomes the asteroid angular velocity. Coherent turning of the jet heads
increases the deflection efficiency. A procession along its surface may
compensate at best the asteroid spin. A small skin-mass (about 2 10^4 tons) may
be ejected by mini nuclear engines. Such prototypes may also build first save
galleries for humans on the Moon. Conclusive deflecting tests might be
performed on remote asteroids. The incoming asteroid 99942 Apophis (just 2% of

described. Its encounter maybe not just a hazard but an opportunity, learning
how to land, dig, build and also to nest save human station inside. Asteroids

Relativity, we analyse the effects that the stellar compactness has on the

the appearance of other dynamical instabilities. By using an extrapolation
technique developed and tested in our previous study [1], we explicitly
determine the threshold for a wide range of compactnesses using four sequences
of models of constant baryonic mass comprising a total of 59 stellar models.
Our calculation of the threshold is in good agreement with the Newtonian
prediction and improves the previous post-Newtonian estimates. In addition, we
find that for stars with sufficiently large mass and compactness, the m=3
deformation is the fastest growing one. For all of the models considered, the
non-axisymmetric instability is suppressed on a dynamical timescale with an m=1
deformation dominating the final stages of the instability. These results,
together with those presented in [1], suggest that an m=1 deformation
represents a general and late-time feature of non-axisymmetric dynamical
instabilities both in full General Relativity and in Newtonian gravity.

integrated soft-magnetic elements that are embedded transverse and adjacent to
the microchannel. The elements are magnetized using an external field, and once
magnetized they produce a magnetic force on blood cells as they flow through
the microchannel. In whole blood, white blood cells (WBCs) behave as
diamagnetic microparticles, while red blood cells (RBCs) exhibit diamagnetic or

  Schupper","Mechanical Properties of Glass Forming Systems",,,"10.1103/PhysRevE.76.052401",,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  We address the interesting temperature range of a glass forming system where
the mechanical properties are intermediate between those of a liquid and a
solid. We employ an efficient Monte-Carlo method to calculate the elastic
moduli, and show that in this range of temperatures the moduli are finite for
short times and vanish for long times, where `short' and `long' depend on the
temperature. By invoking some exact results from statistical mechanics we offer
an alternative method to compute shear moduli using Molecular Dynamics
simulations, and compare those to the Monte-Carlo method. The final conclusion
is that these systems are not ""viscous fluids"" in the usual sense, as their
actual time-dependence concatenates solid-like materials with varying local
shear moduli.

develop a theory on roots, decompositions and genus-surfaces. We apply this
theory to describe an algorithm to list all triangulations of closed surfaces

where the number of vertices is at most 11 and we get theoretical restrictions
on genus-surfaces allowing us to get the list of triangulations of closed
surfaces with at most 11 vertices.

constants, intrigued many scientists, especially Dirac. Relying on the
coincidence of large numbers, Dirac arrived at the revolutionary hypothesis
that the gravitational constant $G$ should vary inversely as the cosmic time
$t$. This hypothesis of Dirac, known as Large Number Hypothesis (LNH), sparked
off many speculations, arguments and new ideas in terms of applications. Works
done by several authors with LNH as their basic platform are reviewed in this
work. Relationship between some of those works are pointed out here.
Possibility of time-variations of physical constants other than $G$ are also
discussed.
