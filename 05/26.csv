f(R,R^abR_ab,R^abcdR_abcd) gravitational theories. It is pointed out that,
despite their fourth-order character, such f(G) gravity models generally cannot
reproduce arbitrary background cosmic evolutions; for example, the standard
LCDM paradigm with Omega_DE = 0.76 cannot be realized in f(G) gravity theories
unless f is a true cosmological constant because it imposes exclusionary
constraints on the form of f(G). We analyze the perturbation equations and find
that, as in f(R) model, the stability of early-time perturbation growth puts
some constraints on the functional form of f(G), in this case d^2 f/d G^2 < 0.
Furthermore, the stability of small-scale perturbations also requires that f
not deviate significantly from a constant. These analyses are illustrated by
numerically propagating the perturbation equations with a specific model
reproducing a representative LCDM cosmic history. Our results show how the f(G)
models are highly constrained by cosmological data.

analysis of real-valued functions on the Boolean cube. In this paper we present
a version of this inequality for matrix-valued functions on the Boolean cube.
Its proof is based on a powerful inequality by Ball, Carlen, and Lieb. We also
present a number of applications. First, we analyze maps that encode $n$
classical bits into $m$ qubits, in such a way that each set of $k$ bits can be
recovered with some probability by an appropriate measurement on the quantum
encoding; we show that if $m<0.7 n$, then the success probability is
exponentially small in $k$. This result may be viewed as a direct product
version of Nayak's quantum random access code bound. It in turn implies strong
direct product theorems for the one-way quantum communication complexity of
Disjointness and other problems. Second, we prove that error-correcting codes
that are locally decodable with 2 queries require length exponential in the
length of the encoded string. This gives what is arguably the first
``non-quantum'' proof of a result originally derived by Kerenidis and de Wolf
using quantum information theory, and answers a question by Trevisan.

quantifying the effect that each parameter has on first the detection of
gravitational waves and then the parameter estimation of their sources
increases. In light of this, we present a study of equal-mass, spinning
binary-black-hole evolutions through matched filtering techniques commonly used

with numerical resolution, initial angular momentum of the black holes and the
inclination angle between the source and the detector. This study is limited by
the fact that the spinning black-hole-binaries are oriented axially and the
waveforms only contain approximately two and a half orbits before merger. We
find that for detection purposes, spinning black holes require the inclusion of
the higher harmonics in addition to the dominant mode, a condition that becomes
more important as the black-hole-spins increase. In addition, we conduct a
preliminary investigation of how well a template of fixed spin and inclination
angle can detect target templates of arbitrary spin and inclination for the
axial case considered here.

whether the super-massive black holes powering these QSOs grew out from the
seeds planted by the first intermediate massive black holes created in the
universe. This question involves a dynamical range of 10^13 in mass and we
address it by combining N-body simulations of structure formation to identify
the most massive halos at z~6 with a Monte Carlo method based on linear theory
to obtain the location and formation times of the first light halos within the
whole simulation box. We show that the descendants of the first ~10^6 Msun
virialized halos do not, on average, end up in the most massive halos at z~6,
but rather live in a large variety of environments. The oldest PopIII
progenitors of the most massive halos at z~6, form instead from density peaks
that are on average one and a half standard deviations more common than the
first PopIII star formed in the volume occupied by one bright high-z QSO. The
intermediate mass black hole seeds planted by the very first PopIII stars at
z>40 can easily grow to masses m_BH>10^9.5 Msun by z=6 assuming Eddington
accretion with radiative efficiency \epsilon~0.1. Quenching of the black hole
accretion is therefore crucial to avoid an overabundance of supermassive black
holes at lower redshift. This can be obtained if the mass accretion is limited
to a fraction \eta~6*10^{-3} of the total baryon mass of the halo hosting the
black hole. The resulting high end slope of the black hole mass function at z=6
is \alpha ~ -3.7, a value within the 1\sigma error bar for the bright end slope
of the observed quasar luminosity function at z=6.

ejecta (PE) to produce the ""Mystery Spot"" (MS). The SN flash takes an extra 8 d
to hit the MS, and this was confirmed at 2e39 ergs/s in the optical at day 8. A
ramp in luminosity starting near day 10 indicates particles from the BJ hitting
the PE, with the fastest particles traveling at 0.8 c, and an upper limit for
the optical luminosity of the MS of 5e40 ergs/s at day 20. The details of SN
1987A strongly suggest that it resulted from a merger of 2 stellar cores of a
common envelope (CE) binary, i.e. a ""double-degenerate"" (DD)-initiated SN, and
is thus the Rosetta Stone for 99% of MSPs in the non-core-collapsed globular
clusters, GRBs, and SNe, including all recent nearby SNe except SN 1986J and
the more distant SN 2006gy. Without having to blast through the CE of Sk -69
202, it is likely that the BJ would have caused a full, long-soft gamma-ray
burst (lGRB) upon hitting the PE, thus DD can produce lGRBs. The typical 0.5
deg collimation of a GRB, over the 22 lt-d from SN 1987A to its PE, produces
~100 s of delay, MATCHING the observed delay of the non-prompt parts of lGRBs.
Because DD must be the dominant SN mechanism in elliptical galaxies, where only
short, hard GRBs (sGRBs) have been observed, DD without CE or PE must also make
sGRBs, thus the initial photon spectrum of 99% of ALL GRBs is KNOWN, & neutron
star (NS)-NS mergers may not make GRBs as we know them. Observations of Ia's
strongly suggest that these are also DD, implying another systematic effect in
Ia Cosmology, as Ia's will appear to be Ic's when viewed from their DD merger
poles, given sufficient matter above that lost to core- collapse (otherwise it
would just beg the question of what ELSE they could possibly be). There is no
need to invent exotica, such as collapsars or hypernovae, to account for GRBs.

very-high energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission from SNRs. However, if the gas cloud
is located at some distance from the SNR shock, this assumption is not
necessarily correct. In this case, the particles which interact with the cloud
are those leaking from the shock and their spectrum is approximately
monoenergetic with the injection energy gradually decreasing as the SNR ages.
In the GLAST energy range the gamma-ray spectrum resulting from particle
interactions with the gas cloud will be flatter than expected, with the cutoff
defined by the pion momentum distribution in the laboratory frame. We evaluate
the flux of particles escaping from a SNR shock and apply the results to the

  Complexity and System Science",,,,"math.OC",,"  Discrete control systems, as considered here, refer to the control theory of
discrete-time Lagrangian or Hamiltonian systems. These discrete-time models are
based on a discrete variational principle, and are part of the broader field of
geometric integration. Geometric integrators are numerical integration methods
that preserve geometric properties of continuous systems, such as conservation
of the symplectic form, momentum, and energy. They also guarantee that the
discrete flow remains on the manifold on which the continuous system evolves,
an important property in the case of rigid-body dynamics.
  In nonlinear control, one typically relies on differential geometric and
dynamical systems techniques to prove properties such as stability,
controllability, and optimality. More generally, the geometric structure of
such systems plays a critical role in the nonlinear analysis of the
corresponding control problems. Despite the critical role of geometry and
mechanics in the analysis of nonlinear control systems, nonlinear control
algorithms have typically been implemented using numerical schemes that ignore
the underlying geometry.
  The field of discrete control system aims to address this deficiency by
restricting the approximation to choice of a discrete-time model, and
developing an associated control theory that does not introduce any additional
approximation. In particular, this involves the construction of a control
theory for discrete-time models based on geometric integrators that yields
numerical implementations of nonlinear and geometric control algorithms that
preserve the crucial underlying geometric structure.

abruptly collapses into a small set of preferred proteins. We observe that
protein folds remain stable and abundant in the population at time scales much
greater than mutation or organism lifetime, and the distribution of the
lifetimes of dominant folds in a population approximately follows a power law.
The separation of evolutionary time scales between discovery of new folds and
generation of new sequences gives rise to emergence of protein families and
superfamilies whose sizes are power-law distributed, closely matching the same
distributions for real proteins. On the population level we observe emergence
of species, subpopulations which carry similar genomes. Further we present a

rough expression brings on that the solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation and
the Dirac equation with the Coulomb potential are divergent at the origin of
the coordinates, also the virtual energies, when the nuclear charges number Z >
137, meaning the original solutions do not satisfy the conditions for
determining solution. Any divergences of the wave functions also imply that the
probability density of the meson or the electron would rapidly increase when
they are closing to the atomic nucleus. What it predicts is not a truth that
the atom in ground state would rapidly collapse to the neutron-like. We
consider that the atomic nucleus has definite radius and write the exact
boundary condition for the hydrogen and hydrogen-like atom, then newly solve
the radial Dirac-Coulomb equation and obtain a new exact solution without any
mathematical and physical difficulties. Unexpectedly, the K value constructed
by Dirac is naturally written in the barrier width or the equivalent radius of
the atomic nucleus in solving the Dirac equation with the exact boundary
condition, and it is independent of the quantum energy. Without any divergent
wave function and the virtual energies, we obtain a new formula of the energy
levels that is different from the Dirac formula of the energy levels in the

ejections (CMEs). In the framework of the flux rope catastrophe model for CMEs,
the energy may be abruptly released either by an ideal magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) catastrophe, which belongs to a global magnetic topological instability
of the system, or by a fast magnetic reconnection across preexisting or
rapidly-developing electric current sheets. Both ways of magnetic energy
release are thought to be important to CME dynamics. To disentangle their
contributions, we construct a flux rope catastrophe model in the corona and
solar wind and compare different cases in which we either prohibit or allow
magnetic reconnection to take place across rapidly-growing current sheets
during the eruption. It is demonstrated that CMEs, even fast ones, can be
produced taking the ideal MHD catastrophe as the only process of magnetic
energy release. Nevertheless, the eruptive speed can be significantly enhanced
after magnetic reconnection sets in. In addition, a smooth transition from slow
to fast eruptions is observed when increasing the strength of the background
magnetic field, simply because in a stronger field there is more free magnetic
energy at the catastrophic point available to be released during an eruption.
This suggests that fast and slow CMEs may have an identical driving mechanism.

solar corona so as to create solar explosions such as solar flares and coronal
mass ejections (CMEs). Recent studies have confirmed that a system consisting
of a flux rope embedded in a background field exhibits a catastrophic behavior,
and the energy threshold at the catastrophic point may exceed the associated
open field energy. The accumulated free energy in the corona is abruptly
released when the catastrophe takes place, and it probably serves as the main
means of energy release for CMEs at least in the initial phase. Such a release
proceeds via an ideal MHD process in contrast with nonideal ones such as
magnetic reconnection. The catastrophe results in a sudden formation of
electric current sheets, which naturally provide proper sites for fast magnetic
reconnection. The reconnection may be identified with a solar flare associated
with the CME on one hand, and produces a further acceleration of the CME on the
other. On this basis, several preliminary suggestions are made for future
observational investigations, especially with the proposed KuaFu satellites, on
the roles of the MHD catastrophe and magnetic reconnection in the magnetic
energy release associated with CMEs and flares.

two phases and the surface tension vanish, but the isothermal magnetic
susceptibility does not diverge in the mean field theory. We also investigate
phase ordering numerically.

4-dimensional Lorentzian general relativity motivated by the canonical
quantization. The starting point is Lorentz covariant loop quantum gravity. Its
kinematical Hilbert space is found as a space of the so-called projected spin
networks. These spin networks are identified with the boundary states of a spin
foam model and provide a generalization of the unique Barrette-Crane
intertwiner. We propose a way to modify the Barrett-Crane quantization
procedure to arrive at this generalization: the B field (bi-vectors) should be
promoted not to generators of the gauge algebra, but to their certain
projection. The modification is also justified by the canonical analysis of
Plebanski formulation. Finally, we compare our construction with other
proposals to modify the Barret-Crane model.

universe is undergoing a late-time acceleration, the mechanism of this
acceleration is yet unknown. In the so-called thick brane model this phenomena
is attributed to the thickness of the brane along the extra dimension. In this
study we mainly rely to the consistency of this model with most recent
observational data related to the background evolution. The new Supernova Type
Ia (SNIa) Gold sample and Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) data, the position of
the acoustic peak at the last scattering surface from the WMAP observations and
the baryon acoustic oscillation peak found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) are used to constrain the free parameter of the thick codimension 1
brane model. To infer its consistency with age of our universe, we compare the
age of old cosmological objects with what computed using the best fit values
for the model parameters. When the universe is matter dominated, $w=0$, at 68%
level of confidence, the combination of Gold sample SNIa, CMB shift parameter
and SDSS databases provides $\Omega_m=0.31_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$,
$\Omega_{\cal{C}}=0.05_{-0.01}^{+0.01}$, $w_r=-1.40_{-0.20}^{+0.20}$, hence a
spatially open universe with $\Omega_k=0.21_{-0.08}^{+0.08}$. The same
combination with SNLS supernova observation gives
$\Omega_m=0.28_{-0.02}^{+0.03}$, $\Omega_{\cal{C}}=0.037_{-0.004}^{+0.003}$,
$w_r=-2.05_{-0.15}^{+0.15}$ consequently provides a spatially open universe
$\Omega_k=0.11_{-0.07}^{+0.10}$. These results obviously seem to be in
contradiction with the most recent WMAP results indicating a flat universe.

of years and in an amazing variety of circumstances. At its core is a system
for acquiring, processing and communicating information that is universal, from
viruses and bacteria to human beings. Advances in genetics and experience in
designing computers have taken us to a stage where we can understand the
optimisation principles at the root of this system, from the availability of
basic building blocks to the execution of tasks. The languages of DNA and
proteins are argued to be the optimal solutions to the information processing
tasks they carry out. The analysis also suggests simpler predecessors to these
languages, and provides fascinating clues about their origin. Obviously, a
comprehensive unraveling of the puzzle of life would have a lot to say about
what we may design or convert ourselves into.

conclude in particular that all relevant skeletons are of first order in the

equivalent to identities between n-graviton scattering amplitudes which
generalize the Slavnov Taylor identities. These identities map the infinite
number of charges and finite numbers of skeletons in gravity to an infinite
number of skeletons and a finite number of charges needing renormalization. Our
analysis suggests that gravity, regarded as a probability conserving but
perturbatively non-renormalizable theory, is renormalizable after all, thanks
to the structure of its Dyson--Schwinger equations.

spirit of Mackey, Gudder, Ballentine) to represent and to generalize some
results of quantum logic about possible macroscopic quantum-like (QL)
behaviour. The crucial point is that our model provides QL-representation of
macroscopic configurations in terms of complex probability amplitudes -- wave
functions of such configurations. Thus, instead of the language of propositions
which is common in quatum logic, we use the language of wave functions which is
common in the conventional presentation of QM. We propose a quantum-like
representation algorithm, QLRA, which maps probabilistic data of any origin in
complex (or even hyperbolic) Hilbert space. On the one hand, this paper
clarifyes some questions in foundations of QM, since some rather mystical
quantum features are illustrated on the basis of behavior of macroscopic
systems. On the other hand, the approach developed in this paper may be used
e.g. in biology, sociology, or psychology. Our example of QL-representation of
hidden macroscopic configurations can find natural applications in those
domains of science.
