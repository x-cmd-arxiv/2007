beyond the tidal radius of Leo II (8.63 arcmin), down to the limiting magnitude
of V ~26, which is roughly 1 mag deeper than the turn-off point of the main
sequence stars of Leo II. Radial number density profiles of bright and faint
red giant branch (RGB) stars were found to change their slopes at around the
tidal radius, and extend beyond the tidal radius with shallower slopes. A
smoothed surface brightness map of Leo II suggests the existence of a small
substructure of globular cluster luminosity beyond the tidal radius. We
investigated the properties of the stellar population by means of the
color-magnitude diagram. The horizontal branch (HB) morphology index shows a
radial gradient in which red HB stars are more concentrated than blue HB stars,
which is common to many Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The color
distribution of RGB stars around the mean RGB sequence shows a larger
dispersion at the center than in the outskirts, indicating a mixture of stellar
populations at the center and a more homogeneous population in the outskirts.
Based on the age estimation using subgiant branch (SGB) stars, we found that
although the major star formation took place ~8 Gyr ago, a considerable stellar
population younger than 8 Gyr is found at the center; such a younger population
is insignificant in the outskirts.

push a particle sitting on the track. We use a novel fluctuating-frame,

  consequences","Brain metabolism scales with its mass well above 3/4 exponent","BMC Biology 5:18 (2007)",,,"q-bio.NC q-bio.TO",,"  Background: Information processing in the brain requires large amounts of
metabolic energy, the spatial distribution of which is highly heterogeneous
reflecting complex activity patterns in the mammalian brain.
  Results: Here, it is found based on empirical data that, despite this
heterogeneity, the volume-specific cerebral glucose metabolic rate of many
different brain structures scales with brain volume with almost the same
exponent around -0.15. The exception is white matter, the metabolism of which
seems to scale with a standard specific exponent -1/4. The scaling exponents
for the total oxygen and glucose consumptions in the brain in relation to its
volume are identical and equal to $0.86\pm 0.03$, which is significantly larger
than the exponents 3/4 and 2/3 suggested for whole body basal metabolism on
body mass.
  Conclusions: These findings show explicitly that in mammals (i)
volume-specific scaling exponents of the cerebral energy expenditure in
different brain parts are approximately constant (except brain stem
structures), and (ii) the total cerebral metabolic exponent against brain
volume is greater than the much-cited Kleiber's 3/4 exponent. The
neurophysiological factors that might account for the regional uniformity of
the exponents and for the excessive scaling of the total brain metabolism are
discussed, along with the relationship between brain metabolic scaling and
computation.

coupling the Standard Model sector with the Stueckelberg sector. Coupled with
the usual Higgs mechanism that breaks the $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ gauge
symmetry, this scenario produces mixings in the neutral gauge boson sector
generating an extra $Z'$ boson. The couplings of the extra $Z'$ to the Standard
Model particles are milli weak but its couplings to the hidden sector matter,

possibility of leading to a sharp $Z' $ resonance, lead to two new types of
dark matter: milli weak (or extra weak) and milli charged. An analysis of the
relic density shows that the WMAP-3 constraints can be satisfied for either of

to have the lowest magnetic field strength (7 MG) of any known polar. We find
evidence for structure in the X-ray eclipse profile which shows a `standstill'
feature lasting 26+/-4 sec. This allows us to place an upper limit on the mass
of the white dwarf of ~1.2 Msun. We find no evidence for QPOs in the frequency
range 0.02-10 Hz. This coupled with the absence of QPOs in RXTE data suggest
that, if present, any oscillations in the shock front have a minimal effect on
the resultant X-ray flux. We find no evidence for a distinct soft X-ray
component in its spectrum - it therefore joins another 7 systems which do not
show this component. We suggest that those systems which are asynchronous, have
low mass transfer rates, or have accretion occurring over a relatively large
fraction of the white dwarf are more likely to show this effect. We find that
the specific mass transfer rate has to be close to 0.1 g cm^-2 s^-1 to predict
masses which are consistent with that derived from our eclipse analysis. This

function (CMF) of the region; we find that the mass at which the core mass

~0.5 Msun to ~1Msun. In contrast with the CMF in other star forming regions
(e.g. Orion), there is no indication for a turnover down to the completeness
limit (~0.2Msun), but the CMF may flatten at around ~0.4Msun. We generalize our
results to the prestellar cores in Taurus and in Orion. In Taurus the ambient
radiation field heating the prestellar cores is believed to be weaker than than
that in rho Oph. Hence, the dust temperatures of the cores in Taurus are
expected to be below ~ 10-11 K.In Orion the radiation field is believed to be
10^3 times stronger than the standard interstellar radiation field. Based on
this assumption we estimate that the dust temperatures of the prestellar cores

temperatures Tk=80-150 K. Both HNC and HC3N are, however, significantly more
excited than the other species which requires higher gas densities - or
radiative excitation through e.g. mid-IR pumping. The HCN line intensity is
fainter than that of HCO+ and HNC for the 3-2 transition, in contrast to
previous findings for the 1-0 lines where the HCN emission is the most
luminous. We tentatively suggest that the observed molecular line emission is
consistent with a young starburst, where the emission can be understood as
emerging from dense, warm gas with an additional PDR component. We find that
X-ray chemistry is not required to explain the observed mm line emission,
including the HCN/HCO+ 1-0 and 3-2 line ratios. The luminous HC3N line emission
is an expected signature of dense, starforming gas. A deeply buried AGN can not
be excluded, but its impact on the surrounding molecular medium is then
suggested to be limited. However, detailed modelling of HC3N abundances in

properties of non-Abelian systems. These issues arise in condensed matter
physics in the context of transport of spins in the presence of spin orbit
coupling: the Pauli Hamiltonian governing the leading relativistic corrections
in condensed matter systems can be rewritten in a language of SU(2) covariant
derivatives, where the role of the non-Abelian gauge fields is taken by the
physical electromagnetic fields. Taking a similar perspective as Jackiw and
coworkers, we show that non-abelian hydrodynamical currents can be factored in
a non-coherent 'classical' part, and a coherent part requiring macroscopic
non-abelian quantum entanglement. Non-abelian flow being thus a much richer
affair than familiar hydrodynamics, permits us to classify the various spin
transport phenomena in in condensed matter physics in a unifying framework.In
semiconductor spintronics, the absence of hydrodynamics is well known, but in
our formulation it is directly associated with the fact that non-abelian
currents are only covariantly conserved.We analyze the quantum mechanical
single particle currents of relevance to mesoscopic transport with as highlight
the Aharonov-Casher effect, where we demonstrate that the non-abelian transport
structure renders it much more fragile than its abelian counterpart, the
Aharonov-Bohm effect. We subsequently focus on spin flows protected by order
parameters, of which the spin-spiral magnets and the spin superfluids are
important examples. The surprising bonus is that the presence of an order
parameter, being single-valued, restores hydrodynamics. We demonstrate a new
effect: the trapping of electrical line charge, being the 'fixed frame'
non-Abelian analogue of the familiar magnetic flux trapping by superconductors.

the unstable equilibrium points of the rotating bar potential. Thus, spirals,
rings and pseudo-rings are related to the invariant manifolds associated to the
periodic orbits around these equilibrium points. We examine the parameter space
of three barred galaxy models and discuss the formation of the different
morphological structures according to the properties of the bar model. We also
study the influence of the shape of the rotation curve in the outer parts, by
making families of models with rising, flat, or falling rotation curves in the
outer parts. The differences between spiral and ringed structures arise from
differences in the dynamical parameters of the host galaxies. The results
presented here will be discussed and compared with observations in a
forthcoming paper.

structure at 18.7 micron, and is dominated by very strong emission from
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at shorter wavelengths. This allows a detailed
study of the relative distributions of small and large dust grains.
  Images of IRS 48 in 5 mid-infrared bands from 8.6 to 18.7 micron as well as a
low resolution N-band spectrum are obtained with VLT-VISIR. Optical
spectroscopy is used to determine the spectral type of the central star and to
measure the strength of the Halpha line.
  The 18.7 micron ring peaks at a diameter of 110 AU, with a gap of ~ 60 AU.
The shape of the ring is consistent with an inclination of i = 48 +- 8 degrees.
In contrast, the 7.5-13 micron PAH emission bands are centered on the source
and appear to fill the gap within the ring. The measured PAH line strengths are
10-100x stronger than those typically measured for young M0 stars and can only
be explained with a high PAH abundance and/or strong excess optical/UV
emission. The morphology of the images, combined with the absence of a silicate
emission feature, imply that the inner disk has been cleared of micron-sized
dust but with a significant population of PAHs remaining. We argue that the gap
can be due to grain growth and settling or to clearing by an unseen planetary
or low-mass companion. IRS 48 may represent a short-lived transitional phase
from a classical to a weak-line T Tauri star.

XBS survey (which is 86% optically identified) showing an optical spectrum
dominated by the light from the host galaxy with no evidence (or little
evidence) for the presence of an AGN. METHODS: We use the X-ray spectral
analysis to assess the presence of an AGN in these sources and to characterize
its properties. RESULTS: We detect AGN activity in 33 out of 35 sources. The
remaining 2 sources are the ones with the lowest X-ray luminosity in the sample
(L[2-10keV]<10^41 erg s^-1) and their X-ray emission could be produced within
the host galaxy. We find that the ``recognition problem'' for AGN is very
critical in the low-luminosity regime (at least 60% of the AGN with
L[2-10keV]<10^43 erg s^-1 are elusive) becoming negligible for high X-ray
luminosities (~1.5% of elusive AGN with L[2-10keV]>10^44 erg s^-1). This
problem affects mostly absorbed AGN (~40% of type~2 AGN in the survey are
elusive) but also a significant fraction of unabsorbed AGN (8%). CONCLUSIONS:
We find that the simplest explanations of why these 33 (or most of them) AGNs
are elusive are two: at low X-ray luminosities (<10^43 erg s^-1) the most
important reason is the intrinsically low AGN/galaxy contrast (optical
dilution) while at high luminosities (>10^44 erg s^-1) it is due to the optical
absorption (in the Compton-thin regime, i.e. NH<10^24 cm^-2). Alternative
hypotheses, like the presence of Compton-thick sources, BL Lac objects or
``non-standard'' AGN (e.g. with alpha_OX<1 or with weak/absorbed Narrow Line
Region) are not supported by the data although we cannot exclude the presence
in the sample of a few sources of these types.

frequencies this mirror moves together with the arm-cavity end mirror, under
the influence of gravitational waves. This scheme improves the low-frequency
quantum-noise-limited sensitivity of optical-spring interferometers
significantly and can be considered as a incorporation of the optical-bar
scheme into currently planned second-generation interferometers. On the other
hand it can be regarded as an extension of the optical bar scheme. Taking
compact-binary inspiral signals as an example, we illustrate how this scheme
can be used to improve the sensitivity of the planned Advanced LIGO
interferometer, in various scenarios, using a realistic classical-noise budget.
We also discuss how this scheme can be implemented in Advanced LIGO with
relative ease.

specifically, we study the behavior of the viscosity (and its frequency
dependence) on approaching the repulsive glass, the attractive glass and in the
re-entrant region where viscosity shows a non monotonic behavior on increasing
attraction strength. On approaching the glass lines, the increase of the
viscosity is consistent with a power-law divergence with the same exponent and
critical packing fraction previously obtained for the divergence of the density
fluctuations. Based on mode-coupling calculations, we associate the increase of
the viscosity with specific contributions from different length scales. We also
show that the results are independent on the microscopic dynamics by comparing
newtonian and brownian simulations for the same model. Finally we evaluate the
Stokes-Einstein relation approaching both glass transitions, finding a clear
breakdown which is particularly strong for the case of the attractive glass.

how an equation for the two point correlations can be derived from the

hydrodynamics, this approach can be used to derive equations for correlations
of any order. Generically, the solutions of the equation for the correlation

common feature of nonequilibrium systems. Finally, we establish a criterion to
determine whether the local thermodynamic variables are positively or
negatively correlated in terms of properties of the transport coefficients.

characterized by massive GMCs with elevated gas temperatures, compared to their
dust temperatures. We note an association between methanol masers and a class
of mid-infrared ``green sources''. These highly embedded YSOs show enhanced
4.5micron emission due to excited molecular lines. The distribution of methanol
masers and supernova remnants suggest a low efficiency of star formation (with
the exception of Sgr B2), which we believe is due to an enhanced flux of cosmic

the importance of cosmic rays in their ability to heat molecular clouds, and
