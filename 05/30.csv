to satisfy an extension of the holomorphic anomaly equation of Bershadsky,
Cecotti, Ooguri and Vafa. The total topological charge of the D-brane

models with a bulk scalar field. The setup considered here consists of a 5-D
bulk spacetime bounded by two 4-D branes localized at the fixed points of an
$S^1/Z_2$ orbifold. There is a scalar field $\phi$ in the bulk which, provided
a superpotential $W(\phi)$, determines the warped geometry of the 5-D
spacetime. This type of scenario is common in string theory, where the bulk
scalar field $\phi$ is related to the volume of small compact extra dimensions.
We show that, after the moduli are stabilized by supersymmetry breaking terms
localized on the branes, the only relevant degrees of freedom in the bulk
consist of a 5-D massive spectrum of gravitons. Then we analyze the
gravitational interaction between massive bodies localized at the positive
tension brane mediated by these bulk gravitons. It is shown that the Newtonian
potential describing this interaction picks up a non-trivial contribution at
short distances that depends on the shape of the superpotential $W(\phi)$. We
compute this contribution for dilatonic braneworld scenarios $W(\phi) =
e^{\alpha \phi}$ (where $\alpha$ is a constant) and discuss the particular case
of 5-D Heterotic M-theory: It is argued that a specific footprint at micron

the 100th anniversary of Albert Einstein's legendary works in which the
foundations of at least three areas of modern physics were laid: statistical
mechanics, quantum mechanics and special relativity. These works turned year
1905 in what deservedly was called the ""miraculous year"" (annus mirabilis) of
Einstein. However, the influence of this great mind was not limited to science.
As it is well known, his fingerprint remains engraved in many aspects of our
daily life. Because of that, in this work we have tried to cover almost all the
subjects in which Einstein was involved during the last century and, of course,
try and reveal the future projection his actions will have in this new century
that has just begun. Among the subjects covered in the volume one can find the
possible connection between Einstein and the artistic vanguard movement, his
religiosity, his days in Argentina, the Nobel Prize, the Einstein-Freud
correspondence, his pacifism and the nuclear energy, science and politics under
the Second Empire and the Weimar Republic, and even a description of his
patents and experiments, the studies performed to search for ""built-in""
features in his brain and the doubts many had regarding whether Einstein was a
genius or a crank. Also included are essays on Einstein and Borges, philosophy
and relativity, Mach's principle, the relation among science, arts and
humanities, and, closer to Einstein's own theoretical research, the twin
paradox, chance and quantum mechanics, the arrow of time, gravitational lenses,
string theory, holography and black holes, gravitomagnetism, superconductivity,
gravitational waves, the photoelectric effect and the alternative theories for
gravitation.

galactic nuclei containing highly relativistic jets with apparent speeds from
$\sim$4 $c$ to $>40c$. The measurements were obtained at optical, 1 mm, and 3
mm wavelengths, and at 7 mm with the Very Long Baseline Array. The data show a
wide range in degree of linear polarization among the sources, from $<$1% to
$>$30%, and interday polarization variability in individual sources. The
polarization properties suggest separation of the sample into three groups with
low, intermediate, and high variability of polarization in the core at 7 mm :
LVP, IVP, and HVP, respectively. The groups are partially associated with the
common classification of active galactic nuclei as radio galaxies and quasars
with low optical polarization (LVP), BL Lacertae objects (IVP), and highly
optically polarized quasars (HVP). Our study investigates correlations between
total flux, fractional polarization, and polarization position angle at the
different wavelengths. We interpret the polarization properties of the sources
in the sample through models in which weak shocks compress turbulent plasma in
the jet. The differences in the orientation of sources with respect to the
observer, jet kinematics, and abundance of thermal matter external to the jet
near the core can account for the diversity in the polarization properties. The
results provide strong evidence that the optical polarized emission originates
in shocks, most likely situated between the 3 mm and 7 mm VLBI cores. They also
support the idea that the 1 mm core lies at the edge of the transition zone
between electromagnetically dominated and turbulent hydrodynamical sections of
the jet.

detonate. Although it is too distant to pose a serious threat as a normal
supernova, and given its rotation axis is unlikely to produce a Gamma-Ray Burst
oriented toward the Earth, eta Carinae is about 30,000 times nearer than
2006gy, and we re-evaluate it as a potential superluminous supernova. We find
that given the large ratio of emission in the optical to the X-ray, atmospheric
effects are negligible. Ionization of the atmosphere and concomitant ozone
depletion are unlikely to be important. Any cosmic ray effects should be spread
out over ~10^4 y, and similarly unlikely to produce any serious perturbation to
the biosphere. We also discuss a new possible effect of supernovae, endocrine
disruption induced by blue light near the peak of the optical spectrum. This is
a possibility for nearby supernovae at distances too large to be considered
""dangerous"" for other reasons. However, due to reddening and extinction by the
interstellar medium, eta Carinae is unlikely to trigger such effects to any
significant degree.

function (LF) of galaxies by invoking mechanisms to suppress star formation in
low- and high-mass galaxies. As these models are optimized to fit the LF at low
redshift, a crucial question is how well they predict the LF at earlier times.
Here we compare recently measured rest-frame V-band LFs of galaxies at
redshifts 2.0<z<3.3 to predictions of semianalytic models by De Lucia & Blaizot
and Bower et al. and hydrodynamic simulations by Dave et al.. The models
succeed for some luminosity and redshift ranges and fail for others. A notable
success is that the Bower et al. model provides a good match to the observed LF
at z~3. However, all models predict an increase with time of the rest-frame
V-band luminosity density, whereas the observations show a decrease. The models
also have difficulty matching the observed rest-frame colors of galaxies. In
all models the luminosity density of red galaxies increases sharply from z~3 to
z~2.2, whereas it is approximately constant in the observations. Conversely, in
the models the luminosity density of blue galaxies is approximately constant,
whereas it decreases in the observations. These discrepancies cannot be
entirely remedied by changing the treatment of dust and suggest that current
models do not yet provide a complete description of galaxy formation and
evolution since z~3.

harmonics from eccentric DWDs can be detected at a signal-to-noise ratio higher
than 8 for at least a handful of eccentric DWDs, given their formation rate and
typical lifetimes estimated from current cluster simulations. Consequently the
association of eccentricity with stellar-mass LISA sources does not uniquely
involve neutron stars, as is usually assumed. Due to the difficulty of
detecting (eccentric) DWDs with present and planned electromagnetic
observatories, LISA could provide unique dynamical identifications of these
systems in globular clusters.

moves behind the star, we can estimate the strength of the thermal emission
from the day side of the planet. Attaining a ground-based detection of one of
these eclipses has proven to be a significant challenge, as time-dependent
variations in instrument throughput and atmospheric seeing and absorption
overwhelm the small signal of the eclipse at infrared wavelengths. We gathered
a series of simultaneous L grism spectra of the transiting planet system TrES-1
and a nearby comparison star of comparable brightness, allowing us to correct
for these effects in principle. Combining the data from two eclipses, we
demonstrate a detection sensitivity of 0.15% in the eclipse depth relative to
the stellar flux. This approaches the sensitivity required to detect the
planetary emission, which theoretical models predict should lie between
0.05-0.1% of the stellar flux in our 2.9-4.3 micron bandpass. We explore the
factors that ultimately limit the precision of this technique, and discuss

setting characterized by a variable of interest that is latent. We argue that
such a setting is by far the most common case in practice, and we show, for the

that the influence of the gravitational field on the electrodynamics at very
large distances leads to a reformulation of our comprehension of the space-
time structure at quantum level through the elimination of the classical idea
of rest. This will lead us to a modification of the relativistic theory by
introducing the idea about a universal minimum limit of speed in the space-
time. Such a limit, unattainable by the particles, represents a preferred frame
associated with a universal background field (a vacuum energy), enabling a
fundamental understanding of the quantum uncertainties. The structure of
space-time becomes extended due to such a vacuum energy density, which leads to
a negative pressure at the cosmological scales as an anti-gravity, playing the
role of the cosmological constant. The tiny values of the vacuum energy density
and the cosmological constant will be successfully obtained, being in agreement

monotonically with increasing lattice strength. The dependence on lattice
strength becomes much richer in two and three dimensions. In the
two-dimensional case, when the interaction is weak, the sound speed first
increases then decreases as the lattice strength increases. For the three
dimensional lattice, the sound speed can even oscillate with the lattice
strength. These rich behaviors can be understood in terms of compressibility

offer an interesting perspective to the understanding: they show the lattice

result of this competition.

criticality (SOC) is one of the most popular theories able to explain this
intermittent charge/discharge behaviour. Despite a large amount of theoretical
work, empirical tests for SOC are still in their infancy. In the present paper
we address the common problem of revealing SOC from a simple time series
without having much information about the underlying system. As a working
example we use a modified version of the multifractal random walk originally
proposed as a model for the stock market dynamics. The study reveals, despite
the lack of the typical ingredients of SOC, an avalanche-like dynamics similar
to that of many physical systems. While, on one hand, the results confirm the
relevance of cascade models in representing turbulent-like phenomena, on the
other, they also raise the question about the current state of reliability of
SOC inference from time series analysis.

Electronic motion observed the rule of differential and integral operations

that the atomic spacetime is not a linear vector space with Newtonian time, and
within which calculus has non-classical definition, and complex wave functions
have fresh physical significances. This alternative approach is original,

an analytical formula for surface density profile near the planetary orbit from

the empirical formula linking surface density with gas accretion rate that is
derived based on hydrodynamic simulations of Tanigawa and Watanabe (2002, ApJ
586, 506), we then simulate the mass evolution of gas giant planets in
viscously-evolving disks. We finally determine the final mass as a function of
semi-major axis of the planet. We find that the disk can be divided into three
regions characterized by different processes by which the final mass is
determined. In the inner region, the planet grows quickly and forms a deep gap
to suppress the growth by itself before disk dissipation. The final mass of the
planet in this region is found to increase with the semi-major axis in a
similar way to the mass given by the viscous condition for gap opening, but the
former is larger by a factor of approximately 10 than the latter. In the
intermediate region, viscous diffusion of the disk gas limits the gas accretion
before the planet form a deep gap. The final mass can be up to the disk mass,
when disk viscous evolution occurs faster than disk evaporation. In the outer
region, planets capture only tiny amounts of gas within the lifetime of the
disk to form Neptune-like planets. We derive analytic formulae for the final
masses in the different regions and the locations of the boundaries, which are
helpful to gain a systematic understanding of the masses of gas giant planets.

universe or stars produced by stellar mergers, has been recently proposed. Some
of these stars will result in black hole formation. In this study, we
investigate iron core collapse and black hole formation systematically for the
iron-core mass range of 3 - 30Msun, which has not been studied well so far.
Models used here are mostly isentropic iron cores that may be produced in
merged stars in the present universe but we also employ a model that is meant
for a Population III star and is obtained by evolutionary calculation. We solve
numerically the general relativistic hydrodynamics and neutrino transfer
equations simultaneously, treating neutrino reactions in detail under spherical
symmetry. As a result, we find that massive iron cores with ~10Msun
unexpectedly produce a bounce owing to the thermal pressure of nucleons before
black hole formation. The features of neutrino signals emitted from such
massive iron cores differ in time evolution and spectrum from those of ordinary
supernovae. Firstly, the neutronization burst is less remarkable or disappears
completely for more massive models because the density is lower at the bounce.
Secondly, the spectra of neutrinos, except the electron type, are softer owing
to the electron-positron pair creation before the bounce. We also study the
effects of the initial density profile, finding that the larger the initial
density gradient is, the more steeply the neutronization burst declines.
Further more, we suggest a way to probe into the black hole progenitors from
the neutrino emission and estimate the event number for the currently operating
neutrino detectors.

hole gas described by Luttinger Hamiltonian with structural inversion asymmetry
and Zeeman splitting in a perpendicular magnetic field was studied. The spin
polarization arising from splitting between the light and the heavy hole bands
shows a resonant peak at a certain magnetic field. Especially, the competition
between the Luttinger term and the structural inversion asymmetry leads to a
rich resonant peaks structure, and the required magnetic field for the
resonance may be effectively reduced by enlarging the effective width of the
quantum well. Furthermore, the Zeeman splitting tends to move the resonant spin
polarization to a relative high magnetic field and destroy these rich resonant
spin phenomena. Finally, both the height and the weight of the resonant peak
increase as the temperature decreases. It is believed that such resonant spin
phenomena can be verified in the sample of a two-dimensional hole gas, and it

37.43. The velocity structure of the ionized gas is complex and cannot be
explained globally by a simple dynamical model. The spectra from the clouds are
inconsistent with shock or ``shock + precursor'' ionization models, but they
are consistent with photoionization by the quasar nucleus. The best-fit
photoionization model requires a low-metallicity (12+log(O/H) < 8.7) two-phase
medium, consisting of a matter-bounded diffuse component with a unity
filling-factor (N ~ 1 \cc, T ~ 15000 K), in which are embedded small, dense
clouds (N ~ 400 \cc, T ~ 10^4 K). The high-density clouds are transient and can
be re-generated through compressing the diffuse medium by low-speed shocks (V_S
\lesssim 100 \kms). Our photoionization model gives a total mass for the
ionized gas of about 3x10^{10} M_sun, and the total kinetic energy implied by
this mass and the observed velocity field is ~2x10^{58} ergs. The fact that
luminous EELRs are confined to steep-spectrum radio-loud quasars, yet show no
morphological correspondence to the radio jets, suggests that the driving force
producing the 4C 37.43 EELR was a roughly spherical blast wave initiated by the
production of the jet. That such a mechanism seems capable of ejecting a mass
comparable to that of the total interstellar medium of the Milky Way suggests
that ``quasar-mode'' feedback may indeed be an efficient means of regulating
star formation in the early universe.

016116 (2004)]. This model is based on generalized stochastic processes leading
to the Tsallis statistics. The equilibrium states correspond to polytropic
configurations similar to gaseous polytropes in astrophysics. For the critical
index n_3=d/(d-2) (where d is the dimension of space), the theory of polytropes
leads to a unique value of the mass M_c that we interpret as a limiting mass.
In d=3, we find M_c=202.8956... and in d=2, we recover the well-known result
M_c=8 pi (in suitable units). For M<M_c, the system evaporates (in an infinite
domain) or tends to an equilibrium state (for box-confined configurations). For
M>M_c, the system collapses and forms a Dirac peak containing a mass M_c
surrounded by a halo. This paper exposes the model and shows, by simple
considerations, the origin of the critical mass. A detailed description of the
critical dynamics of the generalized Keller-Segel model will be given in a

minimally coupled Einstein-scalar field solutions in 4 dimensions; the Buchdahl

minimally coupled Einstein-scalar field solutions can be generated from vacuum
solutions with arbitrary cosmological constant in arbitrary dimension. The only
requirement to a seed solution is that it posesses a hypersurface-orthogonal
Killing vector field. The generalization that allows us to use seed solutions
with arbitrary cosmological constant uncovers a new class of Einstein-scalar
field solutions that has previously not been studied. We apply the new solution
transformation to the (A)dS4 vacuum solution. Transforming the resulting
Einstein-scalar field solution to the conformal frame, a two-parameter family
of spatially finite, expanding and accelerating cosmological solutions are
found that are conformally isometric to the Einstein static universe RxS^3. We
study null geodesics and find that for any observer, the solution has a
cosmological horizon at an angular distance of pi/2 away from the observer. We
find that a subset of these solutions can be naturally interpreted as expanding
cosmologies in which a scalar black hole is formed at late times. The
conformally coupled scalar field satisfies the weak energy condition as long as
the energy density is positive, while the strong energy condition is generally
violated.

density we found the usual plasma oscillation along the field lines; plasma
frequency resembles to the gravitational redshift close to the Schwarzschild

ordering energy is a function of temperature due to thermal vibrations. The

incorporated and this method can replace the Ewald sum method. Core energy
contributions to the ordering energy are stored exclusively in superlattice
lines. The effect of electron-phonon interactions on ordering energy is of the
same order of magnitude as ordering energy near transition temperatures and
cannot be ignored. Ising model and variants are incorrect in explaining alloy
phase transitions as they ignore the role of electron-phonon interactions
without justification. A theoretical formalism that incorporates the
Debye-Waller Factor component of electron-phonon interactions in electronic
structure calculations already exists and must be adopted when modeling
temperature dependent phenomena. It is suggested that DWF correction will
account substantially for the discrepancy between experimental and theoretical
ordering energy in Ni3V. Thermal vibrations alter magnetic ordering energy at
finite temperatures. The role of electron-phonon interactions in alloy and
magnetic phase transitions cannot be ignored and must be incorporated in all
models. This will also ensure consistency with x-ray and electron diffraction
(alloy transitions) and neutron diffraction (magnetic transitions) results. An
isotope effect is predicted for (magnetic) phase transitions if the transition
temperature is below Debye temperature. Recent observations of an isotope
effect in magnetic phase transitions confirm our above conclusions and imply
that the role of electron-phonon interactions must be incorporated in all

serious dilemma called dark energy: an unknown source of exotic energy with
negative pressure driving a current accelerating phase of the universe. All
attempts so far to find a convincing theoretical explanation have failed, so
that one of the last hopes is the yet to be developed quantum theory of
gravity. In this article, loop quantum gravity is considered as a candidate,
with an emphasis on properties which might play a role for the dark energy
problem. Its basic feature is the discrete structure of space, often associated
with quantum theories of gravity on general grounds. This gives rise to
well-defined matter Hamiltonian operators and thus sheds light on conceptual
questions related to the cosmological constant problem. It also implies typical
quantum geometry effects which, from a more phenomenological point of view, may
result in dark energy. In particular the latter scenario allows several
non-trivial tests which can be made more precise by detailed observations in
combination with a quantitative study of numerical quantum gravity. If the
speculative possibility of a loop quantum gravitational origin of dark energy
turns out to be realized, a program as outlined here will help to hammer out
our ideas for a quantum theory of gravity, and at the same time allow
predictions for the distant future of our universe.

of 2D radiative transfer model simulations. Although no discernable embedded
clusters were found in any targets, multiple sources or associations of
redenned young stellar objects were found in many sources indicating
multiplicity at birth. The spectral index ($\alpha$) of these point sources in
3.6--8.0mum bands display large values of $\alpha$=2--5. A color-magnitude
analog plot was used to identify 79 infrared counterparts to the HMPOs. Compact
nebulae are found in 75% of the detected sources with morphologies that can be
well described by core-halo, cometary, shell-like and bipolar geometries
similar to those observed in ultra-compact HII regions. The IRAC band SEDs of
the IR counterparts of HMPOs are best described to represent YSOs with a mass
range of 8--20\msun in their Class I stages when compared with 2D radiative
transfer models. They also suggest that the high $\alpha$ values represent
reprocessed star/star+disk emission that is arising in the dense envelopes.
Thus we are witnessing the luminous envelopes around the protostars rather than
their photospheres or disks. We argue that the compact infrared nebulae likely
reflect the underlying physical structure of the dense cores and are found to
imitate the morphologies of known UCHII regions. Our results favour models of
continuuing accretion involving both molecular and ionised accretion components
to build the most massive stars rather than purely molecular rapid accretion

Moreover, both the shape evolution and the motion of the droplet center of mass

interactions. Starting from the BBGKY hierarchy, we determine the evolution of
the two-body correlation function by using an expansion of the solutions of the
hierarchy in powers of 1/N in a proper thermodynamic limit $N\to +\infty$.
These correlations are responsible for the ``collisional'' evolution of the
system beyond the Vlasov regime due to finite $N$ effects. We obtain a general
kinetic equation that can be applied to spatially inhomogeneous systems and
that takes into account memory effects. These peculiarities are specific to
systems with unshielded long-range interactions. For spatially homogeneous
systems with short memory time like plasmas, we recover the classical Landau
(or Lenard-Balescu) equations. An interest of our approach is to develop a
formalism that remains in physical space (instead of Fourier space) and that
can deal with spatially inhomogeneous systems. This enlightens the basic
physics and provides novel kinetic equations with a clear physical
interpretation. However, unless we restrict ourselves to spatially homogeneous
systems, closed kinetic equations can be obtained only if we ignore some
collective effects between particles. General exact coupled equations taking
into account collective effects are also given. We use this kinetic theory to
discuss the processes of violent collisionless relaxation and slow collisional
relaxation in systems with weak long-range interactions. In particular, we
investigate the dependence of the relaxation time with the system size and
provide a coherent discussion of all the numerical results obtained for these
systems.

Within the non-perturbative continuum framework of Schwinger-Dyson and
Bethe-Salpeter equations we quantify the strength of the back reaction of the
pion onto the quark-gluon interaction. To this end we add a Yang-Mills part of
the interaction such that unquenched lattice results for various current quark
masses are reproduced. We find considerable effects in the quark mass function
at low momenta as well as for the chiral condensate. The quark wave function is
less affected. The Gell--Mann-Oakes-Renner relation is valid to good accuracy
up to pion masses of 400-500 MeV. As a byproduct of our investigation we verify
the Coleman theorem, that chiral symmetry cannot be broken spontaneously when
QCD is reduced to 1+1 dimensions.

on another dimensionless parameter $\lambda$ is weak. In addition, it is
proposed here for the first time that we can also constrain various

traditional Sandage-Loeb test, we should be able to provide a better constraint

  26/05/2007",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20077840",,"astro-ph",,"  Stellar evolution in close binary systems is strongly influenced by mass
transfer from one star to the other when one component fills its zero-velocity
surface or Roche Lobe. SS Lep is a fairly nearby close binary showing the Algol
paradox and a shell spectrum, both indicative of (past) mass transfer. To study
the process of mass transfer and its evolutionary consequences, we aim at a
direct characterisation of the spatial dimensions of the different components
of SS Lep with IR interferometry. We use VINCI/VLTI interferometric
observations in the K band and photometric observations from the UV to the
far-IR. The visibilities are interpreted with simple geometrical models and the
Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) is decomposed into the three main
components: A star, M star and dust shell/disk. From the SED, we find that the
main emitters in the K band are the M star and the circumstellar environment.
Both are spatially resolved with the VINCI observations, showing the excess to
be circumbinary and showing the M star to have a size equal to its Roche Lobe.
We conclude that we have, for the first time, directly resolved a star filling
its Roche Lobe. The resulting mass transfer is probably the cause of (1) the
circumbinary dust disk of which we see the hot inner region spatially resolved
in our observations, (2) the unusually high luminosity of the A star and (3)
the shell spectrum seen in the UV and optical spectra.

consists of a computer and a localizer allowing spatial localization of the
position of the various instruments. Without any human intervention, the
ultrasound nephrostomy tract is superimposed in real time onto fluoroscopic
images acquired in various views. Results: We tested our approach by laboratory
experiments on a phantom. Also, after approval by our institution's Ethics
Committee, we validated this technique in the operating room during PCNL in one
patient. Conclusion: Our system is reliable, and the absence of
image-processing procedures makes it robust. We have initiated a prospective
study to validate this technique both for PCNL specialists and as a learning
tool.

post-quiescence emission. We then discuss a model of the GRBs inner engine
based on the formation of quark phases during the life of an hadronic star.
Within this model the pre-quiescence emission is interpreted as due to the
deconfinement of quark inside an hadronic star and the formation of 2SC quark
matter. The post-quiescence emission is due to the conversion of 2SC into the
Color-Flavor-Locking (CFL) phase. The temporal delay between these two
processes is connected with the nucleation time of the CFL phase in the 2SC
phase and it can be associated with the observed quiescent times in the GRBs
light curves. The stability of CFL cores in compact stars is also discussed.
