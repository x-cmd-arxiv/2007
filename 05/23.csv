systems provides a powerful test that can potentially discriminate amongst
cosmological models. However, applications of this elegant test have been
curtailed by two factors: our ignorance of how galaxies evolve with redshift,
and the absence of methods to deal with the effect of incomplete information in
lensing systems. In this paper, we investigate both issues in detail. We
explore how to extract the properties of evolving galaxies, assuming that the
cosmology is well determined by other techniques. We propose a new nested Monte
Carlo method to quantify the effects of incomplete data. We apply the
lens-redshift test to an improved sample of seventy lens systems derived from
recent observations, primarily from the SDSS, SLACS and the CLASS surveys. We
find that the limiting factor in applying the lens-redshift test derives from
poor statistics, including incomplete information samples, and biased sampling.
Many lenses that uniformly sample the underlying true image separation
distribution will be needed to use this test as a complementary method to
measure the value of the cosmological constant or the properties of evolving
galaxies. Planned future surveys by missions like the SNAP satellite or LSST
are likely to usher in a new era for strong lensing studies that utilize this
test. With expected catalogues of thousands of new strong lenses, the
lens-redshift test could offer a powerful tool to probe cosmology as well as
galaxy evolution.

over from an earlier phase of activity, plus a recently restarted core and
radio jets. Improving the statistics of dying sources will give us a better
handle on the evolution of radio sources, in particular the frequency and time
scales of radio activity. We have used the WENSS and NVSS surveys, in order to
find sources with steep spectral indices, associated with nearby elliptical
galaxies. In the cross correlation we presently used only unresolved sources,
with flux densities at 1.4 GHz larger than 10 mJy. The eleven candidates thus
obtained were observed with the VLA in various configurations, in order to
confirm the steepness of the spectra, and to check whether active structures
like flat-spectrum cores and jets are present, perhaps at low levels. We
estimated the duration of the active and relic phases by modelling the
integrated radio spectra using the standard models of spectral evolution. We
have found six dying sources and three restarted sources, while the remaining
two candidates remain unresolved also with the new VLA data and may be Compact
Steep Spectrum sources, with an unusually steep spectrum. The typical age of
the active phase, as derived by spectral fits, is in the range 10^7 - 10^8

been gaining in popularity for practical reasons among experimentalists who
study biomembranes. Here, for the special case of membrane-bound fluorophores,
we present a substantial body of experimental evidence that justifies the use
of simple Stern-Volmer expressions when modeling either FRET metric under
dilute-probe conditions. We have also discovered a dilute-regime correspondence
between our Stern-Volmer expression for E and Wolber and Hudson's series
approximation for steady-state Forster quenching in 2D. This novel
correspondence allows us to interpret each of our 2D quenching constants in
terms of both (i) an effective Forster distance, and (ii) two maximum
acceptor-concentration limits, each of which defines its own useful
experimental regime. Taken together, our results suggest a three-step strategy
toward designing more effective steady-state FRET experiments for the study of

this could explain ``radio ghosts'' seen far from cluster centers. We simulate
the diffusion of cosmic rays from buoyant bubbles inflated by AGN. Our
simulations include the effects of the anisotropic particle diffusion
introduced by magnetic fields. Our models are consistent with the X-ray
morphology of AGN bubbles, with disruption being suppressed by the magnetic
draping effect. We conclude that for such magnetic field topologies, a
substantial fraction of cosmic rays can be confined inside the bubbles on
buoyant rise timescales even when the parallel diffusivity coefficient is very
large. For isotropic diffusion at a comparable level, cosmic rays would leak
out of the bubbles too rapidly to be consistent with radio observations. Thus,
the long confinement times associated with the magnetic suppression of CR
diffusion can explain the presence of radio ghosts. We show that the partial
escape of cosmic rays is mostly confined to the wake of the rising bubbles, and
speculate that this effect could: (1) account for the excitation of the
H$\alpha$ filaments trailing behind the bubbles in the Perseus cluster, (2)
inject entropy into the metal enriched material being lifted by the bubbles

originates from regions of recent star formation. We also explore vortensity
and mass conservation conditions. Vortensity conservation, which does not
require a steady state, is empirically verified. The velocity and density
profiles show large and varying mass fluxes, which are inconsistent with a
steady flow for a single dominant global spiral mode. We thus conclude that the
spiral arms cannot be in a quasi-steady state in any rotating frame, and/or
that out of plane motions may be significant.

dramatically in 2-10 keV flux over timescales of years and was thought to be
slowly transitioning between periods of quiescence and active accretion. Our
results show that in one year the source continuum flux covered almost the
entire historical range, making it unlikely that the low-luminosity states
correspond to the accretion mechanism switching off. During flaring episodes we
found that a highly redshifted Fe K line appears, implying that the violent
activity is occurring in the inner accretion disk, within ~100 gravitational
radii of the central black hole. We also found that the spectral index of the
X-ray continuum remained approximately constant during the large amplitude
variability. These observations make NGC 2992 well-suited for future
multi-waveband monitoring, as a test-bed for constraining accretion models.

Since detailed maps will be difficult to extract due to noise and foreground
emission, efforts have focused on a statistical detection of the 21-cm
fluctuations. During cosmic reionization, these fluctuations are highly
non-Gaussian and thus more information can be extracted than just the
one-dimensional function that is usually considered, i.e., the correlation
function. We calculate a two-dimensional function that if measured
observationally would allow a more thorough investigation of the properties of
the underlying ionizing sources. This function is the probability distribution
function (PDF) of the difference in the 21-cm brightness temperature between
two points, as a function of the separation between the points. While the
standard correlation function is determined by a complicated mixture of
contributions from density and ionization fluctuations, we show that the
difference PDF holds the key to separately measuring the statistical properties

previously analyzed stellar flares are shown. The analysis of the flare rise

such as high-Tc superconductors and graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) is
still unresolved. In both systems, interactions of electrons with either
phonons or other electrons or both have been proposed to explain
superconductivity. In the high-Tc cuprates, the presence of a Van Hove
singularity (VHS) in the density of states near the Fermi level was long ago
proposed to enhance the many-body couplings and therefore may play a role in
superconductivity. Such a singularity can cause an anisotropic variation in the
coupling strength, which may partially explain the so-called nodal-antinodal
dichotomy in the cuprates. Here we show that the topology of the graphene band
structure at dopings comparable to the GICs is quite similar to that of the
cuprates and that the quasiparticle dynamics in graphene have a similar
dichotomy. Namely, the electron-phonon coupling is highly anisotropic,
diverging near a saddle point in the graphene electronic band structure. These
results support the important role of the VHS in layered materials and the
possible optimization of Tc by tuning the VHS with respect to the Fermi level.

of the classical linear model (Ogorodnikov-Milne) of the local systemic field
and low-degree terms of the general vector harmonic decomposition. Taking
advantage of these relationships we determine the solar velocity with respect
to the local stars of $(V_X,V_Y,V_Z)=(10.5, 18.5, 7.3)\pm 0.1$ \kms. The Oort's
parameters determined by a straightforward least-squares adjustment in vector
spherical harmonics, are $A=14.0\pm 1.4$, $B=-13.1\pm 1.2$, $K=1.1\pm 1.8$, and
$C=-2.9\pm 1.4$ \kmspc. We find a few statistically significant higher degree
harmonic terms, which do not correspond to any parameters in the classical
linear model. One of them, a third-degree electric harmonic, is tentatively
explained as the response to a negative linear gradient of rotation velocity
with distance from the Galactic plane, which we estimate at $\sim -20$ \kmspc.
The most unexpected and unexplained term within the Ogorodnikov-Milne model is
the first-degree magnetic harmonic representing a rigid rotation of the stellar
field about the axis $-Y$ pointing opposite to the direction of rotation. This
harmonic comes out with a statistically robust coefficient $6.2 \pm 0.9$
\kmspc, and is also present in the velocity field of more distant stars. The
ensuing upward vertical motion of stars in the general direction of the
Galactic center and the downward motion in the anticenter direction are
opposite to the vector field expected from the stationary Galactic warp model.

Standard models assuming dipolar spin-down of both pulsars suggest that the
time since the formation of B is ~50 Myr, i.e. close to B's characteristic age.
However, adopting models which account for the impact of A's relativistic wind
on B's spin-down we find that the formation of B took place either 80 or 180
Myr ago, depending the interaction mechanism. Formation 80 Myr ago, closer to
B's characteristic age, would result in the contribution from J0737-3039 to the
inferred coalescence rates for double neutron star binaries increasing by 40%.
The 180 Myr age is closer to A's characteristic age and would be consistent
with the most recent estimates of the coalescence rate. The new age constraints
do not significantly impact recent estimates of the kick velocity, tilt angle

for the future gravitational wave observatory LISA. In a specific frequency
range, this 'foreground noise' is predicted to rise above the instrumental
noise and hinder the detection of other types of signals, e.g., gravitational
waves arising from stellar mass objects inspiraling into massive black holes.
In many previous studies only detached populations of compact object binaries
have been considered in estimating the LISA gravitational wave foreground
signal. Here, we investigate the influence of compact object detached and
Roche-Lobe Overflow Galactic binaries on the shape and strength of the LISA
signal. Since >99% of remnant binaries which have orbital periods within the
LISA sensitivity range are white dwarf binaries, we consider only these
binaries when calculating the LISA signal. We find that the contribution of
RLOF binaries to the foreground noise is negligible at low frequencies, but
becomes significant at higher frequencies, pushing the frequency at which the
foreground noise drops below the instrumental noise to >6 mHz. We find that it
is important to consider the population of mass transferring binaries in order
to obtain an accurate assessment of the foreground noise on the LISA data
stream. However, we estimate that there still exists a sizeable number (~11300)
of Galactic double white dwarf binaries which will have a signal-to-noise ratio
>5, and thus will be potentially resolvable with LISA. We present the LISA
gravitational wave signal from the Galactic population of white dwarf binaries,
show the most important formation channels contributing to the LISA disc and
bulge populations and discuss the implications of these new findings.

leakage injection of CRs. The new simulations follow evolution of the CR
distribution to much higher energies than our previous study, providing a
better examination of evolutionary and asymptotic behaviors. The postshock CR
pressure becomes constant after quick initial adjustment, since the evolution
of the CR partial pressure expressed in terms of a momentum similarity variable
is self-similar. The shock precursor, which scales as the diffusion length of
the highest energy CRs, subsequently broadens approximately linearly with time,
independent of diffusion model, so long as CRs continue to be accelerated to
ever-higher energies. This means the nonlinear shock structure can be described
approximately in terms of the similarity variable, x/(u_s t), where u_s is the
shock speed once the postshock pressure reaches an approximate time asymptotic
state. As before, the shock Mach number is the key parameter determining the
evolution and the CR acceleration efficiency, although finite Alfven wave drift
and wave energy dissipation in the shock precursor reduce the effective
velocity change experienced by CRs, so reduce acceleration efficiency
noticeably, thus, providing a second important parameter at low and moderate

dependence of the low-bias zero-temperature conductance on the tilt angle phi

show that the tilting of the phenyl rings results in a decrease of the
zero-temperature conductance by roughly two orders of magnitude, when going
from a planar conformation to a configuration in which the rings are
perpendicular. In addition we demonstrate that the side groups, apart from
determining phi, have no influence on the conductance. All this is in agreement

intracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a
significant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray
derived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass
fraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out
that cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and
X-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to
measure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For
example, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by
Bonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a
primordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of
1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that
interesting accuracy is within reach. We also briefly discuss how the SZ and

Micromechanical ingredients involve elasticity, friction, a short range

microstructure of the cohesive packing varies according to the assembling
procedure, from rather densely packed if isolated particles are directly
compressed to much looser if the formation of large aggregates is allowed prior
to compression. A crucial parameter is the ratio P*= Pa/F0 of applied pressure
P, acting on grains of diameter $a$, to maximum tensile contact force F0. At
low P* the final structure depends on the level of velocity fluctuations at the
early stages of cluster aggregation. With RR the coordination number approaches
2 in the limit of low initial velocities or large rolling friction. The force
network generally comprises small hyperstatic clusters with forces of the order
of F0, joined by nearly unstressed, barely rigid arms. As P* grows, it quickly
rearranges into force chain-like patterns. Density correlations witness a
fractal structure, with dimension Df, up to some density-dependent blob size.
WIth RR Df coincides with the ballistic aggregation result, despite a possibly
different connectivity. Possible effects of some parameters on material
strength are evoked.

detailed radiative and chemical processes in the postshock relaxation layer

Most of the radiation is originally emitted in the dust continuum in
mid-infrared wavelength (~10-30 micron), which reprocessed to far-infrared with
~100-200 micron. Although some fraction (~0.1) of the radiation energy is
emitted in the H2O lines at the accretion shock, most is absorbed and reemitted
in the dust continuum in the envelope. The H2O lines account for at most ~1/100
of the observed luminosity. If a cavity is present in the envelope due to
outflow or rotation, the dust and H2O line emission in the mid-infrared
wavelength from the shock can be observed directly, or as a reflection nebula.
Among forthcoming observational facillities, SPICA is the most suitable for
detecting either direct or processed radiation from first-core objects.

were used in the determination of the non-mesonic branching fractions. The
implications of the results of this analysis were considered for the empirical
Delta I = 1/2 rule and the decay rates of the 4H-Lambda hypernucleus.

associated with it has been investigated using the sub-millimetre (JCMT-SCUBA),
infrared (Spitzer-MIPSGAL, Spitzer-GLIMPSE, Palomar) and radio (VLA) continuum
data. Cluster simulations have been carried out in order to understand the
properties of clusters as well as to compare with the observations. Results:
The central most obscured part of the protocluster coincident with the compact
sub-millimetre source found with SCUBA is responsible for at least 2/3 of the
total luminosity. A number of cluster members have been identified which are
bright in mid infrared and show rising (near to mid infrared) spectral energy
distributions suggesting that these are very young stellar sources. In the mid
infrared 8.0 micron image, a number of filamentary structures and clumps are
detected in the vicinity of IRAS 18511+0146. Conclusions: Based on the
luminosity and cluster size as well as on the evolutionary stages of the

showing that a procedure, named ``backward induction'' in game theory, yields a
Nash equilibrium. It actually yields Nash equilibria that define a proper
subclass of Nash equilibria. In 1965, Selten named this proper subclass subgame
perfect equilibria. In game theory, payoffs are rewards usually granted at the
end of a game. Although traditional game theory mainly focuses on real-valued
payoffs that are implicitly ordered by the usual total order over the reals,
works of Simon or Blackwell already involved partially ordered payoffs. This
paper generalises the notion of sequential game by replacing real-valued payoff
functions with abstract atomic objects, called outcomes, and by replacing the
usual total order over the reals with arbitrary binary relations over outcomes,
called preferences. This introduces a general abstract formalism where Nash
equilibrium, subgame perfect equilibrium, and ``backward induction'' can still
be defined. This paper proves that the following three propositions are
equivalent: 1) Preferences over the outcomes are acyclic. 2) Every sequential
game has a Nash equilibrium. 3) Every sequential game has a subgame perfect
equilibrium. The result is fully computer-certified using Coq. Beside the
additional guarantee of correctness, the activity of formalisation using Coq
also helps clearly identify the useful definitions and the main articulations

statistical and higher order effects in the epsilon expansion. We also
calculate the eigenvalue distributions on the lattices with heavier sea quarks
at two lattice spacings. Although the epsilon expansion is not applied for
those sea quarks, we find a reasonable agreement of the Dirac operator spectrum

consistent with the estimate in the epsilon-regime.

and SDSS main galaxy samples, and measure the distance--redshift relation at
z=0.2. BAO in the clustering of the SDSS luminous red galaxies measure the
distance--redshift relation at z=0.35. The observed scale of the BAO calculated
from these samples and from the combined sample are jointly analysed using
estimates of the correlated errors, to constrain the form of the distance
measure D_V(z)=[(1+z)^2D_A^2cz/H(z)]^(1/3). Here D_A is the angular diameter
distance, and H(z) is the Hubble parameter. This gives
r_s/D_V(0.2)=0.1980+/-0.0058 and r_s/D_V(0.35)=0.1094+/-0.0033 (1sigma errors),
with correlation coefficient of 0.39, where r_s is the comoving sound horizon
scale at recombination. Matching the BAO to have the same measured scale at all

roughly consistent with that predicted by the higher redshift SNLS supernovae

acceleration at low redshift. If we force the cosmological model to be flat

does appear to be a well-defined color-magnitude relation (CMR) for blue
galaxies at all redshifts, with more luminous galaxies having redder U-V
colors. The slope of the blue CMR is independent of redshift d(U-V)/dMV = -0.09
(0.01) and can be explained by a correlation of dust-reddening with luminosity.
The average color at fixed luminosity reddens strongly \Delta(U-V) = 0.75 from
z~3 to z=0, much of which can be attributed to aging of the stars. The color
scatter of the blue sequence is relatively small sigma(U-V) = 0.25 (0.03) and
constant to z~3, but notably asymmetrical with a sharp blue ridge and a wing
towards redder colors. We explore sets of star formation histories to study the
constraints placed by the shape of the scatter at z=2-3. One particular set of
models, episodic star formation, reproduces the detailed properties very well.
For a two-state model with high and low star formation, the duty cycle is
constrained to be > 40% and the contrast between the states must be a factor >
5 (or a scatter in log(SFR) of > 0.35 dex around the mean). However, episodic
models do not explain the observed tail of very red galaxies, primarily Distant
Red Galaxies (DRGs), which may have ceased star formation altogether or are
more heavily obscured. Finally, the relative number density of red, luminous MV
< -20.5 galaxies increases by a factor of ~ 6 from z = 2.7 to z = 0.5, as does
their contribution to the total rest-frame V-band luminosity density. We are

metallicity range $-2.2\leq$ [Fe/H] $\leq$+0.47. These are the widest ranges of
ages and metallicities in which the behaviour of the Ca II triplet lines has
been investigated in a homogeneous way. We report the first empirical study of
the variation of the CaII triplet lines strength, for given metallicities, with
respect to luminosity. We find that the sequence defined by each cluster in the
Luminosity-$\Sigma$Ca plane is not exactly linear. However, when only stars in
a small magnitude interval are observed, the sequences can be considered as
linear. We have studied the the Ca II triplet lines on three metallicities
scales. While a linear correlation between the reduced equivalent width ($W'_V$
or $W'_I$) versus metallicity is found in the \citet{cg97} and \citet{ki03}
scales, a second order term needs to be added when the \citet{zw84} scale is
adopted. We investigate the role of age from the wide range of ages covered by
our sample. We find that age has a weak influence on the final relationship.
Finally, the relationship derived here is used to estimate the metallicities of
three poorly studied open clusters: Berkeley 39, Trumpler 5 and Collinder 110.
For the latter, the metallicity derived here is the first spectroscopic

(z=2.56) based on observations with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer.
This is the first clear detection of emission from this radical at high
redshift. CN emission is a tracer of dense molecular hydrogen gas (n(H2) > 10^4
cm^{-3}) within star-forming molecular clouds, in particular in regions where
the clouds are affected by UV radiation. The HCN/CN intensity ratio can be used
as a diagnostic for the relative importance of photodissociation regions (PDRs)
in a source, and as a sensitive probe of optical depth, the radiation field,
and photochemical processes. We derive a lensing-corrected CN(N=3-2) line
luminosity of L'(CN(3-2) = (4.5 +/- 0.5) x 10^9 K km/s pc^2. The ratio between
CN luminosity and far-infrared luminosity falls within the scatter of the same
relationship found for low-z (ultra-) luminous infrared galaxies. Combining our
new results with CO(J=3-2) and HCN(J=1-0) measurements from the literature and
assuming thermal excitation for all transitions, we find a CO/CN luminosity
ratio of 9.3 +/- 1.9 and a HCN/CN luminosity ratio of 0.95 +/- 0.15. However,
we find that the CN(N=3-2) line is likely only subthermally excited, implying
that those ratios may only provide upper limits for the intrinsic 1-0 line
luminosity ratios. We conclude that, in combination with other molecular gas
tracers like CO, HCN, and HCO+, CN is an important probe of the physical
conditions and chemical composition of dense molecular environments at high
redshift.

as a renormalized, perturbative quantum field theory on an arbitrary globally
hyperbolic curved, Lorentzian spacetime. To this end, we construct the
non-commutative algebra of observables, in the sense of formal power series, as
well as a space of corresponding quantum states. The algebra contains all gauge
invariant, renormalized, interacting quantum field operators (polynomials in
the field strength and its derivatives), and all their relations such as
commutation relations or operator product expansion. It can be viewed as a
deformation quantization of the Poisson algebra of classical Yang-Mills theory
equipped with the Peierls bracket. The algebra is constructed as the cohomology
of an auxiliary algebra describing a gauge fixed theory with ghosts and
anti-fields. A key technical difficulty is to establish a suitable hierarchy of
Ward identities at the renormalized level that ensure conservation of the
interacting BRST-current, and that the interacting BRST-charge is nilpotent.
The algebra of physical interacting field observables is obtained as the
cohomology of this charge. As a consequence of our constructions, we can prove
that the operator product expansion closes on the space of gauge invariant
operators. Similarly, the renormalization group flow is proved not to leave the
space of gauge invariant operators.

  and data detection","To be published on IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,"10.1109/TIT.2007.903115",,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  In random-access communication systems, the number of active users varies
with time, and has considerable bearing on receiver's performance. Thus,
techniques aimed at identifying not only the information transmitted, but also
that number, play a central role in those systems. An example of application of
these techniques can be found in multiuser detection (MUD). In typical MUD
analyses, receivers are based on the assumption that the number of active users
is constant and known at the receiver, and coincides with the maximum number of
users entitled to access the system. This assumption is often overly
pessimistic, since many users might be inactive at any given time, and
detection under the assumption of a number of users larger than the real one
may impair performance.
  The main goal of this paper is to introduce a general approach to the problem
of identifying active users and estimating their parameters and data in a
random-access system where users are continuously entering and leaving the
system. The tool whose use we advocate is Random-Set Theory: applying this, we
derive optimum receivers in an environment where the set of transmitters
comprises an unknown number of elements. In addition, we can derive
Bayesian-filter equations which describe the evolution with time of the a
posteriori probability density of the unknown user parameters, and use this
density to derive optimum detectors. In this paper we restrict ourselves to
interferer identification and data detection, while in a companion paper we
shall examine the more complex problem of estimating users' parameters.

abundances which are high compared to field stars of the same spectral type,
which are heavily Li depleted. This may be due either to Li production or Li
preservation in these systems. Aims: To measure the lithium isotopic ratio in
the companion star of the neutron star X-ray binary Cen X-4. Method: We use
UVES spectra obtained in years 2000 and 2004 around the orbital quadratures.
The spectra are analysed with spectrum synthesis techniques and the errors
estimated with Monte Carlo simulations. Results: We measure A(Li)=2.87+-0.20
and 6Li/7Li = 0.12+0.08-0.05 at 68% confidence level. We also present updated
system parameters with a refined determination of the orbital period and
component masses i.e. 1.14+-0.45 Msun and 0.23+-0.10 Msun for the neutron star

favours Li preservation scenarios, although Li production mechanisms cannot be
ruled out. In the case of preservation, no Li is freshly created in the binary,

equations. The zero-temperature phase diagram in the crossover regime is
presented, where the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing state
governs the weak-coupling BCS region of a resonance. It is found that the FFLO
oscillation vanishes in the BEC side, in which the system under population
imbalance turns into a phase separation (PS) between locally binding superfluid
and fully polarized spin domains. We also demonstrate numerical calculations
with a large particle number O(10^5), comparable to that observed in recent
experiments. The resulting density profile on a resonance yields the PS, which
is in good agreement with the recent experiments, while the FFLO modulation
exists in the pairing field. It is also proposed that the most favorable
location for the detection of the FFLO oscillation is in the vicinity of the
critical population imbalance in the weak coupling BCS regime, where the
oscillation periodicity becomes much larger than the interparticle spacing.
Finally, we analyze the radio-frequency (RF) spectroscopy in the imbalanced
system. The clear difference in the RF spectroscopy between BCS and BEC sides
reveals the structure of the pairing field and local ``magnetization''.

wavelengths is typically described in terms of different parameters according
to the wavelength range. Most commercial ray tracing packages have been
specifically designed for use with visible/IR systems and thus, though very
flexible and sophisticated, do not provide the appropriate parameters to fully
describe microwave antennas, and thus to compare with specifications. In this
work we demonstrate that the Strehl ratio is equal to the phase efficiency when
the apodization factor is taken into account. The phase efficiency is the most
critical contribution to the aperture efficiency of an antenna, and the most
difficult parameter to optimize during the telescope design. The equivalence
between the Strehl ratio and the phase efficiency gives the designer/user of
the telescope the opportunity to use the faster commercial ray-tracing software
to optimize the design. We also discuss the results of several tests performed
to check the validity of this relationship that we carried out using a
ray-tracing software, ZEMAX and a full Physical Optics software, GRASP9.3,

The permitted behaviours in different settings ($Z_{2}$-mirror branes,
asymmetric shells, signature-changing branes) are analysed in detail. We show
in particular that (i) in asymmetric shells there is an upper bound for the
energy density, and (ii) that the energy density within the brane vanishes when
approaching a change of signature. The description of a signature change as a
`singularity' seen from within the brane is considered. We also find new
relations between the fundamental constants in the brane/shell, its tension,
and the cosmological and gravitational constants of the bulk, independently of
the existence or not of a change of signature.

selected early-type galaxies in the HDF-N and CDF-S with spectroscopic
redshifts in the range 0.85<z<1.15. We measure their 24 micron fluxes from the
deep GOODS-MIPS imaging and derive the IR luminosities and star formation
rates. The fraction of galaxies with >2 sigma detections (~25 muJy} is
17(-4,+9)%. Of the 15 galaxies with significant detections at least six have an
AGN. Stacking the MIPS images of the galaxies without significant detections
and adding the detected galaxies without AGN we find an upper limit on the mean
star formation rate (SFR) of 5.2+/-3.0 Msol yr^-1, and on the mean specific SFR
of 4.6+/-2.2 * 10^-11 yr^-1. Under the assumption that the average SFR will
decline at the same rate as the cosmic average, the in situ growth in stellar
mass of the early-type galaxy population is less than 14+/-7% between z=1 and
the present. We show that the typically low IR luminosity and SFR imply that
the effect of obscured star formation (or AGN) on their rest-frame
optical/near-IR SEDs is negligible for ~90% of the galaxies in our sample.
Hence, their optical/near-IR colors are most likely dominated by evolved
stellar populations. This implies that the colors predicted by the Bruzual &
Charlot (2003) model for stellar populations with ages similar to those of z~1
early-type galaxies (~1-3 Gyr) are most likely too blue, and that stellar
masses of evolved, high-redshift galaxies can be overestimated by up to a
factor of ~2.

a scaling regime is generally reached which involves a hierarchy of string
densities with the lightest most abundant. We also study hybrid networks of
cosmic superstrings, where energetic considerations are more important in
determining interaction outcomes. We again find that networks tend towards
scaling, with the three lightest network components being dominant and having
comparable number densities, while the heavier string states are suppressed. A
more quantitative analysis depends on the precise calculation of the string

these results provide further evidence that the presence of junctions in a

comprehensive explanation for the chemical anomalies of globular cluster stars.
Among these, the most striking is oxygen depletion, which reaches values down
to [O/Fe]~-0.4 in most clusters, but in M13 it goes down to less than [O/Fe]~ -
1. In this work we suggest that the anomalies are due to the super position of
two different events: 1) PRIMORDIAL SELF-ENRICHMENT: this is asked to explain
the oxygen depletion down to a minimum value [O/Fe]~ -0.4; 2) EXTRA MIXING IN A
FRACTION OF THE STARS ALREADY BORN WITH ANOMALOUS COMPOSITION: these objects,
starting with already low [O/Fe], will reduce the oxygen abundance down to the
most extreme values. Contrary to other models that invoke extra mixing to
explain the chemical anomalies, we suggest that it is active only if there is a
fraction of the stars in which the primordial composition is not only oxygen
depleted, but also extremely helium rich (Y~ 0.4), as found in a few GCs from
their main sequence multiplicity. We propose that the rotational evolution (and
an associated extra mixing) of extremely helium rich stars may be affected by
the fact that they develop a very small or non existent molecular weight
barrier during the evolution. We show that extra mixing in these stars, having
initial chemistry that has already been CNO processed, affects mainly the
oxygen abundance, and to a much smaller extent if affects the sodium abundance.
The model also predicts a large fluorine depletion concomitant with the oxygen
depletion, and a further enhancement of the surface helium abundance, which
reaches values close to Y=0.5 in the computed models. We stress that, in this
tentative explanation, those stars that are primordially O--depleted, but ARE
NOT extremely helium rich do not suffer deep extra mixing.

cosmic microwave background. In order to evaluate the effect of this early
dust, we calculate the power spectrum of the dust emission anisotropies and
compare it with the sensitivity limit of the Planck satellite. The spatial
distribution of the dust is estimated through the distribution of dark matter.
At small angular scales ($\ell \gtrsim 1000$) the dust signal is found to be
noticeable with the Planck detector for certain values of dust lifetime and
production rates. The dust signal is also compared to sensitivities of other
instruments. The early dust emission anisotropies are finally compared to those
of local dust and they are found to be similar in magnitude at mm wavelengths.

(T_N=5.2K) HoNi2B2C single crystals in the normal and two different
superconducting (SC) states (T_c=8.5K and $T_c^*=5.6K) are reported. The PC
study of the electron-boson(phonon) interaction (EB(P)I) spectral function
reveals pronounced phonon maxima at 16, 22 and 34meV. For the first time the
high energy maxima at about 50meV and 100meV are resolved. Additionally, an
admixture of a crystalline-electric-field (CEF) excitations with a maximum near
10meV and a `magnetic` peak near 3meV are observed. The contribution of the
10-meV peak in PC EPI constant \lambda_PC is evaluated as 20-30%, while
contribution of the high energy modes at 50 and 100meV amounts about 10% for
each maxima, so the superconductivity might be affected by CEF excitations. The
SC gap in HoNi2B2C exhibits a standard single-band BCS-like dependence, but
vanishes at $T_c^*=5.6K<T_c, with 2\Delta/kT_c^*=3.9. The strong coupling
Eliashberg analysis of the low-temperature SC phase with T_c^*=5.6K =T_N,
coexisting with the commensurate AF structure, suggests a sizable value of the
EPI constant \lambda_s=0.93. We also provide strong support for the recently
proposed by us ''Fermi surface (FS) separation'' scenario for the coexistence
of magnetism and superconductivity in magnetic borocarbides, namely, that the
superconductivity in the commensurate AF phase survives at a special (nearly
isotropic) FS sheet without an admixture of Ho 5d states. Above T_c^* the SC
features in the PC characteristics are strongly suppressed pointing to a
specific weakened SC state between T_c* and T_c.

emergence of soft X-rays from the interaction of the explosion shock wave with
the ambient medium. This shock wave is now interacting strongly with the inner
ring and might have passed already the highest density regions. The emission
can be described by thermal models with two temperatures, with perhaps some but
little change over time. Relative to the elemental abundances prevailing in the
LMC the inner ring shows an overabundance of Si and S compared to the lighter
elements and Fe, which suggests that the ring consists of highly processed
matter dredged up in a binary merger event well before the explosion. The X-ray
lightcurves between 0.5--2 keV and 3--10 keV differ significantly in slope,
with the latter being much flatter but very similar to the radio light curve.

Moreover, we show that scanning photocurrent microscopy constitutes an

Schottky barrier height in such devices.
