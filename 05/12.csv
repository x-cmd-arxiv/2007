four dimensions accounting for 95% of the shape variance, and we partially
reconstruct ""equations of motion"" for the dynamics in this space. These
dynamics have multiple attractors, and we find that the worm visits these in a
rapid and almost completely deterministic response to weak thermal stimuli.
Stimulus-dependent correlations among the different modes suggest that one can
generate more reliable behaviors by synchronizing stimuli to the state of the
worm in shape space. We confirm this prediction, effectively ""steering"" the

a vanishing net EDM for an atom built entirely from point-like, nonrelativistic
constituents that interact only electrostatically. Any experimental observation
of a nonzero atomic EDM would result from corrections to the point-like,
nonrelativistic, electrostatic assumption. We reformulate Schiff's theorem at
the operator level and delineate the electronic and nuclear operators whose
atomic matrix elements generate corrections to ""Schiff screening"". We obtain a
form for the operator responsible for the leading correction associated with
finite nuclear size -- the so-called ""Schiff moment"" operator -- and observe
that it differs from the corresponding operator used in previous Schiff moment
computations. We show that the more general Schiff moment operator reduces to
the previously employed operator only under certain approximations that are not
generally justified. We also identify other corrections to Schiff screening
that may not be included properly in previous theoretical treatments. We
discuss practical considerations for obtaining a complete computation of

gravitationally unstable for the accretion rates needed to explain
super-massive black hole (SMBH) activity. We propose that SMBH are fed by a

Because of incomplete angular momentum cancellation a warped accretion disc
forms in the inner few parsec. The orientation of the disc performs a random
walk. Deposition of new material promotes SMBH accretion at rates much faster
than viscous. Observational implications of this picture include: (i) lighter
accretion discs that can fuel AGN and quasars and yet avoid star formation at R
>> 0.1 pc; (ii) star formation inside the disc is not a function of mass
accretion rate only. It can take place at high or low accretion rates, e.g.,
when too few clouds arrive in the inner region. An example of this might be the
central parsec of our Galaxy. (iii) The discs can form Compton-thick obscuring
structures of ~ parsec size as required in AGN unification models; (iv) faster
black hole growth resulting from misalignment of the disc and the black hole
spin in the early Universe; (v) Isotropic deposition of SMBH energy and
momentum feedback in the galaxy bulge. This may help explain the high
efficiency with which it seems to be operating in the Universe. (vi) No
correlation between SMBH activity and the presence of kiloparsec scale bars or
gaseous discs in galactic bulges; (vii) Bodily collisions between gaseous
components of merging galaxies facilitate production of gas streams feeding the
centre of the combined galaxy. Mergers should thus be catalysts of SMBH growth.

massive nuclear star clusters than feed their SMBHs.

strong coupling is replaced by the ghost-free expression \alpha_E(Q^2)

quantitatively the validity of the APT prescription. Below this scale, the

  We focus on the numerical synthesis of phase screens. The statistically

time-dependence is introduced such that on short time scales the instances of
the phase screens are rigidly shifted into a direction imposed by some wind
velocity - known as the Taylor frozen screen approximation. This simple
technique factorizes spatial and temporal variables and aims at binding the

a candidate burst from a soft-gamma repeater, similar to the giant flare from

such a galaxy is small (<1%), although the size of the error circle (2.6

the error circle also includes a moderately rich galaxy cluster at z=0.43,

short GRBs have for regions of high mass density. No residual optical or
infrared emission has been observed, either in the form of an afterglow or

methods, with finite basis sets, cannot in general yield the Hartree-Fock (HF)

a complete basis are linearly dependent, the HF ground state energy can only be
obtained via a basis set xOEP scheme in the special case that all products of
occupied and unoccupied orbitals emerging from the employed orbital basis set
are linearly independent from each other. In this case, however, exchange
potentials leading to the HF ground state energy exhibit unphysical
oscillations and do not represent a Kohn-Sham (KS) exchange potential. These
findings solve the seemingly paradoxical results of Staroverov, Scuseria and
Davidson that certain finite basis set xOEP calculations lead to the HF ground
state energy despite the fact that within a real space (or complete basis)
representation the xOEP ground state energy is always higher than the HF
energy. Moreover, whether or not the occupied and unoccupied orbital products
are linearly independent, it is shown that basis set xOEP methods only
represent exact exchange-only (EXX) KS methods, i.e., proper density-functional
methods, if the orbital basis set and the auxiliary basis set representing the
exchange potential are balanced to each other, i.e., if the orbital basis is
comprehensive enough for a given auxiliary basis. Otherwise xOEP methods do not
represent EXX KS methods and yield unphysical exchange potentials.

is unresolved, and appears to be centered on the intrinsically fainter (and
also less highly magnified) of the two UV components. The width of the CO line

efficiencies and line widths suggests that LBGJ213512 is a high-redshift,

gas-to-dynamical mass fraction as observed in the submillimeter-selected
population, although the gas surface density and star-formation efficiency is a
factor of 3x less, suggesting less vigorous activity. We discuss the
uncertainties in our conclusions arising from adopting a CO-to-H2 conversion
factor appropriate for either the Milky Way or local luminous infrared
galaxies. These observations demonstrate that current facilities, when aided by
fortuitous gravitational magnification, can study 'ordinary' galaxies at
high-redshift and so act as pathfinders for ALMA.

systematic uncertainties and the depletion of baryons within r500 that is
predicted by simulations. The data therefore provide no compelling evidence for
undetected baryonic components, particularly any that vary in importance with
cluster mass. A unique feature of the current analysis is direct inclusion of
the contribution of intracluster light (ICL) in the baryon budget. The increase
in X-ray gas mass fraction with increasing total mass is entirely accounted for
by a decrease in the total stellar mass fraction, supporting the argument that
the behavior of both the stellar and X-ray gas components is dominated by a
decrease in star formation efficiency in more massive environments. Within just
the stellar component, the fraction of the total stellar luminosity in the BCG
and ICL decreases as velocity dispersion increases, suggesting that the BCG+ICL
component, and in particular the dominant ICL component, grows less efficiently
in higher mass environments. The degree to which this behavior arises from our
sample selection, which favored systems with central, giant elliptical
galaxies, remains unclear. A more robust result is the identification of low
mass groups with large BCG+ICL components, demonstrating that the creation of
intracluster stars does not require a massive cluster environment. Within r500

itinerant ones or atomic-like localized ones depending on their properties. For
heavy Fermion (HF) compounds, however, the f electrons show both itinerant and
localized behaviours depending on temperature. Above the characteristic
temperature T*, which is typically of the order of few K to few tens K, their
magnetic properties are well described by the ionic f-electron models,
suggesting that the f-electrons behave as 'localized' electrons. On the other
hand, well below T*, their Fermi surfaces (FS's) have been observed by
magneto-oscillatory techniques, and generally they can be explained well by the
'itinerant' f-electron model. These two models assume totally different natures
of felectrons, and how they transform between localized and itinerant state as
a function of temperatures has never been understood on the level of their
electronic structures. Here we have studied the band structure of the HF
antiferromagnetic superconductor UPd2Al3 well below and above T* by
angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES), and revealed the temperature
dependence of the electronic structure. We have found that the f-bands, which
form the FS's at low temperatures are excluded from FS's at high temperatures.
The present results demonstrate how the same f-electrons show both itinerant

important information for the unified description of the localized and
itinerant nature of HF compounds.

rotating magnetar and the surrounding supernova shock and host star. The
dynamics is modeled using the two-dimensional, axisymmetric thin-shell
equations. In the first ~10-100 seconds after core collapse the magnetar
inflates a bubble of plasma and magnetic fields behind the supernova shock. The
bubble expands asymmetrically because of the pinching effect of the toroidal
magnetic field, just as in the analogous problem of the evolution of pulsar
wind nebulae. The degree of asymmetry depends on E_mag/E_tot. The correct value
of E_mag/E_tot is uncertain because of uncertainties in the conversion of
magnetic energy into kinetic energy at large radii in relativistic winds; we
argue, however, that bubbles inflated by newly formed magnetars are likely to
be significantly more magnetized than their pulsar counterparts. We show that
for a ratio of magnetic to total power supplied by the central magnetar
L_mag/L_tot ~ 0.1 the bubble expands relatively spherically. For L_mag/L_tot ~
0.3, however, most of the pressure in the bubble is exerted close to the
rotation axis, driving a collimated outflow out through the host star. This can
account for the collimation inferred from observations of long-duration
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Outflows from magnetars become increasingly
magnetically dominated at late times, due to the decrease in neutrino-driven
mass loss as the young neutron star cools. We thus suggest that the
magnetar-driven bubble initially expands relatively spherically, enhancing the
energy of the associated supernova, while at late times it becomes
progressively more collimated, producing the GRB.

matter candidates. We analyse the stability of the Einstein clusters against
both radial and non-radial pulsations, and we show that the Einstein clusters
are dynamically stable. With the use of the Buchdahl type inequalities for
anisotropic bodies, we derive upper limits on the velocity of the particles
defining the cluster. These limits are consistent with those obtained from
stability considerations. The study of light deflection shows that the
gravitational lensing effect is slightly smaller for the Einstein clusters, as
compared to the singular isothermal density sphere model for dark matter.
Therefore lensing observations may discriminate, at least in principle, between

reports the performances of the charge injection capability based on the ground

dispersion of 91eV in FWHM in a specific column for the charges equivalent to
the X-ray energy of 5.1keV. This dispersion width is significantly smaller than
that of the X-ray events of 113eV (FWHM) at approximately the same energy. The
amount of charge loss during transfer in a specific column, which is measured
with the charge injection capability, is consistent with that measured with the
calibration source. These results indicate that the charge injection technique
can accurately measure column-dependent charge losses rather than the
calibration sources. The column-to-column CTI correction to the calibration
source spectra significantly reduces the line widths compared to those with a
column-averaged CTI correction (from 193eV to 173eV in FWHM on an average at

current, the resistance distribution becomes sharp and Gaussian due to the
creation of microweldings between some beads. The action of nearby
electromagnetic waves (sparks) on the electrical conductivity of the chain is
also studied. The spark effect is to lower the resistance values of the more
resistive contacts, the best conductive ones remaining unaffected by the spark
production. The spark is able to induce through the chain a current enough to
create microweldings between some beads. This explains why the electrical
resistance of a granular medium is so sensitive to the electromagnetic waves
produced in its vicinity.

  one-dimensional, nonlinear, and sparsely observed MHD system",,"Nonlinear processes in Geophysics, Vol. 14, pp 163-180, 2007","10.5194/npg-14-163-2007",,"physics.geo-ph",,"  Secular variations of the geomagnetic field have been measured with a
continuously improving accuracy during the last few hundred years, culminating
nowadays with satellite data. It is however well known that the dynamics of the
magnetic field is linked to that of the velocity field in the core and any
attempt to model secular variations will involve a coupled dynamical system for
magnetic field and core velocity. Unfortunately, there is no direct observation
of the velocity. Independently of the exact nature of the above-mentioned
coupled system -- some version being currently under construction -- the
question is debated in this paper whether good knowledge of the magnetic field
can be translated into good knowledge of core dynamics. Furthermore, what will
be the impact of the most recent and precise geomagnetic data on our knowledge
of the geomagnetic field of the past and future? These questions are cast into
the language of variational data assimilation, while the dynamical system
considered in this paper consists in a set of two oversimplified
one-dimensional equations for magnetic and velocity fields. This toy model
retains important features inherited from the induction and Navier-Stokes
equations: non-linear magnetic and momentum terms are present and its linear
response to small disturbances contains Alfv\'en waves. It is concluded that
variational data assimilation is indeed appropriate in principle, even though
the velocity field remains hidden at all times; it allows us to recover the
entire evolution of both fields from partial and irregularly distributed
information on the magnetic field. This work constitutes a first step on the
way toward the reassimilation of historical geomagnetic data and geomagnetic
forecast.

"0705.1779","Anthony Bloch","Fred Adams and Anthony Bloch","Hill's Equation with Random Forcing Terms",,,,,"math-ph astro-ph math.MP",,"  Motivated by a class of orbit problems in astrophysics, this paper considers
solutions to Hill's equation with forcing strength parameters that vary from
cycle to cycle. The results are generalized to include period variations from
cycle to cycle. The development of the solutions to the differential equation
is governed by a discrete map. For the general case of Hill's equation in the
unstable limit, we consider separately the case of purely positive matrix
elements and those with mixed signs; we then find exact expressions, bounds,
and working estimates for the growth rates. We also find exact expressions,
estimates, and bounds for the infinite products of several $2 \times 2$
matrices with random variables in the matrix elements. In the limit of sharply
spiked forcing terms (the delta function limit), we find analytic solutions for
each cycle and for the discrete map that matches solutions from cycle to cycle;
for this case we find the growth rates and the condition for instability in the
limit of large forcing strength, as well as the widths of the stable/unstable
zones.

groundbased gravitational-wave interferometers such as LIGO, GE0600 and VIRGO.
One mechanism that may lead to significant non-asymmetries is the internal
magnetic field. It is well known that a magnetic star will not be spherical
and, if the magnetic axis is not aligned with the spin axis, the deformation
will lead to the emission of gravitational waves. The aim of this paper is to
develop a formalism that would allow us to model magnetically deformed stars,
using both realistic equations of state and field configurations. As a first
step, we consider a set of simplified model problems. Focusing on dipolar
fields, we determine the internal magnetic field which is consistent with a
given neutron star model. We then calculate the associated deformation. We
conclude by discussing the relevance of our results for current
gravitational-wave detectors and future prospects.

These simulations have been performed by implementing a detailed model of

metal release from SNII, SNIa and AGB stars, by properly accounting for the
lifetimes of stars of different mass, as well as to change the stellar initial
mass function (IMF), the lifetime function and the stellar yields. As such, our
implementation of chemical evolution represents a powerful instrument to follow
the cosmic history of metal production. The simulations presented here have
been performed with the twofold aim of checking numerical effects, as well as
the impact of changing the model of chemical evolution and the efficiency of
stellar feedback.
