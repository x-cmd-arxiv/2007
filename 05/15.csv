needed to compare theoretical models to experimental observations. While, in
general, parton showers give a good description of the experimental data, the
precise functional form of the probability distribution underlying the event
generation is generally not known. The reason is that realistic parton showers
are required to conserve four-momentum at each vertex. In this paper we
investigate in detail how four-momentum conservation is enforced in a standard
parton shower and why this destroys the analytic control of the probability
distribution. We show how to modify a parton shower algorithm such that it
conserves four-momentum at each vertex, but for which the full analytic form of
the probability distribution is known. We then comment how this analytic
control can be used to match matrix element calculations with parton showers,
and to estimate effects of power corrections and other uncertainties in parton
showers.

showed to be a K dwarf binary system superimposed on a late F dwarf star. This

renormalization factor that converts the bare lattice operator to its

two standard discretizations of the heavy-quark action. As an application, we
find that this factor brings the previous quenched predictions of the B* - B

detect its evolution. At present, observational constraints are consistent with
a cosmological constant and there is no firm evidence for any evolution in the
dark energy equation of state w. In this paper, we pose the following question:
suppose that future dark energy surveys constrain w at low redshift to be
consistent with -1 to a percent level accuracy, what are the implications for
models of dynamical dark energy? We investigate this problem in a
model-independent way by following quintessence field trajectories in `energy'
phase-space. Attractor dynamics in this phase-space leads to two classes of
acceptable models: 1) models with flat potentials, i.e. an effective
cosmological constant, and 2) models with potentials that suddenly flatten with
a characteristic kink. The prospect of further constraining the second class of
models from distance measurements and fluctuation growth rates at low redshift
(z<3) seems poor. However, in some models of this second class, the dark energy
makes a significant contribution to the total energy density at high redshift.
Such models can be further constrained from observation of the cosmic microwave
background anisotropies and from primordial nucleosynthesis. It is possible,
therefore, to construct models in which the dark energy at high redshift causes
observable effects, even if future dark energy surveys constrain w at low
redshift to be consistent with -1 to high precision.

  extended","Phys.Rev.D76:104036,2007","10.1103/PhysRevD.76.104036",,"hep-th gr-qc",,"  Bigravity is a natural arena where a non-linear theory of massive gravity can
be formulated. If the interaction between the metrics $f$ and $g$ is
non-derivative, spherically symmetric exact solutions can be found. At large
distances from the origin, these are generically Lorentz-breaking bi-flat
solutions (provided that the corresponding vacuum energies are adjusted
appropriately). The spectrum of linearized perturbations around such
backgrounds contains a massless as well as a massive graviton, with {\em two}
physical polarizations each. There are no propagating vectors or scalars, and
the theory is ghost free (as happens with certain massive gravities with
explicit breaking of Lorentz invariance). At the linearized level, corrections
to GR are proportional to the square of the graviton mass, and so there is no
vDVZ discontinuity. Surprisingly, the solution of linear theory for a static
spherically symmetric source does {\em not} agree with the linearization of any
of the known exact solutions. The latter coincide with the standard
Schwarzschild-(A)dS solutions of General Relativity, with no corrections at
all. Another interesting class of solutions is obtained where $f$ and $g$ are
proportional to each other. The case of bi-de Sitter solutions is analyzed in
some detail.

libraries with observations, aiming at detecting weaknesses and strengths from
the stellar population modelling point of view. We compared model predictions

features. Concerning the broad-band colours, we measured the stellar colour
given by three recent sets of model atmospheres and flux distributions(Castelli
& Kurucz 2003; Gustafsson et al. 2003; Brott & Hauschildt 2005), and compared
them with a recent UBVRIJHK calibration (Worthey & Lee 2007). We found that the
models can reproduce with reasonable accuracy the stellar colours for a fair
interval in effective temperatures and gravities. The exceptions are: 1) the
U-B colour, where the models are typically redder than the observations, and;
2) the very cool stars in general (V-K > ~3).Concerning the high resolution
features, we measured 35 spectral indices defined in the literature on three
high resolution synthetic libraries (Coelho et al. 2005; Martins et al. 2005;
Munari et al. 2005), and compared them with the observed measurements given by
three empirical libraries (Valdes et al.2004; Sanchez-Blazquez et al. 2006;
Prugniel & Soubiran 2001). We found that the direct comparison between models
and observations is not a simple task, given the uncertainties in parameter
determinations of empirical libraries. Taking that aside, we found that in
general the three libraries present similar behaviours and systematic
deviations. For stars with Teff < 7000K, the library by Coelho et al. (2005) is
the one with best average performance. We detect that lists of atomic and
molecular line opacities still need improvement, specially in the blue region
of thespectrum, and for the cool stars (Teff < ~4500K).

0.3, and vsini < 2 km/s, and derive a stellar mass of 0.90 +- 0.15 M_sun. We
estimate a planetary mass of 1.92 +- 0.23 M_Jup, based on the sinusoidal
variation of our high-precision radial velocity measurements. This variation
has a period and phase consistent with our transit photometry. Our spectra show
no evidence of line bisector variations that would indicate a blended eclipsing
binary star. From detailed modeling of our B and z photometry of the 2.5%-deep
transits, we determine a stellar radius 0.802 +- 0.046 R_sun and a planetary
radius 1.295 +- 0.081 R_Jup. TrES-3 has one of the shortest orbital periods of
the known transiting exoplanets, facilitating studies of orbital decay and mass
loss due to evaporation, and making it an excellent target for future studies
of infrared emission and reflected starlight.

Double-frequency orbits and loops","10 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12069.x",,"astro-ph",,"  Bars in galaxies are mainly supported by particles trapped around stable
periodic orbits. These orbits represent oscillatory motion with only one
frequency, which is the bar driving frequency, and miss free oscillations. We
show that a similar situation takes place in double bars: particles get trapped
around parent orbits, which in this case represent oscillatory motion with two
frequencies of driving by the two bars, and which also lack free oscillations.
Thus the parent orbits, which constitute the backbone of an oscillating
potential of two independently rotating bars, are the double-frequency orbits.
These orbits do not close in any reference frame, but they map onto loops,
first introduced by Maciejewski & Sparke (1997). Trajectories trapped around
the parent double-frequency orbit map onto a set of points confined within a
ring surrounding the loop.

includes a broad landscape of particle physics models, encompassing the
non-supersymmetric 4D extensions of the standard model, and models based on
supersymmetry, on extra dimensions, on strings and on branes. The
supersymmetric models discussed include complex mSUGRA and its extensions,
while the models based on extra dimensions include 5D models including models
based on warped geometry. CP violation beyond the standard model is central to
achieving the desired amount of baryon asymmetry in the universe via
baryogenesis and leptogenesis. They also affect a variety of particle physics
phenomena: electric dipole moments, $g-2$, relic density and detection rates
for neutralino dark matter in supersymmetric theories, Yukawa unification in
grand unified and string based models, and sparticle production cross sections,
and their decays patterns and signatures at hadron colliders. Additionally CP
violations can generate CP even-CP odd Higgs mixings, affect the neutral Higgs
spectrum and lead to phenomena detectable at colliders. Prominent among these
are the CP violation effects in decays of neutral and charged Higgs bosons.
Neutrino masses introduce new sources of CP violation which will be explored in
neutrino factories in the future. Such phases can also enter in proton
stability in unified models of particle interactions. The current experimental
status of CP violation is discussed and possibilities for the future outlined.

ram-pressure is too small to strip the interstellar medium of galaxies around
the virial radius of a cluster, the fairly high metallicity that we found there
indicates that the metals in the ICM are not transported from member galaxies
by ram-pressure stripping. Instead, the uniformity suggests that the
proto-cluster region was extensively polluted with metals by extremely powerful
outflows (superwinds) from galaxies before the clusters formed. We also
searched for the oxygen emission from the warm--hot intergalactic medium in

fossil information about the process of star formation and the dynamical
history of the systems. In order to advance in the understanding of these
questions, we have made an extensive analysis of the frequency distribution f
(a) for wide binaries (a>25 AU) in the various published catalogues, as well as
in our own (Poveda et al., 1994; Allen et al., 2000; Poveda & Hernandez, 2003).
Based upon all these studies we have established that the frequency f(a) is
function of the age of the system and follows Oepik's distribution f(a) ~ 1/a
in the range of 100 AU < a < a[c](t), where a[c](t) is a critical semi-major
axis beyond which binaries have dissociated by encounters with massive objects.
We argue that the physics behind the distribution f(a) ~ 1/a is a process of
energy relaxation, analogous to that present in stellar clusters (secular
relaxation) or in spherical galaxies (violent relaxation). The frequency
distribution of mass ratios in triple systems as well as the existence of
runaway stars, indicate that both types of relaxation are important in the
process of binary and multiple star formation.

of the n base. Theory takes into account that drift velocities and impact
ionization coefficients differ between electrons and holes, and it makes
quantitative predictions for any semiconductor material possible.

systems have been chosen because they provide access to a regime of red-shift
space that previous weak MgII studies have not looked at. The densities,
metallicities, Doppler parameters, and column densities of these systems are
compared to those of other weak MgII systems at lower redshift. There is no
significant statistical variation in the properties of the absorbers over the
redshift range 0.4<z<2.4. The number density per unit redshift is known to
decrease for weak MgII absorbers between z~1 and z~2 by a greater amount than
predicted from cosmological effects and changes in the extragalactic ionizing
background alone. We suggest that, because the physical properties of the
absorber population are not seen to change significantly across this range,
that the evolution in dN/dz is due to a decrease in the activity that gives
rise to weak MgII absorption, and not due to a change in the processes that
form weak MgII absorbers. The presence of separate, but aligned (in velocity)
low and high density clouds in all single cloud weak MgII absorbers provides an
important diagnostic of their geometry. We discuss possible origins in dwarf

predominantly triaxial. Overall subhalos are more spherical than the host halo,
with minor to major and intermediate to major axis ratios of 0.68 and 0.83,
respectively. Like isolated halos, subhalos tend to be less spherical in their
central regions. The principal axis ratios are independent of subhalo mass,
when the shapes are measured within a physical scale like r_Vmax, the radius of
the peak of the circular velocity curve. Subhalos tend to be slightly more
spherical closer to the host halo center. The spatial distribution of the
subhalos traces the prolate shape of the host halo when they are selected by
the largest V_max they ever had, i.e. before they experienced strong tidal mass
loss. The subhalos' orientation is not random: the major axis tends to align
with the direction towards the host halo center. This alignment disappears for
halos beyond 3 r_200 and is more pronounced when the shapes are measured in the
outer regions of the subhalos. The radial alignment is preserved during a
subhalo's orbit and they become elongated during pericenter passage, indicating
that the alignment is likely caused by the host halo's tidal forces. These
tidal interactions with the host halo act to make subhalos rounder over time.

the operator of multiplication by $S$ defines a contraction operator between
two Hardy Hilbert spaces, $S$ satisfies a von Neumann inequality, a certain
operator-valued kernel associated with $S$ is positive-definite, and $S$ can be
realized as the transfer function of a dissipative (or even conservative)
discrete-time linear input/state/output linear system. Various multivariable
generalizations of this class have appeared recently,one of the most
encompassing being that of Muhly and Solel where the unit disk is replaced by
the strict unit ball of the elements of a dual correspondence $E^{\sigma}$
associated with a $W^{*}$-correspondence $E$ over a $W^{*}$-algebra $\cA$

we add here is the introduction of the notion of reproducing kernel Hilbert

reproducing kernel Hilbert correspondences associated with a completely
positive analogue of the classical Szeg\""o kernel. In this way we are able to
make the analogy between the Muhly-Solel Schur class and the classical Schur
class more complete. We also illustrate the theory by specializing it to some
well-studied special cases; in some instances there result new kinds of

hep-th/0611182 and gr-qc/0703002 and obtain its general spherically symmetric
vacuum solution. It respects the analog of the Birkhoff theorem, i.e., the
vacuum spherically symmetric solution is necessarily static. As in general
relativity, the spherically symmetric solution is seen to describe a black
hole. The exterior geometry is essentially the same as in the Schwarzschild
case, with power-law corrections to the Newtonian potential. The behavior
inside the black-hole region is different from the Schwarzschild case in that
the usual spacetime singularity gets replaced by a singular surface of a new
type, where all basic fields of the theory remain finite but metric ceases to
exist. The theory does not admit arbitrarily small black holes: for small
objects, the curvature on the would-be horizon is so strong that non-metric
modifications prevent the horizon from being formed. The theory allows for
modifications of gravity of very interesting nature. We discuss three physical
effects, namely, (i) correction to Newton's law in the neighborhood of the
source, (ii) renormalization of effective gravitational and cosmological
constants at large distances from the source, and (iii) additional redshift
factor between spatial regions of different curvature. The first two effects
can be responsible, respectively, for the observed anomaly in the acceleration
of the Pioneer spacecraft and for the alleged missing mass in spiral galaxies
and other astrophysical objects. The third effect can be used to propose a
non-cosmological explanation of high redshifts of quasars and gamma-ray bursts.

entanglement of quantum fields between inside and outside of the horizon.
Motivated by the observation that certain modes of gravitational fluctuations
in a black-hole background behave as scalar fields, we compute the entanglement
entropy of such a field, by tracing over its degrees of freedom inside a
sphere. We show that while this entropy is proportional to the area of the
sphere when the field is in its ground state, a correction term proportional to
a fractional power of area results when the field is in a superposition of
ground and excited states. The area law is thus recovered for large areas.
Further, we identify location of the degrees of freedom that give rise to the
above entropy.

  http://www2.scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~machidam/protostar/proto/paper2-submit.pdf",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The driving mechanism of jets and outflows in star formation process is
studied using resistive MHD nested grid simulations. We calculated cloud
evolution from the molecular cloud core to the stellar core. In the collapsing
cloud core, we found two distinct flows: Low-velocity flows (sim 5 km/s) with a
wide opening angle, driven from the adiabatic core, and high-velocity flows
(sim 30 km/s) with good collimation, driven from the protostar. High-velocity
flows are enclosed by low-velocity flows after protostar formation. The
difference in the degree of collimation between the two flows is caused by the
strength of the magnetic field and configuration of the magnetic field lines.
The magnetic field around an adiabatic core is strong and has an hourglass
configuration; therefore, flows from the adiabatic core are driven mainly by
the magnetocentrifugal mechanism and guided by the hourglass-like field lines.
In contrast, the magnetic field around the protostar is weak and has a straight
configuration owing to Ohmic dissipation in the high-density gas region.
Therefore, flows from the protostar are driven mainly by the magnetic pressure
gradient force and guided by straight field lines. Differing depth of the
gravitational potential between the adiabatic core and the protostar cause the
difference of the flow speed. Low-velocity flows correspond to the observed
molecular outflows, while high-velocity flows correspond to the observed
optical jets. We suggest that the outflow and the jet are driven by different
cores, rather than that the outflow being entrained by the jet.

gluing theorem for two index 1 pseudoholomorphic curves U_+ and U_- in the
symplectization of a contact 3-manifold. We assume that for each embedded Reeb
orbit gamma, the total multiplicity of the negative ends of U_+ at covers of
gamma agrees with the total multiplicity of the positive ends of U_- at covers
of gamma. However, unlike in the usual gluing story, here the individual
multiplicities are allowed to differ. In this situation, one can often glue U_+
and U_- to an index 2 curve by inserting genus zero branched covers of
R-invariant cylinders between them. This paper shows that the signed count of
such gluings equals a signed count of zeroes of a certain section of an
obstruction bundle over the moduli space of branched covers of the cylinder.
Part I obtained a combinatorial formula for the latter count and, assuming the
result of the present paper, deduced that the differential d in embedded
contact homology satisfies d^2=0. The present paper completes all of the
analysis that was needed in Part I. The gluing technique explained here is in
principle applicable to more gluing problems. We also prove some lemmas
concerning the generic behavior of pseudoholomorphic curves in

realistic models of population structure, yet the problem of dynamically
modeling SIR-type epidemics in random networks remains complex. I resolve this
dilemma by showing how the SIR dynamics can be modeled with a system of three
nonlinear ODE's. The method makes use of the probability generating function
(PGF) formalism for representing the degree distribution of a random network
and makes use of network-centric quantities such as the number of edges in a
well-defined category rather than node-centric quantities such as the number of
infecteds or susceptibles. The PGF provides a simple means of translating
between network and node-centric variables and determining the epidemic
incidence at any time. The theory also provides a simple means of tracking the
evolution of the degree distribution among susceptibles or infecteds. The
equations are used to demonstrate the dramatic effects that the degree
distribution plays on the final size of an epidemic as well as the speed with
which it spreads through the population. Power law degree distributions are
observed to generate an almost immediate expansion phase yet have a smaller
final size compared to homogeneous degree distributions such as the Poisson.
The equations are compared to stochastic simulations, which show good agreement
with the theory. Finally, the dynamic equations provide an alternative way of
determining the epidemic threshold where large-scale epidemics are expected to
occur, and below which epidemic behavior is limited to finite-sized outbreaks.

variations of BL Lacertae, using the long and well-sampled B and R-band light
curves of the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) collaboration, binned on time
intervals of 1 day. The relation between spectral slope and flux (the spectrum
gets bluer as the source flux increases) is well described by a power-law
model, although there is significant scatter around the best-fitting model
line. To some extent, this is due to the spectral evolution of the source
(along well-defined loop-like structures) during low-amplitude events, which
are superimposed on the major optical flares, and evolve on time scales of a
few days. The ""bluer-when-brighter"" mild chromatism of the long-term variations
of the source can be explained if the flux increases/decreases faster in the B
than in the R band. The B and R-band variations are well correlated, with no
significant, measurable delays larger than a few days. On the other hand, we
find that the spectral variations lead those in the flux light curves by ~ 4

properties. CMEs originating in active regions and accompanied by strong flares
are usually faster and accelerated more impulsively than CMEs associated with
filament eruptions outside active regions and weak flares. It has been proposed
more than two decades ago that there are two separate types of CMEs, fast
(impulsive) CMEs and slow (gradual) CMEs. However, this concept may not be
valid, since the large data sets acquired in recent years do not show two
distinct peaks in the CME velocity distribution and reveal that both fast and
slow CMEs can be accompanied by both weak and strong flares. We present
numerical simulations which confirm our earlier analytical result that a
flux-rope CME model permits describing fast and slow CMEs in a unified manner.
We consider a force-free coronal magnetic flux rope embedded in the potential
field of model bipolar and quadrupolar active regions. The eruption is driven
by the torus instability which occurs if the field overlying the flux rope
decreases sufficiently rapidly with height. The acceleration profile depends on
the steepness of this field decrease, corresponding to fast CMEs for rapid
decrease, as is typical of active regions, and to slow CMEs for gentle
decrease, as is typical of the quiet Sun. Complex (quadrupolar) active regions
lead to the fastest CMEs.

infectious diseases. Current mathematical methods for epidemiological
forecasting on networks largely assume that contacts between individuals are
fixed, at least for the duration of an outbreak. In reality, contact patterns
may be quite fluid, with individuals frequently making and breaking social or
sexual relationships. Here we develop a mathematical approach to predicting
disease transmission on dynamic networks in which each individual has a
characteristic behavior (typical contact number), but the identities of their
contacts change in time. We show that dynamic contact patterns shape
epidemiological dynamics in ways that cannot be adequately captured in static
network models or mass-action models. Our new model interpolates smoothly
between static network models and mass-action models using a mixing parameter,
thereby providing a bridge between disparate classes of epidemiological models.
Using epidemiological and sexual contact data from an Atlanta high school, we
then demonstrate the utility of this method for forecasting and controlling
sexually transmitted disease outbreaks.

exponential factor involving the action of the classical string. On the gauge
theory side, expressions for perturbative amplitudes at strong coupling were
previously proposed only for specific helicities of external particles -- the
maximally helicity violating or MHV amplitudes. These follow from the
exponential ansatz of Bern, Dixon and Smirnov for MHV amplitudes in N=4 SYM. In
this paper we examine the amplitudes dependence on helicities and
particle-types of external states. We consider the prefactor of string
amplitudes and give arguments suggesting that the prefactor at strong coupling
should be the same as the Yang-Mills tree-level amplitude for the same process.
This implies that scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM simplify dramatically in the
strong coupling limit. It follows from our proposal that in this limit all (MHV
and non-MHV) n-point amplitudes are given by the (known) tree-level Yang-Mills
result times the helicity-independent (and particle-type-independent) universal
exponential.

increasing rotation rate. Using inversion techniques akin to medical imaging,
the rotationally broadened profiles from such stars can be used to reconstruct
`Doppler images' of the distribution of cool, dark starspots on their stellar
surfaces. Interacting binaries, however, contain some of the most rapidly
rotating late-type stars known and thus provide important tests of stellar
dynamo models. Furthermore, magnetic activity is thought to play a key role in
their evolution, behaviour and accretion dynamics. Despite this, we know
comparatively little about the magnetic activity and its influence on such
binaries. In this review we summarise the concepts behind indirect imaging of
these systems, and present movies of the starspot distributions on the cool
stars in some interacting binaries. We conclude with a look at the future

between a two-level system and the Dirac electron that comes to light when the
two-level system is described within the formalism of second quantization in
terms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators. The analogy enables one
to introduce all the powerful tools of relativistic QED (albeit in a greatly

useful. In particular, the QED concept of the vacuum polarization finds its
close counterpart in the photon scattering off a two level-system leading via
the linear response theory to the general formulas for the atomic
polarizability and the dynamic single spin susceptibility. To illustrate the
usefulness of these methods, we calculate the polarizability and susceptibility
up to the fourth order of perturbation theory. These {\em ab initio}
calculations resolve some ambiguities concerning the sign prescription and the
optical damping that arise in the phenomenological treatment. We also show that
the methods used to study two-level systems (qubits) can be extended to
many-level systems (qudits). As an example, we describe the interaction with

the ensuing formation and decay of a binary massive black hole (MBH), are
dominated by massive perturbers (MPs) such as giant molecular clouds or
clusters. MPs accelerate relaxation by orders of magnitude relative to 2-body
stellar relaxation alone, and efficiently scatter stars into the binary MBH's
orbit. The 3-body star-binary MBH interactions shrink the binary MBH to the
point where energy losses from the emission of gravitational waves (GW) lead to
rapid coalescence. We model this process based on observed and simulated MP
distributions and take into account the decreased efficiency of the star-binary
MBH interaction due to acceleration in the galactic potential. We show that
mergers of gas-rich galactic nuclei lead to binary MBH coalescence well within
the Hubble time. Moreover, lower-mass binary MBHs (<10^8 Msun) require only a
few percent of the typical gas mass in a post-merger nucleus to coalesce in a
Hubble time. The fate of a binary MBH in a gas poor galactic merger is less
certain, although massive stellar structures (e.g. clusters, stellar rings)
could likewise lead to efficient coalescence. These coalescence events are
observable by their strong GW emission. MPs thus increase the cosmic rate of
such GW events, lead to a higher mass deficit in the merged galactic core and
suppress the formation of triple MBH systems and the resulting ejection of MBHs
into intergalactic space.

systems for the investigation of the physics in reduced dimensions. In the
metallic state of a one-dimensional solid, Fermi-liquid theory breaks down and
spin and charge degrees of freedom become separated. But the metallic phase is
not stable in one dimension: as the temperature is reduced, the electronic
charge and spin tend to arrange themselves in an ordered fashion due to strong
correlations. The competition of the different interactions is responsible for
which broken-symmetry ground state is eventually realized in a specific
compound and which drives the system towards an insulating state.
  Here we review the various ordering phenomena and how they can be identified
by optic and magnetic measurements. While the final results might look very
similar in the case of a charge density wave and a charge-ordered metal, for
instance, the physical cause is completely different. When density waves form,
a gap opens in the density of states at the Fermi energy due to nesting of the
one-dimension Fermi surface sheets. When a one-dimensional metal becomes a
charge-ordered Mott insulator, on the other hand, the short-range Coulomb
repulsion localizes the charge on the lattice sites and even causes certain
charge patterns.
  We try to point out the similarities and conceptional differences of these
phenomena and give an example for each of them. Particular emphasis will be put
on collective phenomena which are inherently present as soon as ordering breaks
the symmetry of the system.

groundstates of mean-field diluted spin glasses) undergoes several structural
phase transitions as the amount of constraints is increased. This set first
breaks down into a large number of well separated clusters. At the freezing
transition, which is in general distinct from the clustering one, some
variables (spins) take the same value in all solutions of a given cluster. In
this paper we study the critical behavior around the freezing transition, which
appears in the unfrozen phase as the divergence of the sizes of the
rearrangements induced in response to the modification of a variable. The
formalism is developed on generic constraint satisfaction problems and applied
in particular to the random satisfiability of boolean formulas and to the
coloring of random graphs. The computation is first performed in random tree
ensembles, for which we underline a connection with percolation models and with
the reconstruction problem of information theory. The validity of these results
for the original random ensembles is then discussed in the framework of the
cavity method.

(1) a new library of synthetic galaxy spectra, and (2) first results of

synthetic galaxy spectra using the PEGASE.2 code, which is based on galaxy
evolution models that take into account metallicity evolution, extinction
correction, emission lines (with stellar spectra based on the BaSeL library).
Our classification and regression models are Support Vector Machines (SVMs),
which are kernel-based nonlinear estimators. Results:We produce a basic library
of about 4000 zero redshift galaxy spectra covering the main Hubble types over
wavelength range 250 to 1050 nm at a sampling of 1 nm or less. It is computed
on a regular grid of four key astrophysical parameters for each type and for
intermediate random values of the same parameters. An extended library
reproduces this at a series of redshifts. Initial results from the SVM
classifiers and parametrizers are promising, indicating that Hubble types can
be reliably predicted and several parameters estimated with low bias and
variance. Comparing the colours of our synthetic library with Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) spectra we find good agreement over the full range of Hubble
types and parameters.

the case then the speed of light, in fact any speed, must decrease inversely
proportional to this age. The immediate consequence is that energy is not
conserved: the hypothesis that time is a homogeneous property implies
conservation of energy (the theorem of Noether). Nonconservation of energy
follows from the condition that any time interval is proportional to the
cosmological time, and therefore time can not be homogeneous. From the
uncertainty principle, taking the constant of Planck as a real constant, time
independent, it follows that any energy in the Universe decreases linearly with
time. We then prove that Schroedinger equation does not change, except for the
potential energy term. The future of the Universe gives for the wave functions
a long sinusoidal spatial solution, so that everything becomes unlocalized. The
relativistic absolute interval remains the same, even with a changing speed of

be used to minimize taxes using examples concerned with Clarke tax and public
projects.

0024+17 at z~0.4 from ACS data, unifying both strong- and weak-lensing
constraints. The weak-lensing signal from a dense distribution of background
galaxies (~120 per square arcmin) across the cluster enables the derivation of
a high-resolution parameter-free mass map. The strongly-lensed objects tightly
constrain the mass structure of the cluster inner region on an absolute scale,
breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy. The mass reconstruction of Cl 0024+17
obtained in such a way is remarkable. It reveals a ringlike dark matter
substructure at r~75"" surrounding a soft, dense core at r~50"". We interpret
this peculiar sub-structure as the result of a high-speed line-of-sight
collision of two massive clusters 1-2 Gyr ago. Such an event is also indicated
by the cluster velocity distribution. Our numerical simulation with purely
collisionless particles demonstrates that such density ripples can arise by
radially expanding, decelerating particles that originally comprised the
pre-collision cores. Cl 0024+17 can be likened to the bullet cluster 1E0657-56,
but viewed $along$ the collision axis at a much later epoch. In addition, we
show that the long-standing mass discrepancy for Cl 0024+17 between X-ray and
lensing can be resolved by treating the cluster X-ray emission as coming from a
superposition of two X-ray systems. The cluster's unusual X-ray surface
brightness profile that requires a two isothermal sphere description supports
this hypothesis.

  Tokyo","Journal of Geophysical Research D: Atmospheres (15/05/2007) in press",,"10.1029/2006JD007885",,"physics.ao-ph",,"  This paper studies two high-pollution episodes over Greater Tokyo: 9 and 10
December 1999, and 31 July and 1 August 2001. Results obtained with the
chemistry-transport model (CTM) Polair3D are compared to measurements of
inorganic PM2.5. To understand to which extent the aerosol processes modeled in
Polair3D impact simulated inorganic PM2.5, Polair3D is run with different
options in the aerosol module, e.g. with/without heterogeneous reactions. To
quantify the impact of processes outside the aerosol module, simulations are
also done with another CTM (CMAQ). In the winter episode, sulfate is mostly
impacted by condensation, coagulation, long-range transport, and deposition to
a lesser extent. In the summer episode, the effect of long-range transport
largely dominates. The impact of condensation/evaporation is dominant for
ammonium, nitrate and chloride in both episodes. However, the impact of the
thermodynamic equilibrium assumption is limited. The impact of heterogeneous
reactions is large for nitrate and ammonium, and taking heterogeneous reactions
into account appears to be crucial in predicting the peaks of nitrate and
ammonium. The impact of deposition is the same for all inorganic PM2.5. It is
small compared to the impact of other processes although it is not negligible.
The impact of nucleation is negligible in the summer episode, and small in the
winter episode. The impact of coagulation is larger in the winter episode than
in the summer episode, because the number of small particles is higher in the
winter episode as a consequence of nucleation.

consider first a Josephson junction which consists of two S/F bilayers
separated by an insulating layer. We show that for an antiparallel alignment of
the magnetization in the two F layers the Josephson critical current $I_c$
increases with increasing exchange field $h$. The second system we consider is
a S/F structure with a local inhomogeneity of the magnetization in the
ferromagnet near the S/F interface. Due to the proximity effect not only a
singlet but also a triplet component of the superconducting condensate is
induced in the ferromagnet. The latter penetrates over the length
$\sqrt{D/\epsilon}$ ($D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $\epsilon$ the
energy). In the case of temperatures of the order of the Thouless energy this
length is comparable to the length of the ferromagnet. This long-range
penetration leads to a significant increase of the ferromagnet conductance
below the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$. Contrary to the case of
the singlet component, the contribution to the conductance due to the odd
triplet component is not zero at $T = 0$ and $V = 0$ ($V$ is the voltage) and
decays with increasing temperature T in a monotonic way
