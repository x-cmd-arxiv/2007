spectrum and the density of dark matter within the framework of a standard
LambdaCDM model. We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to combine
independent measurements of the three dimensional weak gravitational lensing
shear field by the COSMOS survey, of low and high resolution Ly-alpha forest
flux power spectrum by SDSS and LUQAS, and of Cosmic Microwave Background
temperature and polarization anisotropies by WMAP. We note good agreement
between the amplitude of the matter power spectrum on intermediate and small
scales as inferred from Ly-alpha forest and lensing data. The Ly-alpha forest
data helps to break the sigma_8-Omega_m degeneracy characteristic of weak
lensing results, yielding sigma_8 = 0.876 +- 0.048 for COSMOS plus Ly-alpha
SDSS data. This is somewhat larger than the value preferred by the WMAP year
three CMB data. Combining all three data sets significantly tightens the
constraints on sigma_8, the spectral index of primordial density fluctuation
n_s, a possible running of the spectral index n_run and the matter density
Omega_m. Assuming no running, the joint constraints for COSMOS, SDSS and WMAP
are sigma_8 = 0.800 +- 0.023, n_s = 0.971 +- 0.011, Omega_m = 0.247 +- 0.016

dependent mass renormalization of mesons composed of one sea and one valence
quark, regardless of the type of fermion discretization methods used in the
valence and sea sectors. The value of the mass renormalization depends upon the
lattice actions used. This mixed meson mass shift is an important lattice
artifact to determine for mixed action calculations; because it modifies the
pion mass, it plays a central role in the low energy dynamics of all hadronic
correlation functions. We determine the leading order, $\mathcal{O}(a^2)$, and
next to leading order, $\mathcal{O}(a^2 m_\pi^2)$, additive mass shift of
\textit{valence-sea} mesons for a mixed lattice action with domain-wall valence
fermions and rooted staggered sea fermions, relevant to the majority of current
large scale mixed action lattice efforts. We find that on the asqtad improved
coarse MILC lattices, this additive mass shift is well parameterized in lattice
units by $\Delta(am)^2 = 0.034(2) -0.06(2) (a m_\pi)^2$, which in physical
units, using $a=0.125$ fm, corresponds to $\Delta(m)^2 = (291\pm 8

theory parameters, the corresponding mass shift is given by $a^2

next-to-leading order corrections including the necessary chiral logarithms for
this mixed action calculation, determined in this work. Within the precision of

an unusual galaxy that is very faint at all wavelengths shortward of 1.1
micron. Photometric redshift fits to data at 0.4 to 8 microns yield a
significant probability that it is an extremely massive galaxy at z~6.5. In
this paper we present new photometry at 16 microns and 22 micron from Spitzer
Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) peak-up imaging of the Great Observatories Origins
Deep Survey (GOODS) fields. We find that the spectral energy distribution shows
a factor of ~4 rise in flux density between the 16 micron and 22 micron
bandpass which is most likely due to the entrance of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon emission features into the 22 micron and 24 micron passbands. The
flux ratio between these bandpasses can be best fit by a z~1.7 luminous
infrared galaxy with a bolometric luminosity of (2-6)\times10^{11} L_sun
corresponding to a star-formation rate of 80 M_sun/yr. The predicted flux
density values at other longer wavelengths are below the detection limits of
current instrumentation but such sources could potentially be detected in
lensed submillimeter surveys. Re-evaluation of the optical/near-infrared
photometry continues to favor z>6 photometric redshift solutions, but we argue
that the consistency of the multiwavelength parameters of this galaxy with
other dusty starbursts favor the z~2 mid-infrared photometric redshift. The
data presented here provide evidence that optically undetected near-infrared
sources which are detected at 24 microns are most likely dusty, starburst
galaxies at a redshift of z~2 with stellar masses >10^{10} M_sun.

incorporates a novel strategy for learning regulatory programs. Novelties
include the use of a bottom-up Bayesian hierarchical clustering to construct
the regulatory programs, and the use of a conditional entropy measure to assign
regulators to the regulation program nodes. Using SynTReN data, we test the
performance of LeMoNe in a completely controlled situation and assess the
effect of the methodological changes we made with respect to an existing
software package, namely Genomica. Additionally, we assess the effect of
various parameters, such as the size of the data set and the amount of noise,
on the inference performance. Overall, application of Genomica and LeMoNe to
simulated data sets gave comparable results. However, LeMoNe offers some
advantages, one of them being that the learning process is considerably faster
for larger data sets. Additionally, we show that the location of the regulators
in the LeMoNe regulation programs and their conditional entropy may be used to
prioritize regulators for functional validation, and that the combination of
the bottom-up clustering strategy with the conditional entropy-based assignment
of regulators improves the handling of missing or hidden regulators.

orders of lens potential derivatives to be calculated analytically, while
ensuring a non-divergent total mass. We show how the observables predicted by
this profile differ from that of the original infinite-mass NFW profile.

decreasing the tidal radius allows stripped haloes to be modelled, providing a
framework for a fuller investigation of dark matter substructure in galaxies

higher order derivatives of the lens potential when studying catastrophes in
strong lenses.

the weak link it can be destroyed (``burned'') with probability p, providing a
bias in the motion of the molecular motor. A new theoretical approach that

as velocity and dispersion, at general conditions is presented. It is found
that dispersion is a decreasing function of the concentration of bridges, while
the dependence of dispersion on the burning probability is more complex. Our

distribution amplitudes of $1^3P_1$ and $1^1P_1$ axial-vector mesons, based on
QCD conformal partial wave expansion. Applying equations of motion, the
twist-three two-parton light-cone distribution amplitudes can be expressed in
terms of leading-twist and twist-three three-parton light-cone distribution
amplitudes. The relevant G-parity invariant and violating parameters,
containing the corrections due to the SU(3) breaking effects, are evaluated
from the QCD sum rule method. The results for axial-vector decay constants of
$1^3P_1$ states are presented. The values of tensor decay constants and
Gegenbauer moments of the leading twist distribution amplitudes for $1^1P_1$
states are updated. Using Gell-Mann-Okubo mass formula, the mixing angle for
the $f_8$ and $f_1$ of $1^3P_1$ states is $\theta_{^3P_1}\sim 38^\circ$, and
that for $h_8$ and $h_1$ of $1^1P_1$ states is $\theta_{^1P_1}\sim 10^\circ$.
The detailed properties for physical states $f_1(1285), f_1(1420), h_1(1170)$,
and $h_1(1380)$ are given. Assuming the mixing angle between $K_{1A}$ and
$K_{1B}$ to be $\theta_K=45^\circ$ or $-45^\circ$, we also give the detailed
study for $K_1(1270)$ and $K_1(1400)$. Using the conformal partial wave
expansion, we obtain the models for light-cone distribution amplitudes,
containing contributions up to conformal spin 9/2. It is interesting to note
that some distribution amplitudes have significant asymmetric behaviors, which
should be phenomenologically attractive.

dynamical investigations within tens of AU of high-mass YSOs--scales that are
critical for probing the interfaces where outflows from accretion disks are
launched and collimated. Using observations of SiO masers obtained with the VLA
and the VLBA, the KaLYPSO project is overcoming these limitations by mapping
the structure and dynamical/temporal evolution of the material 10-1000 AU from
the nearest high-mass YSO: Radio Source I in the Orion BN/KL region. Our data
include ~40 epochs of VLBA observations over a several-year period, allowing us
to track the proper motions of individual SiO maser spots and to monitor
changes in the physical conditions of the emitting material with time.
Ultimately these data will provide 3-D maps of the outflow structure over
approximately 30% of the outflow crossing time. Here we summarize recent
results from the KaLYPSO project, including evidence that high-mass star

the classical nova V1186 Sco. This slowly developing nova had an complex light
curve with multiple secondary peaks similar to those seen in PW Vul. The time
to decline 2 magnitudes, t$_2$, was 20 days but the erratic nature of the light
curve makes determination of intrinsic properties based on the decline time
(e.g., luminosity) problematic, and the often cited MMRD relationship of Della
Valle and Livio (1995) fails to yield a plausible distance. Spectra covering
0.35 to 35 $\mu$m were obtained in two separate epochs during the first year of
outburst. The first set of spectra, taken about 2 months after visible maximum,
are typical of a CO-type nova with narrow line emission from \ion{H}{1},
\ion{Fe}{2}, \ion{O}{1} and \ion{He}{1}. Later data, obtained between 260 and
380 days after maximum, reveal an emerging nebular spectrum. \textit{Spitzer}
spectra show weakening hydrogen recombination emission with the emergence of
[\ion{Ne}{2}] (12.81 $\mu$m) as the strongest line. Strong emission from
[\ion{Ne}{3}] (15.56 $\mu$m) is also detected. Photoionization models with low
effective temperature sources and only marginal neon enhancement (Ne $\sim$ 1.3
Ne$_{\odot}$) are consistent with these IR fine-structure neon lines indicating
that V1186 Sco did not occur on a ONeMg white dwarf. In contrast, the slow and
erratic light curve evolution, spectral development, and photoionization
analysis of the ejecta imply the outburst occurred on a low mass CO white
dwarf. We note that this is the first time strong [\ion{Ne}{2}] lines have been
detected so early in the outburst of a CO nova and suggests that the presence
of mid-infrared neon lines is not directly indicative of a ONeMg nova event.

low-mass pre--main-sequence and early-type stars as obtained from X-ray and NIR

active-sterile neutrino mixing in a medium in thermal equilibrium. The quantum
kinetic equations for the distribution functions and coherences are obtained
from two independent methods: the effective action and the quantum master
equation. The decoherence time scale for active-sterile oscillations is
$\tau_{dec} = 2/\Gamma_{aa}$, but the evolution of the distribution functions
is determined by the two different time scales associated with the damping
rates of the quasiparticle modes in the medium: $\Gamma_1=\Gamma_{aa}\cos^2\tm
; \Gamma_2=\Gamma_{aa}\sin^2\tm$ where $\Gamma_{aa}$ is the interaction rate of
the active species in absence of mixing and $\tm$ the mixing angle in the
medium. These two time scales are widely different away from MSW resonances and
preclude the kinetic description of active-sterile production in terms of a
simple rate equation. We give the complete set of quantum kinetic equations for
the active and sterile populations and coherences and discuss in detail the
various approximations. A generalization of the active-sterile transition
probability \emph{in a medium} is provided via the quantum master equation. We
derive explicitly the usual quantum kinetic equations in terms of the

However, this effect is only important for the strong MgII absorbers.
Regardless of the reasons for this discrepancy, this result confirms once more

power-law density distributions is a well-studied topic. However, in many
situations, such as a star formed at the edge of a molecular cloud core, an
offset power-law density distribution would be more appropriate. In this paper
a few of the main issues of the formation and expansion of HII regions in such
media are outlined and results are presented for the particular cases where the
underlying power laws are 1/r^2 and 1/r^3. A simple criterion is developed for
determining whether the initial photoionized region will be unbounded, which
depends on the power-law exponent and the ratio of the equivalent Stroemgren
radius produced by the star in a uniform medium to the stellar offset distance.
In the expansion stage, the ionized volumes will eventually become unbounded
unless pressure balance with the external medium is reached before the
ionization front velocity becomes supersonic with respect to the ionized gas.

less radioactive nickel, and hence it has been argued (without any real

the first ever radiation-hydrodynamics calculations of the light-curves

for light-curve decline rate, three SNe rise in 18.81 +- 0.36 days, while five
SNe rise in 16.64 +- 0.21 days. If all eight SNe are sampled from a single

comparing high-z to low-z SN luminosities for determining cosmological
parameters, bias can be introduced by use of a light-curve template with an
unrealistic rise time. If the period over which light curves are sampled
depends on z in a manner typical of current search and measurement strategies,
a two-day discrepancy in template rise time can bias the luminosity comparison
by ~0.03 magnitudes.

The integral varieties of such solutions, in four and five dimensional gravity,
depend on arbitrary generation and integration functions of one, two and/ or

select vacuum and/or Einstein metrics, to generalize such solutions for
nontrivial string (for instance, with antisymmetric torsion fields) and matter

Finsler and Lagrange geometry but re-defined for semi-Riemannian spaces) is
that new classes of exact solutions can be generated by nonholonomic
deformations depending on parameters associated to some generalized Geroch
transforms and Ricci flow evolution. In this paper, we apply the method to
construct in explicit form some classes of exact solutions for multi-parameter
Einstein spaces and their nonholonomic Ricci flows describing evolutions/

category} of geometric orbifolds. These interpolate between (compact K\"" ahler)
manifolds and such manifolds with logarithmic structure. These geometric
orbifolds are considered from the point of view of their geometry, and thus
equipped with the usual invariants of varieties: morphisms and bimeromorphic
maps, differential forms, fundamental groups and universal covers, fields of
definition and rational points. The most elementary properties, directly
adapted from the case of varieties without orbifold structure, are established
here. The arguments of [Ca01] can then be directly adapted to extend the main
structure results to this orbifold category. We hope to come back to deeper
aspects later. The motivation is that the natural frame for the theory of
classification of compact K\"" ahler (and complex projective) manifolds includes
at least the category of orbifolds, as shown in [Ca01] by the fonctorial
decomposition of {\it special} manifolds as tower of orbifolds with either
$\kappa_+=-\infty$ or $\kappa=0$, and also, seemingly, by the minimal model
program, in which most proofs work only after the adjunction of a ""boundary"".
  Also, fibrations enjoy in the bimeromorphic category of geometric orbifolds
extension properties not satisfied in the category of varieties without
orbifold structure, permitting to express invariants of the total space from
those of the generic fibre and of the base. For example, the natural sequence
of fundamental groups is exact there; also the total space is special if so are
the generic fibre and the base. This makes this category suitable to lift

forces is reported in this paper. This transmission is based on Slide-o-Cam, a
cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower.
The design of Slide-o-Cam, a transmission intended to produce a sliding motion
from a turning drive, or vice versa, was reported elsewhere. This transmission
provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions
and linear drives. The pressure angle is a relevant performance index for this
transmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the load
vs. that transmitted to the machine frame. To assess the transmission
capability of the mechanism, the Hertz formula is introduced to calculate the
stresses on the rollers and on the cams. The final transmission is intended to
replace the current ball-screws in the Orthoglide, a three-DOF parallel robot
for the production of translational motions, currently under development for
machining applications at Ecole Centrale de Nantes.

introduce the notion of `quantum numbers' of the defects and draw an analogy,
rather formal one, to developments which took place about 50 years ago and were
triggered by creation of the Sakata model.

moments are introduced. The expectation value of the quantum 4-force, which
holds in any frame, is worked out in terms of them. In contrast to it the whole
calculation in [1] ([1] J. Anandan, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{85}, 1354 (2000))

the expression for the 3D force $\mathbf{f}%_{S}$ in [1] is not
relativistically correct and that the quantum 4-force is not zero in the
experiments proposed in [1]. This means that the phase shifts that could be
observed in such experiments are not topological phase shifts.

equilibrium system in the continuum limit. Meanwhile, the equipartition theorem
allows one to make a connection between the ensemble average of the kinetic
energy and the uniform temperature. When a system or its environment is far
from equilibrium, however, such an association does not necessarily apply. In
small systems, the regression hypothesis may not even apply. Herein, we show
that in small nonequilibrium systems, the regression hypothesis still holds
though with a generalized definition of the temperature. The latter must now be
defined for each such manifestation.

into account a physical effect which has been overlooked and which could have
important consequences. We assume that the short length scale characterizing
the new physics is endowed with a finite width, the origin of which could be
found in quantum gravity. As a result, the leading corrections responsible for
superimposed osillations in the CMB temperature anisotropies are generically
damped by the blurring of the UV scale. To determine the observational
ramifications of this damping, we compare it to that which effectively occurs
when computing the angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropies. The
former gives an overall change of the oscillation amplitudes whereas the latter
depends on the angular scale. Therefore, in principle they could be
distinguished. In any case, the observation of superimposed oscillations would
place tight constraint on the variance of the UV cutoff.

intermediate-mass black holes in the cores of globular clusters. Based on
theoretical arguments and simulation results it has previously been suggested
that a large core radius -- or particularly a large ratio of the core radius to
half-mass radius -- is a promising indicator for finding such a black hole in a
star cluster. In this study N-body models of 100000 stars with and without
primordial binaries are used to investigate the long-term structural evolution
of star clusters. Importantly, the simulation data is analysed using the same
processes by which structural parameters are extracted from observed star
clusters. This gives a ratio of the core and half-mass (or half-light) radii
that is directly comparable to the Galactic globular cluster sample. As a
result, it is shown that the ratios observed for the bulk of this sample can be
explained without the need for an intermediate-mass black hole. Furthermore, it
is possible that clusters with large core to half-light radius ratios harbour a
black-hole binary (comprised of stellar mass black holes) rather than a single
massive black hole. This work does not rule out the existence of
intermediate-mass black holes in the cores of at least some star clusters.

quadrupole $1S$ excitons in cuprous oxide. This evanescent polariton has a long
life-time ($1.7 ns$), which is determined only by its excitonic component. The
polariton lower branch has a well pronounced minimum. This suggests that this
excitation can be utilized for BEC. The spatial coherence of the polariton can
be improved by assembling the micro-spheres in a linear chain.
