Mars. In the present work, we show from three dimensional calculations of sand
transport that the size and the shape of the minimal barchan dune depend on the
wind friction speed and the sand flux on the area between dunes in a field. Our
results explain the common appearance of barchans a few tens of centimeter high
which are observed along coasts. Furthermore, we find that the rate at which
grains enter saltation on Mars is one order of magnitude higher than on Earth,
and is relevant to correctly obtain the minimal dune size on Mars.

networks, it is demonstrated that game theory can be used as an effective tool
to study resource allocation in wireless networks with quality-of-service (QoS)
constraints. A family of non-cooperative (distributed) games is presented in
which each user seeks to choose a strategy that maximizes its own utility while
satisfying its QoS requirements. The utility function considered here measures
the number of reliable bits that are transmitted per joule of energy consumed
and, hence, is particulary suitable for energy-constrained networks. The
actions available to each user in trying to maximize its own utility are at
least the choice of the transmit power and, depending on the situation, the
user may also be able to choose its transmission rate, modulation, packet size,
multiuser receiver, multi-antenna processing algorithm, or carrier allocation
strategy. The best-response strategy and Nash equilibrium for each game is
presented. Using this game-theoretic framework, the effects of power control,
rate control, modulation, temporal and spatial signal processing, carrier
allocation strategy and delay QoS constraints on energy efficiency and network

[Phys. Rev. Lett. bf 97, 123902 (2006)]. They reported that when one has two
coupled systems A and C, with delay between them, then the introduction of a
third element B between A and C will allow them to synchronize even in regions
of the parameter space where this was not possible without the presence of B.
Here we study in detail the phenomenon and verify that in all the cases studied
(including the ones reported by Fisher et al.) this occurs due to the tendency
of A and B and B and C to be in antiphase synchronization and if A is in
antiphase with B and B is in antiphase with C, it will imply that A and C are
inphase. We show this in coupled quadratic maps, Kuramoto and R\""ossler

amplitude (linear effective bias parameter b_{eff} ~ 3x(0.85/sigma_8)), and
sufficiently high sampling density (~ 3x10^{-5} h^{3} Mpc^{-3}) the recovered

the maximum of the angular-diameter (observer-area) distance and the redshift

$\Omega_{\Lambda}$, the amount of vacuum energy in the universe, independently

there is a parallel vector field making curvature $-a^2$ with the geodesic
direction. We prove that $M$ has constant curvature equal to $-a^2$ if $M$ is

pinched as follows: $-\Lambda^2 < K < -\lambda^2$ where $\lambda/\Lambda >

the hyperbolic rank rigidity theorem of Hamenst\""{a}dt, subject to the pinching
condition in even dimension; in all other cases it is a new result. We also
present a rigidity result using only an assumption on maximal Lyapunov
exponents in direct analogy with work done by Connell. The proof of the main
theorem is simplified considerably by assuming strict negative curvature; in
fact, in all dimensions but 7 and 8 it is then an immediate consequence of
ergodicity of the $(dim(M)-1)$-frame flow. In these exceptional dimensions,
recourse to the dynamics of the 2-frame flow must be made and the scheme of

from the recently developed universal uncertainty principle for the

obtaining the precision limit to realizing the quantum NOT gate has eluded a
solution from these approaches. Here, we develop a new method for this problem
based on analyzing the trace distance between the output state from the

mathematical apparatus of orthogonal polynomials, we obtain a general lower
bound on the error probability for the realization of the quantum NOT gate in
terms of the number of qubits in the control system under the conservation of
the total angular momentum of the computational qubit plus the the control
system along the direction used to encode the computational basis. The lower
bound turns out to be more stringent than one might expect from previous
results. The new method is expected to lead to more accurate estimates for
physical realizations of various types of quantum computations under

of programmable quantum processors.

crossovers are derived for the electrical conductivity, which is a key probe of

disordered systems, we are able to incorporate the interplay between
fluctuating Cooper pairs and electrons, that is outside the scope of a
time-dependent Ginzburg Landau or effective bosonic action formalism. It is
essential to go beyond the standard approximation in order to capture the zero
temperature correction which results purely from the (dynamic) quantum
fluctuations and dictates the behavior of the conductivity in an entire low
temperature quantum regime. All dynamic contributions are of the same order and
conspire to add up to a negative total, thereby inhibiting the conductivity as
a result of superconducting fluctuations. On the contrary, the classical and
the intermediate regimes are dominated by the positive bosonic channel. Our
theory is applicable in one, two and three dimensions and is relevant for
experiments on superconducting nanowires, doubly-connected cylinders, thin
films and bulk in the presence of magnetic impurities, magnetic field or other
pair-breakers. A window of non-monotonic behavior is predicted to exist as

unpublished velocity dispersion measurements and emission-line fluxes. Measured
velocity dispersions are 130-340 km/s with a mean of 216 km/s. Converting to BH
mass, we find that the BH mass distribution is identical for FRIs and FRIIs,
with a mean of approximately 2.5x10^8 Msun. We convert [OII] and [OIII]
emission-line luminosities to photoionizing luminosity under the assumption
that the gas is ionized by the nuclear UV continuum. Most of the galaxies with
FRI morphology and/or low-excitation emission-line spectra have progressively
lower BH masses at lower photoionizing (and jet) luminosities. This agrees with
the Ledlow-Owen relation which states that the radio luminosity at the FRI/FRII
transition depends on the optical luminosity of the host, L_radio ~
L_optical^1.8, because both L_radio and L_optical relate to AGN nuclear
parameters. When recasting the Ledlow-Owen relation into BH mass versus
photoionizing and jet luminosity, we find that the recasted relation describes
the sample quite well. The FRI/FRII transition occurs at approximately an order
of magnitude lower luminosity relative to the Eddington luminosity than the
soft-to-hard transition in X-ray binaries. This difference is consistent with
the Ledlow-Owen relation, which predicts a weak BH mass dependence in the
transition luminosity. We conclude that the FRI/FRII dichotomy is caused by a
combination of external and nuclear factors, with the latter dominating.

types of broad line emitting AGN. The 4D Eigenvector 1 (4DE1) parameter space
shows promise as a unification capable of organizing quasar diversity on a
sequence primarily governed by Eddington ratio. This paper considers the role
of CIV 1549 measures with special emphasis on the CIV 1549 line shift as a
principal 4DE1 diagnostic. We use HST archival spectra for 130 sources with S/N
high enough to permit reliable CIV 1549 broad component (BC) measures. We find
a CIV 1549 BC profile blueshift that is strongly concentrated among (largely
radio-quiet: RQ) sources with FWHM(H beta BC) < 4000 km/s (which we call
Population A). Narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1, with FWHM H beta < 2000 km/s)
sources belong to this population but do not emerge as a distinct class. The
systematic blueshift, widely interpreted as arising in a disk wind/outflow, is
not observed in broader lined AGN which we call Population B. We find new
correlations between FWHM(CIV 1549 BC) and CIV 1549 line shift as well as the
equivalent width of CIV 1549. They are seen only in Pop. A sources. CIV 1549
measures enhance the apparent dichotomy at FWHM(Hbeta BC) approx. 4000 \kms\
(Sulentic et al. 2000) suggesting that it has more significance in the context
of Broad Line Region structure than the more commonly discussed RL vs. RQ
dichotomy. Black hole masses computed from FWHM CIV 1549 BC for about 80 AGN
indicate that the CIV 1549 width is a poor virial estimator. Comparison of mass
estimates derived from Hbeta BC and CIV 1549 reveals that the latter show
different and nonlinear offsets for population A and B sources. A significant
number of sources also show narrow line CIV 1549 emission. We present a recipe
for CIV 1549 narrow component extraction.

that follow from the combined colour, Dirac and isospin Fierz transformations.
These relations reduce the number of independent baryon operators with any
given spin and isospin. The Fierz identities also effectively restrict allowed
baryon chiral multiplets. It turns out that the chiral multiplets of the
baryons are equivalent to their Lorentz representation. For the two independent
nucleon operators the only permissible chiral multiplet is the fundamental one
$(\frac12,0)\oplus(0,\frac12)$. For the $\Delta$, admissible Lorentz
representations are $(1,\frac12)\oplus (\frac12,1)$ and
$(\frac32,0)\oplus(0,\frac32)$. In the case of the $(1,\frac12)\oplus
(\frac12,1)$ chiral multiplet the $I(J)=\frac32(\frac32)$ $\Delta$ field has
one $I(J)=\frac12(\frac32)$ chiral partner; otherwise it has none. We also
consider the Abelian ($U_A(1)$) chiral transformation properties of fields and
show that each baryon comes in two varieties: 1) with Abelian axial charge +3;
and 2) with Abelian axial charge -1. In case of the nucleon these are the two
Ioffe's fields; in case of the $\Delta$, the $(1,\frac12)\oplus (\frac12,1)$

rise to the electrical current, may be the dominant effect causing the
evolution of the magnetic field in the solid crust of neutron stars. It is a
nonlinear process that, despite a number of efforts, is still not fully
understood. We use the Hall induction equation in axial symmetry to obtain some
general properties of nonevolving fields, as well as analyzing the evolution of
purely toroidal fields, their poloidal perturbations, and current-free, purely
poloidal fields. We also analyze energy conservation in Hall instabilities and
write down a variational principle for Hall equilibria. We show that the
evolution of any toroidal magnetic field can be described by Burgers' equation,
as previously found in plane-parallel geometry. It leads to sharp current
sheets that dissipate on the Hall time scale, yielding a stationary field
configuration that depends on a single, suitably defined coordinate. This
field, however, is unstable to poloidal perturbations, which grow as their
field lines are stretched by the background electron flow, as in instabilities
earlier found numerically. On the other hand, current-free poloidal
configurations are stable and could represent a long-lived crustal field
supported by currents in the fluid stellar core.

a lower bound on the exponential decay rate of the false-negative probability

Finally, these results are extended to the case of memoryless attacks and

branches of solutions -- the conventional and self-accelerated one. The
conventional branch gives a perturbatively stable model of a metastable
graviton, with potentially testable predictions within the Solar system. The
self-accelerated branch, on the other hand, provides an existence proof for an
idea that the accelerated expansion of the Universe could be due to modified
gravity. The issue of perturbative stability of the self-accelerated branch is
obscured by a breakdown of the conventional perturbative expansion. However, a
certain exact non-perturbative solution found in hep-th/0612016 exhibits a net
negative gravitational mass, while this mass is positive on the conventional
branch. This suggest that the self-accelerated solution must be
non-perturbatively unstable. A proposal to overcome this problem in an

to be unrestricted, is briefly discussed.

with multi-site exchanges. Main topic of our manuscript are critical phenomena
in spin systems defined on the recurrence lattices. Main tool of our approach
is the method of recursive (hierarchical) lattices. We apply the method of
dynamical mapping (or recursive lattices) for investigation of magnetic
properties of the fluid and solid $^3$He, phase transitions in crystals and
macromolecules. First, we analyze the helix-coil phase transition for
polypeptides and proteins, and describe an quasi unfolding transition (like the
cold denaturation process) for the degree of helicity (the order parameter for
macromolecules). Next we consider the recurrent models of $^3$He defined on the
square, Husimi and hexagon lattices. Using the method of dynamical mapping, the
magnetization curves with plateaus, bifurcation point and one period doubling
are obtained. Then we investigate the model with cubic symmetry defined on the
Bethe lattice and containing both linear and quadratic spin-spin interactions.
The magnetization of the system is calculated, and a complex structure of the
phase transitions between the disordered, partially ordered and completely
ordered states is observed. In the framework of QCD, we consider the azimuthal
asymmetries in heavy flavor production in the lepton-nucleon deep inelastic
scattering (DIS). We calculate the azimuthal (or $\phi$-) dependence of the
next-to-leading order heavy-quark-initiated contributions to DIS. It is shown
that, contrary to the basic gluon-initiated component, the photon-quark
scattering mechanism is practically $\cos2\phi$-independent. We investigate the
possibility of measuring both nonperturbative (intrinsic) and perturbative
(CTEQ, MRST) charm distributions using the $\cos2\phi$ asymmetry.

more accurately measure the desired system parameters. One such method is the

theory (DMFT). We investigate the magnetic and phonon features associated with
polaron formation as a function of the exchange coupling $J$, of the
electron-phonon interaction $\lambda$ and of the temperature. Our solution
directly relates the features of the optical conductivity to the excitations in
the single-particle spectral function, revealing two distinct mechanisms of
closing and filling of the optical pseudogap that take place upon varying the
microscopic parameters. We show that the optical absorption at the polaron
crossover is characterized by a coexistence of a magnon peak at low frequency
and a broad polaronic band at higher frequency. An analytical expression for
$\sigma(\omega)$ valid in the polaronic regime is presented.

Furthermore, we study d/I/d junctions when the dSC leads include subdominant

strongly diminish the critical current for 110 oriented junctions whereas no
suppression is obtained for the 100 orientation. This may help resolve a

representation of the Newtonian potential by Brownian motion is explained in an
elementary way. We conclude with the description of recent progress seen in the

conformal invariance and multifractality, associated with the potential theory
of the Brownian curve itself.

statistics is the generalization of the univariate rank method to multivariate
data. Halfspace depth is a measure of data depth. Given a set S of points and a
point p, the halfspace depth (or rank) k of p is defined as the minimum number
of points of S contained in any closed halfspace with p on its boundary.
Computing halfspace depth is NP-hard, and it is equivalent to the Maximum
Feasible Subsystem problem. In this thesis a mixed integer program is
formulated with the big-M method for the halfspace depth problem. We suggest a
branch and cut algorithm. In this algorithm, Chinneck's heuristic algorithm is
used to find an upper bound and a related technique based on sensitivity
analysis is used for branching. Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) hitting
set cuts are applied. We also suggest a binary search algorithm which may be
more stable numerically. The algorithms are implemented with the BCP framework
from the COIN-OR project.

  chains: classical counterpart of macroscopic tunneling quantum dynamics","33 pages, 16 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.77.046603",,"nlin.PS",,"  We present analytical and numerical studies of phase-coherent dynamics of
intrinsically localized excitations (breathers) in a system of two weakly
coupled nonlinear oscillator chains. We show that there are two qualitatively
different dynamical regimes of the coupled breathers, either immovable or
slowly-moving: the periodic transverse translation (wandering) of low-amplitude
breather between the chains, and the one-chain-localization of high-amplitude
breather. These two modes of coupled nonlinear excitations, which involve large
number of anharmonic oscillators, can be mapped onto two solutions of a single
pendulum equation, detached by a separatrix mode. We also study two-chain
breathers, which can be considered as bound states of discrete breathers with
different symmetry and center locations in the coupled chains, and bifurcation
of the anti-phase two-chain breather into the one-chain one. Delocalizing
transition of 1D breather in 2D system of a large number of parallel coupled
nonlinear chains is described, in which the breather, initially excited in a
given chain, abruptly spreads its vibration energy in the whole 2D system upon
decreasing breather frequency or amplitude below the threshold one. The
threshold breather frequency is above the cut off phonon frequency in 2D
system, and the threshold breather amplitude scales as square root of the
inter-chain coupling constant. Delocalizing transition of discrete vibrational
breather in 2D and 3D systems of coupled nonlinear chains has an analogy with
delocalizing transition for Bose-Einstein condensates in 2D and 3D optical
lattices.

Yang-Mills theories with all different N in a unified way. D-particle field
operators, creating and annihilating a D particle and hence changing N one by
one, are defined. The base space of these D-particle fields is a (complex)
vector space of infinite dimensions. The gauge invariance of Yang-Mills quantum
mechanics is reinterpreted as a quantum-statistical symmetry, which is taken
into account by setting up a novel algebraic and projective structure in the
formalism. Ordinary physical observables of Yang-Mills theory, obeying the
standard algebra, are expressed as bilinear forms of the D-particle fields.
Together with the open-closed string duality, our new formulation suggests a
trinity of three different but mutually dual viewpoints in string theory.

of the film leads to conductance of the STO substrate, and asymmetric and
non-linear current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. However, a brief oxygen
plasma etch allows full recovery of the insulating character of the substrate.
The I-V characteristics of the bridges are then fully linear over a large range
of current densities. We find colossal magnetoresistance properties typical for
strained LCMO on STO but no signature of non-linear effects (so-called
electroresistance) connected to electronic inhomogeneites. In the metallic
state below 150 K, the highest current densities lead to heating effects and
non-linear I-V characteristics.

reduces kappa_{e-mu} and makes it temperature independent. Proton
superconductivity suppresses the reduction and restores the Fermi-liquid

regular and irregular lattices of nodes characterized by different recovery

Nested Pad\'e approximants and Partial Differential approximants were used in
the case of expansions with respect to two variables (two recovery rates) for
the evaluation of the critical values and critical exponents. The critical
exponents in heterogeneous systems are very close to those for the homogeneous

diagnostic window for exploring the thermal and magnetic structure of the quiet

collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms on the scattering polarization signals
of the 13 lines of multiplet 42 of Ti I and on those of the K line and of the
IR triplet of Ca II, with emphasis on the collisional transfer rates between
nearby J-levels. To this end, we calculate the linear polarization produced by
scattering processes considering realistic multilevel models and solving the
statistical equilibrium equations for the multipolar components of the atomic
density matrix. We confirm that the lower levels of the 13 lines of multiplet
42 of Ti I are completely depolarized by elastic collisions. We find that
upper-level collisional depolarization turns out to have an unnoticeable impact
on the emergent linear polarization amplitudes, except for the ${\lambda 4536$
line for which it is possible to notice a rather small depolarization caused by
the collisional transfer rates. Concerning the Ca II lines, we show that the
collisional rates play no role on the polarization of the upper level of the K

polarization of the metastable lower levels of the Ca II IR triplet.
