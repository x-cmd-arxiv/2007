the same functional dependence on two Casimir invariants $[E^a(t)E^a(t)]$ and

garnered with the ordinary formulation of physics. Two-Time Physics has shown
that the Standard Model of Particles and Forces is successfully reproduced by a
two-time field theory in 4 space and 2 time dimensions projected as a
holographic image on an emergent spacetime in 3+1 dimensions. Among the
successes of this approach is the resolution of the strong CP problem of QCD as
an outcome of the restrictions imposed by the higher symmetry structures in 4+2
dimensions. In this paper we launch a program to construct the duals of the
Standard Model as other holographic images of the same 4+2 dimensional theory
on a variety of emergent spacetimes in 3+1 dimensions. These dual field
theories are obtained as a family of gauge choices in the master 4+2 field
theory. In the present paper we deal with some of the simpler gauge choices
which lead to interacting Klein-Gordon field theories for the conformal scalar
with a predicted SO(d,2) symmetry in a variety of interesting curved spacetimes
in (d-1)+1 dimensions. More challenging and more interesting gauge choices
(including some that relate to mass) which are left to future work are also
outlined. Through this approach we discover a new realm of previously
unexplored dualities and hidden symmetries that exist both in the macroscopic
and microscopic worlds, at the classical and quantum levels. Such phenomena
predicted by 2T-physics can in principle be confirmed both by theory and
experiment. 1T-physics can be used to analyze the predictions but in most
instances gives no clue that the predicted phenomena exist in the first place.
This point of view suggests a new paradigm for the construction of a
fundamental theory that is likely to impact on the quest for unification.

slit experiment, is based on a natural but implicit assumption about the
position of a particle {\it before} a position measurement is performed on it.
This assumption cannot be deduced from the standard postulates of quantum
mechanics. In the present paper this assumption is made explicit and formally
postulated as a new rule, the {\it quantum typicality rule}. This rule
correlates the positions of the particles at two different times, thus defining
their trajectories. Unexpectedly, this rule is also equivalent to the Born rule
with regard to the explanation of the results of statistical experiments. For
this reason it can be considered a generalization of the Born rule. The
existence of the quantum typicality rule strongly suggests the possibility of a
new trajectory-based formulation of quantum mechanics. According to this new
formulation, a closed quantum system is represented as a {\it quantum process},
which corresponds to a canonical stochastic process in which the probability
measure is replaced by the wave function and the usual frequentist
interpretation of probability is replaced by the quantum typicality rule.

confirm the theoretical predictions that supernova remnants can operate as
powerful cosmic ray accelerators. If these objects are responsible for the bulk
of galactic cosmic rays, then they should accelerate protons and nuclei to
10^15 eV and beyond, i.e. act as cosmic PeVatrons. The model of diffusive shock
acceleration allows, under certain conditions, acceleration of particles to
such high energies and their gradual injection into the interstellar medium,
mainly during the Sedov phase of the remnant evolution. The most energetic
particles are released first, while particles of lower energies are more
effectively confined in the shell, and are released at later epochs. Thus the
spectrum of nonthermal paticles inside the shell extends to PeV energies only
during a relatively short period of the evolution of the remnant. For this
reason one may expect spectra of secondary gamma-rays and neutrinos extending
to energies beyond 10 TeV only from T \lesssim 1000 yr old supernova remnants.
On the other hand, if by a chance a massive gas cloud appears in the \lesssim
100 pc vicinity of the supernova remnant, ``delayed'' multi-TeV signals of
gamma-rays and neutrinos arise when the most energetic partices emerged from
the supernova shell reach the cloud. The detection of such delayed emission of

galactic scale. Such vortices can occur as a result of global rotation of the
early universe. We study analytical models of vortices and calculate exemplary
galaxy rotation curves. Depending on the setup it is possible to obtain a
variety of shapes which give a good qualitative agreement with observational
results. However, as we show, the extremely low velocity dispersions of the
axions velocity are required to form the single vortex on the galactic scales.
We find that the required velocity dispersion is of the order of $\sigma
\approx 10^{-12} \frac{m}{s}$. This is much smaller that predicted within the
present understanding of the axion physics. The vortices in axion condensate
can be however formed on the much smaller scales and give seeds to the galaxy
formation and to their angular momenta. On the other hand, the vortices can be
formed on the galactic scales, but only if the mass of the axion-like particles
is of the order of $10^{-30}$eV. In this case, the particle de Broglie
wavelength is comparable with the galactic diameter. This condition must be
fulfilled in order to keep the coherence of the quantum condensate on the
galactic scales.

Balmer break (Dn4000) to separate the galaxy population and the EW[OII]3727
line as proxy for the star formation activity. We discuss to what extent
stellar mass drives galaxy evolution, showing for the first time the interplay
between stellar ages and stellar masses over the past 8Gyr. Low-mass galaxies
have small Dn4000 and at increasing stellar mass, the galaxy distribution moves
to higher Dn4000 values as observed in the local Universe. As cosmic time goes
by, we witness an increasing abundance of massive spectroscopically ET systems
at the expense of the LT systems. This spectral transformation is a process
started at early epochs and continuing efficiently down to the local Universe.
This is confirmed by the evolution of our type-dependent stellar mass function.
The underlying stellar ages of LT galaxies apparently do not show evolution,
likely as a result of a continuous formation of new stars. All star formation
activity indicators consistently point towards a star formation history peaked
in the past for massive galaxies, with little or no residual star formation
taking place in the most recent epochs. The activity and efficiency of forming
stars are mechanisms that depend on stellar mass, and the mass assembly becomes
progressively less efficient in massive systems as time elapses. The concepts
of star formation downsizing and mass assembly downsizing describe a single
scenario that has a top-down evolutionary pattern. The role of (dry) merging
events seems to be only marginal at z<1.3, as our estimated efficiency in
stellar mass assembly can possibly account for the progressive accumulation of
passively evolving galaxies.

adequate sensing. The basic idea under the proposed scheme is based on the
notion of spectrum pooling. The idea is quite simple: a cognitive radio will
listen to the channel and, if sensed idle, will transmit during the voids. It
turns out that, although its simplicity, the proposed scheme showed very
interesting features with respect to the spectral efficiency and the maximum
number of possible pairwise cognitive communications. We impose the constraint
that users successively transmit over available bands through selfish water
filling. For the first time, our study has quantified the asymptotic (with
respect to the band) achievable gain of using spectrum pooling in terms of
spectral efficiency compared to classical radio systems. We then derive the

formulae to describe the non-resonant part of the two-photon emission profiles.
Combining these with the analytic form of the cascade-term yields a simple and
accurate description of the full two-photon decay spectrum, which only involves
a sum over a few intermediate states. We demonstrate that the cascade term
naturally leads to a nearly Lorentzian shape of the two-photon profiles in the
vicinity of the resonances. However, due to quantum-electrodynamical
corrections, the two-photon emission spectra deviate significantly from the
Lorentzian shape in the very distant wings of the resonances. We investigate up
to which distance the two-photon profiles are close to a Lorentzian and discuss
the role of the interference term. We then analyze how the deviation of the
two-photon profiles from the Lorentzian shape affects the dynamics of
cosmological hydrogen recombination. Since in this context the escape of
photons from the Lyman-alpha resonance plays a crucial role, we concentrate on
the two-photon corrections in the vicinity of the Lyman-alpha line. Our
computations show that the changes in the ionization history due to the
additional two-photon process from high shell (n>2) likely do not reach the
percent-level. For conservative assumptions we find a correction DN_e/N_e~-0.4%

study; however, the physics leading to this conclusion is rather different. In
particular, our calculations of the effective two-photon decay rates yield

theoretical models of Type II migration and protoplanetary disk physics. We
describe a theoretical model for the expected radial distribution of extrasolar
planets that combines an analytic description of migration with an empirically
calibrated disk model. The disk model includes viscous evolution and mass loss
via photoevaporation. Comparing the predicted distribution to a uniformly
selected subsample of planets from the Lick / Keck / AAT planet search
programs, we find that a simple model in which planets form in the outer disk
at a uniform rate, migrate inward according to a standard Type II prescription,
and become stranded when the gas disk is dispersed, is consistent with the
radial distribution of planets for orbital radii 0.1 AU < a < 2.5 AU and planet
masses greater than 1.65 Jupiter masses. Some variant models are disfavored by
existing data, but the significance is limited (~95%) due to the small sample
of planets suitable for statistical analysis. We show that the favored model
predicts that the planetary mass function should be almost independent of
orbital radius at distances where migration dominates the massive planet
population. We also study how the radial distribution of planets depends upon
the adopted disk model. We find that the distribution can constrain not only
changes in the power-law index of the disk viscosity, but also sharp jumps in
the efficiency of angular momentum transport that might occur at small radii.

this work we show that some of the new observables also have smaller systematic
uncertainties than the helicity fractions, with a dependence on anomalous
couplings similar or stronger than for helicity fractions. Consequently, their
measurement can significantly improve the limits on anomalous couplings.
Moreover, the most sensitive measurements can be combined. In this case, the

time at z = 20 to a final mass-weighted mean shock radius of 2.5 kpc (proper),
roughly half the size of the HII region, and in this process sweeps up a total
gas mass of 2.5*10^5 M_sun. The morphology of the shock becomes highly
anisotropic once it leaves the host halo and encounters filaments and
neighboring minihalos, while the bulk of the shock propagates into the voids of
the intergalactic medium. The SN entirely disrupts the host halo and terminates
further star formation for at least 200 Myr, while in our specific case it
exerts positive mechanical feedback on neighboring minihalos by
shock-compressing their cores. In contrast, we do not observe secondary star
formation in the dense shell via gravitational fragmentation, due to the
previous photoheating by the progenitor star. We find that cooling by metal
lines is unimportant for the entire evolution of the SN remnant, while the
metal-enriched, interior bubble expands adiabatically into the cavities created
by the shock, and ultimately into the voids with a maximum extent similar to
the final mass-weighted mean shock radius. Finally, we conclude that dark

equatorial disk through a rotating surface explosion. Material is launched
normal to the surface of an oblate rotating star with an initial kick velocity
that scales approximately with the local escape speed. Thereafter, ejecta
follow ballistic orbital trajectories, feeling only a central force
corresponding to a radiatively reduced gravity. Our model is conceptually
similar to the wind-compressed disk model of Bjorkman & Cassinelli, but we
modify it to an explosion instead of a steady line-driven wind, we include a
rotationally-distorted star, and we treat the dynamics somewhat differently.
Continuum-driving avoids the disk inhibition that normally operates in
line-driven winds. Our model provides a simple method by which rotating hot
stars can simultaneously produce intrinsically bipolar and equatorial mass
ejections, without an aspherical environment or magnetic fields. Although
motivated by eta Carinae, the model may have generic application to other LBVs,
B[e] stars, or SN1987A's nebula. When near-Eddington radiative driving is less
influential, our model generalizes to produce bipolar morphologies without

the periphery of Carina provides a strong case that star formation here was
indeed triggered by stellar winds and UV radiation. This second generation
appears to involve a cascade toward preferentially intermediate- and low-mass
stars, but this may soon change when eta Car and its siblings explode. If the
current reservoir of atomic and molecular gas can be tapped at that time,
massive star formation may be rejuvinated around the periphery of Carina much
as if it were a young version of Gould's Belt. Also, when these multiple SNe
occur, the triggered second generation will be pelted repeatedly with SN ejecta
bearing short-lived radioactive nuclides. Carina may therefore represent the

degeneracy between planet formation models when only systems with single stars
are studied--several mechanisms appear to be able to produce such a final
result. This degeneracy is lifted by searching for planets in binary systems;
the resulting detections (or evidence of non-existence) of planets in binaries
isolates which models may contribute to how planets form in nature. In this
chapter, we consider observational efforts to detect planetary companions to
binary stars in two types of hierarchical planet-binary configurations: first
``S-type'' planets which orbit just one of the stars, with the binary period
being much longer than the planet's; second, ``P-type'' or circumbinary
planets, where the planet simultaneously orbits both stars, and the planetary
orbital period is much longer than that of the binary. The S-type planet
finding techniques are different for binaries that can or cannot be spatially
resolved. For wider systems, techniques reviewed include dualstar
interferometric differential astrometry and precision radial velocities.
Alternatively, unresolved binaries can be studied using modified dualstar
""PHASES-style"" differential astrometry or a modification of the radial velocity
technique for composite spectra. Should a fortunately aligned--but still long
period--binary be found, eclipse timing can also reveal the presence of S-type
planets. Methods for detecting P-type planets include the composite-spectra
variant of the radial velocity technique and eclipse timing.

the determination of the statistical correlations between detector neighbor
pixels. The correlations are determined by means of noise variance measurement
for a isolated pixels and the difference between neighbor pixels. The method is
validated using images from the two different GE Senographe 2000D mammographic
units. The pixelized detector has been irradiated using x-rays along its entire
surface. It is shown that the pixel simultaneous detection probabilities can be
estimated within accuracy 0.001 - 0.003, where the systematic error is
estimated to be smaller than 0.005. The presampled two-dimensional point-spread
function (PSF0) is determined using a single Gaussian and a sum of two Gaussian
approximations. The obtained results for the presampled PSF0 show that the
single Gaussian approximation is not appropriate, and the sum of two Gaussian
approximations providing the best fit predicts the existence of a large (~50%)
narrow component. Another proof of this fact is the latest simulation study of
columnar indirect digital detectors by A. Badano et al. The sampled
two-dimensional PSF is determined using Monte Carlo simulation for the L-shape
uniform distributed acceptance function for different values of fill factors.
The detector spatial resolution is estimated using sampled PSF and has values
54 and 58 mkm for two different units. The calculation of the presampled
modulation transfer function based on the PSF0 estimation shows that the
existing data can only be reproduced using a single Gaussian approximation and
the usage of the sum of two Gaussian show significantly larger values in the
higher frequency region for both units.

The decay rates for the $f_0(980)K^{*-}$ and $f_0(980)\ov K^{*0}$ modes depend
on the $f_0-\sigma$ mixing angle $\theta$. The experimental measurements can be
accommodated for $\theta\approx 20^\circ$. (ii) If the $a_0(980)$ is a $q\bar
q$ bound state, the predicted branching ratios for the channels $a_0^+\rho^-$
and $a_0^0\rho^-$ will be very large, of order $30\times 10^{-6}$ and $23\times
10^{-6}$, respectively. If the observation of or the experimental limit on
theses two modes is much smaller than the expectation of $\sim 25\times
10^{-6}$, this could hint at a four-quark nature for the $a_0(980)$. (iii) For
the $a_0(1450)$ channels, $a_0^+(1450)\rho^-$ and $a_0^0(1450)\rho^-$ are found
to have branching ratios of order $16\times 10^{-6}$ and $22\times 10^{-6}$,
respectively. A measurement of them at the predicted level will favor the
$q\bar q$ structure for the $a_0(1450)$. (iv) Contrary to the naive expectation
that $\Gamma(B^-\to a_0^0\rho^-)\sim {1\over 2}\Gamma(\bar B^0\to
a_0^+\rho^-)$, we found that they have comparable rates due to additional
contributions to the $a_0\rho^-$ mode from the $a_0^0$ emission. (v) The
predicted central value of $Br(\bar B^0\to\ov K^{*0}_0(1430)\phi)$ is larger
than experiment, though it can be accommodated within theoretical errors. The
decays $B\to K^{*}_0(1430)\rho$ are expected to have rates substantially larger
than that of $B\to K^{*}_0(1430)\pi$ owing to the constructive (destructive)
interference between the $a_4$ and $a_6$ penguin terms in the former (latter).
Experimentally, it is thus important to check if the $B\to K^{*}_0\rho$ modes
are enhanced relative to the corresponding $K_0^*\pi$ channels.

a statistically isotropic scalar signal from noise-contaminated data on a
region of the unit sphere. Three different methods of spectral estimation are
considered: (i) the spherical analogue of the one-dimensional (1-D)
periodogram, (ii) the maximum likelihood method, and (iii) a spherical analogue
of the 1-D multitaper method. The periodogram exhibits strong spectral leakage,
especially for small regions of area $A\ll 4\pi$, and is generally unsuitable
for spherical spectral analysis applications, just as it is in 1-D. The maximum
likelihood method is particularly useful in the case of nearly-whole-sphere
coverage, $A\approx 4\pi$, and has been widely used in cosmology to estimate
the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation from spacecraft
observations. The spherical multitaper method affords easy control over the
fundamental trade-off between spectral resolution and variance, and is easily
implemented regardless of the region size, requiring neither non-linear
iteration nor large-scale matrix inversion. As a result, the method is ideally
suited for most applications in geophysics, geodesy or planetary science, where
the objective is to obtain a spatially localized estimate of the spectrum of a
signal from noisy data within a pre-selected and typically small region.

delay-limited Gaussian source over a slowly fading channel. The source is coded
in superimposed layers, with each layer successively refining the description
in the previous one. The receiver decodes the layers that are supported by the
channel realization and reconstructs the source up to a distortion. The
expected distortion is minimized by optimally allocating the transmit power
among the source layers. For two source layers, the allocation is optimal when
power is first assigned to the higher layer up to a power ceiling that depends
only on the channel fading distribution; all remaining power, if any, is
allocated to the lower layer. For convex distortion cost functions with convex
constraints, the minimization is formulated as a convex optimization problem.
In the limit of a continuum of infinite layers, the minimum expected distortion
is given by the solution to a set of linear differential equations in terms of
the density of the fading distribution. As the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses
per source symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes
expected distortion converges to the one that maximizes expected capacity.
While expected distortion can be improved by acquiring CSI at the transmitter
(CSIT) or by increasing diversity from the realization of independent fading
paths, at high SNR the performance benefit from diversity exceeds that from
CSIT, especially when b is large.

structure and metallicities. We examine a potential cause for these dispersions
in the context of the conventional sequential accretion formation scenario. In
principle, gas accretion onto cores with masses below several times that of the
Earth is suppressed by the energy released from the bombardment of residual
planetesimals. We show that these planetesimals generally cannot pass through
the mean motion resonances of the cores, and the suppression of planetesimal
bombardment rate enables the cores to accrete gas with little interruption.
During growth from the cores to protoplanets, as the resonances overlap with
each other, the trapped planetesimals become dynamically unstable and their
eccentricity excitation is strongly enhanced. Subsequent gas drag induces the
planetesimals to migrate and collide with the protoplanet. This process leads
to the resumption and a surge of planetesimal bombardment during the advanced
stage of the protoplanet growth. This mechanism may account for the diversity
of the core-envelope structure between Jupiter, Saturn and the metallicity
dispersion inferred from the transiting extra solar planets.

orderings of the faces of any shellable regular CW-complex (called
`shelling-type orderings') that can be used to explicitly construct maximum
acyclic matchings of the poset of cells of the given complex. Building on an
application of this method to the classical zonotope shellings we describe a
class of maximum acyclic matchings for the Salvetti complex of a linear
complexified arrangement. To do this, we introduce and study a new
combinatorial stratification of the Salvetti complex. For the obtained acyclic
matchings we give an explicit description of the critical cells that depends
only on the chosen linear extension of the poset of regions. It is always
possible to choose the linear extension so that the critical cells can be
explicitly constructed from the chambers of the arrangement via the bijection
to no-broken-circuit sets defined by Jewell and Orlik. Our method can be
generalized to arbitraty oriented matroids.

fluctuation theorems for the entropy ds, which is locally produced in this

<exp(-ds)>=1, is a generalization of the second law of thermodynamics, that
remains valid at relativistic particle energies and under high cosmic expansion
rates. From this relation follows, that the probability to observe a local
reduction of entropy is exponentially small even if the universe was to
recollapse. For the special case of the Einstein-de Sitter universe an
additional relation, <exp(-ds-dh)>=1, is derived which holds simultaneously
with the first relation and where dh is proportional to the Hubble constant.
Furthermore, the fluctuation theorems are shown to provide a physical criterion

particles in two dimensions, when confined laterally by a pair of parallel hard
walls within a quasi one dimensional channel, possesses several anomalous
structural and mechanical properties not observed in the bulk. Depending on the
density $\rho$ and the distance between the walls $L_y$, the system shows
structural characteristics analogous to a weakly modulated liquid, a strongly
modulated smectic, a triangular solid or a buckled phase. At fixed $\rho$, a
change in $L_y$ leads to many reentrant discontinuous transitions involving
changes in the number of layers parallel to the confining walls depending
crucially on the commensurability of inter-layer spacing with $L_y$. The solid
shows resistance to elongation but not to shear. When strained beyond the
elastic limit it fails undergoing plastic deformation but surprisingly, as the
strain is reversed, the material recovers completely and returns to its
original undeformed state. We obtain the phase diagram from mean field theory
and finite size simulations and discuss the effect of fluctuations.

  the sine-Gordon equation","49 pages, 10 figures",,,,"nlin.SI nlin.PS",,"  The use of the sine-Gordon equation as a model of magnetic flux propagation
in Josephson junctions motivates studying the initial-value problem for this
equation in the semiclassical limit in which the dispersion parameter $\e$
tends to zero. Assuming natural initial data having the profile of a moving
$-2\pi$ kink at time zero, we analytically calculate the scattering data of
this completely integrable Cauchy problem for all $\e>0$ sufficiently small,
and further we invert the scattering transform to calculate the solution for a
sequence of arbitrarily small $\e$. This sequence of exact solutions is
analogous to that of the well-known $N$-soliton (or higher-order soliton)
solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. Plots of exact
solutions for small $\e$ reveal certain features that emerge in the
semiclassical limit. For example, in the limit $\epsilon\to 0$ one observes the
appearance of nonlinear caustics. In the appendices we give a self contained
account of the Cauchy problem from the perspectives of both inverse scattering
and classical analysis (Picard iteration). Specifically, Appendix A contains a
complete formulation of the inverse-scattering method for generic $L^1$-Sobolev
initial data, and Appendix B establishes the well-posedness for $L^p$-Sobolev
initial data (which in particular completely justifies the inverse-scattering
analysis in Appendix A).

is likely to affect planet formation and evolution, the precise effects and
their actual impact on planet occurrence and properties are still debated. In

discrimination against close binaries in Doppler planet searches. To bring
observational constraints on the occurrence and properties of planets in
binaries and multiple stars, we have been conducting two dedicated observing
programs using both adaptive optics imaging and radial-velocity monitoring. In
this chapter we explain our approach and present preliminary results from these
two programs. A simplified statistical analysis of the data from our VLT/NACO
imaging survey brings the first observational evidence that the occurrence of
planets is reduced in binaries closer than ~120 AU. On the radial-velocity
side, current results confirm that the use of two-dimensional correlation
allows to search for circumprimary giant planets in many types of spectroscopic
binaries. Definitive results from our ongoing planet search in spectroscopic
binaries should yield important constraints on the closest binaries susceptible

instability as well as by core accretion. Complete consensus has not been
reached yet on whether the formation of giant planets is promoted or suppressed
by tidal interactions with a companion star. While systems with binary
separations of order 100 AU or larger appear to behave more or less as in
isolation, systems with smaller separations exhibit an increased or decreased
susceptibility to fragmentation, depending on the details of thermodynamics, in
particular on the inclusion or absence of artificial viscosity, and on the
initial conditions. While code comparisons on identical problems need to be
carried out (some of which are already in progress) to decide which computer
models are more realistic, it is already clear that relatively close binary
systems, with separations of order 60 AU or less, should provide strong
constraints on how giant planets form in these systems.

encompasses the ""secant criterion"" for cyclic networks presented in our

law of T_l with a second (co)monad T_r on M, a natural transformation i:\Pi T_l
\to \Pi T_r, and a morphism w: T_r X \to T_l X in M. The relations i and w need
to satisfy are categorical versions of Kaygun's axioms of a transposition map.
Motivation comes from the observation that a (co)ring T over an algebra R
determines a distributive law of two (co)monads T_l=T \otimes_R (-) and T_r =
(-)\otimes_R T on the category of R-bimodules. The functor \Pi can be chosen

(-) \to (-) \hat{\otimes}_R T is given by the flip map and a morphism w: X
\otimes_R T \to T\otimes_R X is constructed whenever T is a (co)module algebra
or coring of an R-bialgebroid. Stable anti Yetter-Drinfel'd modules over
certain bialgebroids, so called x_R-Hopf algebras, are introduced. In the
particular example when T is a module coring of a x_R-Hopf algebra B and X is a
stable anti Yetter-Drinfel'd B-module, the para-cyclic object Z_* is shown to
project to a cyclic structure on T^{\otimes_R *+1} \otimes_B X. For a B-Galois
extension S \to T, a stable anti Yetter-Drinfel'd B-module T_S is constructed,
such that the cyclic objects B^{\otimes_R *+1} \otimes_B T_S and T^
{\hat{\otimes}_S *+1} are isomorphic. As an application, we compute Hochschild
and cyclic homology of a groupoid with coefficients, by tracing it back to the

particular, initial low P states with high coordination numbers lose many

simulated isotropic packings of spherical beads assembled by different
procedures and subjected to a varying confining pressure P are investigated. In
addition P, which determines the stiffness of contacts by Hertz's law, elastic
moduli are chiefly sensitive to the coordination number, the possible values of
which are not necessarily correlated with the density. Comparisons of numerical
and experimental results for glass beads in the 10kPa-10MPa range reveal
similar differences between dry samples compacted by vibrations and lubricated
packings. The greater stiffness of the latter, in spite of their lower density,
can hence be attributed to a larger coordination number. Voigt and Reuss bounds
bracket bulk modulus B accurately, but simple estimation schemes fail for shear
modulus G, especially in poorly coordinated configurations under low P.
Tenuous, fragile networks respond differently to changes in load direction, as
compared to load intensity. The shear modulus, in poorly coordinated packings,
tends to vary proportionally to the degree of force indeterminacy per unit
volume. The elastic range extends to small strain intervals, in agreement with
experimental observations. The origins of nonelastic response are discussed. We
conclude that elastic moduli provide access to mechanically important
information about coordination numbers, which escape direct measurement
techniques, and indicate further perspectives.

through polymer solutions is systematically reviewed. The primary focus is the
study of diffusive motion of small probe particles. Comparison is made with
measurements of solution viscosities. A coherent description was obtained,
namely that the probe diffusion coefficient generally depends on polymer
concentration as D_p = D_0 exp(-alpha c^nu). One finds that alpha depends on
polymer molecular weights as alpha ~ M^0.8, and \nu appears to have large-M and
small-M values with a crossover linking them. The probe diffusion coefficient
does not simply track the solution viscosity; instead, D_p eta typically
increases markedly with increasing polymer concentration and molecular weight.
In some systems, e.g., hydroxypropylcellulose:water, the observed probe spectra
are bi- or tri-modal. Extended analysis of the full probe phenomenology implies
that hydroxypropylcellulose solutions are characterized by a single,
concentration-independent, length scale that is approximately the size of a
polymer coil. In a very few systems, one sees re-entrant or
low-concentration-plateau behaviors of uncertain interpretation; from their
rarity, these behaviors are reasonably interpreted as corresponding to specific
chemical effects. True microrheological studies examining the motion of
mesoscopic particles under the influence of a known external force are also
examined. Viscosity from true microrheological measurements is in many cases
substantially smaller than the viscosity measured with a macroscopic
instrument.
