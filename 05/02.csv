While differences in classical states are easy to detect, quantum states, which
are represented by complex-valued vectors, exhibit subtle differences leading
to several notions of equivalence. This provides flexibility in optimizing
quantum circuits, but leads to difficult new equivalence-checking issues for
simulation and synthesis. We identify several different equivalence-checking

were somewhat more distant (<150 pc), very young (<10 Myr) stars, 3 were stars
with known radial velocity planets, and 4 were older, very nearby (<20 pc)

absorption bandhead found in the spectrum of cool brown dwarfs and gas giant
planets. In our VLT data, we achieved H band contrasts > 10 mag (5 sigma) at a
separation of 0.5"" from the primary star on 45% of our targets and H band
contrasts of > 9 mag at a separation of 0.5'' on 80% of our targets. With this
degree of attenuation, we should be able to image (5sigma detection) a 5

attained 50% 5 sigma completeness for 6-10 M_Jup planets at semi-major axes of

(at the 98% confidence/2.0sigma level) a model planet population using a planet

noncoherent scenario where neither the receiver nor the transmitter knows the

obtained. The effect of fading correlation among the receiver antennas is also
studied. Simulation results indicate that for sufficiently low duty cycle
values, lower probability of error values with respect to FSK signaling are
achieved. Equivalently, when compared to FSK modulation, OOFSK with low duty
cycle requires less energy to achieve the same probability of error, which
renders this modulation a more energy efficient transmission technique.

information paradox. Further, there seems to be no unique prediction of where
the information about the collapsing body is localized. We propose that the
latter aspect of the paradox may be a manifestation of an inconsistent
self-reference in the semiclassical theory of black hole evolution. This
suggests the inadequacy of the semiclassical approach or, at worst, that
standard quantum mechanics and general relavity are fundamentally incompatible.
One option for the resolution for the paradox in the localization is to
identify the G\""odel-like incompleteness that corresponds to an imposition of
consistency, and introduce possibly new physics that supplies this
incompleteness. Another option is to modify the theory in such a way as to
prohibit self-reference. We discuss various possible scenarios to implement
these options, including eternally collapsing objects, black hole remnants,
black hole final states, and simple variants of semiclassical quantum gravity.

also allows a quantitative assessment of the errors and enables a rigorous
testing of the significance of relationships between various curve parameters,
regardless of whether their uncertainties are correlated. Analysis of the
curves gives the following results: (1) In accord with our previous findings,
the central position of the 2175 A extinction bump is mildly variable, its
width is highly variable, and the two variations are unrelated. (2) Strong
correlations are found among some extinction properties within the UV region,
and within the IR region. (3) With the exception of a few curves with extreme
(i.e., large) values of R(V), the UV and IR portions of Galactic extinction
curves are not correlated with each other. (4) The large sightline-to-sightline
variation seen in our sample implies that any average Galactic extinction curve
will always reflect the biases of its parent sample. (5) The use of an average
curve to deredden a spectral energy distribution (SED) will result in
significant errors, and a realistic error budget for the dereddened SED must
include the observed variance of Galactic curves. While the observed large
sightline-to-sightline variations, and the lack of correlation among the
various features of the curves, make it difficult to meaningfully characterize
average extinction properties, they demonstrate that extinction curves respond
sensitively to local conditions. Thus, each curve contains potentially unique

that disk-accreting neutron stars with weak magnetic fields produce three
distinct types of high-frequency X-ray oscillations. These oscillations are
powered by release of the binding energy of matter falling into the strong
gravitational field of the star or by the sudden nuclear burning of matter that
has accumulated in the outermost layers of the star. The frequencies of the
oscillations reflect the orbital frequencies of gas deep in the gravitational
field of the star and/or the spin frequency of the star. These oscillations can
therefore be used to explore fundamental physics, such as strong-field gravity
and the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and important
astrophysical questions, such as the formation and evolution of millisecond
pulsars. Observations using RossiXTE have shown that some two dozen neutron
stars in low-mass X-ray binary systems have the spin rates and magnetic fields
required to become millisecond radio-emitting pulsars when accretion ceases,
but that few have spin rates above about 600 Hz. The properties of these stars
show that the paucity of spin rates greater than 600 Hz is due in part to the
magnetic braking component of the accretion torque and to the limited amount of
angular momentum that can be accreted in such systems. Further study will show
whether braking by gravitational radiation is also a factor. Analysis of the
kilohertz oscillations has provided the first evidence for the existence of the
innermost stable circular orbit around dense relativistic stars that is
predicted by strong-field general relativity. It has also greatly narrowed the
possible descriptions of ultradense matter.

particular we find that the emission and absorption components of the excess

non-interacting case when they are identical. We study the resonance features

powerful to improve cosmological parameter constraints and/or test inherent
systematics. However they probe the same cosmic mass density field, if the two
are drawn from the same survey region, and therefore the combination may be
less powerful than first thought. We investigate the cross-covariance between
the cosmic shear power spectra and the cluster counts based on the halo model
approach, where the cross-covariance arises from the three-point correlations
of the underlying mass density field. Fully taking into account the
cross-covariance as well as non-Gaussian errors on the lensing power spectrum
covariance, we find a significant cross-correlation between the lensing power
spectrum signals at multipoles l~10^3 and the cluster counts containing halos
with masses M>10^{14}Msun. Including the cross-covariance for the combined
measurement degrades and in some cases improves the total signal-to-noise
ratios up to plus or minus 20% relative to when the two are independent. For
cosmological parameter determination, the cross-covariance has a smaller effect
as a result of working in a multi-dimensional parameter space, implying that
the two observables can be considered independent to a good approximation. We
also discuss that cluster count experiments using lensing-selected mass peaks
could be more complementary to cosmic shear tomography than mass-selected
cluster counts of the corresponding mass threshold. Using lensing selected
clusters with a realistic usable detection threshold (S/N~6 for a ground-based
survey), the uncertainty on each dark energy parameter may be roughly halved by
the combined experiments, relative to using the power spectra alone.

sets, to check for a generic failure of dark energy models. Given a dark energy
parameter, such as the energy density Omega_Lambda or equation of state w, we
split it into two meta-parameters with one controlling geometrical distances,
and the other controlling the growth of structure. Observational data spanning
Type Ia Supernovae, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), galaxy clustering,
and weak gravitational lensing statistics are fit without requiring the two
meta-parameters to be equal. This technique checks for inconsistency between
different data sets, as well as for internal inconsistency within any one data
set (e.g., CMB or lensing statistics) that is sensitive to both geometry and
growth. We find that the cosmological constant model is consistent with current
data. Theories of modified gravity generally predict a relation between growth
and geometry that is different from that of general relativity.
Parameter-splitting can be viewed as a crude way to parametrize the space of
such theories. Our analysis of current data already appears to put sharp limits
on these theories: assuming a flat universe, current data constrain the
difference Omega_Lambda(geom) - Omega_Lambda(grow) to be -0.0044 +/- 0.0058
(68% C.L.); allowing the equation of state w to vary, the difference w(geom) -
w(grow) is constrained to be 0.37 +/- 0.37 (68% C.L.). Interestingly, the
region w(grow) > w(geom), which should be generically favored by theories that
slow structure formation relative to general relativity, is quite restricted by
data already. We find w(grow) < -0.80 at 2 sigma. As an example, the best-fit
flat Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model approximated by our parametrization
lies beyond the 3 sigma contour for constraints from all the data sets.

pairs of galaxies due to gravitational lensing by intervening mass clumps.
However galaxies may become (intrinsically) aligned with each other, and with
nearby mass clumps, during their formation. This effect needs to be
disentangled from the cosmic shear signal to place constraints on cosmology. We
use the linear intrinsic alignment model as a base and compare it to an
alternative model and data. If intrinsic alignments are ignored then the dark
energy equation of state is biased by ~50 per cent. We examine how the number
of tomographic redshift bins affects uncertainties on cosmological parameters
and find that when intrinsic alignments are included two or more times as many
bins are required to obtain 80 per cent of the available information. We
investigate how the degradation in the dark energy figure of merit depends on
the photometric redshift scatter. Previous studies have shown that lensing does
not place stringent requirements on the photometric redshift uncertainty, so
long as the uncertainty is well known. However, if intrinsic alignments are
included the requirements become a factor of three tighter. These results are
quite insensitive to the fraction of catastrophic outliers, assuming that this
fraction is well known. We show the effect of uncertainties in photometric
redshift bias and scatter. Finally we quantify how priors on the intrinsic
alignment model would improve dark energy constraints.

using 3D numerical hydrodynamics to follow the evolution of an initial poloidal
field. It is found that the field is subject to an instability, located
initially on the magnetic equator, whereby the gas is displaced in a direction
parallel to the magnetic axis. If the magnetic axis is parallel to the rotation
axis, the rotation does not affect the initial linear growth of the
instability, but does restrict the growth of the instability outside of the
equatorial zone. The magnetic energy decays on a timescale which is a function
of the Alfv\'en crossing time and the rotation speed, but short compared to any
evolutionary timescale. No evidence is found for a possible stable end state to
evolve from an initial axisymmetric poloidal field. The field of an oblique
rotator is similarly unstable, in both cases regardless of the rotation speed.

fcc Co and bcc Fe, are investigated within the framework of Neel-Brown (N-B)

dimensionless correction function, the reduced magnetization, m(\tao) =
MS(T)/MS(0), in which \tao = T/TC is the reduced temperature, MS(T) is the
saturation magnetization, and TC is the Curie temperature. The factor, m(\tao),
accounts for the temperature-dependent effect of the shape anisotropy. The
constants, H0 and E0, are for the switching field at zero temperature and the
potential barrier at zero field, respectively. According to this newly derived
equation, the blocking temperature above which the properties of
superparamagnetism show up is described by the expression, TB =
E0m^2(\tao)/[kBln(t/t0)], with the extra correction factor m^2(\tao). The

are neutral in the sense that they do not significantly alter a protein's
ability to perform its primary biological function. However, new protein
functions evolve when selection begins to favor other, ""promiscuous"" functions
that are incidental to a protein's biological role. If mutations that are
neutral with respect to a protein's primary biological function cause
substantial changes in promiscuous functions, these mutations could enable
future functional evolution.
  RESULTS: Here we investigate this possibility experimentally by examining how
cytochrome P450 enzymes that have evolved neutrally with respect to activity on
a single substrate have changed in their abilities to catalyze reactions on
five other substrates. We find that the enzymes have sometimes changed as much
as four-fold in the promiscuous activities. The changes in promiscuous
activities tend to increase with the number of mutations, and can be largely
rationalized in terms of the chemical structures of the substrates. The
activities on chemically similar substrates tend to change in a coordinated
fashion, potentially providing a route for systematically predicting the change
in one function based on the measurement of several others.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that initially neutral genetic drift can lead
to substantial changes in protein functions that are not currently under
selection, in effect poising the proteins to more readily undergo functional
evolution should selection ""ask new questions"" in the future.

algorithms as working with images. Inspiration is drawn from an analogous
situation that is found in machine and human vision. Image processing
techniques are used to assist in the spatial indexing of the data. A fixed grid
approach is used and bins with too many records are sub-divided hierarchically.
Search queries are pre-computed for bins that do not contain any data records.
This has the effect of dividing the search space up into non rectangular
regions which are based on the spatial properties of the data. The bucketing
quad tree can be considered as an image with a resolution of two by two for
each layer. The results show that this method performs better than the quad
tree if there are more divisions per layer. This confirms our suspicions that
the algorithm works better if it gets to look at the data with higher
resolution images. An elegant class structure is developed where the
implementation of concrete spatial indexes for a particular data type merely
relies on rendering the data onto an image.

Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism with that due to the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism
which is also calculated from the kinetic spin Bloch equations with all the
scatterings, especially the spin-conserving electron-electron and
electron-heavy hole scatterings, included. We find that, in intrinsic quantum
wells, the effect from the Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism is much smaller than that
from the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism at low temperature, and it is smaller by no
more than one order of magnitude at high temperature. In $p$-type quantum
wells, the spin relaxation due to the Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism is also much
smaller than the one due to the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism at low temperature

$\bar{\rho^q(r)}$ of the local order parameter $\rho(r)$ scale with a set
$x(q)$ of non-trivial exponents $x(q) \neq q x(1)$. In this paper, we revisit
these ideas to incorporate more recent findings: (i) whenever a multifractal
measure $w(r)$ normalized over space $ \sum_r w(r)=1$ occurs in a random
system, it is crucial to distinguish between the typical values and the
disorder averaged values of the generalized moments $Y_q =\sum_r w^q(r)$, since
they may scale with different generalized dimensions $D(q)$ and $\tilde D(q)$
(ii) as discovered by Wiseman and Domany (S. Wiseman and E. Domany, Phys Rev E

a lack of self-averaging at critical points for thermodynamic observables, in
particular for the order parameter. After this general discussion valid for any
random critical point, we apply these ideas to random polymer models that can
be studied numerically for large sizes and good statistics over the samples. We
study the bidimensional wetting or the Poland-Scheraga DNA model with loop
exponent $c=1.5$ (marginal disorder) and $c=1.75$ (relevant disorder). Finally,
we argue that the presence of finite Griffiths ordered clusters at criticality
determines the asymptotic value $x(q \to \infty) =d$ and the minimal value $
\alpha_{min}=D(q \to \infty)=d-x(1) $ of the typical multifractal spectrum

description sheds new light on the dynamics of particles in time-varying
confining potentials. It specifically allows us to extract the effective depth
of the ion trap as the activation energy for evaporation. As a function of the
rf amplitude we find two distinct regimes related to the stability of motion of
the trapped ions. For low amplitudes the entire trap allows for stable motion
and the trap depth increases with the rf field. For larger rf amplitudes,
however, rapid energy transfer from the field to the ion motion can occur at
large trap radii, which leads to a reduction of the effective trapping volume.
In this regime the trap depth decreases again with increasing rf amplitude. We
give an analytical parameterization of the trap depth for various multipole
traps that allows predictions of the most favorable trapping conditions.

not be able to shed much light on the original ancient processes . Here we are
interested in determining how simple a signalling method can be, while still
achieving self-assembly. In 2D a coupled cellular automaton/differential
equation approach models organisms and chemotaxic chemicals, producing
spiralling aggregation. In 3D Lennard-Jones-like particles are used to
represent single cells, and their evolution in response to signalling is
followed by molecular dynamics. It is found that if a single cell is able to
emit a signal which induces others to move towards it, then a colony of

downturn in sigma(omega) at small omega, earlier emphasized by Takenaka et al.

extremely flat X-ray continuum up to 10 keV (photon index Gamma=1.26) and
indications of strong intrinsic absorption (N_H~10^22 cm^{-2} assuming neutral
gas). The instrument for hard X-rays HXD/PIN allows us a detection of the
source up to 50 keV. The broad-band continuum (0.5-50 keV) can be well modeled
with a power-law with slope Gamma=1.5 (definitively softer than the continuum
measured by XMM-Newton) above 1 keV with strong deficit of soft photons. The
low-energy cut-off can be well fitted either with intrinsic absorption (with
column density N_H~10^22 cm^{-2} in the quasar rest frame) or with a break in
the continuum, with an extremely hard (Gamma =0.7) power-law below 1 keV. We
construct the Spectral Energy Distribution of the source, using also optical-UV
measurements obtained through a quasi-simultaneous UVOT/SWIFT observation. The
shape of the SED is similar to that of other Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars
(FSRQs) with similar power, making this source an excellent candidate for the
detection in gamma-rays by GLAST. We model the SED with the synchrotron-Inverse
Compton model usually applied to FSRQs, showing that the deficit of soft
photons can be naturally interpreted as due to an intrinsic curvature of the
spectrum near the low energy end of the IC component rather than to intrinsic
absorption, although the latter possibility cannot be ruled out. We propose
that in at least a fraction of the radio-loud QSOs at high redshift the cut-off
in the soft X-ray band can be explained in a similar way. Further studies are

tunneling structures containing diluted magnetic impurities. Due to the
exchange interaction between the conduction electrons and the impurities, there
arises a giant Zeeman splitting in the presence of a moderately low magnetic
field. As a consequence, when the quantum well is magnetically doped the
current-voltage characteristics shows two peaks corresponding to transport for
each spin channel. This behavior is experimentally observed and can be
reproduced with a simple tunneling model. The model thus allows to analyze
other configurations. First, we further increase the magnetic field, which
leads to a spin polarization of the electronic current injected from the leads,
thus giving rise to a relative change in the current amplitude. We demonstrate
that the spin polarization in the emitter can be determined from such a change.
Furthermore, in the case of a magnetically doped injector our model shows a
large increase in peak amplitude and a shift of the resonance to higher
voltages as the external field increases. We find that this effect arises from

Sgr A* at the center of our Galaxy with a (quasi)-period of ~17-20 minutes,
suggesting an emission region only a few Schwarzschild radii above the event
horizon. The latest X-ray flare, detected with XMM-Newton, is notable for its
detailed lightcurve, yielding not only the highest quality period thus far, but
also important structure reflecting the geometry of the emitting region. Recent
MHD simulations of Sgr A*'s disk have demonstrated the growth of a Rossby wave
instability, that enhances the accretion rate for several hours, possibly
accounting for the observed flares. In this Letter, we carry out ray-tracing
calculations in a Schwarzschild metric to determine as accurately as possible
the lightcurve produced by general relativistic effects during such a
disruption. We find that the Rossby wave induced spiral pattern in the disk is
an excellent fit to the data, implying a disk inclination angle of ~77 deg.
Note, however, that if this association is correct, the observed period is not
due to the underlying Keplerian motion but, rather, to the pattern speed. The
favorable comparison between the observed and simulated lightcurves provides
important additional evidence that the flares are produced in Sgr A*'s inner
disk.

characterize intrinsic properties of the most common liquid scintillator

achieve optimum discrimination performances have been developed. However, the
vast majority of these studies have been performed on samples of small

experiment Borexino, as a 4 ton spherical scintillation detector immersed in
1000 tons of shielding water, represents a unique opportunity to extend the
small-sample PSD studies to a large-volume setup. Specifically, in this work we
consider two different liquid scintillation mixtures employed in CTF,
illustrating for both the PSD characterization results obtained either with the
processing of the scintillation waveform through the optimum Gatti's method, or
via a more conventional approach based on the charge content of the
scintillation tail. The outcomes of this study, while interesting per se, are
also of paramount importance in view of the expected Borexino detector
performances, where PSD will be an essential tool in the framework of the
background rejection strategy needed to achieve the required sensitivity to the

predicts undetectably small tensor perturbations with a tensor-scalar ratio $r

the evolution of a highly mixed MQS interacting with an environment, and
compare it with that of a pure MQS having the same size of the central distance

additional single-magnon contribution to the scattering with a spectral weight
proportional to $T^3$. We also compute the leading corrections to the UCL
approximation and find them to be small, putting the UCL results on a solid
basis. All this univocally points to the conclusion that the observed low
temperature RIXS intensity in La$_2$CuO$_4$ is due to two-magnon scattering.

component (labels 1, 2, 3) mixture of Fermions is considered where the
components 1 and 2 interact and, for instance, form pairs whereas the component
3 is in the normal state. For cooling, the components 2 and 3 are coupled by an
electromagnetic field. Since the quasiparticle distributions in the paired and
in the normal states are different, the coupling leads to cooling of the normal
state even when initially $T_{paired}\geq T_{normal}$ (notation $T_S\geq T_N$).
The cooling efficiency is given by the pairing energy and by the linewidth of
the coupling field. No superfluidity is required: any type of pairing, or other
phenomenon that produces a suitable spectral density, is sufficient. In
principle, the paired state could be cooled as well but this requires
$T_N<T_S$. The method has a conceptual analogy to cooling based on
superconductor -- normal metal (SN) tunneling junctions. Main differences arise
from the exact momentum conservation in the case of the field-matter coupling
vs. non-conservation of momentum in the solid state tunneling process.
Moreover, the role of processes that relax the energy conservation requirement
in the tunneling, e.g. thermal fluctuations of an external reservoir, is now
played by the linewidth of the field. The proposed method should be
experimentally feasible due to its close connection to RF-spectroscopy of
ultracold gases which is already in use.

ratio inspirals (IMRIs) are most likely to be found in globular clusters. We
analyze four possible IMRI formation mechanisms: (1) hardening of an NS-IMBH or
BH-IMBH binary via three-body interactions, (2) hardening via Kozai resonance
in a hierarchical triple system, (3) direct capture, and (4) inspiral of a
compact object from a tidally captured main-sequence star; we also discuss
tidal effects when the inspiraling object is an NS. For each mechanism we
predict the typical eccentricities of the resulting IMRIs. We find that IMRIs
will have largely circularized by the time they enter the sensitivity band of
ground-based detectors. Hardening of a binary via three-body interactions,
which is likely to be the dominant mechanism for IMRI formation, yields
eccentricities under 10^-4 when the GW frequency reaches 10 Hz. Even among
IMRIs formed via direct captures, which can have the highest eccentricities,
around 90% will circularize to eccentricities under 0.1 before the GW frequency
reaches 10 Hz. We estimate the rate of IMRI coalescences in globular clusters
and the sensitivity of a network of three Advanced LIGO detectors to the
resulting GWs. We show that this detector network may see up to tens of IMRIs
per year, although rates of one to a few per year may be more plausible. We
also estimate the loss in signal-to-noise ratio that will result from using
circular IMRI templates for data analysis and find that, for the eccentricities
we expect, this loss is negligible.

algorithm provides full performance in correcting a certain class of errors,
generic errors, which includes most errors, and can decode codes on algebraic

three different kinds of architectures that our algorithm can be applied to,
and we represent the control operation of shift-registers and switches at each

comparison of the total running time and the numbers of multipliers and
shift-registers in three architectures with those of the conventional ones for

image-slicing spectrograph designed to deliver excellent thoughput, wavelength
stability, spectrophotometric performance and superb image quality along with
wide spectral coverage throughout the 320-950 nm wavelength region. It provides
a 25x38 arcsec. field with 0.5 arcsec. sampling along each of twenty five 38X1
arcsec slitlets. The output format is optimized to match the 4096x4096 pixel
CCD detectors in each of two cameras individually optimized for the blue and
the red ends of the spectrum, respectively. A process of ""interleaved
nod-and-shuffle"" will be applied to permit quantum noise-limited sky
subtraction. Using VPH gratings, spectral resolutions of 3000 and 7000 are
provided. The full spectral range is covered in a single exposure at R=3000,
and in two exposures in the R=7000 mode. The use of transmissive coated optics,
VPH gratings and optimized mirror coatings ensures a throughput (including
telescope atmosphere and detector) > 30% over a wide spectral range. The
concentric image-slicer design ensures an excellent and uniform image quality
across the full field. To maximize scientific return, the whole instrument is
configured for remote observing, pipeline data reduction, and the accumulation
of calibration image libraries.

blazars known as IntraDay Variability (IDV) can be explained in at least some
sources as a propagation effect; the variations are interpreted as
scintillation of radio waves in the turbulent interstellar medium of the Milky
Way. One of the most convincing observational arguments in favor of a
propagation-induced variability scenario is the observed annual modulation in
the characteristic time scale of the variation due to the Earth's orbital
motion. So far there are only two sources known with a well-constrained
seasonal cycle. Annual modulation has been proposed for a few other less
well-documented objects. However, for some other IDV sources source-intrinsic
structural variations which cause drastic changes in the variability time scale
were also suggested. J1128+592 is a recently discovered, highly variable IDV
source. Previous, densely time-sampled flux-density measurements with the
Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope (Germany) and the Urumqi 25-m radio telescope
(China), strongly indicate an annual modulation of the time scale. The most
recent 4 observations in 2006/7, however, do not fit well to the annual
modulation model proposed before. In this paper, we investigate a possible
explanation of this discrepancy.

patch of an accretion disk whose parameters were chosen so that radiation
pressure and gas pressure would be comparable in magnitude. Heating, radiative
transport, and cooling are computed self-consistently with the structure by
solving the equations of radiation MHD in the shearing-box approximation. Using
a fully 3-d and energy-conserving code, we compute the structure and energy
balance of this disk segment over a span of more than forty cooling times. As
is also true when gas pressure dominates, the disk's upper atmosphere is
magnetically-supported. However, unlike the gas-dominated case, no steady-state
is reached; instead, the total (i.e., radiation plus gas) energy content
fluctuates by factors of 3--4 over timescales of several tens of orbits, with
no secular trend. Because the radiation pressure varies much more than the gas
pressure, the ratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure varies over the
approximate range 0.5--2. The volume-integrated dissipation rate generally
increases with increasing total energy, but the mean trend is somewhat slower
than linear, and the instantaneous dissipation rate is often a factor of two
larger or smaller than the mean for that total energy level. Locally, the
dissipation rate per unit volume scales approximately in proportion to the
current density; the time-average dissipation rate per unit mass is
proportional to m^{-1/2}, where m is the horizontally-averaged mass column
density to the nearer of the top or bottom surface. As in our earlier study of
a gas-dominated shearing-box, we find that energy transport is completely
dominated by radiative diffusion, with Poynting flux carrying less than 1% of
the energy lost from the box.

magnetic semiconductors (DMS) is studied systematically by taking into
consideration the Coulomb attraction between the carriers and the magnetic
impurities. The density of states and the ferromagnetic transition temperature
of a Spin-Fermion model applied to DMS are evaluated using Dynamical Mean-Field
Theory (DMFT) and Monte Carlo (MC) calculations. It is shown that the addition
of a square-well-like attractive potential can generate an IB at small enough
Mn doping $x$ for values of the $p-d$ exchange $J$ that are not strong enough
to generate one by themselves. We observe that the IB merges with the VB when
$x >= x_c$ where $x_c$ is a function of $J$ and the Coulomb attraction strength
$V$. Using MC calculations, we demonstrate that the range of the Coulomb
attraction plays an important role. While the on-site attraction, that has been
used in previous numerical simulations, effectively renormalizes $J$ for all
values of $x$, an unphysical result, a nearest-neighbor range attraction
renormalizes $J$ only at very low dopings, i.e., until the bound holes wave
functions start to overlap. Thus, our results indicate that the Coulomb
attraction can be neglected to study Mn doped GaSb, GaAs, and GaP in the
relevant doping regimes, but it should be included in the case of Mn doped GaN
that is expected to be in the IB regime.

  optical tweezers","4 pages, 4 figures","Nature Physics, vol. 3, p. 696 (2007)","10.1038/nphys698",,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum computers have the capability of out-performing their classical
counterparts for certain computational problems. Several scalable quantum
computing architectures have been proposed. An attractive architecture is a
large set of physically independant qubits, arranged in three spatial regions
where (i) the initialized qubits are stored in a register, (ii) two qubits are
brought together to realize a gate, and (iii) the readout of the qubits is
performed. For a neutral atom-based architecture, a natural way to connect
these regions is to use optical tweezers to move qubits within the system. In
this letter we demonstrate the coherent transport of a qubit, encoded on an
atom trapped in a sub-micron tweezer, over a distance typical of the separation
between atoms in an array of optical traps. Furthermore, we transfer a qubit
between two tweezers, and show that this manipulation also preserves the
coherence of the qubit.

is turned on or off by changes in the concentration of a transcription factor
(TF). We use recent data on noise levels in gene expression to show that it
should be possible to transmit much more than just one regulatory bit.
Realizing this optimal information capacity would require that the dynamic
range of TF concentrations used by the cell, the input/output relation of the
regulatory module, and the noise levels of binding and transcription satisfy
certain matching relations. This parameter-free prediction is in good agreement
with recent experiments on the Bicoid/Hunchback system in the early Drosophila
embryo, and this system achieves ~90% of its theoretical maximum information
transmission.

vertical structure and thermodynamics of a shearing box whose parameters were
chosen so that the radiation and gas pressures would be comparable. The upper
layers of this disk segment are magnetically-dominated, creating conditions
appropriate for both photon bubble and Parker instabilities. We find little
evidence for photon bubbles, even though the simulation has enough spatial
resolution to see them and their predicted growth rates are high. On the other
hand, there is strong evidence for Parker instabilities, and they appear to
dominate the evolution of the magnetically supported surface layers. The disk
photosphere is complex, with large density inhomogeneities at both the
scattering and effective (thermalization) photospheres of the evolving
horizontally-averaged structure. Both the dominant magnetic support and the
inhomogeneities are likely to have strong effects on the spectrum and
polarization of thermal photons emerging from the disk atmosphere. The
inhomogeneities are also large enough to affect models of reflection spectra
from the atmospheres of accretion disks.

\dots,m\}$. Motivated by wavelength assignment for multicasts in optical
networks, we introduce and study $n$-fibre colourings of labelled digraphs.
These are colourings of the arcs of $D$ such that at each vertex $v$, and for
each colour $\alpha$, $in(v,\alpha)+out(v,\alpha)\leq n$ with $in(v,\alpha)$
the number of arcs coloured $\alpha$ entering $v$ and $out(v,\alpha)$ the
number of labels $l$ such that there is at least one arc of label $l$ leaving
$v$ and coloured with $\alpha$. The problem is to find the minimum number of
colours $\lambda_n(D)$ such that the $m$-labelled digraph $D$ has an $n$-fibre
colouring. In the particular case when $D$ is $1$-labelled, $\lambda_1(D)$ is
called the directed star arboricity of $D$, and is denoted by $dst(D)$. We
first show that $dst(D)\leq 2\Delta^-(D)+1$, and conjecture that if
$\Delta^-(D)\geq 2$, then $dst(D)\leq 2\Delta^-(D)$. We also prove that for a
subcubic digraph $D$, then $dst(D)\leq 3$, and that if $\Delta^+(D),
\Delta^-(D)\leq 2$, then $dst(D)\leq 4$. Finally, we study
$\lambda_n(m,k)=\max\{\lambda_n(D) \tq D \mbox{is $m$-labelled} \et
\Delta^-(D)\leq k\}$. We show that if $m\geq n$, then $\ds
\left\lceil\frac{m}{n}\left\lceil \frac{k}{n}\right\rceil + \frac{k}{n}

\frac{k}{n}\right\rceil + \frac{k}{n} \right\rceil + C \frac{m^2\log k}{n}$ for
some constant $C$. We conjecture that the lower bound should be the right value
of $\lambda_n(m,k)$.

With special emphasis we look to the multicritical point and its crossover
exponent that characterizes the passage between DP and mean-field critical
properties. This crossover occurs in the limit of infinite diffusion rate and
our results pointed $\phi=4$ as the better estimate for the crossover exponent
in agreement with computational simulations.
