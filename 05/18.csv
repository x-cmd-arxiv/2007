scalar sector and their implications for the electroweak phase transition. We
determine the conditions on the scalar potential parameters that lead to a
strong first order phase transition as needed to produce the observed baryon
asymmetry of the universe. We analyze the constraints on the potential
parameters derived from Higgs boson searches at LEP and electroweak precision
observables. For models that satisfy these constraints and that produce a
strong first order phase transition, we discuss the prospective signatures in
future Higgs studies at the Large Hadron Collider and a Linear Collider. We
argue that such studies will provide powerful probes of phase transition
dynamics in models with an extended scalar sector.

Gaudin models associated to finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras suggests
that the common eigenvalues of the mutually commuting quantum Hamiltonians in a
model associated to an affine algebra should be encoded by affine opers
associated to the Langlands dual affine algebra. This leads us to some concrete
predictions for the spectra of the quantum Hamiltonians of the soliton systems.
In particular, for the KdV system the corresponding affine opers may be
expressed as Schroedinger operators with spectral parameter, and our
predictions in this case match those recently made by Bazhanov, Lukyanov and
Zamolodchikov. This suggests that this and other recently found examples of the

the candidate and discuss its implications for the nature of gravity. Part 1
briefly overviews the currently popular `concordance cosmology' and summarises
the evidence for dark energy. It also provides the observational and
theoretical arguments in favour of the cosmological constant as the candidate
and emphasises why no other approach really solves the conceptual problems
usually attributed to the cosmological constant. Part 2 describes some of the
approaches to understand the nature of the cosmological constant and attempts
to extract the key ingredients which must be present in any viable solution. I
argue that (i)the cosmological constant problem cannot be satisfactorily solved
until gravitational action is made invariant under the shift of the matter
lagrangian by a constant and (ii) this cannot happen if the metric is the
dynamical variable. Hence the cosmological constant problem essentially has to
do with our (mis)understanding of the nature of gravity. Part 3 discusses an
alternative perspective on gravity in which the action is explicitly invariant
under the above transformation. Extremizing this action leads to an equation
determining the background geometry which gives Einstein's theory at the lowest
order with Lanczos-Lovelock type corrections. (Condensed abstract).

velocities in the range $\sim 10^{1}-10^{3}$ km $\rm{s}^{-1}$. The column
density of the warm absorbing gas is $\sim 10^{20-23} \rm{cm}^{-2}$. Nine of
the ten AGN exhibiting warm absorption are best--fit by multiple ionization
components and three of the ten AGN \emph{require} multiple kinematic
components. The warm absorbing gas in our AGN sample has a wide range of
ionization parameter, spanning roughly four orders of magnitude ($\xi \sim
10^{0-4}$ ergs cm $\rm{s}^{-1}$) in total, and often spanning three orders of
magnitude in the same gas. Warm absorber components with ionization parameter
$\xi<10$ generate an unresolved transition array due to Fe in seven of the ten
AGN exhibiting warm absorption. These low ionization state absorbers may also
carry away the largest mass outflows from the AGN. The mass outflow rate
depends critically on the volume filling factor of the gas, which cannot yet be
directly measured. However, upper limits on the mass outflow ratesfor filling
factors of unity can be much greater than the expected accretion rate onto the
central supermassive black hole and filling factors as small as 1% can give
outflow rates comparable to the accretion rate. There appears to be a gap in
the outflow velocities in our sample between $\sim 300-500$ km $\rm{s}^{-1}$,
the origin of which is not clear. The outflow components with velocities below
this gap tend to be associated with lower column densities than those with
velocities above the gap.

or no absorption, in the Lyman alpha forest. We examine the spectra of 137
quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to search for such voids, and find no
clear evidence of their existence. The size distribution of voids in the range
5-70 Angstrom (corresponding to physical sizes of approximately 3-35 comoving
Mpc/h) is consistent with the standard model for the Lyman alpha forest without
additional hot bubbles. We adapt a physical model for HII bubble growth during
cosmological reionization (Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga and Hernquist 2004), to
describe the expected size-distribution of hot super-bubbles at redshift around
z = 3. This model incorporates the conjoining of bubbles around individual
neighboring galaxies. Using the non-detection of voids, we find that models in
which the volume filling factor of hot bubbles exceeds approximately 20 percent
at z=3 can be ruled out, primarily because they overproduce the number of large
(40-50 Angstrom) voids. We conclude that any pre-heating mechanism that

\eta=\tau_{tr}/\tau_{tot}$ does not depend on the shape of the scatterer but
only on whether scattering is specular or diffuse and on the spatial
dimensionality (D). In particular, for specular scattering, \eta is a universal
constant determined only by the dimensionality of the system: \eta = 2 for D =
3 and \eta = 3/2 for D = 2. The crossover between classical and quantum regimes
of scattering is discussed.

an electrical resistivity that evolves linearly with temperature, T. In the

other key properties -- Cooper-pair breaking and Kondo-lattice coherence -- are
not. Thus, T-linear resistivity in CeCoIn5 is intimately related to the nature
of incoherent scattering centers in the Kondo lattice, which provides insight
into the anomalous scattering rate synonymous with quantum criticality [7].

considering a sample eigenvalue based scheme is the computational simplicity
and the robustness to eigenvector modelling errors which are can adversely
impact the performance of estimators that exploit information in the sample
eigenvectors.
  There is, however, a price we pay by discarding the information in the sample
eigenvectors; we highlight a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample eigenvalue
based detection of weak/closely spaced high-dimensional signals from a limited
sample size. This motivates our heuristic definition of the effective number of
identifiable signals which is equal to the number of ""signal"" eigenvalues of
the population covariance matrix which exceed the noise variance by a factor
strictly greater than 1+sqrt(Dimensionality of the system/Sample size). The
fundamental asymptotic limit brings into sharp focus why, when there are too
few samples available so that the effective number of signals is less than the
actual number of signals, underestimation of the model order is unavoidable (in
an asymptotic sense) when using any sample eigenvalue based detection scheme,
including the one proposed herein. The analysis reveals why adding more sensors
can only exacerbate the situation. Numerical simulations are used to
demonstrate that the proposed estimator consistently estimates the true number
of signals in the dimension fixed, large sample size limit and the effective
number of identifiable signals in the large dimension, large sample size limit.

probability of invasion of a genotype in a population, i.e. a genotype with
lower variance in offspring number can be favored in finite populations even if
it has a somewhat lower mean fitness than a competitor. In this paper,
Gillespie's results are extended to population genetic systems with explicit
age structure, where the demographic variance (variance in growth rate)
calculated in the work of Engen and colleagues is used as a generalization of
""variance in offspring number"" to predict the interaction between deterministic
and random forces driving change in allele frequency. By calculating the
variance from the life history parameters, it is shown that selection against
variance in the growth rate will favor a genotypes with lower stochasticity in
age specific survival and fertility rates. A diffusion approximation for
selection and drift in a population with two genotypes with different life
history matrices (and therefore, different growth rates and demographic
variances) is derived and shown to be consistent with individual based
simulations. It is also argued that for finite populations, perturbation
analyses of both the growth rate and demographic variances may be necessary to

delta-function potentials, acting on a massless scalar field, in a spacetime
defined by Rindler coordinates (tau,x,y,xi). Fixed xi in such a spacetime
represents uniform acceleration. We calculate the force on systems consisting

whether it is practical to perform numerical computation using non-abelian dual

methods developed recently in the context of spin foam quantum gravity, we
derive an algorithm for efficiently computing the dual amplitude and describe

expectation value computations over a range of lattice sizes and couplings that

are classically identified as $SU(N_F)$ solitons with a unit Pontryagin number

consists of a direct magnetic coupling to the $SU(N_F)$ field strength as well
as a minimal coupling to the $U(N_F)$ gauge field. Upon the dimensional
reduction, this effective action reproduces all interaction terms between

mediated by an infinite tower of vector mesons, rendering the baryon

However, many of them fundamentally were flawed by a lack of robustness and

paper, we introduce a new kind of symmetric key block cipher algorithm that is
based on \emph{tripled chaotic maps}. In this algorithm, the utilization of two
coupling parameters, as well as the increased complexity of the cryptosystem,
make a contribution to the development of cryptosystem with higher security. In
order to increase the security of the proposed algorithm, the size of key space
and the computational complexity of the coupling parameters should be increased
as well. Both the theoretical and experimental results state that the proposed
algorithm has many capabilities such as acceptable speed and complexity in the
algorithm due to the existence of two coupling parameter and high security.
Note that the ciphertext has a flat distribution and has the same size as the
plaintext. Therefore, it is suitable for practical use in secure

appearing throughout scientific data analysis. Recently, a powerful new
algorithm called Affinity Propagation (AP) based on message-passing techniques
was proposed by Frey and Dueck \cite{Frey07}. In AP, each cluster is identified
by a common exemplar all other data points of the same cluster refer to, and
exemplars have to refer to themselves. Albeit its proved power, AP in its
present form suffers from a number of drawbacks. The hard constraint of having
exactly one exemplar per cluster restricts AP to classes of regularly shaped
clusters, and leads to suboptimal performance, {\it e.g.}, in analyzing gene
expression data. Results: This limitation can be overcome by relaxing the AP
hard constraints. A new parameter controls the importance of the constraints
compared to the aim of maximizing the overall similarity, and allows to
interpolate between the simple case where each data point selects its closest
neighbor as an exemplar and the original AP. The resulting soft-constraint
affinity propagation (SCAP) becomes more informative, accurate and leads to
more stable clustering. Even though a new {\it a priori} free-parameter is
introduced, the overall dependence of the algorithm on external tuning is
reduced, as robustness is increased and an optimal strategy for parameter
selection emerges more naturally. SCAP is tested on biological benchmark data,
including in particular microarray data related to various cancer types. We
show that the algorithm efficiently unveils the hierarchical cluster structure
present in the data sets. Further on, it allows to extract sparse gene
expression signatures for each cluster.

  2006; F. Kerschbaum, C. Charbonnel, B. Wing eds, ASP Conf.Ser. in press",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In the radio regime the mass-loss rate of AGB stars is best probed using
molecular (and atomic) line emission arising in the CSE formed by the stellar
wind. The numerical modelling of the circumstellar emission where intricate
interplays between physical and chemical processes take place, is a challenge.
The derived mass-loss rates depend crucially on the assumptions in the
circumstellar model, of which some can be constrained if enough observational
data exist. Therefore, a reliable mass-loss-rate determination for an
individual star requires, in addition to a detailed radiative transfer
analysis, good observational constraints in the form of multi-line observations
and radial brightness distributions. Of the methods used to estimate mass-loss
rates from galactic AGB stars those based on radiative transfer modelling of CO
line emission are most commonly used and possibly also the most accurate.
Typically, CO multi-transitional observations can constrain the mass-loss rate
to better than 50%, within the adopted circumstellar model. Comparison with
complementary methods, such as estimates based on dust radiative transfer
modelling coupled with a dynamical model, are consistent within a factor of
three.

low-temperature rate of phase loss of electrons in mesoscopic systems. The
study of the dephasing rate is expected to contribute to the understanding of
the many-body nature of such systems. Closed quantum dots are of special
interest in this respect, due to theoretical predictions suggesting a possible
transition temperature below which the dephasing rate vanishes. This prediction
has attracted much attention, since closed quantum dots are prime candidates
for storage units in quantum computers, and thus their phase coherence
properties are of great importance. However, an effective method for measuring
the dephasing rate within a closed quantum dot is still lacking. Here we study
two-level systems and show that the Fano factor has a sharp peak as a function
of the chemical potential, the location of which can be simply related to the
dephasing rate. We thus suggest to use the properties of the Fano factor peak
in the super-Poissonian regime as a probe for the dephasing rate.

agglomerates. It is still unclear if planetesimals can be formed from these

the collisional outcome from low velocity impacts of equal sized porous
agglomerates which are too large to be examined in a laboratory experiment. We
use the Lagrangian particle method Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics to solve the
equations that describe the dynamics of elastic and plastic bodies.
Additionally, to account for the influence of porosity, we follow a previous
developed equation of state and certain relations between the material strength
and the relative density. Collisional growth seems possible for rather low
collision velocities and particular material strengths. The remnants of
collisions with impact parameters that are larger than 50% of the radius of the
colliding objects tend to rotate. For small impact parameters, the colliding
objects are effectively slowed down without a prominent compaction of the
porous structure, which probably increases the possibility for growth. The
protoplanetesimals, however, do not stick together for the most part of the
employed material strengths. An important issue in subsequent studies has to be
the influence of rotation to collisional growth. Moreover, for realistic
simulations of protoplanetesimals it is crucial to know the correct material
parameters in more detail.

astrophysical detonations. A prime motivation of this development is the
description of a carbon detonation in conditions relevant to superbursts, which
are thought to result from the propagation of a detonation front around the
surface of a neutron star in the carbon layer underlying the atmosphere.
Methods. The algorithm we have developed is a finite-volume method inspired by
the original MUSCL scheme of van Leer (1979). The algorithm is of second-order
in the smooth part of the flow and avoids dimensional splitting. It is applied
to some test cases, and the time-dependent results are compared to the
corresponding steady state solution. Results. Our algorithm proves to be robust
to test cases, and is considered to be reliably applicable to astrophysical
detonations. The preliminary one-dimensional calculations we have performed
demonstrate that the carbon detonation at the surface of a neutron star is a
multiscale phenomenon. The length scale of liberation of energy is $10^6$ times
smaller than the total reaction length. We show that a multi-resolution
approach can be used to solve all the reaction lengths. This result will be
very useful in future multi-dimensional simulations. We present also
thermodynamical and composition profiles after the passage of a detonation in a
pure carbon or mixed carbon-iron layer, in thermodynamical conditions relevant
to superbursts in pure helium accretor systems.

signal lies in a narrow range around approximately 718 Hz. In our systematic
study, using both GR and Newtonian gravity, we identify, individually quantify,
and discuss in detail the micro- and macrophysical mechanisms leading to this
result, i.e. the effects of rotation, the EoS, and deleptonization. We also
discuss the detectability prospects of such GW burst signals by GW detectors,

investigated the influence of bar on the distribution of molecular gas in
spiral galaxies using these data. We confirmed that the degree of central
concentration is higher in barred spirals than in non-barred spirals as shown
by the previous works. Furthermore, we present an observational evidence that
bars are efficient in driving molecular gas that lies within the bar length
toward the center, while the role in bringing gas in from the outer parts of
the disks is small. The transported gas accounts for about half of molecular
gas within the central region in barred spiral galaxies. We found a correlation
between the degree of central concentration and bar strength. Galaxies with
stronger bars tend to have higher central concentration. The correlation
implies that stronger bars accumulate molecular gas toward the center more
efficiently. These results are consistent with long-lived bars.

making predictions for relativistic heavy ion collisions. The method involves
extracting equilibrium distribution functions for quarks and gluons from the
EOS, which in turn will allow a determination of the transport and other bulk
properties of the quark gluon plasma. Simultaneously, the method also yields a
quasi particle description of interacting quarks and gluons. The first EOS is
perturbative in the QCD coupling constant and has contributions of $O(g^5)$.
The second EOS is an improvement over the first, with contributions upto $
O(g^6 ln(\frac{1}{g}))$; it incorporates the nonperturbative hard thermal
contributions. The interaction effects are shown to be captured entirely by the
effective chemical potentials for the gluons and the quarks, in both the cases.
The chemical potential is seen to be highly sensitive to the EOS. As an
application, we determine the screening lengths which are, indeed the most
important diagnostics for QGP. The screening lengths are seen to behave
drastically differently depending on the EOS considered., and yield, therefore,
a way to distinguish the two equations of state in heavy ion collisions.

quasi-two dimensional charge carriers undergo a quantum phase transition from
an unconventional d-wave superconducting state to a conventional s-wave
superconductor with more carriers per unit cell. In the opposite
strong-coupling regime rotational symmetry breaking appears as a result of a
reduced Coulomb repulsion between unconventional bipolarons dismissing thereby
some constraints on unconventional pairing in the Bose-Einstein condensation

consider in detail two specific processes having DDLRD, originally presented in
Taqqu and Levy (1986), and Parke (1999). For these processes, we obtain the
limiting distribution of suitably standardized discrete Fourier transforms
(DFTs) and sample autocovariances. At low frequencies, the standardized DFTs
converge to a stable law, as do the standardized sample autocovariances at
fixed lags. Finite collections of standardized sample autocovariances at a
fixed set of lags converge to a degenerate distribution. The standardized DFTs
at high frequencies converge to a Gaussian law. Our asymptotic results are
strikingly similar for the two DDLRD processes studied. We calibrate our
asymptotic results with a simulation study which also investigates the
properties of the semiparametric log periodogram regression estimator of the
memory parameter.

The mass rearing of M.dorsiplana was carried out in a population cage where the
density of egg-laying females per infested seed was increased from 1:1 on the
first day to 5:1 on the last (fifth) day. Under these experimental conditions
egg-clutch size per host increased, and at the same time the mortality of eggs
laid also increased. The density of egg-laying females influenced the sex ratio
which tended towards a balance of sons and daughters,in contrast to the sex
ratio of a single egg-laying female per host (1 son to 7 daughters). The mean
weight of adults emerging from a parasitized host was negatively correlated
with the egg-clutch size, i.e., as egg-clutch size increased, adult weight
decreased. All these results show that mass rearing of the gregarious

containing only ~ 0.1 - 0.4 Msun, in which ~ 0.02 - 0.06 Msun is 56Ni
synthesized at the explosion. To explain the blueshift, the blob should either
be of unipolar moving at the center-of-mass velocity v ~ 2,000 - 5,000 km s-1,
or suffer from self-absorption within the ejecta as seen in SN 1990I. In both
interpretations, the low-mass blob component dominates the optical output both
at the first peak (~ 20 days) and at the late phase (~ 300 days). The low
luminosity at the late phase (the absolute R magnitude M_R ~ -10.2 mag at ~ 270
days) sets the upper limit for the mass of 56Ni < ~ 0.08 Msun, which is in
contradiction to the value necessary to explain the second, main peak
luminosity (M_R ~ -18.3 mag at ~ 40 days). Encountered by this difficulty in
the 56Ni heating model, we suggest an alternative scenario in which the heating
source is a newly born, strongly magnetized neutron star (a magnetar) with the
surface magnetic field Bmag ~ 10^{14-15} gauss and the initial spin period P0 ~
10 ms. Then, SN 2005bf could be a link between normal SNe Ib/c and an X-Ray
