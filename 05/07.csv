on primordial nucleosynthesis in a systematic way. The first step establishes
the response of primordial element abundances to the variation of a large
number of nuclear physics parameters, including nuclear binding energies. We
find a strong influence of the n-p mass difference (for the 4He abundance), of
the nucleon mass (for deuterium) and of A=3,4,7 binding energies (for 3He, 6Li
and 7Li). A second step relates the nuclear parameters to the parameters of the
Standard Model of particle physics. The deuterium, and, above all, 7Li
abundances depend strongly on the average light quark mass hat{m} \equiv
(m_u+m_d)/2. We calculate the behaviour of abundances when variations of
fundamental parameters obey relations arising from grand unification. We also
discuss the possibility of a substantial shift in the lithium abundance while
the deuterium and 4He abundances are only weakly affected.

non-analytic as functions of a controlled thermodynamical variable. As occurs
with the self-consistent Fermi Golden Rule, one condition to obtain the
discontinuous behavior is the proper evaluation of a classical or quantum
thermodynamic limit. We show that in presence of an environment, the
oscillatory dynamics of a quantum two-level system, in analogy with a classical
damped oscillator, can undergo a quantum dynamical phase transition to a
non-oscillatory phase. This is obtained from a self-consistent solution of the
Generalized Landauer Buettiker Equations, a simplified integral form of the
Keldysh formalism. I argue that working at each side of the transition implies
standing under different paradigms in the Kuhn's sense of the word. In
consequence, paradigms incommensurability obtains a sound mathematical
justification as a consequence of the non-analyticity of the observables. A
strong case is made upon the need to deepen the public's intuition and
understanding on the abrupt transition from static to dynamical friction
regimes.

test the validity of the monotonicity formula at next-to-leading order in

motivation that, under some natural conditions, these walks mix quickly and
provide an efficient method of sampling the vertices of a graph. Alon,
Benjamini, Lubetzky and Sodin studied non-backtracking random walks on regular
graphs, and showed that their mixing rate may be up to twice as fast as that of
the simple random walk. As an application, they showed that the maximal number
of visits to a vertex, made by a non-backtracking random walk of length $n$ on
a high-girth $n$-vertex regular expander, is typically $(1+o(1))\frac{\log
n}{\log\log n}$, as in the case of the balls and bins experiment. They further
asked whether one can establish the precise distribution of the visits such a
walk makes.
  In this work, we answer the above question by combining a generalized form of
Brun's sieve with some extensions of the ideas in Alon et al. Let $N_t$ denote
the number of vertices visited precisely $t$ times by a non-backtracking random
walk of length $n$ on a regular $n$-vertex expander of fixed degree and girth
$g$. We prove that if $g=\omega(1)$, then for any fixed $t$, $N_t/n$ is
typically $\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}t!}+o(1)$. Furthermore, if $g=\Omega(\log\log
n)$, then $N_t/n$ is typically $\frac{1+o(1)}{\mathrm{e}t!}$ uniformly on all
$t \leq (1-o(1))\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}$ and 0 for all $t \geq
(1+o(1))\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}$. In particular, we obtain the above result
on the typical maximal number of visits to a single vertex, with an improved
threshold window. The essence of the proof lies in showing that variables
counting the number of visits to a set of sufficiently distant vertices are
asymptotically independent Poisson variables.

uniaxial nematic phase, an additional (tetratic) oriented phase, possessing two
directors, which is the analogue of the biaxial or cubatic phases in three-
dimensional fluids. There is computer simulation evidence that the tetratic
phase might be stable with respect to phases with spatial order for rectangles
with low aspect ratios. As hard rectangles are mixed with other particles not
possessing stable tetratic order by themselves, the tetratic phase is
destabilised, via a first- or second-order phase transition, to uniaxial
nematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles of low aspect ratio tetratic
order persists in a relatively large range of volume fractions. The order of
these transitions depends on the particle geometry, dimensions and
thermodynamic conditions of the mixture. The second component of the mixture
has been chosen to be hard discs or disco-rectangles, the geometry of which is
different from that of rectangles, leading to packing frustration and demixing
behaviour, or simply rectangles of different aspect ratio. These mixtures may
be good candidates for observing thermodynamically stable tetratic phases in
monolayers of hard particles. Finally, demixing between fluid
(isotropic--tetratic or tetratic--tetratic) phases is seen to occur in mixtures

the focused irradiance, electric fields of which drive electrons into the

modulations of the electron density naturally and robustly take the shape of
paraboloidal dense shells, separated by evacuated regions, moving almost at the
speed of light. When we inject another counter-propagating laser pulse, it is
partially reflected from the shells, acting as relativistic flying
(semi-transparent) mirrors, producing an extremely time-compressed
frequency-multiplied pulse which may be focused tightly to the diffraction
limit. This is as if the counterstreaming laser pulse bounces off a
relativistically swung tennis racket, turning the ball of the laser photons
into another ball of coherent X-ray photons but with a form extremely
relativistically compressed to attosecond and zeptosecond levels. Here we
report the first demonstration of the frequency multiplication detected from
the reflection of a weak laser pulse in the region of the wake wave generated
by the driver pulse in helium plasma. This leads to the possibility of very
strong pulse compression and extreme coherent light intensification. This
Relativistic Tennis with photon beams is demonstrated leading to the
possibility toward reaching enormous electromagnetic field intensification and

  animated version of Figure 1 see
  http://uk.geocities.com/mike.hapgood@btinternet.com/moon_movie_6.gif","Ann. Geophys., 25, 2037--2044, 2007","10.5194/angeo-25-2037-2007",,"physics.space-ph",,"  This paper shows how the exposure of the Moon to the Earth's plasmasheet is
subject to decadal variations due to lunar precession. The latter is a key
property of the Moon's apparent orbit around the Earth - the nodes of that
orbit precess around the ecliptic, completing one revolution every 18.6 years.
This precession is responsible for a number of astronomical phenomena, e.g. the
year to year drift of solar and lunar eclipse periods. It also controls the
ecliptic latitude at which the Moon crosses the magnetotail and thus the number
and duration of lunar encounters with the plasmasheet. This paper presents a
detailed model of those encounters and applies it to the period 1960 to 2030.
This shows that the total lunar exposure to the plasmasheet will vary from 10
hours per month at a minimum of the eighteen-year cycle rising to 40 hours per
month at the maximum. These variations could have a profound impact on the
accumulation of charge due plasmasheet electrons impacting the lunar surface.
Thus we should expect the level of lunar surface charging to vary over the
eighteen-year cycle. The literature contains reports that support this: several
observations made during the cycle maximum of 1994-2000 are attributed to
bombardment and charging of the lunar surface by plasmasheet electrons. Thus we
conclude that lunar surface charging will vary markedly over an eighteen-year
cycle driven by lunar precession. It is important to interpret lunar
environment measurements in the context of this cycle and to allow for the
cycle when designing equipment for deployment on the lunar surface. This is
particularly important in respect of developing plans for robotic exploration
on the lunar surface during the next cycle maximum of 2012-19.

radiation associated with the cyclotron maser instability for parameterized
horseshoe electron velocity distributions. The velocity distribution function
was modeled to closely fit the electron distribution functions observed in the
auroral cavity. We systematically varied the model parameters as well as the
propagation direction to study the dependence of growth rates on model
parameters. The growth rate depends strongly on loss cone opening angle, which
must be less than $90^{o}$ for significant CMI growth. The growth rate is
sharply peaked for perpendicular radiation ($k_{\parallel} = 0$), with a
full-width at half-maximum $1.7^{o}$, in good agreement with observed k-vector
orientations and numerical simulations. The fractional bandwidth varied between
10$^{-4}$ and 10$^{-2}$, depending most strongly on propagation direction. This
range encompasses nearly all observed fractional AKR burst bandwidths. We find
excellent agreement between the computed RX mode emergent intensities and
observed AKR intensities assuming convective growth length $L_c\approx$20-40 km
and group speed 0.15$c$. The only computed LO mode growth rates compatible
observed LO mode radiation levels occurred for number densities more than 100
times the average energetic electron densities measured in auroral cavities.
This implies that LO mode radiation is not produced directly by the CMI
mechanism but more likely results from mode conversion of RX mode radiation. We
find that perturbation of the model velocity distribution by large ion solitary
waves (ion holes) can enhance the growth rate by a factor of 2-4. This will
result in a gain enhancement more than 40 dB depending on the convective growth
length within the structure. Similar enhancements may be caused by EMIC waves.

the resistance across $T_c$. Moreover, we observe an anomalous variation,

show that this peak is due to the formation of domains in the temperature
region between the low-$T$ ordered phase and the true paramagnetic disordered
phase. The existence of such domains is known in the theory of critical
phenomena. The behavior of the resistance obtained here is compared to a recent
experiment. An excellent agreement with our physical interpretation is

equal). An analytical expression for the crossover between attractive and
repulsive pressure is obtained as a function of the salt concentration. This
condition reduces to the high-salt limit of Parsegian and Gingell where the
interaction is exponentially screened and to the zero salt limit of Lau and
Pincus in which the important length scales are the inter-plate separation and
the Gouy-Chapman length. In the regime of low salt and high surface charges we
predict - for any ratio of the charges on the surfaces - that the attractive
pressure is long-ranged as a function of the spacing. The attractive pressure
is related to the decrease in counter-ion concentration as the inter-plate
distance is decreased. Our theory predicts several scaling regimes with
different scaling expressions for the pressure as function of salinity and
surface charge densities. The pressure predictions can be related to surface
force experiments of oppositely charged surfaces that are prepared by coating
one of the mica surfaces with an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte.

  We have synthesized binary star populations to calculate the number of merged
stars with helium cores which could be early-R stars. We find many possible
evolutionary channels. The most common of which is the merger of a helium white
dwarf with a hydrogen-burning red giant branch star during a common envelope
phase followed by a helium flash in a rotating core which mixes carbon to the
surface. All the channels together give ten times more early-R stars than we
require to match recent Hipparcos observations - we discuss which channels are
likely to be the true early-R stars and which are not. For the first time we
have constructed a viable model of the early-R stars with which we can test
some of our ideas regarding common envelope evolution in giants, stellar
mergers, rotation, the helium flash and the origin of the early-R stars.

Structure forms readily in the recollapsing phase of a model with negative
Lambda, so collapse fraction alone cannot forbid Lambda from being large and
negative. A negative Lambda is disfavoured only if we assume that formation of
observers can be neglected once the recollapsing universe has heated to T > 8
K. For the case of positive Lambda, however, the current universe does occupy a
extremely typical position compared to the predicted distribution on the

dual to the zero-range process (ZRP) in the sense that, while for the ZRP the
rate of transfer of a particle only depends on the occupation of the departure
site, it only depends on the occupation of the arrival site for the target
process. More precisely, duality associates to a given ZRP a unique target
process, and vice-versa. If the dynamics is symmetric, i.e., in the absence of
a bias, both processes have the same stationary-state product measure. In this
work we focus our interest on the situation where the latter measure exhibits a
continuous condensation transition at some finite critical density $\rho_c$,
irrespective of the dimensionality. The novelty comes from the case of
asymmetric dynamics, where the target process has a nontrivial fluctuating
stationary state, whose characteristics depend on the dimensionality. In one
dimension, the system remains homogeneous at any finite density. An alternating
scenario however prevails in the high-density regime: typical configurations
consist of long alternating sequences of highly occupied and less occupied
sites. The local density of the latter is equal to $\rho_c$ and their
occupation distribution is critical. In dimension two and above, the asymmetric
target process exhibits a phase transition at a threshold density $\rho_0$ much
larger than $\rho_c$. The system is homogeneous at any density below $\rho_0$,
whereas for higher densities it exhibits an extended condensate elongated along
the direction of the mean current, on top of a critical background with density
$\rho_c$.

elementary rotations around a chemical bond. Self-avoidance of a polypeptide
chain introduces degree correlations in the conformation network, which in turn

along energy gradients organize themselves into scale free networks, thus
explaining previous observations made via molecular dynamics simulations. We
also show that these energy landscape correlations are essential for recovering
the observed connectivity exponent, which belongs to a different universality

5033, made at 4.9 and 8.4 GHz on 8 April 2003. Combined with VLA archival
observations at 1.4 and 4.9 GHz made on 7 August 1993, 29 August 1999, and 31
October 1999, we sample the galaxy radio emission at scales ranging from the
nuclear regions (<~ 100 pc) to the outer regions of the disk (~ 40 kpc). The
high-resolution VLA images show a core-jet structure for the Sy 1.5 nucleus.
While the core has a moderately steep non-thermal radio spectrum (S_\nu ~
\nu^\alpha; \alpha_{1.5}^{4.9} \approx -0.4), the inner kpc region shows a
steeper spectrum (\alpha_{1.5}^{8.4} \approx -0.9). This latter spectrum is
typical of galaxies where energy losses are high, indicating that the escape
rate of cosmic ray electrons in NGC 5033 is low. The nucleus contributes little
to the total 1.4 GHz radio power of NGC 5033 and, based on the radio to
far-infrared (FIR) relation, it appears that the radio and far-infrared
emission from NGC 5033 are dominated by a starburst that during the last 10 Myr
produced stars at a rate of ~2.8 M_sun/yr, yielding a supernova (type Ib/c and
II) rate of 0.045 #/yr. This supernova rate corresponds to about 1 SN event
every 22 yr. Finally, from our deep 8.4 GHz VLA-D image, we suggest the
existence of a radio spur in NGC 5033, which could have been due to a hot
superbubble formed as a consequence of sequential supernova explosions
occurring during the lifetime of a giant molecular cloud.

quasi-classical models their bound is achievable and they gave a necessary and
sufficient condition for positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) attaining
this bound. They asked (i) whether their bound is attainable more generally,
(ii) whether explicit expressions for optimal POVMs can be derived from the
attainability condition. We show that the symmetric logarithmic derivative
(SLD) quantum information is less than or equal to the SM bound, i.e.\
$H(\theta) \leq C_{\Upsilon}(\theta)$ and we find conditions for equality. As
the Fisher information is less than or equal to the SLD quantum information,
i.e. $F_M(\theta) \leq H(\theta)$, we can deduce when equality holds in
$F_M(\theta) \leq C_{\Upsilon}(\theta)$. Equality does not hold for all
channels. As a consequence, the attainability condition cannot be used to test
for optimal POVMs for all channels. These results are extended to
multi-parameter channels.
