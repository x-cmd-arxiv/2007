models of electroweak symmetry breaking with bulk gauge and fermion fields,
since the radion may turn out to be the lightest particle in such models. We
calculate the coupling of the radion in such scenarios to bulk fermion and
gauge modes. Special attention needs to be devoted to the coupling to massless
gauge fields (photon, gluon), since it is well known that loop effects may be
important for these fields. We also present a detailed explanation of these
couplings from the CFT interpretation. We then use these couplings to determine
the radion branching fractions and discuss some of the discovery potential of
the LHC for the radion. We find that the gamma-gamma signal is enhanced over
most of the range of the radion mass over the gamma-gamma signal of a SM Higgs,
as long as the RS scale is sufficiently low. However, the signal significance
depends strongly on free parameters that characterize the magnitude of bare
brane-localized kinetic terms for the massless gauge fields. In the absence of
such terms, the signal can be be enhanced over the traditional RS1 models
(where all standard model fields are localized on the IR brane), but the signal
can also be reduced compared to RS1 if the brane localized terms are sizeable.
We also show that for larger radion masses, where the gamma-gamma signal is no
longer significant, one can use the usual 4 lepton signal to discover the
radion.

  Hidden in GR","final edits: more detail on derivation of equations of motion for q",,,,"gr-qc hep-th math-ph math.MP",,"  A derivation of the equations of motion of general relativity is presented
that does not invoke the Axiom of Choice, but requires the explicit
construction of a choice function q for continuous three-space regions. The
motivation for this (seemingly academic) endeavour is to take the background
independence intrinsic to Einstein gravity one step further, and to assure that
both the equations of motion and the way in which those equations of motion are
derived are as self-consistent as possible. That is, solutions to the equations
of motion of general relativity endow a three-space region with a physical and
distinguishing geometry in four-dimensional space-time. However, in order to
derive these equations of motion one should first be able to choose a
three-space region without having any prior knowledge of its physically
appropriate geometry. The expression of this choice process requires a
three-dimensional topological manifold Q, to which all considered three-space
regions belong, and that generates an equation of motion whose solutions are q.
These solutions relate the effects of curvature to the source term through the
topology of Q and constitute Einstein gravity. Q is given by 2T^3+3S^1xS^2, and
is embedded in four dimensions. This points toward a hidden topological content
for general relativity, best phrased as: Q and q provide a structure for how to
choose a three-space region irrespective of what geometric properties it has,
while at the same time Q and q determine that only GR can endow a three-space
with those geometric properties. In this sense, avoiding the Axiom of Choice
allows one to gain physical insight into GR. Possible links with holography are
pointed out.

the nature of the lenses being detected in this direction (dark halo objects,

the more common, but fainter, turnoff sources. Warm Spitzer could observe bulge
microlenses for 38 days per year, which would permit up to 24 microlens

relativistic superfluids, and remind that there are at least three bulk

coefficient associated to the normal fluid component of the superfluid. In our
analysis we use Son's effective field theory for the superfluid phonon, amended
to include scale breaking effects proportional to the square of the strange
quark mass m_s. We compute the bulk viscosity at leading order in the scale
breaking parameter, and find that it is dominated by collinear splitting and
joining processes. The resulting transport coefficient is zeta=0.011 m_s^4/T,
growing at low temperature T until the phonon fluid description stops making

dwarfs. The temperature/pressure profiles of the non-equilibrium models are
fully consistent with the non-equilibrium chemistry. Our grid of
non-equilibrium models includes spectra for effective temperatures from 200 K
to 1800 K, three surface gravities, four possible values of the coefficient of
eddy diffusion in the radiative zone, and three different CO/CH$_4$ chemical
reaction prescriptions. We find that the non-equilibrium overabundance of CO
translates into flux suppressions in the M ($\sim4-$5 $\mu$m) band of at most
$\sim$40% between effective temperatures of 600 and 1800 K. The effect is
largest around $T_{\rm eff} \approx 1100$ K. The underabundance of ammonia due
to non-equilibrium chemistry translates into flux enhancements of no more than
$\sim$20% for the $T_{\rm eff}$ range from 300 to 1800 K, with the largest
effects at the lowest values of $T_{\rm eff}$. The magnitude of the departure
from chemical equilibrium increases with decreasing gravity, with increasing
eddy diffusion coefficient, and with decreasing speed of the CO/CH$_4$
reaction. Though these effects are modest, they lead to better fits with the

role of the R-parity violating parameters are given following perturbative
diagonalization of mass-squared matrices for the scalars. Dominant
contributions come from the combinations $B_i \lambda^{\prime}_{ij1}$ for which
we obtain robust bounds. It turns out that neutron and deuteron EDMs receive
much stronger contributions than mercury EDM and any null result at the future
deuteron EDM experiment or Los Alamos neutron EDM experiment can lead to
extra-ordinary constraints on RPV parameter space. Even if R-parity violating
couplings are real, CKM phase does induce RPV contribution and for some cases
such a contribution is as strong as contribution from phases in the R-parity
violating couplings.Hence, we have bounds directly on $|B_i
\lambda^{\prime}_{ij1}|$ even if the RPV parameters are all real.
Interestingly, even if slepton mass and/or $\mu_0$ is as high as 1 TeV, it
still leads to neutron EDM that is an order of magnitude larger than the
sensitivity at Los Alamos experiment. Since the results are not much sensitive
to $\tan \beta$, our constraints will survive even if other observables tighten
the constraints on $\tan \beta$.

H-band magnitude of the secondary varies by as much as 1.3 mag within a decade,

photospheric variability caused by an uneven accretion rate or from the
rotation of the secondary. We detected a half-ring shaped circumbinary disk
around the binary with a bright southwest part but a barely detectable

inclination are about 520 AU and 42, respectively. The disk is not uniform but
has remarkable features, including a clumpy structure along the disk,
circumstellar material inside the inner cavity, and an extended armlike

a clump or material accreting from the disk onto the binary. The armlike

the $N^*(1535)$ resonance to $N \phi$ is compatible with previous indications
of a large $s \bar{s}$ component in the quark wave function of the $N^*(1535)$
resonance and may be the real origin of the significant enhancement of the
$\phi$ production over the naive OZI-rule predictions.

few-body wave functions corresponding to the AV18 interaction and treating the
final state interaction (FSI) within the Eikonal Approximation to describe the
multiple rescattering of the struck nucleon with the nucleons of the spectator
two-nucleon system. Calculations have been performed in momentum space so that
the nucleon electromagnetic current could be left in the fully covariant form
avoiding by this way non relativistic reductions and the factorization
approximation. The results of calculations, which are compared with recent JLab
experimental data, show that the left-right asymmetry exhibit a clear
dependence upon the multiple scattering in the final state and demonstrate the
breaking down of the factorization approximation at \phi=0 i.e. for ""negative""
and large \geq 300MeV/c values of the missing momentum.

initially in the single-qubit mixed state. Representing the affine
transformation of the generalized amplitude damping by a three-dimensional
volume, we plot explicitly the volume occupied by the channels simulatable by a
single-qubit mixed-state environment. As expected, this volume is embedded in
the total volume by the channels which is simulated by two-qubit enviroment.
The volume ratio is approximately 0.08 which is much smaller than 3/8, the
volume ratio for generalized depolarizing channels.

lattices in the presence of an additional, smoothly varying potential, as in
current experiments. Three regimes emerge in the phase diagram: a
low-temperature Mott regime similar to the zero-temperature quantum phase, an
intermediate regime where MI features persist, but where superfluidity is
absent, and a thermal regime where features of the Mott insulator state have
disappeared. We obtain the thermodynamic functions of the Mott phase in the
latter cases. The results are used to estimate the temperatures achieved by
adiabatic loading in current experiments. We point out the crucial role of the
trapping potential in determining the final temperature, and suggest a scheme
for further cooling by adiabatic decompression.
