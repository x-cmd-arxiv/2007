hyperbolic systems of conservation laws with source terms are studied. The
basic approach is to investigate the stability and monotonicity of a non-linear
scheme in terms of its corresponding scheme in variations. Such an approach
leads to application of the stability theory for linear equation systems to
establish stability of the corresponding non-linear scheme. The main
methodological innovation is the theorems establishing the notion that a
non-linear scheme is stable (and monotone) if the corresponding scheme in
variations is stable (and, respectively, monotone). Criteria are developed for
monotonicity and stability of difference schemes associated with the numerical
analysis of systems of partial differential equations. The theorem of
Friedrichs (1954) is generalized to be applicable to variational schemes with
non-symmetric matrices. A new modification of the central Lax-Friedrichs (LxF)
scheme is developed to be of the second order accuracy. A monotone piecewise
cubic interpolation is used in the central schemes to give an accurate
approximation for the model in question. The stability and monotonicity of the
modified scheme are investigated. Some versions of the modified scheme are
tested on several conservation laws, and the scheme is found to be accurate and
robust. As applied to hyperbolic conservation laws with, in general, stiff
source terms, it is constructed a second order scheme based on
operator-splitting techniques.

$\gamma=(66.6^{+4.3+4.0}_{-5.0-3.0})^\circ$, where the latter errors correspond
to a generous estimate of U-spin-breaking effects. On the other hand, the
$B_d\to\pi^\mp K^\pm$, $B_s\to \pi^\pm K^\mp$ analysis leaves us with
$26^\circ\leq\gamma\leq70^\circ$, and points to a value of the $B_s\to \pi^\pm

bottle-brush polymers with a rigid backbone and flexible side chains under good
solvent conditions are summarized and their validity and applicability is
assessed by a comparison with Monte Carlo simulations of a simple lattice
model. It is shown that under typical conditions, as they are also present in
experiments, only a rather weak stretching of the side chains is realized, and
then the scaling predictions based on the extension of the Daoud-Cotton blob
picture are not applicable.
  Also two-component bottle brush polymers are considered, where two types
(A,B) of side chains are grafted, assuming that monomers of different kind
repel each other. In this case, variable solvent quality is allowed for, such
that for poor solvent conditions rather dense cylinder-like structures result.
Theories predict ``Janus Cylinder''-type phase separation along the backbone in
this case. The Monte Carlo simulations, using the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth
method (PERM) then are restricted to rather short side chain length.
Nevertheless, evidence is obtained that the phase separation between an A-rich
part of the cylindrical molecule and a B-rich part can only occur locally. The
correlation length of this microphase separation can be controlled by the
solvent quality. This lack of a phase transition is interpreted by an analogy
with models for ferromagnets in one space dimension.

about the evolution of the average ionization during the epoch of reionization.
Interpretation of the polarization spectrum usually requires the assumption of
a fixed functional form for the evolution, e.g. instantaneous reionization. We
develop a model-independent method where a small set of principal components
completely encapsulate the effects of reionization on the large-angle E-mode
polarization for any reionization history within an adjustable range in
redshift. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, we apply this approach to
both the 3-year WMAP data and simulated future data. WMAP data constrain two
principal components of the reionization history, approximately corresponding
to the total optical depth and the difference between the contributions to the
optical depth at high and low redshifts. The optical depth is consistent with
the constraint found in previous analyses of WMAP data that assume
instantaneous reionization, with only slightly larger uncertainty due to the
expanded set of models. Using the principal component approach, WMAP data also
place a 95% CL upper limit of 0.08 on the contribution to the optical depth
from redshifts z>20. With improvements in polarization sensitivity and
foreground modeling, approximately five of the principal components can
ultimately be measured. Constraints on the principal components, which probe
the entire reionization history, can test models of reionization, provide
model-independent constraints on the optical depth, and detect signatures of
high-redshift reionization.

For pure Gaussian states, central resources for continuous-variable quantum

additional constraint of global purity, and the one following by the
local-unitary freedom. Counting arguments and insights from the phase-space
Schmidt decomposition and in general from the framework of symplectic analysis,
accompany our description of the standard form of pure n-mode Gaussian states.
In particular we clarify why only in pure states with n<=3 modes all the direct
correlations between position and momentum operators can be set to zero by
local unitary operations. For any n, the emerging minimal set of parametres
contains complete information about all forms of entanglement in the
corresponding states. An efficient state engineering scheme (able to encode
direct correlations between position and momentum operators as well) is
proposed to produce entangled multimode Gaussian resources, its number of
optical elements matching the minimal number of locally invariant degrees of
freedom of general pure n-mode Gaussian states. We demonstrate that so-called
""block-diagonal"" Gaussian states, without direct correlations between position
and momentum, are systematically less entangled, on average, than arbitrary
pure Gaussian states.

confirmed to be at z~5 from their Ly alpha emission and the continuum
depression shortward of Ly alpha. The EWs of Ly alpha emission of the 2 LBGs
are not so strong to be detected as Ly alpha emitters, and one of them shows
strong low-ionized interstellar (LIS) metal absorption lines. Two faint objects
with z' \geq 25.0 mag are also confirmed to be at z~5, and their spectra show
strong Ly alpha emission in contrast to the bright ones. These results suggest
a deficiency of strong Ly alpha emission in bright LBGs at z~5, which has been
discussed in our previous paper. Combined with our previous spectra of LBGs at
z~5 obtained around the Hubble Deep Field-North (HDF-N), we made a composite
spectrum of UV luminous (M_1400 \leq -21.5 mag) LBGs at z~5. The resultant
spectrum shows a weak Ly alpha emission and strong LIS absorptions which
suggests that the bright LBGs at z~5 have chemically evolved at least to ~0.1
solar metallicity. For a part of our sample in the HDF-N region, we obtained
near-to-mid infrared data, which constraint stellar masses of these objects.
With the stellar mass and the metallicity estimated from LIS absorptions, the
metallicities of the LBGs at z~5 tend to be lower than those of the galaxies
with the same stellar mass at z \lesssim 2, although the uncertainty is very
large.

on dyed DI-water for several voltages, frequencies and flow-rates, displaying
good mixing properties in the range of $10 \div 100$kHz, at low peak-to-peak
voltages ($\sim15 \div 20$ volts). Low voltage supply, small dimensions and
possibility of fabrication via standard lithographic techniques make the device
highly integrable in lab-on-a-chip platforms.

expansion without a cosmological constant and satisfies both cosmological and
solar-system tests in the small-field limit of the parameter space.
Solar-system tests alone place only weak bounds on these models, since the
additional scalar degree of freedom is locked to the high-curvature
general-relativistic prediction across more than 25 orders of magnitude in
density, out through the solar corona. This agreement requires that the
galactic halo be of sufficient extent to maintain the galaxy at high curvature
in the presence of the low-curvature cosmological background. If the galactic
halo and local environment in f(R) models do not have substantially deeper
potentials than expected in LCDM, then cosmological field amplitudes |f_R| >
10^{-6} will cause the galactic interior to evolve to low curvature during the
acceleration epoch. Viability of large-deviation models therefore rests on the
structure and evolution of the galactic halo, requiring cosmological
simulations of f(R) models, and not directly on solar-system tests. Even small
deviations that conservatively satisfy both galactic and solar-system
constraints can still be tested by future, percent-level measurements of the
linear power spectrum, while they remain undetectable to cosmological-distance
measures. Although we illustrate these effects in a specific class of models,
the requirements on f(R) are phrased in a nearly model-independent manner.

(graphene) resemble quantum-relativistic particles also known as Dirac Fermions
(DF). They possess an internal degree of freedom, chirality, that leads to
unusual Landau Level (LL) energy sequences in a magnetic field and profoundly
alters the magneto-transport properties. One of the consequences is an
anomalous Quantum-Hall effect, recently detected in both single layer and
bi-layer graphene. However the underlying cause, the unusual LL sequence, was
never observed. Here we report the direct observation of LL of DF by means of
low temperature Scanning-Tunnelling-Spectroscopy (STS) on the surface of
graphite in fields up to 12 Tesla. We find evidence of coexistence of massless
and massive DF, and identify the zero-energy LL which is a unique consequence
of their quantum-relativistic nature. Surprisingly these strictly
two-dimensional properties emerge even on bulk graphite in samples where the
interlayer coupling is weak.

mid-infrared phase variations of three short-period extrasolar planetary
systems: HD 209458, HD 179949 and 51 Peg. We gathered IRAC images in multiple
wavebands at eight phases of each planet's orbit. We find the uncertainty in
relative photometry from one epoch to the next to be significantly larger than
the photon counting error at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron. We are able to place
2-sigma upper limits of only 2% on the phase variations at these wavelengths.
At 8 micron the epoch-to-epoch systematic uncertainty is comparable to the
photon counting noise and we detect a phase function for HD 179949 which is in
phase with the planet's orbit and with a relative peak-to-trough amplitude of
0.00141(33). Assuming that HD 179949b has a radius R_J < R_p < 1.2R_J, it must
recirculate less than 21% of incident stellar energy to its night side at the
1-sigma level (where 50% signifies full recirculation). If the planet has a
small Bond albedo, it must have a mass less than 2.4 M_J (1-sigma). We do not
detect phase variations for the other two systems but we do place the following
2-sigma upper limits: 0.0007 for 51 Peg, and 0.0015 for HD 209458. Due to its
edge-on configuration, the upper limit for HD 209458 translates, with
appropriate assumptions about Bond albedo, into a lower limit on the
recirculation occuring in the planet's atmosphere. HD 209458b must recirculate
at least 32% of incident stellar energy to its night side, at the 1-sigma
level, which is consistent with other constraints on recirculation from the
depth of secondary eclipse depth at 8 micron and the low optical albedo. These
data indicate that different Hot Jupiter planets may experience different

of the recurrent nova RS Oph was observed twice with Chandra and once with
XMM-Newton. The observations were taken on days 39.7, 54.0, and 66.9 after
outburst. We confirm a 35-sec period on day 54.0 and found that it originates
from the SSS emission and not from the shock. We discus the bound-free
absorption by neutral elements in the line of sight, resonance absorption lines
plus self-absorbed emission line components, collisionally excited emission
lines from the shock, He-like intersystem lines, and spectral changes during an
episode of high-amplitude variability. We find a decrease of the oxygen K-shell
absorption edge that can be explained by photoionization of oxygen. The
absorption component has average velocities of -1286+-267 km/s on day 39.7 and
of -771+-65 km/s on day 66.9. The wavelengths of the emission line components
are consistent with their rest wavelengths as confirmed by measurements of
non-self absorbed He-like intersystem lines. We have evidence that these lines
originate from the shock rather than the outer layers of the outflow and may be
photoexcited in addition to collisional excitations. We found collisionally
excited emission lines that are fading at wavelengths shorter than 15A that
originate from the radiatively cooling shock. On day 39.5 we find a systematic
blue shift of -526+-114 km/s from these lines. We found anomalous He-like f/i
ratios which indicates either high densities or significant UV radiation near
the plasma where the emission lines are formed. During the phase of strong
variability the spectral hardness light curve overlies the total light curve
when shifted by 1000sec. This can be explained by photoionization of neutral
oxygen in the line of sight if the densities of order 10^{10}-10^{11} cm^{-3}.

This fact is promising for the further development of techniques for the

to maximize the spectral efficiency in the secondary system. A secondary
receiver observes a multiple access channel of two users, the secondary and the
primary transmitter, respectively. We show that, for spectrally-efficient
operation, the secondary system should apply Opportunistic Interference
Cancellation (OIC). With OIC, the secondary system decodes the primary signal
when such an opportunity is created by the primary rate and the power received
from the primary system. For such an operation, we derive the achievable data
rate in the secondary system. When the primary signal is decodable, we devise a
method, based on superposition coding, by which the secondary system can
achieve the maximal possible rate. Finally, we investigate the power allocation

temperatures dilute magnetic moments embedded in graphene can order into a
state analogous to that of a dilute antiferromagnet. We find that in the
undoped case one expects no net magnetic moment, and demonstrate numerically
that this effect generalizes to ribbons where the magnetic response is
strongest at the edge, suggesting the possibility of an unusual spin-transfer
device. For doped graphene we find that moments at definite lattice sites
interact over longer distances than those placed in interstitial sites of the

suppressed in the latter due to the absence of backscattering.

outburst in 1995 and gradually faded afterwards. Its eruption resembled the
well-known FU Orionis-type or EX Lupi-type outbursts. Since very few such
events have ever been documented at infrared wavelengths, our aim is to study
the temporal evolution of OO Ser in the infrared. OO Ser was monitored with the
Infrared Space Observatory starting 4 months after peak brightness and covering
20 months. In 2004-2006 we again observed OO Ser from the ground and
complemented this dataset with archival Spitzer obsevations also from 2004. We
analysed these data with special attention to source confusion and constructed
light curves at 10 different wavelengths as well as spectral energy
distributions. The outburst caused brightening in the whole infrared regime.
According to the infrared light curves, OO Ser started a wavelength-independent
fading after peak brightness. Later the flux decay became slower but stayed
wavelength-independent. The fading is still ongoing, and current fading rates
indicate that OO Ser will not return to quiescent state before 2011. The
outburst timescale of OO Ser seems to be shorter than that of FUors, but longer
than that of EXors. The outburst timescale and the moderate luminosity suggest
that OO Ser is different from both FUors and EXors, and shows similarities to
the recently erupted young star V1647 Ori. Based on its spectral energy
distribution and bolometric temperature, OO Ser seems to be an early class I
object, with an age of < 10^5 yr. The object is probably surrounded by an
accretion disc and a dense envelope. Due to the shorter outburst timescales,
the viscosity in the circumstellar disc of OO Ser is probably an order of
magnitude higher than usual for FUors.

their predictions of the evolution of the mean cosmic flux decrement, D_A, to
measurements of this quantity based on observations. To this end, we use data
available in the literature and our own measurements of the cosmic flux
decrement for 25 quasars in the redshift range 2.71 < z < 5.41 taken from the
SDSS Data Release 5. In order to perform the measurements of D_A, we fit a
power-law to the continuum redward of the Lya emission line, and extrapolate
this fit to region blueward of it, where the flux is severely affected by
absorption due to intervening HI absorbers. We compute, using numerical
simulations, the redshift evolution of D_A accounting for the presence of Lya
Forest absorbers and Lyman limit systems randomly distributed along the
line-of-sight, and compute its intrinsic scatter at the 1-, 2-, and 3-sigma
level due to fluctuations in the absorber properties (column density, Doppler
parameter, redshift) along different lines-of-sight. The numerical simulations
consist of Monte Carlo realizations of distributions of the absorber properties
constrained from observations. The results from the models considered here
confirm our theoretical expectation that the distribution of D_A at any given
redshift be well described by a lognormal distribution function. This implies
that the effective optical depth, usually defined as the negative logarithm of
the average flux, 1 - D_A, is very accurately Gaussian distributed, in contrast
to previous studies. This result is independent to the form of the input
distribution functions, and rather insensitive to the presence of high-column
density absorbers, such as the Lyman limit systems.

X-ray burster of which only two bursts have been recorded: an ordinary short
type I X-ray burst, and a 15 min long burst. An upper limit to its distance is
estimated to about 14.5 kpc. The broad-band spectrum of the persistent emission
in the 0.3-100 keV energy band obtained using contemporaneous INTEGRAL and
XMM-Newton data indicates a bolometric flux of 1.1x10^-10 erg/cm2/s

also have UV and IR data from GALEX and GOODS-Spitzer respectively.
  Our main finding is that there is good agreement between the extinction
corrected SFR(UV) and the SFR(X), and we confirm the use of X-ray luminosities
as a trustful tracer of recent star formation activity. Nevertheless, at
SFR(UV) larger than about 5Msol/year there are several galaxies with an excess
of SFR(X) suggesting the presence of an obscured AGN not detected in the
optical spectra. We conclude that the IR luminosity is driven by recent star
formation even in those galaxies where the SFR(X) is an order of magnitude
higher than the SFR(UV) and therefore may harbour an AGN. One object shows
SFR(X) much lower than expected based on the SFR(UV); this SFR(X) `deficit' may
be due to an early transient phase before most of the massive X-ray binaries
were formed. An X-ray deficit could be used to select extremely young bursts in
an early phase just after the explosion of the first supernovae associated with
massive stars and before the onset of massive X-ray binaries.

system; its equilibrium is based on a balance of two thermodynamic forces, one
related to the incoming pumping power and another to the emitted light. The
basic expression for such equilibrium is a logistic map, graphical solutions to
which are pitchfork bifurcation diagrams. As pumping force increases, the
relative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unity
correspondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum of
the up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point. Even
in a simple case of 2-level laser with only 2 possible transition types (up and
down), the spectra look like sets of the line packets, starting well before the
population inversion. This effect is an independent confirmation of the
Einstein's prohibition on practical realization of 2-level laser. Multilevel
lasers may be approached by employing the idea of thermodynamic activity for
the emitting atoms. Considering coefficient of thermodynamic activity of the
lasing level atoms to be proportional to the ratio of life times on the upper
and lasing (the 3d) levels, one can derive a new basic map for the multilevel
laser system. For a modest ratio only of 0.01, spontaneous transitions between
levels are pushed to the area beyond population inversion, opening a space for
the functioning of laser.

Coalsack. Analyzed together with multiband polarization data from the
literature, probing the Chamaeleon I, Musca, rho Opiuchus, R CrA and Taurus
clouds, we show that the wavelength of maximum polarization (lambda_max) is
linearly correlated with the radiation environment of the grains. Using
Far-Infrared emission data, we show that the large scatter seen in previous
studies of lambda_max as a function of A_V is primarily due to line of sight
effects causing some A_V measurements to not be a good tracer of the extinction
(radiation field strength) seen by the grains being probed. The derived slopes
in lambda_max vs. A_V, for the individual clouds, are consistent with a common
value, while the zero intercepts scale with the average values of the ratios of
total-to-selective extinction (R_V) for the individual clouds. Within each
cloud we do not find direct correlations between lambda_max and R_V. The
positive slope in consistent with recent developments in theory and indicating
alignment driven by the radiation field. The present data cannot conclusively
differentiate between direct radiative torques and alignment driven by H_2
formation. However, the small values of lambda_max(A_V=0), seen in several
clouds, suggest a role for the latter, at least at the cloud surfaces. The
scatter in the lambda_max vs. A_V relation is found to be associated with the
characteristics of the embedded Young Stellar Objects (YSO) in the clouds. We
propose that this is partially due to locally increased plasma damping of the
grain rotation caused by X-rays from the YSOs.

good entanglement measure. By using partial entropy, we firstly introduce the
Combinatorial Entropy of Fully entangled states (CEF) which can be used to
quantify entanglement for any fully entangled pure states. In order to quantify
entanglement for any multipartite states we also need another concept the
Entanglement Combination (EC) which can be used to completely describe the
entanglement between any parties of the given quantum states. Combining CEF
with EC, we define the Combinatorial Entropy (CE) for any multipartite pure
states and present some nice properties which indicate CE is a good
entanglement measure. Finally, we point out the feasibility of extending these
three concepts to mixed quantum states.

Design. The cells are fixed on a 2D grid and exchange ""chemicals"" with their
neighbors during the growth process. The quantity of chemicals that a cell
produces, as well as the differentiation value of the cell in the phenotype,
are controlled by a Neural Network (the genotype) that takes as inputs the
chemicals produced by the neighboring cells at the previous time step. In the
proposed model, the number of iterations of the growth process is not
pre-determined, but emerges during evolution: only organisms for which the
growth process stabilizes give a phenotype (the stable state), others are
declared nonviable. The optimization of the controller is done using the NEAT
algorithm, that optimizes both the topology and the weights of the Neural
Networks. Though each cell only receives local information from its neighbors,
the experimental results of the proposed approach on the 'flags' problems (the
phenotype must match a given 2D pattern) are almost as good as those of a
direct regression approach using the same model with global information.
Moreover, the resulting multi-cellular organisms exhibit almost perfect
self-healing characteristics.

gravity by means of large-scale clustering of galaxies. We measure the power
spectrum and the bispectrum of Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies and compare
the result with predictions in an empirical model of modified gravity. Our
model assumes an additional Yukawa-like term with two parameters that
characterize the amplitude and the length scale of the modified gravity. The
model predictions are calculated using two methods; the second-order
perturbation theory and direct N-body simulations. These methods allow us to
study non-linear evolution of large-scale structure. Using the simulation
results, we find that perturbation theory provides reliable estimates for the
power spectrum and the bispectrum in the modified Newtonian model. We also
construct mock galaxy catalogues from the simulations, and derive constraints
on the amplitude and the length scale of deviations from Newtonian gravity. The
resulting constraints from power spectrum are consistent with those obtained in
our earlier work, indicating the validity of the previous empirical modeling of
gravitational nonlinearity in the modified Newtonian model. If linear biasing
is adopted, the bispectrum of the SDSS galaxies yields constraints very similar
to those from the power spectrum. If we allow for the nonlinear biasing
instead, we find that the ratio of the quadratic to linear biasing
coefficients, b_2/b_1, should satisfy -0.4 < b_2/b_1<0.3 in the modified
Newtonian model.
