Many are
indistinguishable from point lens light curves. Of those that deviate from the
point lens form, caustic crossing light curves have tended to dominate
identified binary lens events. Other distinctive signatures of binary lenses
include significant asymmetry, multiple peaks, and repeating events. We have
quantified, using high resolution simulations, the theoretically expected
relative numbers of each type of binary lens event, based on its measurable
characteristics. We find that a microlensing survey with current levels of
photometric uncertainty and sampling should find at least as many non-caustic
crossing binary lens events as caustic crossing events; in future surveys with
more sensitive photometry, the contribution of distinctive non-caustic crossing
events will be even greater. To try to explain why caustic crossing light
curves appear to be so dominant among the published binary lensing events, we
investigate the influence of several physical effects, including blending,
sampling rate, and various binary populations.

coupling that supports propagating edge states and is not adiabatically
connected to the ordinary insulator. In several ways it is a spin-orbit-induced
analogue in time-reversal-invariant systems of the integer quantum Hall effect
(IQHE). This paper studies the topological insulator phase in disordered
two-dimensional systems, using a model graphene Hamiltonian introduced by Kane
and Mele as an example. The nonperturbative definition of a topological
insulator given here is distinct from previous efforts in that it involves
boundary phase twists that couple only to charge, does not refer to edge
states, and can be measured by pumping cycles of ordinary charge. In this
definition, the phase of a Slater determinant of electronic states is
determined by a Chern parity analogous to Chern number in the IQHE case.
Numerically we find, in agreement with recent network model studies, that the
direct transition between ordinary and topological insulators that occurs in
band structures is a consequence of the perfect crystalline lattice.
Generically these two phases are separated by a metallic phase, which is
allowed in two dimensions when spin-orbit coupling is present. The same
approach can be used to study three-dimensional topological insulators.

not all of the degrees of freedom in an experimental system are accessible to
forcing. We find that certain Lagrange multipliers take on a fundamental
physical role as the efficiency of the forcing function and the effective
forcing experienced by the degrees of freedom which are not forced directly.
Furthermore, we find that the product of the displacement of nearby
trajectories and the effective total forcing function is a conserved quantity.

constrain the curvature of the universe to be close to zero for a universe
dominated by a cosmological constant or dark energy with a constant equation of
state. Here we investigate the role of cosmic priors on deriving these tight
bounds on geometry, by considering a landscape motivated scenario with an
oscillating curvature term. We perform a likelihood analysis of current data
under such a model of non-trivial geometry and find that the uncertainties on
curvature, and correspondingly on parameters of the matter and dark energy
sectors, are larger. Future dark energy experiments together with CMB data from
experiments like Planck could dramatically improve our ability to constrain
cosmic curvature under such models enabling us to probe possible imprints of
quantum gravity.

  The first part is concerned with the study of ideals in the ring
$C^\infty(M,R)$ of smooth functions on a compact smooth manifold M or more
generally submodules of a finitely generated $C^\infty(M,R)$-module V. We
define a topology on the space of all submodules of V of a fixed finite
codimension d. Its main property is that it is compact Hausdorff and, in the
case of ideals in the ring itself, it contains as a subspace the configuration
space of d distinct unordered points in M and therefore gives a
""compactification"" of this configuration space. We present a concrete
description of this space for low codimensions.
  The main focus is then put on the second part which is concerned with a
generalization of Vassiliev's h-principle. This principle in its simplest form
asserts that the jet prolongation map $j^r:C^\infty(M,E)\to\Gamma(J^r(M,E))$,
defined on the space of smooth maps from a compact manifold M to a Euclidean
space E and with target the space of smooth sections of the jet bundle
$J^r(M,E)$, is a cohomology isomorphism when restricted to certain
""nonsingular"" subsets (these are defined in terms of a certain subset
$R\subseteq J^r(M,E)$). Our generalization then puts this theorem in a more
general setting of topological $C^\infty(M,R)$-modules. As a reward we get a
strengthening of this result asserting that all the homotopy fibres have zero
homology.

solitons travelling on the quasi-periodic background, the $n/t$-pane contains
$g+2$ areas where the perturbed solution is close to a finite-gap solution in

undergoes a continuous phase transition (in the Jacobian variety) and which
interpolates between these isospectral solutions. In the special case of the

recover the known result.

galaxy power spectrum as a function of redshift is a promising method to
constrain the equation-of-state parameter of the dark energy w. To measure the
scale of the BAO precisely, a substantial volume of space must be surveyed. We
test whether light-cone effects are important and whether the scaling relations
used to compensate for an incorrect reference cosmology are in this case
sufficiently accurate. We investigate the degeneracies in the cosmological
parameters and the benefits of using the two-dimensional anisotropic power
spectrum. Finally, we estimate the uncertainty with which w can be measured by
proposed surveys at redshifts of about z=3 and z=1, respectively.
  In the simulated survey we find that light-cone effects are small and that
the simple scaling relations used to correct for the cosmological distortion
work fairly well even for large survey volumes. The analysis of the
two-dimensional anisotropic power spectra enables an independent determination
to be made of the apparent scale of the BAO, perpendicular and parallel to the
line of sight. This is essential for two-parameter w-models, such as the
redshift-dependent dark energy model w=w_0+(1-a)w_a. Using Planck priors for
the matter and baryon density and Delta(H_0)=5% for the Hubble constant, we
estimate that the BAO measurements of future surveys around z=3 and z=1 will be
able to constrain, independently of other cosmological probes, a constant w to
~ 12% and ~ 11% (68% c.l.), respectively.

observed in HI in our Galaxy. Here we compare the distribution of HVCs observed
around our own Galaxy and extra-planar gas around the Andromeda galaxy to these
possible HVC analogs in a simulation of galaxy formation that naturally
generates these condensed clouds. We find a very good correspondence between
these observations and the simulation, in terms of number, angular size,
velocity distribution, overall flux and flux distribution of the clouds. We
show that condensed cloud accretion only accounts for ~ 0.2 M_solar / year of
the current overall Galactic accretion in the simulations. We also find that
the simulated halo clouds accelerate and become more massive as they fall
toward the disk. The parameter space of the simulated clouds is consistent with
all of the observed HVC complexes that have distance constraints, except the
Magellanic Stream which is known to have a different origin. We also find that
nearly half of these simulated halo clouds would be indistinguishable from
lower-velocity gas and that this effect is strongest further from the disk of
the galaxy, thus indicating a possible missing population of HVCs. These
results indicate that the majority of HVCs are consistent with being infalling,
condensed clouds that are a remnant of Galaxy formation.

prescription how to implement the infrared cutoff $\mu$ in any loop integral

symmetries such as e.g. supersymmetry. We discuss the issue of gauge invariance
of effective actions in general and in particular when using background field
gauge. Our prescription for the IR cutoff (as any such prescription) breaks the
gauge symmetry. Using our prescription, we have explicitly computed, at one
loop, many terms of the Wilsonian effective action for general gauge theories,
involving bosonic and fermionic matter fields of arbitrary masses and in
arbitrary representations, exhibiting the non-gauge invariant (as well as the
gauge invariant) terms. However, for supersymmetric gauge theories all
non-gauge invariant terms cancel within each supermultiplet. This is strong
evidence that in supersymmetric gauge theories this indeed defines a Lorentz,
susy and gauge invariant Wilsonian effective action. As a byproduct, we obtain
the explicit one-loop Wilsonian couplings for all higher-derivative terms $F
D^{2n}F$ in the effective action of arbitrary supersymmetric gauge theories.

with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The cores are linearly coupled by

GPE split into subgaps. Symmetry breaking in two-component BEC solitons is
studied in cases of the attractive (AA) and repulsive (RR) nonlinearity in both
traps; the mixed situation, with repulsion in one trap and attraction in the
other (RA), is considered too. In all the cases, stable asymmetric solitons are
found, bifurcating from symmetric or antisymmetric ones (and destabilizing
them), in the AA and RR systems, respectively. In either case, bi-stability is
predicted, with a nonbifurcating stable branch, either antisymmetric or
symmetric, coexisting with asymmetric ones. Solitons destabilized by the
bifurcation tend to rearrange themselves into their stable asymmetric
counterparts. The impact of a phase mismatch, between the OLs in the two cores
is also studied. Also considered is a related model, for a binary BEC in a
single-core trap with the OL, assuming that the two species (representing
different spin states of the same atom) are coupled by linear interconversion.
In that case, the symmetry-breaking bifurcations in the AA and RR models switch
their character, if the inter-species nonlinear interaction becomes stronger
than the intra-species nonlinearity.

demonstrate that this is related to the interpretation of SN color excesses

indicator of a possible SNR/CO cloud interaction. Thus, G18.8+0.3 is likely to

deviation from previous surveys using quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) as
background sources. We find that the number density of C IV toward GRBs is
dN/dz(z~1.5)= 2.2 +2.8/-1.4, dN/dz(z~2.5)= 2.3 +1.8/-1.1 and dN/dz(z~3.5)= 1.1

along QSO sightlines. Furthermore, the distribution of equivalent widths of the
GRB and QSO samples are consistent with being drawn from the same parent
population. Although the results for Mg II and C IV absorbers along GRB
sightlines appear to contradict one another, we note that the surveys are
nearly disjoint: the C IV survey corresponds to higher redshift and more highly
ionized gas than the Mg II survey. Nevertheless, analysis on larger statistical

the determination of a characteristic length scale set by the spatial

evidence of the distorted current paths posited in theoretical simulations. We

r=-Rf_{,R}/f) while the accelerated attractor exists in the region 0<m<1. We
find that the equation of state w_DE of all such ``viable'' f(R) models

smaller than z_{c}. Using the observational data of Supernova Ia and Cosmic

several orders of magnitude smaller than unity in the region whose density is
much larger than the present cosmological density. The representative models

constructed to realize this idea. The CP violating phase does not vanish when
all Higgs masses become large. There are flavor changing neutral current (FCNC)
interactions mediated by neutral Higgs bosons at the tree level. However,
unlike general multi-Higgs models, the FCNC Yukawa couplings are fixed in terms
of the quark masses and CKM mixing angles. Implications for meson-anti-meson
mixing, including recent data on $D-\bar D$ mixing, and neutron electric dipole
moment (EDM) are studied. We find that the neutral Higgs boson masses can be at
the order of one hundred GeV. The neutron EDM can be close to the present
experimental upper bound.

Cen's mass ratio can be expected to be much less extreme than previously
thought, at q~0.07 rather than q~0.016. This relaxes the constraints on the

fully degenerate, and the mass of the accreting white dwarf no longer has to be
very close to the Chandrasekhar limit.

pulse-broadening time of 670$\pm$100 $\mu$s, and the implied strength of
scattering (scattering measure) is the lowest that is estimated towards the
Crab nebula from observations made so far. The sensitivity of the system is
largely dictated by the sky background, and our simple equipment is capable of
detecting pulses that are brighter than $\sim$9 kJy in amplitude. The brightest

  p. 1891-5","10.1109/ISIT.2007.4557497",,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  A key idea in coding for the broadcast channel (BC) is binning, in which the
transmitter encode information by selecting a codeword from an appropriate bin
(the messages are thus the bin indexes). This selection is normally done by
solving an appropriate (possibly difficult) combinatorial problem. Recently it
has been shown that binning for the Blackwell channel --a particular BC-- can
be done by iterative schemes based on Survey Propagation (SP). This method uses
decimation for SP and suffers a complexity of O(n^2). In this paper we propose
a new variation of the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, named Reinforced BP
algorithm, that turns BP into a solver. Our simulations show that this new
algorithm has complexity O(n log n). Using this new algorithm together with a
non-linear coding scheme, we can efficiently achieve rates close to the border
of the capacity region of the Blackwell channel.

`almost homogeneous'. We therefore study the problem of embedding an almost
homogeneous subset $X$ of a Hilbert space $H$ into a finite-dimensional
Euclidean space. In fact we show that if $X$ is a compact subset of a Banach

prevalent set of linear maps from $X$ into $\Re^N$ are almost bi-Lipschitz

from a Bayesian perspective. For a linear data model, a number of known and
novel reconstruction schemes, which differ in terms of the underlying signal
prior, data likelihood, and numerical inverse extra-regularization schemes are
derived and classified. The Bayesian methodology presented in this paper tries
to unify and extend the following methods: Wiener-filtering, Tikhonov
regularization, Ridge regression, Maximum Entropy, and inverse regularization
techniques. The inverse techniques considered here are the asymptotic
regularization, the Jacobi, Steepest Descent, Newton-Raphson,
Landweber-Fridman, and both linear and non-linear Krylov methods based on
Fletcher-Reeves, Polak-Ribiere, and Hestenes-Stiefel Conjugate Gradients. The
structures of the up-to-date highest-performing algorithms are presented, based
on an operator scheme, which permits one to exploit the power of fast Fourier
transforms. Using such an implementation of the generalized Wiener-filter in
the novel ARGO-software package, the different numerical schemes are
benchmarked with 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional problems including structured white
and Poissonian noise, data windowing and blurring effects. A novel numerical
Krylov scheme is shown to be superior in terms of performance and fidelity.
These fast inverse methods ultimately will enable the application of sampling
techniques to explore complex joint posterior distributions. We outline how the
space of the dark-matter density field, the peculiar velocity field, and the
power spectrum can jointly be investigated by a Gibbs-sampling process. Such a
method can be applied for the redshift distortions correction of the observed
galaxies and for time-reversal reconstructions of the initial density field.

and also have the necessary ingredients to solve two of the most outstanding
issues in cosmology: the origin of dark matter and baryonic matter. One of the
most attractive features of this framework is that the relevant physical
processes are related to interactions at the weak scale and therefore may be
tested in collider experiments in the near future. This is true for the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) as well as for its extension with the
addition of one singlet chiral superfield, the so-called nMSSM. It has been
recently shown that within the nMSSM an elegant solution to both the problem of
baryogenesis and dark matter may be found, that relies mostly on the mixing of
the singlet sector with the Higgs sector of the theory. In this work we review
the nMSSM model constraints from cosmology and present the associated collider
phenomenology at the LHC and the ILC. We show that the ILC will efficiently
probe the neutralino, chargino and Higgs sectors, allowing to confront
cosmological observations with computations based on collider measurements. We
also investigate the prospects for a direct detection of dark matter and the
constraints imposed by the current bounds of the electron electric dipole
moment in this model.

mas at 5 GHz. VSOP observations of the jet in 0836+710 at 1.6 and 5 GHz have

apply linear stability analysis to identify the oscillatory modes with modes of
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability that match the wavelengths of the structures

helical surface mode and a combination of the helical and elliptic body modes
of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Our results indicate that the jet is

Quasars projected onto the halos of nearer galaxies are encountered among the
multitude of quasars observed at various distances from us. Among them there
are quasars that are close to the galaxies not only in angular separation, but
also in redshift. Such quasar-galaxy pairs are called close pairs. We developed
further the hypothesis that such pairs appear, because the fluxer on the
nucleus of the more distant galaxy passes through halo globular clusters of the
nearer galaxy,resulting in magnification and splitting of the image of the
source that we interpret as a quasar. To corroborate this hypothesis, we
analyzed the distribution of quasars in the plane of the halos of these
galaxies. The quasars from close pairs were found to follow the density profile
of globular clusters in the halos of elliptical and spiral galaxies with slopes
of -1.5 and -2.4 for elliptical and spiral galaxies, respectively. This
suggests that quasars do not appear near galaxies by chance and that quasars
are associated with galaxies via halo globular clusters.

dwarf to be surrounded by a gaseous disc of metal-rich material, similar to the
recently discovered SDSSJ1228+1040. A photospheric Magnesium abundance of 0.3
times the solar value, determined from the observed MgII4481 absorption line,
implies that the white dwarf is accreting from the circumstellar material. The
absence of Balmer emission lines and of photospheric HeI4471 absorption
indicates that the accreted material is depleted in volatile elements and, by
analogy with SDSS1228+1040, may be the result of the tidal disruption of an
asteroid. Additional spectroscopy of the DAZ white dwarfs WD1337+705 and GD362
does not reveal CaII emission lines. GD362 is one of the few cool DAZ that
display strong infrared flux excess, thought to be originating in a
circumstellar dust disc, and its temperature is likely too low to sublimate
sufficient amounts of disc material to generate detectable CaII emission.
WD1337+705 is, as SDSS1228+1040 and SDSS1043+0855, moderately hot, but has the
lowest Mg abundance of those three stars, suggesting a possible correlation
between the photospheric Mg abundance and the equivalent width of the CaII
emission triplet. Our inspection of 7360 white dwarfs from SDSS DR4 fails to
unveil additional strong ""metal gas disc"" candidates, and implies that these
objects are rather rare.

external axial field B^0_z to produce remarkable amounts of the helicities. Any
regular time-dependency of the helicity could not be found. The resulting axial
alpha-effect is mainly due to the current helicity, the characteristic time

the Texas persistent object store. Since our final objective is to compare

performance results obtained by simulation for a given experiment have been
compared to the results obtained by benchmarking the real systems in the same

observed to be consistent, so it appears that simulation can be a reliable

to SiI, CaI and FeI observed for the first time in a QSO spectrum. We
investigate the nature of this absorber by comparing its properties with those
of different classes of absorbers (weak MgII, Damped Ly-alpha systems and local
interstellar clouds) and reproducing its ionization conditions with
photoionization models. The observed absorber belongs to the class of weak MgII
systems on the basis of its equivalent width, however the relative strength of
commonly observed transitions deviates significantly from those of the above
mentioned absorbers. A rough estimate of the probability to cross such a system
with a QSO line of sight is P~0.03. The presence of rare neutral transitions
suggests that the cloud is shielded by a large amount of neutral hydrogen. A
detailed comparison of the observed column densities with the average
properties of damped Ly-alpha systems and local interstellar cold clouds shows,
in particular, deficient MgII/MgI and CaII/CaI ratios in our cloud. The results
of photoionization models indicate that the cloud could be ionized by the UV
background. However, a simple model of a single cloud with uniform density
cannot reproduce the observed ionic abundance ratios, suggesting a more complex
density structure for the absorber. Supposing that ionization corrections are
negligible, the most puzzling result is the underabundance of magnesium with
respect to iron which is hard to explain both with nucleosynthesis and with
differential dust depletion. [Abridged]

two-body forces within the proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase
approximation (pnQRPA). We include the effects that come from the finite size
of a nucleon, from the higher-order terms of nucleonic weak currents, and from
the nucleon-nucleon short-range correlations. Most importantly, we improve on
the presently available calculations by replacing the rudimentary Jastrow
short-range correlations by the more advanced unitary correlation operator
method (UCOM). The UCOM corrected matrix elements turn out to be notably larger
in magnitude than the Jastrow corrected ones. This has drastic consequences for
the detectability of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the present and future double
beta experiments.

parameters from Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (SVZ) sum rules, making use of the
harmonic-oscillator potential model as an example. In this case, one knows the
exact solution for the polarization operator $\Pi(\mu)$, which allows one to
obtain both the OPE to any order and the spectrum of states. We start with the
OPE for $\Pi(\mu)$ and analyze the extraction of the square of the ground-state
wave function, $R\propto|\Psi_0(\vec r=0)|^2$, from an SVZ sum rule, setting
the mass of the ground state $E_0$ equal to its known value and treating the
effective continuum threshold as a fit parameter. We show that in a limited
``fiducial'' range of the Borel parameter there exists a solution for the
effective threshold which precisely reproduces the exact $\Pi(\mu)$ for any
value of $R$ within the range $0.7 \le R/R_0 \le 1.15$ ($R_0$ is the known
exact value). Thus, the value of $R$ extracted from the sum rule is determined
to a great extent by the contribution of the hadron continuum. Our main finding
is that in the cases where the hadron continuum is not known and is modeled by
an effective continuum threshold, the systematic uncertainties of the sum-rule
procedure cannot be controlled.

resolution Plateau de Bure observations of the 110 GHz 111-101 para-NH2D line

toward the core nucleus from 12 K down to 5.5 K resulting in an increase of a
factor of 50% in the estimated density of the core from the dust continuum if
compared with the estimates done with constant temperature of 8.75 K. We also
found a remarkably high abundance of deuterated ammonia with respect to the
ammonia abundance (50%+-20%), which proves the persistence of nitrogen bearing
molecules at very high densities (2e6 cm-3) and shows that high-resolution

impose constraints on planetary formation theories. We have recently proposed a
binary-object formation model based on the notion of chaos-assisted capture.
Here we present a more detailed analysis with calculations performed in the
spatial (three-dimensional) three- and four-body Hill approximations. It is
assumed that the potential binary partners are initially following heliocentric
Keplerian orbits and that their relative motion becomes perturbed as these
objects undergo close encounters. First, the mass, velocity, and orbital
element distribu- tions which favour binary formation are identified in the
circular and elliptical Hill limits. We then consider intruder scattering in
the circular Hill four-body problem and find that the chaos-assisted capture
mechanism is consistent with observed, apparently randomly distributed, binary
mutual orbit inclinations. It also predicts asymmetric distributions of
retrograde versus prograde orbits. The time-delay induced by chaos on particle
transport through the Hill sphere is analogous to the formation of a resonance
in a chemical reaction. Implications for binary formation rates are considered
and the 'fine-tuning' problem recently identified by Noll et al. (2007) is also
addressed.

now been small or poorly defined. The AMIGA project (Analysis of the

statistically useful sample of the most isolated galaxies in the local (z <
0.05) Universe. A suitable large sample for the AMIGA project already exists,
the Catalogue of Isolated Galaxies (CIG, Karachentseva 1973; 1050 galaxies),
and we use this sample as a starting point to refine and perform a better
quantification of its isolation properties. Digitised POSS-I E images were
analysed out to a minimum projected radius R > 0.5 Mpc around 950 CIG galaxies
(those within Vr = 1500 km s-1 were excluded). We identified all galaxy
candidates in each field brighter than B = 17.5 with a high degree of
confidence using the LMORPHO software. We generated a catalogue of
approximately 54 000 potential neighbours (redshifts exist for 30% of this
sample). Six hundred sixty-six galaxies pass and two hundred eighty-four fail
the original CIG isolation criterion. The available redshift data confirm that
our catalogue involves a largely background population rather than physically
associated neighbours. We find that the exclusion of neighbours within a factor
of four in size around each CIG galaxy, employed in the original isolation
criterion, corresponds to Delta Vr ~ 18000 km s-1 indicating that it was a
conservative limit. Galaxies in the CIG have been found to show different
degrees of isolation. We conclude that a quantitative measure of this is
mandatory. It will be the subject of future work based on the catalogue of
neighbours obtained here.

Hamiltonian derivation of the energy and the angular momenta of both
asymptotically flat and asymptotically AdS spacetimes in any dimension D bigger

asymptotic conditions of the metric and of its conjugate momentum. These
conditions happen to be achieved in ellipsoidal coordinates adapted to the
rotating solutions.The asymptotic symmetry algebra is found to be isomorphic
either to the Poincare algebra or to the so(D-1, 2) algebra, as expected. In
the asymptotically flat case, the boundary conditions involve a generalization
of the parity conditions, introduced by Regge and Teitelboim, which are
necessary to make the angular momenta finite. The charges are explicitly

Schroedinger equations arising in nonlinear optics. We discuss when the
solutions are global in time or blow-up in finite time. Some results, in
dependence of the data of the problem, are proved; in particular we give a
bound, depending on the coupling parameter, for the blow-up threshold.
