  Disk: Implications for Measuring Black Hole Spin","32 pages, 10 figures; accepted by ApJ",,"10.1086/527346",,"astro-ph",,"  We consider a simple Newtonian model of a steady accretion disk around a
black hole. The model is based on height-integrated hydrodynamic equations,
alpha-viscosity, and a pseudo-Newtonian potential that results in an innermost
stable circular orbit (ISCO) that closely approximates the one predicted by GR.
We find that the hydrodynamic models exhibit increasing deviations from the
standard disk model of Shakura & Sunyaev as disk thickness H/R or the value of
alpha increases. The latter is an analytical model in which the viscous torque
is assumed to vanish at the ISCO. We consider the implications of the results
for attempts to estimate black hole spin by using the standard disk model to
fit continuum spectra of black hole accretion disks. We find that the error in
the spin estimate is quite modest so long as H/R < 0.1 and alpha < 0.2. At
worst the error in the estimated value of the spin parameter is 0.1 for a
non-spinning black hole; the error is much less for a rapidly spinning hole. We
also consider the density and disk thickness contrast between the gas in the
disk and that inside the ISCO. The contrast needs to be large if black hole
spin is to be successfully estimated by fitting the relativistically-broadened
X-ray line profile of fluorescent iron emission from reflection off an
accretion disk. In our hydrodynamic models, the contrast in density and
thickness is low when H/R>0.1, sugesting that the iron line technique may be
most reliable in extemely thin disks. We caution that these results have been
obtained with a viscous hydrodynamic model and need to be confirmed with MHD
simulations of radiatively cooled thin disks.

each qubit in a codeword is subject to a general Hamiltonian interaction with
an independent bath. We first consider the scheme in the case of a trivial
single-qubit code, which provides useful insights into the workings of
continuous error correction and the difference between Markovian and
non-Markovian decoherence. We then study the model of a bit-flip code with each
qubit coupled to an independent bath qubit and subject to continuous
correction, and find its solution. We show that for sufficiently large
error-correction rates, the encoded state approximately follows an evolution of
the type of a single decohering qubit, but with an effectively decreased
coupling constant. The factor by which the coupling constant is decreased
scales quadratically with the error-correction rate. This is compared to the
case of Markovian noise, where the decoherence rate is effectively decreased by
a factor which scales only linearly with the rate of error correction. The
quadratic enhancement depends on the existence of a Zeno regime in the
Hamiltonian evolution which is absent in purely Markovian dynamics. We analyze
the range of validity of this result and identify two relevant time scales.
Finally, we extend the result to more general codes and argue that the
performance of continuous error correction will exhibit the same qualitative
characteristics.

PWN component of a 3''\times12'' size is elongated in the north-south
direction, with the pulsar close to its south end. This component is immersed
in a larger (20''\times40''), similarly elongated outer PWN component of lower
surface brightness. The elongated shape of the compact PWN can be explained by
the ram pressure confinement of the pulsar wind due to the supersonic motion of
the pulsar. The PWN spectrum fits a PL model with photon index of 1.4\pm0.1 and
0.5-8 keV luminosity of 4\times10^{32} ergs s^{-1}. The compact PWN appears to
be inside a large-scale (~4'\times4') emission more extended to the south of
the pulsar, i.e. in the direction of the alleged pulsar motion. To explain the
extended X-ray emission ahead of the moving pulsar, one has to invoke strong
intrinsic anisotropy of the pulsar wind or assume that this emission comes from
a relic PWN swept by the asymmetrical reverse SNR shock. The pulsar and its PWN
are located within the extent of the unidentified TeV source HESS J1809-193

FJ method is compared with Dirac method, the results show the two methods are
equivalent in the quantization of this system. And by the practical research in
this letter, it can be found that the FJ method is really simpler than the
Dirac method, namely, the FJ method obviates the need to distinguish primary

the FJ method is a more economical and effective method of quantization.

fields (method of canonical quantization). This general theory of quantized
fields has remained undisputed up to now. We show how the unmodified
Heisenberg-Pauli calculations make sense mathematically by using a theory of
generalized functions adapted to nonlinear operations. By providing an
appropriate mathematical setting, nonlinear generalized functions open doors
for their understanding but there remains presumably very hard technical
problems. (i) Domains of the interacting field operators: a priori the H-P
calculations give time dependent dense domains, what is not very convenient;
(ii) Calculations of the resulting matrix elements of the S operator: from the
unitarity of the S operator as a whole there are no longer ``infinities,'' but
a priori there is no other hope than heavy computer calculations; (iii)
Connection with renormalization theory: it should provide an approximation when
the coupling constant is small. The aim of this paper is to present, on the
grounds of a standard mathematical model of QFT (a self interacting scalar
boson field), a basis for improvement without significant prerequisites in
mathematics and physics. It is an attempt to use nonlinear generalized
functions in QFT, starting directly from the calculations made by physicists,
in the same way as they have already been used in classical mechanics and
general relativity.

effect the non-equivariant part of the former, we relate the answer to an

using the blackbody synchrotron radiation, sufficient event rates for

the decisive factors for the complexity of the algorithm. The radius problem

of decoding the real and imaginary parts of each jointly detected symbol
independently of each other, making use of the new lattice representation. We
further show by simulations that the new approach achieves 80% reduction in the
overall complexity compared to the conventional SD for a 2x2 system, and almost
50% reduction for the 4x4 and 6x6 cases, thus relaxing the requirements for

into active (blue) and quiescent (red) galaxies. Our measurements of the K-LFs
and LD evolution support the idea that a large fraction of galaxies is already
assembled at $z\sim 1.2$. Based on the analysis of the evolution of the stellar
mass-to-light ratio (in K-band) for the spectroscopic sub-sample, we derive the
stellar mass density for the entire sample. We find that the global evolution
of the stellar mass density is well reproduced by the star formation rate
derived from UV dust corrected measurements. Over the last 8Gyrs, we observe
that the stellar mass density of the active population remains approximately
constant while it gradually increases for the quiescent population over the
same timescale. As a consequence, the growth of the stellar mass in the
quiescent population must be due to the shutoff of star formation in active
galaxies that migrate into the quiescent population. From $z=2$ to $z=1.2$, we
observe a major build-up of the quiescent population with an increase by a
factor of 10 in stellar mass, suggesting that we are observing the epoch when
an increasing fraction of galaxies are ending their star formation activity and
start to build up the red sequence.

light curves covering a normal (July 2000) and a low-amplitude (August 2002)
outburst to derive maps of the disk surface brightness distribution at
different phases along the outburst cycles. The sequence of eclipse maps of the
2000 July outburst reveal that the disk shrinks at outburst onset while an
uneclipsed component of 13 per cent of the total light develops. The derived
radial intensity distributions suggest the presence of an outward-moving
heating wave during rise and of an inward-moving cooling wave during decline.
The inferred speed of the outward-moving heating wave is ~ 1.6 km/s, while the
speed of the cooling wave is a fraction of that. A comparison of the measured
cooling wave velocity on consecutive nights indicates that the cooling wave
accelerates as it travels towards disk center, in contradiction with the
prediction of the disk instability model. From the inferred speed of the
heating wave we derive a viscosity parameter alpha_{hot} ~ 0.13, comparable to
the measured viscosity parameter in quiescence. The 2002 August outburst had
lower amplitude (\Delta B ~ 0.8 mag) and the disk at outburst maximum was
smaller than on 2000 July. For an assumed distance of 92 pc, we find that along
both outbursts the disk brightness temperatures remain below the minimum
expected according to the disk instability model. The results suggest that the
outbursts of V2051 Oph are caused by bursts of increased mass transfer from the

extrinsic curvature of the brane to the curvature in the bulk, with respect to
the mean extrinsic curvature. The latter corresponds to formulating an explicit
junction condition on the mean of the extrinsic curvature, analogue to the
Israel junction condition for the jump of the extrinsic curvature. We find that
there appears a new type of an effective anisotropic fluid on the right-hand

energy in the vortical and wave modes of a 3D rotating stratified fluid as a
function of $\epsilon = f/N$. Working in regimes characterized by moderate
Burger numbers, i.e. $Bu = 1/\epsilon^2 < 1$ or $Bu \ge 1$, our results
indicate profound change in the character of vortical and wave mode
interactions with respect to $Bu = 1$. As with the reference state of
$\epsilon=1$, for $\epsilon < 1$ the wave mode energy saturates quite quickly
and the ensuing forward cascade continues to act as an efficient means of
dissipating ageostrophic energy. Further, these saturated spectra steepen as
$\epsilon$ decreases: we see a shift from $k^{-1}$ to $k^{-5/3}$ scaling for
$k_f < k < k_d$ (where $k_f$ and $k_d$ are the forcing and dissipation scales,
respectively). On the other hand, when $\epsilon > 1$ the wave mode energy
never saturates and comes to dominate the total energy in the system. In fact,
in a sense the wave modes behave in an asymmetric manner about $\epsilon = 1$.
With regard to the vortical modes, for $\epsilon \le 1$, the signatures of 3D
quasigeostrophy are clearly evident. Specifically, we see a $k^{-3}$ scaling
for $k_f < k < k_d$ and, in accord with an inverse transfer of energy, the
vortical mode energy never saturates but rather increases for all $k < k_f$. In
contrast, for $\epsilon > 1$ and increasing, the vortical modes contain a
progressively smaller fraction of the total energy indicating that the 3D
quasigeostrophic subsystem plays an energetically smaller role in the overall
dynamics.

Cosmology is not even astrophysics: all the principal assumptions in this field
are unverified (or unverifiable) in the laboratory, and researchers are quite
comfortable with inventing unknowns to explain the unknown. How then could,
after fifty years of failed attempt in finding dark matter, the fields of dark
matter {\it and now} dark energy have become such lofty priorities in astronomy
funding, to the detriment of all other branches of astronomy? I demonstrate in

embedding of the 3-brane in the bulk. A large number of independent
observations have shown that the rotational velocities of test particles
gravitating around galaxies tend, as a function of the distance from the

velocity, the general solution of the vacuum gravitational field equations on

the explicit form of the projections of the bulk Weyl tensor on the brane, and
the equation of state of the dark pressure as a function of the dark radiation.

in the Bright Star Catalog, while it is more probably on the main-sequence or
at the beginning of the subgiant branch. We performed an extensive analysis of

its external parameters and internal structure. We first reviewed the
observational constraints on the metallicity, the gravity and the effective
temperature derived from the spectroscopic observations of HD 52265. We also
derived its luminosity using the Hipparcos parallax. We computed the
evolutionary tracks for models of various metallicities which cross the

tests. The possible models for HD 52265, which satisfy the constraints derived
from the spectroscopic observations, are different in both their external and
internal parameters. They lie either on the main sequence or at the beginning
of the subgiant branch. The differences in the models lead to quite different
properties of their oscillation frequencies. We give evidences of an
interesting specific behaviour of these frequencies in case of helium-rich
cores: the ``small separations'' may become negative and give constraints on

metal/superconductor (N/S) junctions where a superconductor has even-frequency
symmetry in the bulk and a normal metal layer has an arbitrary length. Using
the quasiclassical Green's function formalism, we demonstrate that, quite
generally, the pair amplitude in the junction has an admixture of an
odd-frequency component due to the breakdown of translational invariance near
the N/S interface where the pair potential acquires spatial dependence. If a
superconductor has even-parity pair potential (spin-singlet s-wave state), the
odd-frequency pairing component with odd-parity is induced near the N/S
interface, while in the case of odd-parity pair potential (spin-triplet
$p_{x}$-wave or spin-singlet $d_{xy}$-wave) the odd-frequency component with

Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), we have traced 123 pairs of opposite
magnetic polarity moving magnetic features (MMFs) in three active regions NOAA
ARs 8375, 0330 and 9575. At the time of observation, AR 8375 was young, AR 0330
mature, and AR 9575 decaying. The vertical velocity indicates that the elements
of MMF pairs with polarity opposite to that of the sunspot support a downflow
of around 50-100 m s$^{-1}$. The average Doppler shift difference between
negative and positive elements of an MMF pair is about 150 m s$^{-1}$ in AR
8375, 100 m s$^{-1}$ in AR 0330, and 20 m s$^{-1}$ in AR 9575. These
observational results are in agreement with the model that MMF pairs are part
of a U-loop emanating from the sunspot's magnetic canopy. According to this
model the downflow is caused by the Evershed flow returning below the solar
surface. For AR 8375, the horizontal velocity of MMFs ranges from 0.1 km
s$^{-1}$ to 0.7 km s$^{-1}$, and on average, the velocity of an MMF pair
decreases significantly (from 0.6 km s$^{-1}$ to 0.35 km s$^{-1}$) with
increasing distance from the MMF's birth place. This result suggests that the
change in MMF flow speed does not reflect the radial structure of the moat
flow, but rather is intrinsic to the evolution of the MMF pairs. This result is
also in agreement with the U-loop model of MMF pairs. We also find that
properties of MMF pairs, most strikingly the lifetime, depend on the evolution
stages of the parent sunspot. The mean lifetimes of MMF pairs in ARs 9575 and
0330 are 0.7 hours and 1.6 hours, respectively, which is considerably shorter
than the 4 hours lifetime previously found for AR 8375.

eclipsing binary millisecond pulsar system PSR B1957+20. Combining previous
data and new data points at minimum from the Hubble Space Telescope, we have
100% coverage in the R-band. We also have a number of new K_s-band data points,
which we use to constrain the infrared magnitude of the system. We model this
with the Eclipsing Light Curve code (ELC). From the modelling with the ELC code
we obtain colour information about the secondary at minimum light in BVRI and
K. For our best fit model we are able to constrain the system inclination to 65
+/- 2 degrees for pulsar masses ranging from 1.3 -- 1.9 M_sun. The pulsar mass
is unconstrained. We also find that the secondary star is not filling its Roche
lobe. The temperature of the un-irradiated side of the companion is in
agreement with previous estimates and we find that the observed temperature
gradient across the secondary star is physically sustainable.

clouds over the SIRTA observatory between 2002 and 2006 with multiple
tropopauses (MT) retrieved from radiosounding temperature profiles. The
temporal variability of MT properties (frequency, thickness) are discussed.
Results show a marked annual cycle, with MT frequency reaching its lowest point
in May (~18% occurrence of MT) and slowly rising to more than 40% in DJF. The
average thickness of the MT also follows an annual cycle, going from less than
1 km in spring to 1.5 km in late autumn. Comparison with lidar observations
show that cirrus clouds show a preference for being located close below the 1st
tropopause. When the cloud top is above the 1st tropopause (7% of
observations), in 20% of cases the cloud base is above it as well, resulting in
a cirrus cloud ""sandwiched"" between the two tropopauses. Compared to the
general distribution of cirrus, cross-tropopause cirrus show a higher frequency
of large optical depths, while inter-tropopause cirrus show almost exclusively
low optical depths (Tau < 0.03 in 90% of cases) typical of subvisible clouds.
Results suggest the occurrence of inter-tropopause cirrus clouds is correlated
with the frequency of multiple tropopauses.

(waveform)implementations of this framework based on understanding, element by
element, the physics behind each feature of the waveform, and on systematically
comparing various EOB-based waveforms with ``exact'' waveforms obtained by
numerical relativity approaches. The present paper focuses on small-mass-ratio
non-spinning binary systems, which can be conveniently studied by
Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-type methods. Our results include: (i) a resummed,
3PN-accurate description of the inspiral waveform, (ii) a better description of
radiation reaction during the plunge, (iii) a refined analytic expression for
the plunge waveform, (iv) an improved treatment of the matching between the
plunge and ring-down waveforms. This improved implementation of the EOB
approach allows us to construct complete analytic waveforms which exhibit a
remarkable agreement with the ``exact'' ones in modulus, frequency and phase.
In particular, the analytic and numerical waveforms stay in phase, during the
whole process, within $\pm 1.1 %$ of a cycle. We expect that the extension of
our methodology to the comparable-mass case will be able to generate comparably
accurate analytic waveforms of direct use for the ground-based network of
interferometric detectors of gravitational waves.

with -21 < M(B) -5 log h < -18 mag. and 0.010 < z < 0.123 drawn from the
Millennium Galaxy Catalogue. Our findings are that:
  (i) Galaxies in close pairs are generally more asymmetric than isolated
galaxies and the degree of asymmetry increases for closer pairs. At least 35%
of close pairs (with projected separation of less than 20 h^{-1} kpc and
velocity difference of less than 500 km s^{-1}) show significant asymmetry and
are therefore likely to be physically bound.
  (ii) Among asymmetric galaxies, we find that at least 80% are either
interacting systems or merger remnants. However, a significant fraction of
galaxies initially identified as asymmetric are contaminated by nearby stars or
are fragmented by the source extraction algorithm. Merger rates calculated via
asymmetry indices need careful attention in order to remove the above sources
of contamination, but are very reliable once this is carried out.
  (iii) Close pairs and asymmetries represent two complementary methods of
measuring the merger rate. Galaxies in close pairs identify future mergers,
occurring within the dynamical friction timescale, while asymmetries are
sensitive to the immediate pre-merger phase and identify remnants.
  (iv) The merger fraction derived via the close pair fraction and asymmetries
is about 2% for a merger rate of (5.2 +- 1.0) 10^{-4} h^3 Mpc^{-3} Gyr^{-1}.
These results are marginally consistent with theoretical simulations (depending
on the merger time-scale), but imply a flat evolution of the merger rate with
redshift up to z ~1.

determine the order of the phase transitions. In the case of strong Yukawa
couplings the model effectively becomes an O(4)-symmetric non-linear
sigma-model for all values of the quartic coupling constant. This leads to the
existence of a symmetric phase also in the regime of large values of the Yukawa
coupling constant. On finite and small lattices, however, strong finite volume
effects prevent the expectation value of the Higgs field from vanishing thus
obscuring the existence of the symmetric phase at strong Yukawa couplings.

parameters are consistent with the previous results, but with much better
accuracy. In previous study, it was assumed that the shape of the observed
luminosity function of Fanaroff-Riley type II radio galaxies is the same with
the intrinsic luminosity function of radio loud quasars. Our results prove the
validity of this assumption. We also find that low and high redshift groups
divided by z=0.1 are likely to be from different parent populations.

  crystals: The specific heat of bismuth","4 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the specific heat $C$
of insulators and semiconductors because of the availability of samples with
different isotopic masses and the possibility of performing \textit{ab initio}
calculations of its temperature dependence $C(T)$ using as a starting point the
electronic band structure. Most of the crystals investigated are elemental
(e.g., germanium) or binary (e.g., gallium nitride) semiconductors. The initial
electronic calculations were performed in the local density approximation and
did not include spin-orbit interaction. Agreement between experimental and
calculated results was usually found to be good, except for crystals containing
heavy atoms (e.g., PbS) for which discrepancies of the order of 20% existed at
the low temperature maximum found for $C/T^3$. It has been conjectured that
this discrepancies result from the neglect of spin-orbit interaction which is
large for heavy atoms ($\Delta_0\sim$1.3eV for the $p$ valence electrons of
atomic lead). Here we discuss measurements and \textit{ab initio} calculations
of $C(T)$ for crystalline bismuth ($\Delta_0\sim$1.7 eV), strictly speaking a
semimetal but in the temperature region accessible to us ($T >$ 2K) acting as a
semiconductor. We extend experimental data available in the literature and
notice that the \textit{ab initio} calculations without spin-orbit interaction
exhibit a maximum at $\sim$8K, about 20% lower than the measured one. Inclusion
of spin-orbit interaction decreases the discrepancy markedly: The maximum of
$C(T)$ is now only 7% larger than the measured one. Exact agreement is obtained
if the spin-orbit hamiltonian is reduced by a factor of $\sim$0.8.

parsec-scale jets derived from VLBI observations and again find no evidence for
systematic alignments. Finally, we have investigated the correlation between
the polarization position angle and those of the parsec-scale jets. As
expected, we find that there is a tendency for the polarization angles to be
perpendicular to the jet angles. However, the difference in jet and
polarization position angles does not show any systematic trend in different
parts of the sky.

intuitional and visual method to deal with their discrimination problem.
Secondly, we consider the condition for perfect discrimination of two quantum

distinguishable if and only if their characteristic vectors are orthogonal.

Economic
systems with power law distribution in the wealth is one of the examples. To
better understand the working behind the complexity, we undertook an empirical
study measuring the interactions between market participants. A Web server was
setup to administer the exchange of futures contracts whose liquidation prices
were coupled to event outcomes. After free registration, participants started
trading to compete for the money prizes upon maturity of the futures contracts
at the end of the experiment. The evolving `cash' flow network was
reconstructed from the transactions between players. We show that the network
topology is hierarchical, disassortative and scale-free with a power law
exponent of 1.02+-0.09 in the degree distribution. The small-world property
emerged early in the experiment while the number of participants was still
small. We also show power law distributions of the net incomes and
inter-transaction time intervals. Big winners and losers are associated with
high degree, high betweenness centrality, low clustering coefficient and low
degree-correlation. We identify communities in the network as groups of the
like-minded. The distribution of the community sizes is shown to be power-law
distributed with an exponent of 1.19+-0.16.

self-gravitating systems formed through the dissipationless collapse of N-point
sources. We explore the effects of resolution in mass and length on the growth
of triaxial structures formed by an instability triggered by an excess of
radial orbits. We point out that as resolution increases, the equilibria shift,
from mildly prolate, to oblate. A number of particles N ~= 100000 or larger is
required for convergence of axial aspect ratios. An upper bound for the
softening, e ~ 1/256, is also identified. We then study the properties of a set
of equilibria formed from scale-free cold initial mass distributions, ro ~ r^-g
with 0 <= g <= 2. Oblateness is enhanced for initially more peaked structures
(larger values of g). We map the run of density in space and find no evidence
for a power-law inner structure when g <= 3/2 down to a mass fraction <~0.1 per
cent of the total. However, when 3/2 < g <= 2, the mass profile in equilibrium
is well matched by a power law of index ~g out to a mass fraction ~ 10 per
cent. We interpret this in terms of less-effective violent relaxation for more
peaked profiles when more phase mixing takes place at the centre. We map out
the velocity field of the equilibria and note that at small radii the velocity
coarse-grained distribution function (DF) is Maxwellian to a very good
approximation.
