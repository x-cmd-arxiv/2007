condensation"" into a superconducting state. Helium atoms are preformed bosons
and, in addition to their condensed superfluid state, can also form a quantum
solid, lacking phase-coherence. Here we show that the fate of Cooper pairs can
be more varied than the BCS or helium paradigms. In copper-oxide d-wave
superconductors (dSC) Cooper pairs are intrinsically non-local objects, with
both center-of-mass and relative motions. As doping decreases, the center-of
mass fluctuations force a correlated dSC into a state with enhanced
diamagnetism and robust but short-ranged superconducting order. At extreme
underdoping, the relative fluctuations take over and two pseudogaps --
``small'' (charge) and ``large'' (spin) -- emerge naturally from the theory, as
Cooper pairs ``disintegrate'' and charge ``detaches'' from spin-singlet bonds.
The ensuing ground state(s) are governed by diagonal (mostly antiferromagnetic)
rather than by superconducting (off-diagonal) correlations. The theory is used
to account for several recent experiments and to draw general conclusions about
the phase diagram.

applications. Two of the main fields are the automotive and the home
entertainment sector. The POF can be applied in several different optical
communication systems as automotive multi-media busses or in-house Ethernet
systems.
  The requirements of bandwidth are increasing very fast in these sectors and
therefore solutions that satisfy these demands are of high actuality. One
solution is to use the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technique. Here,
several different wavelengths can carry information over one POF fiber. All
wavelengths that are transmitted over the fiber, must be separated at the
receiver to regain and redirect the information channels. These separators are
so-called Demultiplexers.
  There are several systems available on the market, which are all afflicted
with certain disadvantages. But all these solutions have one main disadvantage,
they are all too expensive for most of the applications mentioned above. So the
goal of this study is to develop an economical Demultiplexer for WDM
transmission over POF.
  The main idea is to separate the chromatic light in its monochromatic
components with the help of a prism with low reciprocal dispersive power. The
prism and the other assemblies, which are needed to adjust the optical path,
should be manufactured in injection molding technique. This manufacturing
technique is a very simple and economical way to produce a mass production

wavelengths using COBE/DIRBE data is limited by the accuracy to which
foreground interplanetary and Galactic dust emission can be modeled and
subtracted. Previous determinations of the far infrared CIB (e.g., Hauser et
al. 1998) were based on the detection of residual isotropic emission in skymaps
from which the emission from interplanetary dust and the neutral interstellar
medium were removed. In this paper we use the Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper (WHAM)
Northern Sky Survey as a tracer of the ionized medium to examine the effect of
this foreground component on determination of the CIB. We decompose the DIRBE
far infrared data for five high Galactic latitude regions into H I and H-alpha
correlated components and a residual component. We find the H-alpha correlated
component to be consistent with zero for each region, and we find that addition
of an H-alpha correlated component in modeling the foreground emission has
negligible effect on derived CIB results. Our CIB detections and 2 sigma upper
limits are essentially the same as those derived by Hauser et al. and are given
by nu I_nu (nW m-2 sr-1) < 75, < 32, 25 +- 8, and 13 +- 3 at 60, 100, 140, and
240 microns, respectively. Our residuals have not been subjected to a detailed
anisotropy test, so our CIB results do not supersede those of Hauser et al. We
derive upper limits on the 100 micron emissivity of the ionized medium that are
typically about 40% of the 100 micron emissivity of the neutral atomic medium.
This low value may be caused in part by a lower dust-to-gas mass ratio in the
ionized medium than in the neutral medium, and in part by a shortcoming of
using H-alpha intensity as a tracer of far infrared emission.

10^{40} erg/s in the 0.3-10 keV band (similar to the maximum luminosity found
by ASCA in 1995), and declined on an e-folding timescale ~ 3 days. The X-ray
spectrum is always dominated by a broad power-law-like component. When the
source is seen at X-ray luminosities ~ 10^{40} erg/s, an additional soft
thermal component (which we interpret as emission from the accretion disk)
contributes ~ 1/4 of the X-ray flux; when the luminosity is higher, ~ 3 x
10^{40} erg/s, the thermal component is not detected and must contribute < 10%
of the flux. At the beginning of the decline, ionized absorption is detected
around 0.5-2 keV; it is a possible signature of a massive outflow. The
power-law is always hard, with a photon index Gamma ~ 1.7 (and even flatter at
times), as is generally the case with bright ULXs. We speculate that this
source and perhaps most other bright ULXs are in a high/hard state: as the
accretion rate increases well above the Eddington limit, more and more power is
extracted from the inner region of the inflow through non-radiative channels,
and is used to power a Comptonizing corona, jet or wind. The observed thermal
component comes from the standard outer disk; the transition radius between
outer standard disk and Comptonizing inner region moves further out and to
lower disk temperatures as the accretion rate increases. This produces the
observed appearance of a large, cool disk. Based on X-ray luminosity and
spectral arguments, we suggest that this accreting black hole has a likely mass
~ 50-150 Msun (even without accounting for possible beaming).

and two pulse echoes in magnets when the distortion mechanism of single-pulse
echo formation is effective, and the absence of such analogy in the case of
lithium ferrite where the multipulse mechanism of single-pulse echo formation
is effective.
  It is shown also that the timing and frequency diagrams of magnetic pulse
influence on the two-pulse echo signals, corresponding to the symmetric and
asymmetric magnetic pulse applications in the studied magnets, are defined by
their domain walls parameters and could serve for their qualitative and
quantitative characterization.

  unicellular populations in static environments","27 pages, 4 figures",,,,"q-bio.PE q-bio.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper develops a mathematical model describing the influence that
conjugation-mediated Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) has on the
mutation-selection balance in an asexually reproducing population of
unicellular, prokaryotic organisms. It is assumed that mutation-selection
balance is reached in the presence of a fixed background concentration of
antibiotic, to which the population must become resistant in order to survive.
We analyze the behavior of the model in the limit of low and high
antibiotic-induced first-order death rate constants, and find that the highest
mean fitness is obtained at low rates of bacterial conjugation. As the rate of
conjugation crosses a threshold, the mean fitness decreases to a minimum, and
then rises asymptotically to a limiting value as the rate of conjugation
becomes infinitely large. However, this limiting value is smaller than the mean
fitness obtained in the limit of low conjugation rate. This dependence of the
mean fitness on the conjugation rate is fairly small for the parameter ranges
we have considered, and disappears as the first-order death rate constant due
to the presence of antibiotic approaches zero. For large values of the
antibiotic death rate constant, we have obtained an analytical solution for the
behavior of the mean fitness that agrees well with the results of simulations.
The results of this paper suggest that conjugation-mediated HGT has a slightly
deleterious effect on the mean fitness of a population at mutation-selection
balance. Therefore, we argue that HGT confers a selective advantage by allowing
for faster adaptation to a new or changing environment. The results of this
paper are consistent with the observation that HGT can be promoted by
environmental stresses on a population.

and biochemical networks is of critical importance in biology today. We sought
to develop a mathematical approach to this problem using, as a test case, one
of the most well-studied and clinically important signaling networks in biology
today, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) driven signaling cascade.
More specifically, we suggest a method, augmented sparse reconstruction, for
the identification of links among nodes of ordinary differential equation (ODE)
networks from a small set of trajectories with different initial conditions.
Our method builds a system of representation by using a collection of integrals
of all given trajectories and by attenuating block of terms in the
representation itself. The system of representation is then augmented with
random vectors, and minimization of the 1-norm is used to find sparse
representations for the dynamical interactions of each node. Augmentation by
random vectors is crucial, since sparsity alone is not able to handle the large
error-in-variables in the representation. Augmented sparse reconstruction
allows to consider potentially very large spaces of models and it is able to
detect with high accuracy the few relevant links among nodes, even when
moderate noise is added to the measured trajectories. After showing the
performance of our method on a model of the EGFR protein network, we sketch
briefly the potential future therapeutic applications of this approach.

the maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) rule for a linear vector channel can be
relaxed to a convex optimization problem, which is called a relaxed MLD
problem. The proposed decoding algorithm is based on a numerical optimization
technique so called interior point method with barrier function. Approximate
variations of the gradient descent and the Newton methods are used to solve the
convex optimization problem. In a decoding process of the proposed algorithm, a
search point always lies in the fundamental polytope defined based on a
low-density parity-check matrix. Compared with a convectional joint message
passing decoder, the proposed decoding algorithm achieves better BER
performance with less complexity in the case of partial response channels in
many cases.

critical exponent of the asymptotic growth rate of SS weight distribution
(corresponding to decoding performance) can be derived. It is shown that, in

hessence energies in Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC). Interestingly enough, we
find that there are some stable attractors in these two cases. In the case of
quintom, all stable attractors have the feature of decelerated expansion. In
the case of hessence, most of stable attractors have the feature of decelerated
expansion while one stable attractor can have decelerated or accelerated
expansion depend on the model parameter. In all cases, the equation-of-state
parameter (EoS) of all stable attractors are larger than -1 and there is no
singularity in the finite future. These results are different from the dynamics
of phantom in LQC, or the ones of phantom, quintom and hessence in classical
Einstein gravity.

Several schemes have been proposed for approximating number-resolving

divided into several segments, and the spectrum of each segment was fitted with
a three-component blackbody model, in which two components are affected by
partial covering and the third one is unaffected. A Gaussian emission line is
also included in the spectral model to represent the Fe Ka line at ~ 6.4 keV.
The fitted temperatures of the two partially covered components are about 2 keV
and 1 keV, while the uncovered component has a temperature of ~ 0.5-0.6 keV.
The equivalent blackbody emission radius of the hottest component is the
smallest and that of the coolest component is the biggest. During dips, the
fluxes of the two hot components are linearly correlated, while that of the
third component doesn't show any significant variation. The Fe line flux
remains constant within errors during the short dips. However, during the long
dips the line flux changes significantly and is positively correlated with the
fluxes of the two hot components. These results suggest: (1) the temperature of
the X-ray emitting region decreases with radius, (2) the Fe Ka line emitting
region is close to the hot continuum emitting region, and (3) the size of the
Fe line emitting region is bigger than the size of the obscuring matters
causing short dips but smaller than the sizes of those causing long dips.

to the Einstein-de Sitter universe at spatial and null infinities. We consider
two limiting mass accretion scenarios, no accretion and significant accretion.
We find that the radiation power strongly depends on not only the asymptotic
condition but also the mass accretion scenario. For the no accretion case, we
consider the Einstein-Straus solution, where a black hole of constant mass
resides in the dust Friedmann universe. We find negative cosmological
correction besides the expected redshift factor. This is given in terms of the
cubic root of ratio in size of the black hole to the cosmological horizon, so
that it is currently of order $10^{-5} (M/10^{6}M_{\odot})^{1/3} (t/14
{Gyr})^{-1/3}$ but could have been significant at the formation epoch of
primordial black holes. Due to the cosmological effects, this black hole has
not settled down to an equilibrium state. This cosmological correction may be
interpreted in an analogy with the radiation from a moving mirror in a flat
spacetime. For the significant accretion case, we consider the Sultana-Dyer
solution, where a black hole tends to increase its mass in proportion to the
cosmological scale factor. In this model, we find that the radiation power is
apparently the same as the Hawking radiation from the Schwarzschild black hole
of which mass is that of the growing mass at each moment. Hence, the energy
loss rate decreases and tends to vanish as time proceeds. Consequently, the
energy loss due to evaporation is insignificant compared to huge mass accretion
onto the black hole. Based on this model, we propose a definition of
quasi-equilibrium temperature for general conformal stationary black holes.

the $a_1$ are antisymmetric under the exchange of quark and anti-quark momentum
fractions in the SU(2) limit. The branching ratios for $a_1 \pi$ modes are
sensitive to tree--penguin interference. The resultant ${\cal B}(B^0 \to
a_1^\pm \pi^\mp)$ are in good agreement with the data. However, using the
current Cabibbo--Kobayashi--Maskawa angles, $\beta=22.0^\circ$ and
$\gamma=59.0^\circ$, our results for the mixing-induced parameter $S$ and
$\alpha_{\rm eff}$ differ from the measurements of the time-dependent CP
asymmetries in the decay $B^0\to a_1^\pm \pi^\mp$ at about the $3.7\sigma$

For $a_1 K$ modes, the annihilation topologies give sizable contributions and
are sensitive to the first Gegenbauer moment of the leading-twist tensor
(chiral-odd) distribution amplitude of the $a_1$ meson. The $B\to a_1 K$
amplitudes resemble the corresponding $B\to \pi K$ ones very much. Taking the
ratios of corresponding CP-averaged $a_1 K$ and $\pi K$ branching ratios, we
can extract information relevant to the electroweak penguins and annihilations.
The existence of new-physics in the electroweak penguin sector and final state

of its population of 21 pulsars, which is related to the high cluster density.
The distance of Terzan 5 is found to be d$_{\odot}$=5.5$\pm$0.9 kpc from the

a consequence, the higher cluster density is even more favourable for formation

from the plane. There is evidence that a significant fraction of the halo is

on the disc parameters derived from observational data, we have analyzed the
relativistic Bardeen-Petterson effect driven by a Kerr black hole as the
potential physical mechanism responsible for the disc warping. We found that
the Bardeen-Petterson radius is comparable to or smaller than the inner radius
of the maser disc (independent of the allowed value for the black hole spin
parameter). Numerical simulations for a wide range of physical conditions have
shown that the evolution of a misaligned disc due to the Bardeen-Petterson
torques usually produces an inner flat disc and a warped transition region with
a smooth gradient in the tilt and twist angles. Since this structure is similar
to that seen in NGC 4258, we propose that the Bardeen-Petterson effect may be
responsible for the disc warping in this galaxy. We estimated the time-scale
necessary for the disc inside of the Bardeen-Petterson radius to align with the
black hole's equator, as a function of the black hole spin. Our results show
that the Bardeen-Petterson effect can align the disc within a few billion years
in the case of NGC 4258. Finally, we show that if the observed curvature of the
outer anomalous arms in the galactic disc of NGC 4258 is associated with the
precession of its radio jet/counterjet, then the Bardeen-Petterson effect can
provide the required precession period.

classified according to their radial velocity and by verifying their
extended/point-source nature from ground-based optical images. Among the 48
observed candidates clusters we found 5 genuine remote globular clusters. One
of them has been already identified independently by Mackey et al. (2007),
their GC1; the other four are completely new discoveries: B516, B517, B518,
B519. The newly discovered clusters lie at projected distance 40 kpc<~R_p<~100
kpc from the center of M31, and have absolute integrated magnitude
-9.5<M_V<-7.5. For all the observed clusters we have measured the strongest
Lick indices and we have obtained spectroscopic metallicity estimates.
Mackey-GC1, Martin-GC1, B517 and B518 have spectra typical of old and metal
poor globular clusters ([Fe/H]<~ -1.3); B519 appears old but quite metal-rich
([Fe/H]~-0.5); B516 presents very strong Balmer absorption lines: if this is
indeed a cluster it should have a relatively young age (likely <2 Gyr). The
present analysis nearly doubles the number of M31 globulars at R_p> 40 kpc. At
odds with the Milky Way, M31 appears to have a significant population of very
bright globular clusters in its extreme outskirts.

reproduce the MOND physics, in which the field equations are particularly
simple outside matter. However, the analysis of the field equations within
matter (a crucial point which is often forgotten in the literature) exhibits a
deadly problem, namely that they do not remain always hyperbolic. Incidentally,
we prove that the same theoretical framework provides a stable and well-posed

continuous deviation of the critical exponents from their 2D values. We observe
that in the same range of varying thickness the deviation of the exponent $\nu$
is very small from its 2D value, while exponent $\beta$ suffers a larger
deviation. Moreover, as long as the film thickness is fixed, i. e. no finite
size scaling is done in the $z$ direction perpendicular to the film, the 3D
values of the critical exponents cannot be attained even with very large (but
fixed) thickness. The crossover to 3D universality class cannot therefore take
place without finite size scaling applied in the $z$ direction, in the limit of
numerically accessible thicknesses. From values of exponent $\alpha$ obtained
by MC, we estimate the effective dimension of the system. We conclude that with
regard to the critical behavior, thin films behave as systems with effective

Additionally we have used publicly available XMM/Newton observations for a

determine the dynamical state and to estimate the total mass. We also
identified four gravitational arc candidates. We find this cluster to be in a
relaxed state, which is confirmed by a large cooling flow with nominal
~1600M_\odot per year, regular galaxy density and light distributions and a
regular shape of the weak lensing mass reconstruction. The mass content derived

of Lie groups restrict the possible actions of those groups on surfaces. The
results show a strong parallel between the possible actions of such a group on
the circle $S^1$ and the measure preserving actions on surfaces.
  Our aim is the study of the (non)-existence of actions of lattices in a large
class of non-compact Lie groups on surfaces. A definitive analysis of the
analogous question for actions on $S^1$ was carried out by \'E. Ghys. Our
approach is topological and insofar as possible we try to isolate properties of
a group which provide the tools necessary for our analysis. The two key
properties we consider are almost simplicity and the existence of a distortion
element. Both will be defined and described in the lectures.
  Our techniques are almost all from low dimensional dynamics. But we are
interested in how algebraic properties of a group -- commutativity, nilpotence,
etc. affect the possible kinds of dynamics which can occur. For most of the
results we will consider groups of diffeomorphisms which preserve a Borel
probability measure.

models called Kolmogorov Lorenz systems, which received an elegant general
Hamiltonian description and includes also the famous Lorenz63 case, from the
viewpoint of energy and Casimir balance. In particular it is considered in
detail a subclass of these models, precisely those obtained from the Lorenz63
by a small perturbation on the standard parameters, which includes for example
the forced Lorenz case in Ref.[6]. The paper is divided into two parts. In the
first part the extremes of the mentioned state functions are considered, which
define an invariant manifold, used to construct an appropriate Poincare surface
for our return map. From the experimental observation of the simple orbital
motion around the two unstable fixed points, together with the circumstance
that these orbits are classified by their energy or Casimir maximum, we
construct a conceptually simple skeletal dynamics valid within our sub class,
reproducing quite well the Lorenz map for Casimir. This energetic approach
sheds some light on the physical mechanism underlying regime transitions. The
second part of the paper is devoted to the investigation of a new type of
maximum energy based long term predictions, by which the knowledge of a
particular maximum energy shell amounts to the knowledge of the future
(qualitative) behaviour of the system. It is shown that, in this respect, a
local analysis of predictability is not appropriate for a complete
characterization of this behaviour. A perspective on the possible extensions of
this type of predictability analysis to more realistic cases in (geo)fluid
dynamics is discussed at the end of the paper.

undergoing external shock (ES) in either a uniform or a wind-like interstellar
medium, and assess the relative importance of IC and synchrotron emissions. We
determine the primary model parameters driving the IC to synchrotron emission
ratio in the case of a short duration central engine. We then investigate the
case of ES by a long duration central engine, or delayed external shock (DES),
a model that can account for some of the flares observed in GRB X-ray light
curves. We present model predictions, in particular in terms of GeV vs X-ray
behavior, and compare them with other models proposed to explain the origin of
flares. We find that if most of the emission occurs when the fireball is in the
fast cooling regime, then a substantial GeV emission is expected both for a
short (standard ES) and a long (DES) duration central engine activity. In
particular, in the context of standard ES we are able to account for the
delayed emission observed in GRB940217. In the case of DES, we find that IC
scattering of X-ray flare photons can produce high energy flares in the GeV
band, which can be detected by GLAST. The detectability of high energy flares
improves with the burst kinetic energy: about 30% of Swift GRBs showing flares
in their X-ray light curve have sufficiently large kinetic energy so that the
expected high flares can be detected by GLAST. One important prediction of the
DES model is the simultaneity between low and high energy flares. To test this
simultaneity, the peak energies of both flares need to fall below or within the
observational bands. We predict that X-ray flares with peak energy of ~10 eV
produce high energy flares with peak energy of around 100 MeV-GeV. Observations
by Swift and GLAST then, can test the predicted simultaneity.
