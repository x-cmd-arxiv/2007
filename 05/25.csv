ground state properties of quantum many-body systems. The key feature is a
novel variational method over quantum circuits via infinitesimal unitary
transformations, inspired by flow equation methods. Variational classes are
represented as efficiently contractible unitary networks, including the
matrix-product states of density matrix renormalization, multiscale
entanglement renormalization (MERA) states, weighted graph states, and quantum
cellular automata. In particular, this provides a tool for varying over classes
of states, such as MERA, for which so far no efficient way of variation has
been known. The scheme is flexible when it comes to hybridizing methods or
formulating new ones. We demonstrate the functioning by numerical
implementations of MERA, matrix-product states, and a new variational set on
benchmarks.

center have unique kinematic properties compared to other halo stars. Their
trajectories will deviate from being exactly radial because of the asymmetry of
the Milky Way potential produced by the flattened disk and the triaxial dark
matter halo, causing a change of angular momentum that can be much larger than
the initial small value at injection. We study the kinematics of HVSs and
propose an estimator of dark halo triaxiality that is determined only by
instantaneous position and velocity vectors of HVSs at large Galactocentric
distances (r>~50kpc). We show that, in the case of a substantially triaxial
halo, the distribution of deflection angles (the angle between the stellar
position and velocity vector) for HVSs on bound orbits is spread uniformly over
the range 10--180deg. Future astrometric and deep wide-field surveys should
measure the positions and velocities of a significant number of HVSs, and
provide useful constraints on the shape of the Galactic dark matter halo.

result is the proof of decidability. We show how to express precondition,
postconditions, and loop invariants for some interesting programs. It is also
possible to express properties such as disjointness of data-structures, and
low-level heap mutations. Moreover, our logic can express properties of
arbitrary data-structures and of an arbitrary number of pointer fields. The
latter provides a way to naturally specify postconditions that relate the

to use the logic to automatically prove partial correctness of programs

including new observations of three sources: 4U 0614+09, LMC X-2 and GX 349+2.
The average radio-OIR spectrum for NSXBs is alpha ~ +0.2 (where L_nu propto
nu^alpha) at least at high luminosities when the radio jet is detected. This is
comparable to, but slightly more inverted than the alpha ~ 0.0 found for black
hole X-ray binaries. The OIR spectra and relations between OIR and X-ray fluxes
are compared to those expected if the OIR emission is dominated by thermal
emission from an X-ray or viscously heated disc, or synchrotron emission from
the inner regions of the jets. We find that thermal emission due to X-ray
reprocessing can explain all the data except at high luminosities for some
NSXBs, namely the atolls and millisecond X-ray pulsars (MSXPs). Optically thin
synchrotron emission from the jets (with an observed OIR spectral index of
alpha_thin < 0) dominate the NIR light above L_x ~ 10^36 erg/s and the optical
above L_x ~ 10^37 erg/s in these systems. For NSXB Z-sources, the OIR

invariant under a combined time-reversal and parity transformation. We then
consider two swimmers and find that the interaction between them consists of
two parts; a dead term, independent of the motion of the second swimmer, which
takes the expected dipolar form and a live term resulting from the simultaneous
swimming action of both swimmers which does not. We argue that, in general, the

field generated by a pointlike scalar charge orbiting a black hole. Time-domain
evolution offers an efficient way for calculating black hole perturbations,
especially as input for computations of the local self force acting on orbiting
particles. In Kerr geometry, the field equations are not fully separable in the
time domain, and one has to tackle them in 2+1 dimensions (two spatial
dimensions and time; the azimuthal dependence is still separable). A technical
difficulty arises when the source of the field is a pointlike particle, as the
2+1-dimensional perturbation is then singular: Each of the azimuthal modes
diverges logarithmically at the particle. To deal with this problem we split
the numerical domain into two regions: Inside a thin worldtube surrounding the
particle's worldline we solve for a regularized variable, obtained from the
full field by subtracting out a suitable ``puncture'' function, given
analytically. Outside this worldtube we solve for the full, original field. The
value of the evolution variable is adjusted across the boundary of the

MHD equations. Performing a set of numerical simulations in a fixed
computational domain with increasing resolution, we demonstrate that turbulent
activity decreases as resolution increases. We quantify the turbulent activity
by measuring the rate of angular momentum transport through evaluating the
standard alpha parameter. We find alpha=0.004 when (N_x,N_y,N_z)=(64,100,64),
alpha=0.002 when (N_x,N_y,N_z)=(128,200,128) and alpha=0.001 when
(N_x,N_y,N_z)=(256,400,256). This steady decline is an indication that
numerical dissipation, occurring at the grid scale is an important determinant
of the saturated form of the MHD turbulence. Analysing the results in Fourier
space, we demonstrate that this is due to the MRI forcing significant flow
energy all the way down to the grid dissipation scale. We also use our results
to study the properties of the numerical dissipation in ZEUS. Its amplitude is
characterised by the magnitude of an effective magnetic Reynolds number Re_M
which increases from 10^4 to 10^5 as the number of grid points is increased
from 64 to 256 per scale height. The simulations we have carried out do not
produce results that are independent of the numerical dissipation scale, even
at the highest resolution studied. Thus it is important to use physical
dissipation, both viscous and resistive, and to quantify contributions from
numerical effects, when performing numerical simulations of MHD turbulence with
zero net flux in accretion disks at the resolutions normally considered.

adopt an unstratified shearing box model and focus on the case where the net
vertical magnetic flux threading the box vanishes. For the most part we use the
finite difference code ZEUS, including explicit transport coefficients in the
calculations. However, we also compare our results with those obtained using
other algorithms (NIRVANA, the PENCIL code and a spectral code) to demonstrate
both the convergence of our results and their independence of the numerical
scheme. We find that small scale dissipation affects the saturated state of MHD
turbulence. In agreement with recent similar numerical simulations done in the
presence of a net vertical magnetic flux, we find that turbulent activity
(measured by the rate of angular momentum transport) is an increasing function
of the magnetic Prandtl number Pm for all values of the Reynolds number Re that
we investigated. We also found that turbulence disappears when the Prandtl
number falls below a critical value Pm_c that is apparently a decreasing
function of Re. For the limited region of parameter space that can be probed
with current computational resources, we always obtained Pm_c>1. We conclude
that the magnitudes of the transport coefficients are important in determining
the properties of MHD turbulence in numerical simulations in the shearing box
with zero net flux, at least for Reynolds numbers and magnetic Prandtl numbers
that are such that transport is not dominated by numerical effects and thus can
be probed using current computational resources.

independently for each individual star considered. In this paper we revisit the
work by Michel et al. (1999) following, however, a new approach which consists
in the search for a single, complete, and coherent solution for all the
selected stars, in order to constrain and test the assumed physics describing
these objects. To do so, refined descriptions for the effects of rotation on
the determination of the global stellar parameters and on the adiabatic
oscillation frequency computations are used. In addition, a crude attempt is
made to study the role of rotation on the prediction of mode instabilities.The
present results are found to be comparable with those reported by Michel et al.
(1999). Within the temperature range log T_eff = 3.87-3.88 agreement between
observations and model computations of unstable modes is restricted to values
for the mixing-length parameter alpha_nl less or equal to 1.50. This indicates
that for these stars a smaller value for alpha_nl is required than suggested
from a calibrated solar model. We stress the point that the linear stability
analysis used in this work still assumes stellar models without rotation and
that further developments are required for a proper description of the
interaction between rotation and pulsation dynamics.

to yield an ionization rate greater than about 10^-19 s^-1 near the center of
the minihalo. The presence of CRs with energies less than approximately 10^7 eV
would indirectly enhance the molecular cooling in these regions, and we
estimate that the resulting lower temperatures in these minihaloes would yield
a characteristic stellar mass as low as ~ 10 M_sun. CRs have a less pronounced
effect on the cooling and collapse of primordial gas clouds inside more massive
dark matter haloes with virial masses greater than approximately 10^8 M_sun at
the later stages of cosmological structure formation around z ~ 10 - 15. In
these clouds, even without CR flux the molecular abundance is already
sufficient to allow cooling to the floor set by the temperature of the cosmic

very massive young stars. Seeing N IV] 1486A emission in a high-redshift quasar
may thus be understood in the context of co-formation and early co-evolution of

views the host galaxy's axis of symmetry. We discuss our results in the context
of dissipative merger scenarios, and infer that dusty disks primarily reside in
old, boxy remnants of gas-poor galaxy mergers, whereas filamentary dust lanes
reside in younger disky remnants of gas-rich mergers.

Hartley's information formula to the generalized information formula step by
step for measuring subjective information: metrical information (such as
conveyed by thermometers), sensory information (such as conveyed by color
vision), and semantic information (such as conveyed by weather forecasts). The
pivotal step is to differentiate condition probability and logical condition
probability of a message. The paper illustrates the rationality of the formula,
discusses the coherence of the generalized information formula and Popper's
knowledge evolution theory. For optimizing data compression, the paper
discusses rate-of-limiting-errors and its similarity to complexity-distortion
based on Kolmogorov's complexity theory, and improves the rate-distortion
theory into the rate-fidelity theory by replacing Shannon's distortion with
subjective mutual information. It is proved that both the rate-distortion
function and the rate-fidelity function are equivalent to a
rate-of-limiting-errors function with a group of fuzzy sets as limiting
condition, and can be expressed by a formula of generalized mutual information
for lossy coding, or by a formula of generalized entropy for lossless coding.
By analyzing the rate-fidelity function related to visual discrimination and
digitized bits of pixels of images, the paper concludes that subjective
information is less than or equal to objective (Shannon's) information; there
is an optimal matching point at which two kinds of information are equal; the
matching information increases with visual discrimination (defined by confusing
probability) rising; for given visual discrimination, too high resolution of
images or too much objective information is wasteful.

energy transfer proceeds either by Hawking radiation from the black hole

results based on 5d models, we find a significant suppression of the energy
transfer rates if the size of the embedding Calabi-Yau orientifold is much

coeval young stars which appear to reside in a coherent disk. Surrounding this
dynamically-cool stellar system, there is a population of stars with a similar
age and much larger eccentricities and inclinations relative to the disk. We
propose a hypothesis for the origin of this dynamical dichotomy. Without
specifying any specific mechanism, we consider the possibility that both
stellar populations were formed within a disk some 6 Myr ago. But this orderly
structure was dynamically perturbed outside-in by an intruding object with a
mass ~10^4 Msun, which may be an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) or a dark
stellar cluster hosting an IMBH. We suggest that the perturber migrated inward
to ~0.15-0.3pc from the GC under the action of dynamical friction. Along the
way, it captured many stars in the outer disk region into its mean-motion
resonance, forced them to migrate with it, closely encountered with them, and
induced the growth of their eccentricity and inclination. But stars in the
inner regions of the disk retain their initial coplanar structure. We predict
that some of the inclined and eccentric stars surrounding the disk may have
similar Galactocentric semimajor axis. Future precision determination of their
kinematic distribution of these stars will not only provide a test for this
hypothesis but also evidences for the presence of an IMBH or a dark cluster at
the immediate proximity of the massive black hole at the GC. (abridged)

we revisit this possibility. We find that the angular distribution of the WMAP
Haze matches the prediction for dark matter annihilations with a cusped density
profile, $\rho(r) \propto r^{-1.2}$ in the inner kiloparsecs. Comparing the
intensity in different WMAP frequency bands, we find that a wide range of
possible WIMP annihilation modes are consistent with the spectrum of the haze
for a WIMP with a mass in the 100 GeV to multi-TeV range. Most interestingly,
we find that to generate the observed intensity of the haze, the dark matter
annihilation cross section is required to be approximately equal to the value
needed for a thermal relic, $\sigma v \sim 3 \times 10^{-26}$ cm$^3$/s. No
boost factors are required. If dark matter annihilations are in fact
responsible for the WMAP Haze, and the slope of the halo profile continues into
the inner Galaxy, GLAST is expected to detect gamma rays from the dark matter
annihilations in the Galactic Center if the WIMP mass is less than several

70% of the 1.1x10^9 Msolar of molecular gas detected in the inner 20"" is found
to be concentrated within the inner 800 pc and is distributed along the large
scale stellar bar seen in near-infrared observations. A hole in the CO
distribution coincides with the nucleus where most of the Halpha emission and
blue light are emitted. The kinematics are modelled in three different ways,
ranging from the purely geometrical to the most physical. This approach allows
us to constrain progressively the physical properties of the galaxy and
eventually to emerge with a reasonable fit to an analytical model of orbits in
a barred potential. Fitting an axisymmetric model shows that the non-circular
motions must be comparable in amplitude to the circular motions (120 km/s).
Fitting a model based on elliptical orbits allows us to identify with
confidence the single inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) of the large scale bar.
Finally, a model based on analytical solutions for the gas particle orbits in a
weakly barred potential constrained by the ILR radius reproduces the

x-ray reflectivity and tensiometry demonstrates that the liquid to gas
monolayer phase transition at the hexane/water interface is thermodynamically
favorable only for long-chain alkanols. As the alkanol chain length is
decreased, the change in excess interfacial entropy per area decreases to zero.
Systems with small values of excess interfacial entropy form multi-molecular
layers at the interface instead of the monolayer formed by systems with much
larger excess interfacial entropy. Substitution of n-hexane by n-hexadecane
significantly alters the interfacial structure for a given alkanol surfactant,
but this substitution does not change fundamentally the phase transition
behavior of the monolayers. These data show that the critical alkanol carbon
number, at which the change in excess interfacial entropy per area decreases to
zero, is approximately six carbons larger than the number of carbons in the
alkane solvent molecules.

underlying ensemble evolves under a classical distribution of unitary
processes. While many incoherent processes appear decoherent, there are
important differences. The distribution functions underlying incoherent
processes are either static or slowly varying with respect to control
operations and so the errors introduced by these distributions are refocusable.
The observation and control of incoherence in small Hilbert spaces is well
known. Here we explore incoherence during an entangling operation, such as is
relevant in quantum information processing. As expected, it is more difficult
to separate incoherence and decoherence over such processes. However, by
studying the fidelity decay under a cyclic entangling map we are able to
identify distinctive experimental signatures of incoherence. This result is
demonstrated both through numerical simulations and experimentally in a three
qubit nuclear magnetic resonance implementation.

simulations of the Accretion-Induced Collapse (AIC) of a rapidly-rotating white
dwarf. We focus on the dynamical role of MHD processes after the formation of a
millisecond-period protoneutron star. We find that including magnetic fields
and stresses can lead to a powerful explosion with an energy of a few Bethe,
rather than a weak one of at most 0.1 Bethe, with an associated ejecta mass of
~0.1Msun, instead of a few 0.001Msun. The core is spun down by ~30% within
500ms after bounce, and the rotational energy extracted from the core is
channeled into magnetic energy that generates a strong magnetically-driven
wind, rather than a weak neutrino-driven wind. Baryon loading of the ejecta,
while this wind prevails, precludes it from becoming relativistic. This
suggests that a GRB is not expected to emerge from such AICs during the early
protoneutron star phase, except in the unlikely event that the massive white
dwarf has sufficient mass to lead to black hole formation. In addition, we
predict both negligible 56Ni-production (that should result in an
optically-dark, adiabatically-cooled explosion) and the ejection of 0.1Msun of
material with an electron fraction of 0.1-0.2. Such pollution by neutron-rich
nuclei puts strong constraints on the possible rate of such AICs. Moreover,
being free from ``fallback,'' such highly-magnetized millisecond-period
protoneutron stars may later become magnetars, and the magnetically-driven
winds may later transition to Poynting-flux-dominated, relativistic winds,
eventually detectable as GRBs at cosmological distances. However, the low
expected event rate of AICs will constrain them to be, at best, a small subset
of GRB and/or magnetar progenitors.

them back to a base station. Data fusion, which fuses the collected data before
they are sent to the base station, is usually implemented over the network.
Since the sensor is typically placed in locations accessible to malicious
attackers, information assurance of the data fusion process is very important.
A witness-based approach has been proposed to validate the fusion data. In this
approach, the base station receives the fusion data and ""votes"" on the data
from a randomly chosen sensor node. The vote comes from other sensor nodes,
called ""witnesses,"" to verify the correctness of the fusion data. Because the
base station obtains the vote through the chosen node, the chosen node could
forge the vote if it is compromised. Thus, the witness node must encrypt the
vote to prevent this forgery. Compared with the vote, the encryption requires
more bits, increasing transmission burden from the chosen node to the base
station. The chosen node consumes more power. This work improves the
witness-based approach using direct voting mechanism such that the proposed
scheme has better performance in terms of assurance, overhead, and delay. The
witness node transmits the vote directly to the base station. Forgery is not a
problem in this scheme. Moreover, fewer bits are necessary to represent the
vote, significantly reducing the power consumption. Performance analysis and
simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can achieve a 40 times
better overhead than the witness-based approach.

order to ensure that the stars in the sample are free of various sources of
astrometric noise that might impede the detection of planets, we have initiated
programs to collect photometry, high contrast images, interferometric data and
radial velocities for stars in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. We
have completed a high contrast imaging survey of target stars in Taurus and the
Pleiades and found no definitive common proper motion companions within one
arcsecond (140 AU) of the SIM targets. Our radial velocity surveys have shown
that many of the target stars in Sco-Cen are fast rotators and a few stars in
Taurus and the Pleiades may have sub-stellar companions. Interferometric data
of a few stars in Taurus show no signs of stellar or sub-stellar companions
with separations of <5 mas. The photometric survey suggests that approximately
half of the stars initially selected for this program are variable to a degree
(1 sigma>0.1 mag) that would degrade the astrometric accuracy achievable for
that star. While the precursor programs are still a work in progress, we
provide a comprehensive list of all targets ranked according to their viability
as a result of the observations taken to date. By far, the observable that
moves the most targets from the SIM-YSO program is photometric variability.

  $\dot{\mu}/\mu=(1 \pm 3) \times 10^{-16}$ yr$^{-1}$. A combination of this
result and the atomic clock results gives the best limt on variation of
$\alpha$: $\dot{\alpha}/\alpha=(-0.8 \pm 0.8) \times 10^{-16}$ yr$^{-1}$. The
Oklo natural reactor gives the best limit on the variation of
$m_s/\Lambda_{QCD}$ where $m_s$ is the strange quark mass.
  Huge enhancement of the relative variation effects happens in transitions
between close atomic, molecular and nuclear energy levels. We suggest several
new cases where the levels are very narrow. Large enhancement of the variation
effects is also possible in cold atomic and molecular collisions near Feshbach
resonance. Massive bodies (stars or galaxies) can also affect physical
constants. They have large scalar charge $S$ proportional to number of
particles which produces a Coulomb-like scalar field $U=S/r$. This leads to a
variation of the fundamental constants proportional to the gravitational
potential, e.g. $\delta \alpha/ \alpha = k_\alpha \delta (GM/ r c^2)$. We
compare different manifestations of this effect.The strongest limit
  $k_\alpha +0.17 k_e= (-3.5\pm 6) \times 10^{-7}$.

aspect, we generalize the force calculation of D0-${\bar {\rm D}}$0 of Banks

find that the force is also divergent for p = 1 while for the other cases ($p
\ge 2$) the forces are in general finite when $Z \to 0^+$, where $Z =
\frac{Y^2}{2\pi^2\alpha'} - 1$ with Y, the brane-antibrane separation. However,
the forces are divergent for all cases when Z < 0, signalling the occurrence of
open string tachyon condensation in this regime. The other deals with the
puzzling static nature of the supergravity brane-antibrane configurations. We
will show that the force on a brane probe due to a brane-antibrane background
vanishes when the probe is placed at the location of the coincident
brane-antibranes, thereby providing a direct evidence for the existence of
general static brane-antibrane configuration in the supergravity approximation.

galaxies provide a new confirmation of buoyant feedback outflow in the hot gas
atmospheres around these galaxies. AGN feedback energy is required to prevent
wholesale cooling and star formation in these group-centered galaxies. In NGC
5044 we observe interstellar (presumably PAH) emission at 8 microns out to
about 5 kpc. Both NGC 5044 and 4636 have extended 70 microns emission from cold
dust exceeding that expected from stellar mass loss. The sputtering lifetime of
this extended dust in the ~1keV interstellar gas, ~10^7 yrs, establishes the
time when the dust first entered the hot gas. Evidently the extended dust
originated in dusty disks or clouds, commonly observed in elliptical galaxy
cores, that were disrupted, heated and buoyantly transported outward. The
surviving central dust in NGC 5044 and 4636 has been disrupted into many small
filaments. It is remarkable that the asymmetrically extended 8 micron emission
in NGC 5044 is spatially coincident with Halpha+[NII] emission from warm gas. A
calculation shows that dust-assisted cooling in buoyant hot gas moving out from
the galactic core can cool within a few kpc in about ~10^7 yrs, explaining the
optical line emission observed. The X-ray images of both galaxies are
disturbed. All timescales for transient activity - restoration of equilibrium
and buoyant transport in the hot gas, dynamics of surviving dust fragments, and
dust sputtering - are consistent with a central release of feedback energy in
both galaxies about 10^7 yrs ago.

for this source (alpha = 21h43m3.38s, delta= +6deg54'17"".53; 90% uncertainty of

propositions:
  1. Zero-point radiation derives from quantic fluctuations in space, and the
wavelength of its photons with the greatest energy is inversely proportional to
the curvature of space.
  2. The Universe began as the breaking in of photons of extremely high energy
contained in the 3-dimensional surface: $w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2=R^2_i$, whose radius
has continued to expand at the speed of ligth since its origin at $t=0$.
  3. The wavelength of the photons is quantized and the quantum of wavelength
is invariable.
  These propositions imply that the value of the total energy of the zero-point
radiation in the Universe remains constant and the condition $w^2 + x^2 + y^2 +
z^2 = (R_i + ct)^2 = R_u^2$ determines that every point in our space is subject
to a tension whose intensity $i$ is proportional to the curvature $1/R_u$. Any
increase of $R_u$ implies a decrease in $i$ and consequently an energy flow
which translates into an expansive force. Therefore, the Universe will expand
indefinitely: no Big Crunch is possible. If the initial radius of the Universe
$R_i$ has been smaller than the Schwarzschild radius, $R_s$, which corresponds
to the total mass of the Universe, $M_u$, the generation of matter would have
lasted for thousands of millions of years. Generation of matter over short
periods would have required values for $R_i$ of thousands of millions of light
years.

extended system exhibit a resonant patterns and frequency-locking phenomena.
The system also shows that the noise and the external periodic forces play a
constructive role in the Scheffer's model: first, the noise can enhance the
oscillation of phytoplankton species' density and format a large clusters in
the space when the noise intensity is within certain interval. Second, the
external periodic forces can induce 4:1 and 1:1 frequency-locking and spatially
homogeneous oscillation phenomena to appear. Finally, the resonant patterns are
observed in the system when the spatial noises and external periodic forces are
both turned on. Moreover, we found that the 4:1 frequency-locking transform
into 1:1 frequency-locking when the noise intensity increased. In addition to
elucidating our results outside the domain of Turing instability, we provide
further analysis of Turing linear stability with the help of the numerical
calculation by using the Maple software. Significantly, oscillations are
enhanced in the system when the noise term presents. These results indicate

general approach based on two function of the solid fraction to be determined.
Studying the vertical chute flow, we show that shear band thickness is always
independent from flowrate in the quasistatic limit, for Coulomb wall boundary
conditions. The effect of bin width is addressed using the functions developed
by Pouliquen and coworkers, predicting a linear dependence of shear band
thickness by channel width, while literature reports contrasting data. We also
discuss the influence of wall roughness on shear bands. Through a Coulomb wall
friction criterion we show that our model correctly predicts the effect of
increasing wall roughness on the thickness of shear bands. Then a simple
mixing-length approach to steady granular flows can be useful and

conductivity accompanies the change of the Berry phase. This property is robust
against the impurity potentials in the system. Experimental detection of this
topological quantum phase transition is discussed.

  and energy conserving collisions","This June 21 version contains a new theorem significantly extending
  the scope of the results, and more eplanation of how the method works",,,,"math-ph math.FA math.MP",,"  The Kac model describes the local evolution of a gas of $N$ particles with
three dimensional velocities by a random walk in which the steps correspond to
binary collisions that conserve momentum as well as energy. The state space of
this walk is a sphere of dimension $3N - 4$. The Kac conjecture concerns the
spectral gap in the one step transition operator $Q$ for this walk. In this
paper, we compute the exact spectral gap.
  As in previous work by Carlen, Carvalho and Loss where a lower bound on the
spectral gap was proved, we use a method that relates the spectral properties
of $Q$ to the spectral properties of a simpler operator $P$, which is simply an
average of certain non commuting projections. The new feature is that we show
how to use a knowledge of certain eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of $P$ to
determine spectral properties of $Q$, instead of simply using the spectral gap
for $P$ to bound the spectral gap for $Q$, inductively in $N$, as in previous
work. The methods developed here can be applied to many other high--dimensional
stochastic process, as we shall explain.
  We also use some deep results on Jacobi polynomials to obtain the required
spectral information on $P$, and we show how the identity through which Jacobi
polynomials enter our problem may be used to obtain new bounds on Jacobi
polynomials.

Relating $obf(G)$ to the distribution of vertex degrees in $G$, we show an
efficient way of constructing a drawing of $G$ with at least $obf(G)/3$ edge
crossings. We prove bounds $(\delta(G)^2/24-o(1))n^2 < \obf G <3 n^2$ for an
$n$-vertex planar graph $G$ with minimum vertex degree $\delta(G)\ge 2$.
  The shift complexity of $G$, denoted by $shift(G)$, is the minimum number of
vertex shifts sufficient to eliminate all edge crossings in an arbitrarily
obfuscated drawing of $G$ (after shifting a vertex, all incident edges are
supposed to be redrawn correspondingly). If $\delta(G)\ge 3$, then $shift(G)$
is linear in the number of vertices due to the known fact that the matching
number of $G$ is linear. However, in the case $\delta(G)\ge2$ we notice that

computational complexity, we show that, given a drawing $D$ of a planar graph,
it is NP-hard to find an optimum sequence of shifts making $D$ crossing-free.

with the complexity classes VP and VNP, which can be viewed as analogues of the

arithmetic circuits and provides a framework to study the complexity for
sequences of polynomials. Prominent examples of difficult (that is,
VNP-complete) problems in this model includes the permanent and hamiltonian
polynomials. While the permanent and hamiltonian polynomials in general are
difficult to evaluate, there have been research on which special cases of these
polynomials admits efficient evaluation. For instance, Barvinok has shown that
if the underlying matrix has bounded rank, both the permanent and the
hamiltonian polynomials can be evaluated in polynomial time, and thus are in
VP. Courcelle, Makowsky and Rotics have shown that for matrices of bounded
treewidth several difficult problems (including evaluating the permanent and
hamiltonian polynomials) can be solved efficiently. An earlier result of this
flavour is Kasteleyn's theorem which states that the sum of weights of perfect
matchings of a planar graph can be computed in polynomial time, and thus is in
VP also. For general graphs this problem is VNP-complete. In this paper we
investigate the expressive power of the above results. We show that the
permanent and hamiltonian polynomials for matrices of bounded treewidth both

Neptune (Gl 581b) and two super-Earths (Gl 581c and Gl 581d). The habitability
of this system with respect to the super-Earths is investigated following a
concept that studies the long-term possibility of photosynthetic biomass
production on a dynamically active planet. Methods: A thermal evolution model
for a super-Earth is used to calculate the sources and sinks of atmospheric
carbon dioxide. The habitable zone is determined by the limits of biological
productivity on the planetary surface. Models with different ratios of land /
ocean coverage are investigated. Results: The super-Earth Gl 581c is clearly
outside the habitable zone, since it is too close to the star. In contrast, Gl
581d is a tidally locked habitable super-Earth near the outer edge of the
habitable zone. Despite the adverse conditions on this planet, at least some
primitive forms of life may be able to exist on its surface.Therefore, Gl 581d
is an interesting target for the planned TPF/Darwin missions to search for
biomarkers in planetary atmospheres.

subthreshold membrane potential (Vm) activity. The power spectral density (PSD)
of the Vm displays a power-law structure at high frequencies (>50 Hz) with a
slope of about -2.5. This type of frequency scaling cannot be accounted for by
traditional models, as either single-compartment models or models based on
reconstructed cell morphologies display a frequency scaling with a slope close
to -4. This slope is due to the fact that the membrane resistance is
""short-circuited"" by the capacitance for high frequencies, a situation which
may not be realistic. Here, we integrate non-ideal capacitors in cable
equations to reflect the fact that the capacitance cannot be charged
instantaneously. We show that the resulting ""non-ideal"" cable model can be
solved analytically using Fourier transforms. Numerical simulations using a
ball-and-stick model yield membrane potential activity with similar frequency
scaling as in the experiments. We also discuss the consequences of using
non-ideal capacitors on other cellular properties such as the transmission of
high frequencies, which is boosted in non-ideal cables, or voltage attenuation
in dendrites. These results suggest that cable equations based on non-ideal
capacitors should be used to capture the behavior of neuronal membranes at high
frequencies.

a range of temperatures for which no entanglement can be distilled by means of

the appearance of bound entanglement can be linked to entanglement-area laws,

to a new version of smooth hybrid inflation based only on renormalizable

with the fitting of the three-year Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data by
the standard power-law cosmological model with cold dark matter and a

adequately small so that it is compatible with the data. Moreover, the
Pati-Salam gauge group is broken to the standard model gauge group during
inflation and, thus, no monopoles are formed at the end of inflation.
Supergravity corrections based on a non-minimal Kaehler potential with a
convenient choice of a sign keep the spectral index comfortably within the

wave is determined, as well as the wavelength, which shrinks as the waves
propagate outwards due to the effects of the central planet's oblateness. The

due to the satellite's many other vertical resonances in the ring, and the

environments for studying the role of massive stars in the formation and
destruction of dust. At redshifts above ~ 6, when the universe was less than ~
1 Gyr old, dust could have only condensed in the explosive ejecta of Type II
supernovae (SNe), since most of the progenitors of the AGB stars, the major
alternative source of interstellar dust, did not have time to evolve off the
main sequence since the onset of star formation. In this paper we present
analytical models for the evolution of the gas, dust, and metals in high
redshift galaxies, with a special application to SDSS J1148+5251, a
hyperluminous quasar at z = 6.4. We find that an average supernova must
condense at least 1 Msun of dust to account for the observed dust mass in this
quasar. Observationally, it is in excess of the largest dust yield of ~0.02
Msun found thus far in the ejecta of any SN. If future observations find this
to be a typical supernova dust yield, then additional processes, such as
accretion onto preexisting grains, or condensation around the AGN will need to
be invoked to account for the large amount of dust in this and similar objects.
The galaxy's star formation history is still uncertain, and current
observations of the gas, metal, and dust contents of J1148 can be reproduced by
either an intensive and short burst of star formation (~ 1000 Msun/yr) with a
duration of ~ 100 Myr, or a much lower star formation rate (~ 100 Msun/yr)

system, which contributes ~18.5 % of the total 16\micron flux, indicates that
unlike similar off-nuclear infrared-bright regions found in Arp 299 or NGC
4038/9, its MIR spectrum is inconsistent with an enshrouded hot dust (T > 300K)
component. Instead, the three brightest MIR regions all display dust continua
of temperatures less than ~ 200K. These low dust temperatures indicate the dust
is likely in the form of a patchy screen of relatively cold material situated

young (about 6 Myr) stellar populations. A fourth region, for which we have no

reporting on extensive radio observations of the first extended and yet
unidentified source, namely TeV J2032+4130. This object was originally detected
by the HEGRA telescope in the direction of the Cygnus OB2 region and its nature
has been a matter of debate during the latest years.
  Aims. We aim to pursue our radio exploration of the TeV J2032+4130 position
that we initiated in a previous paper but taking now into account the latest
results from new Whipple and MILAGRO TeV telescopes.
  Methods. Our investigation is mostly based on interferometric radio
observations with the Giant Metre Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT) close to Pune
(India) and the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico (USA). We also conducted
near infrared observations with the 3.5 m telescope and the OMEGA2000 camera at
the Centro Astronomico Hispano Aleman (CAHA) in Almeria (Spain).
  Results. We present deep radio maps centered on the TeV J2032+4130 position
at different wavelengths. In particular, our 49 and 20 cm maps cover a field of
view larger than half a degree that fully includes the Whipple position and the
peak of MILAGRO emission. Our most important result here is a catalogue of 153
radio sources detected at 49 cm within the GMRT antennae primary beam with a
full width half maximum (FWHM) of 43 arc-minute. Moreover, our
multi-configuration VLA images reveal the non-thermal extended emission
previously reported by us with improved angular resolution.
