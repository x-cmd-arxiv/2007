bluffing is even open for debate, adding further complication to the process of
creating intelligent virtual players that can bluff, and hence play,
realistically. Through the use of intelligent, learning agents, and carefully
designed agent outlooks, an agent can in fact learn to predict its opponents
reactions based not only on its own cards, but on the actions of those around
it. With this wider scope of understanding, an agent can in learn to bluff its
opponents, with the action representing not an illogical action, as bluffing is
often viewed, but rather as an act of maximising returns through an effective
statistical optimisation. By using a tee dee lambda learning algorithm to
continuously adapt neural network agent intelligence, agents have been shown to
be able to learn to bluff without outside prompting, and even to learn to call
each others bluffs in free, competitive play.

to near tri-bimaximal leptonic mixing as well as realistic CKM matrix elements

obtained. Due to the {}^{(d)}T transformation property of the matter fields,
the b-quark mass can be generated only when the {}^{(d)}T symmetry is broken,
giving a dynamical origin for the hierarchy between m_{b} and m_{t}. There are
only nine operators allowed in the Yukawa sector up to at least mass dimension
seven due to an additional Z_{12} x Z'_{12} symmetry, which also forbids, up to
some high orders, operators that lead to proton decay. The resulting model has
a total of nine parameters in the charged fermion and neutrino sectors, and
hence is very predictive. In addition to the prediction for \theta_{13} \simeq
\theta_{c}/3 \sqrt{2}, the model gives rise to a sum rule,
\tan^{2}\theta_{\odot} \simeq \tan^{2} \theta_{\odot, \mathrm{TBM}} - {1/2}

in the quark sector. This deviation could account for the difference between
the experimental best fit value for the solar mixing angle and the value
predicted by the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix.

weak, and presented a spectral energy distribution (SED). Here we present HST
STIS optical and UV spectra, and ground-based optical spectra. The optical and
UV line emission is very unusual. There is no evidence for forbidden or
semiforbidden lines. The near-UV spectrum is dominated by very strong FeII and
FeIII, and unusual low-ionization lines such as NaID and CaII H&K are observed.
High-ionization lines are very weak; CIV has an equivalent width of 6.6A, a
factor of ~5 smaller than measured from quasar composite spectra. An unusual
feature near 1200A can be deblended in terms of Ly\alpha, NV, SiII, and CIII*
using the blueshifted CIV profile as a template. Photoionization modeling shows
that the unusual line emission can be explained qualitatively by the unusually
soft SED. Principally, a low gas temperature results in inefficient emission of
collisionally excited lines, including the semiforbidden lines generally used
as density diagnostics. The emission resembles that of high-density gas; in
both cases this is a consequence of inefficient cooling. PHL 1811 is very
unusual, but we note that quasar surveys are generally biased against finding

three-degree-of-freedom hybrid manipulator. This manipulator is obtained by
adding in series to a five-bar planar mechanism (similar to the one studied by
Bajpai and Roth) a third revolute passing through the line of centers of the
two actuated revolute joints of the above linkage. The resulting architecture
is hybrid in that it has both serial and parallel links. Fully-parallel
manipulators are known for the existence of particularly undesirable
singularities (referred to as parallel singularities) where control is lost [4]
and [6]. On the other hand, due to their cantilever type of kinematic
arrangement, fully serial manipulators suffer from a lack of stiffness and from
relatively large positioning errors. The hybrid manipulator studied is
intrinsically stiffer and more accurate. Furthermore, since all actuators are
located on the first axis, the inertial effects are considerably reduced. In
addition, it is shown that the special kinematic structure of our manipulator
has the potential of avoiding parallel singularities by a suitable choice of
the ""working mode"", thus leading to larger workspaces. The influence of the
different structural dimensions (e.g. the link lengths) on the kinematic and
mechanical properties are analysed in view of the optimal design of such hybrid
manipulators.

distributions. Galaxies separate into a ``red sequence'', populated
prototypically by early-type galaxies, and a ``blue cloud'', whose typical
objects are late-type disk galaxies. Intermediate-type (Sa-Sbc) galaxies
populate both regions. It has been suggested that this bimodality reflects the
two-component nature of disk-bulge galaxies. However, it has now been
established that there are two types of bulges: ``classical bulges'' that are
dynamically hot systems resembling (little) ellipticals, and ``pseudobulges'',
dynamically cold, flattened, disk-like structures that could not have formed
via violent relaxation. Therefore thee question is whether at types Sa-Sbc,
where both bulge types are found, the red-blue dichotomy separates galaxies at
some value of disk-to-bulge ratio, $B/T$, or, whether it separates galaxies of
different bulge type, irrespective of their $B/T$. We identify classical bulges

galaxies. Detailed surface photometry reveals that: (1) The red -- blue
dichotomy is a function of bulge type: at the same $B/T$, pseudobulges are in
globally blue galaxies and classical bulges are in globally red galaxies. (2)
Bulge type also predicts where the galaxy lies in other (bimodal) global
structural parameters. (3) Hence, the red -- blue dichotomy is not due to
decreasing bulge prominence alone, and the bulge type of a galaxy carries
significance for the galaxy's evolutionary history ... (Abridged)

gravities, and masses) of the NGC 6791 white dwarf population. This unique
stellar system is both one of the oldest (8 Gyr) and most metal-rich ([Fe/H] ~
0.4) open clusters in our Galaxy, and has a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) that
exhibits both a red giant clump and a much hotter extreme horizontal branch.
Fitting the Balmer lines of the white dwarfs in the cluster, using Keck/LRIS
spectra, suggests that most of these stars are undermassive, <M> = 0.43 +/-
0.06 Msun, and therefore could not have formed from canonical stellar evolution
involving the helium flash at the tip of the red giant branch. We show that at
least 40% of NGC 6791's evolved stars must have lost enough mass on the red
giant branch to avoid the flash, and therefore did not convert helium into
carbon-oxygen in their core. Such increased mass loss in the evolution of the
progenitors of these stars is consistent with the presence of the extreme
horizontal branch in the CMD. This unique stellar evolutionary channel also
naturally explains the recent finding of a very young age (2.4 Gyr) for NGC
6791 from white dwarf cooling theory; helium core white dwarfs in this cluster
will cool ~3 times slower than carbon-oxygen core stars and therefore the
corrected white dwarf cooling age is in fact ~7 Gyr, consistent with the well
measured main-sequence turnoff age. These results provide direct empirical
evidence that mass loss is much more efficient in high metallicity environments
and therefore may be critical in interpreting the ultraviolet upturn in
elliptical galaxies.

reveals no significant change in its spin period. The 2 sigma upper limit on
the period derivative leads, in the dipole spin-down formalism, to an energy
loss rate E-dot < 7e33 ergs/s, surface magnetic field strength B_p < 1.5e11 G,
and characteristic age tau_c = P/2P-dot > 8 Myr. This tau_c exceeds the age of

3e33(d/7.1 kpc)^2 ergs/s is a large fraction of E-dot, which challenges the

0.46+/-0.04 keV, small blackbody radius ~ 0.8 km, and large pulsed fraction, ~
80%, may be evidence of accretion onto a polar cap, possibly from a fallback
disk made of supernova debris. If B_p < 1e10 G, an accretion disk can penetrate
the light cylinder and interact with the magnetosphere while resulting torques
on the neutron star remain within the observed limits. A weak B-field is also
inferred in another CCO, the 424-ms pulsar 1E 1207.4-5209, from its steady spin
and soft X-ray absorption lines. We propose this origin of radio-quiet CCOs:
the B-field, derived from a turbulent dynamo, is weaker if the NS is formed
spinning slowly, which enables it to accrete SN debris. Accretion excludes
neutron stars born with both B_p < 1e11 G and P > 0.1 s from radio pulsar
surveys, where B_p < 1e11 G is not encountered except among very old (tau_c >

  discussion",,"10.1086/523787",,"astro-ph",,"  Light travel time delays distort the apparent shapes of HII regions
surrounding bright quasars during early stages of cosmic reionization.
Individual HII regions may remain undetectable in forthcoming redshifted 21 cm
experiments. However, the systematic deformation along the line of sight may be
detectable statistically, either by stacking tomographic 21cm images of quasars
identified, for example, by JWST, or as small-scale anisotropy in the
three-dimensional 21cm power spectrum. Here we consider the detectability of
this effect. The anisotropy is largest when HII regions are large and expand
rapidly, and we find that if bright quasars contributed to the early stages of
reionization, then they can produce significant anisotropy, on scales
comparable to the typical sizes of HII regions of the bright quasars (approx.
30 Mpc and below). The effect therefore cannot be ignored when analyzing future
21cm power spectra on small scales. If 10 percent of the volume of the IGM at
redshift z=10 is ionized by quasars with typical ionizing luminosity of S= 5 x
10^{56} photons/second, the distortions can enhance by more than 10 percent the
21cm power spectrum in the radial (redshift) direction, relative to the
transverse directions. The level of this anisotropy exceeds that due to
redshift-space distortion, and has the opposite sign. We show that on-going
experiments such as MWA should be able to detect this effect. A detection would
reveal the presence of bright quasars, and shed light on the ionizing yield and
age of the ionizing sources, and the distribution and small-scale clumping of
neutral intergalactic gas in their vicinity.

The total mass of the population is connected to the star formation rate (SFR)

up to high ages it is convenient to use this M_max(SFR) relation for the

determine the temperature at different points on the planet's surface. Here we
report observations of HD 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetary
systems, over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a 'map' of

dayside of the planet rotated into view. We estimate a minimum brightness
temperature of 973 +/- 33 K and a maximum brightness temperature of 1212 +/- 11
K at a wavelength of 8 microns, indicating that energy from the irradiated
dayside is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere, in contrast to
a recent claim for another hot Jupiter. Our data indicate that the peak
hemisphere-integrated brightness occurs 16$\pm$6 degrees before opposition,

current acceleration of the universe. However, in order to connect these
conditions with observations, one often needs first to integrate them, and then
find the corresponding constraints on some observational variables, such as the
distance modulus. Those integral forms can be misleading, and great caution is
needed when one interprets them physically. A typical example is that the
transition point of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ is at about $z \simeq
0.76$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model. However, with the same model when we consider
the dimensionless Hubble parameter $E(z)$, which involves the integration of
$q(z)$, we find that $E(z)$ does not cross the line of $q(z) = 0$ before $z =
2$. Therefore, to get the correct result, we cannot use the latter to determine
the transition point. With these in mind, we carefully study the constraints
from the energy conditions, and find that, among other things, the current
observational data indeed strongly indicate that our universe has ocne
experienced an accelerating expansion phase between the epoch of galaxy
formation and the present.

account for the appearance of new spheroidals since z~1 and that additional
mechanisms, such as morphological transformations, are required to drive the

J141256.0+792204 -- which we have dubbed Calvera -- as a typical X-ray-dim

those of a nearby (80 to 260 pc) radio pulsar, similar to the radio millisecond
pulsars of 47 Tuc, with further observations required to confirm this
classification. If it is a millisecond pulsar, it has an X-ray flux equal to
the X-ray brightest millisecond pulsar (and so is tied for highest flux); is
the closest northern hemisphere millisecond pulsar; and is potentially the

and academia due to the popularity of content-sharing systems such as
CiteULike, del.icio.us, and Flickr. These systems give users the opportunity to
add data items and to attach their own metadata (or tags) to stored data. The
result is an effective content management tool for individual users. Recent
studies, however, suggest that, as tagging communities grow, the added content
and the metadata become harder to manage due to an ease in content diversity.
Thus, mechanisms that cope with increase of diversity are fundamental to
improve the scalability and usability of collaborative tagging systems. This
paper analyzes whether usage patterns can be harnessed to improve navigability
in a growing knowledge space. To this end, it presents a characterization of
two collaborative tagging communities that target scientific literature:
CiteULike and Bibsonomy. We explore three main directions: First, we analyze
the tagging activity distribution across the user population. Second, we define
new metrics for similarity in user interest and use these metrics to uncover
the structure of the tagging communities we study. The structure we uncover
suggests a clear segmentation of interests into a large number of individuals
with unique preferences and a core set of users with interspersed interests.
Finally, we offer preliminary results that demonstrate that the interest-based
structure of the tagging community can be used to facilitate content usage as
communities scale.

t^{-1.5}. For most of these afterglows, the X-ray spectral slope and the decay
indices before and after the break can be accommodated by the standard jet
model although a different origin of the breaks cannot be ruled out. In
addition, there are 27 other afterglows whose X-ray light-curves may also
exhibit a late break to a steep decay, but the evidence is not that compelling.
  The X-ray emissions of 38 afterglows decay slower than t^{-1.5} until after 3

  Therefore, the fraction of well-monitored Swift afterglows with potential
jet-breaks is around 60 percent, whether we count only the strongest cases for

isotropic output and with burst collimated output) as previously found for
pre-Swift optical afterglows with light-curve breaks (the Amati and Ghirlanda

stronger Ghirlanda correlation only when the few outliers to the Amati relation

Hilbert space, inspired by the work of E. J. Hannan, 1961/1962 for general
canonical correlations of stochastic processes. The spectral theory of
selfadjoint operators is used to investigate the properties of the angles,
e.g., to establish connections between the angles corresponding to orthogonal
complements. The classical gaps and angles of Dixmier and Friedrichs are
characterized in terms of the angles. We introduce principal invariant
subspaces and prove that they are connected by an isometry that appears in the
polar decomposition of the product of corresponding orthogonal projectors.
Point angles are defined by analogy with the point operator spectrum. We bound
the Hausdorff distance between the sets of the squared cosines of the angles
corresponding to the original subspaces and their perturbations. We show that
the squared cosines of the angles from one subspace to another can be
interpreted as Ritz values in the Rayleigh-Ritz method, where the former
subspace serves as a trial subspace and the orthogonal projector of the latter
subspace serves as an operator in the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The Hausdorff
distance between the Ritz values, corresponding to different trial subspaces,
is shown to be bounded by a constant times the gap between the trial subspaces.
We prove a similar eigenvalue perturbation bound that involves the gap squared.
Finally, we consider the classical alternating projectors method and propose
its ultimate acceleration, using the conjugate gradient approach. The
corresponding convergence rate estimate is obtained in terms of the angles. We
illustrate a possible acceleration for the domain decomposition method with a
small overlap for the 1D diffusion equation.

Meshes computations form the basis of many applications, e.g. finite-element
methods, image rendering, and collision detection. In one important mesh
primitive, called a mesh update, each mesh vertex stores a value and repeatedly
updates this value based on the values stored in all neighboring vertices. The
performance of a mesh update depends on the layout of the mesh in memory.
  This paper shows how to find a memory layout that guarantees that the mesh
update has asymptotically optimal memory performance for any set of memory
parameters. Such a memory layout is called cache-oblivious. Formally, for a
$d$-dimensional mesh $G$, block size $B$, and cache size $M$ (where
$M=\Omega(B^d)$), the mesh update of $G$ uses $O(1+|G|/B)$ memory transfers.
The paper also shows how the mesh-update performance degrades for smaller
caches, where $M=o(B^d)$.
  The paper then gives two algorithms for finding cache-oblivious mesh layouts.
The first layout algorithm runs in time $O(|G|\log^2|G|)$ both in expectation
and with high probability on a RAM. It uses $O(1+|G|\log^2(|G|/M)/B)$ memory
transfers in expectation and $O(1+(|G|/B)(\log^2(|G|/M) + \log|G|))$ memory
transfers with high probability in the cache-oblivious and disk-access machine
(DAM) models. The layout is obtained by finding a fully balanced decomposition
tree of $G$ and then performing an in-order traversal of the leaves of the
tree. The second algorithm runs faster by almost a $\log|G|/\log\log|G|$ factor
in all three memory models, both in expectation and with high probability. The
layout obtained by finding a relax-balanced decomposition tree of $G$ and then
performing an in-order traversal of the leaves of the tree.

advantages over their serial counterparts, like high structural rigidity and
high dynamic capacities. Indeed, the parallel kinematic arrangement of the
links provides higher stiffness and lower moving masses that reduce inertia
effects. Thus, PKMs have better dynamic performances. However, the design of a
parallel kinematic machine tool (PKMT) is a hard task that requires further
research studies before wide industrial use can be expected. Many criteria need
to be taken into account in the design of a PKMT. We pay special attention to
the description of kinetostatic criteria that rely on the conditioning of the
Jacobian matrix of the mechanism. The organisation of this paper is as follows:
next section introduces general remarks about PKMs, then is explained why PKMs
can be interesting alternative machine tool designs. Then are presented
existing PKMTs. An application to the design of a small-scale machine tool
prototype developed at IRCCyN is presented at the end of this paper.

orthorhombic lattices, together with the details of calculations for a putative
exact solution. Two conjectures, an additional rotation in the fourth curled-up
dimension and the weight factors on the eigenvectors, are proposed to serve as
a boundary condition to deal with the topologic problem of the 3D Ising model.
The partition function of the 3D simple orthorhombic Ising model is evaluated
by spinor analysis, by employing these conjectures. Based on the validity of
the conjectures, the critical temperature of the simple orthorhombic Ising
lattices could be determined by the relation of KK* = KK' + KK'' + K'K'' or
sinh 2K sinh 2(K' + K'' + K'K''/K) = 1. For a simple cubic Ising lattice, the
critical point is putatively determined to locate exactly at the golden ratio
xc = exp(-2Kc) = (sq(5) - 1)/2, as derived from K* = 3K or sinh 2K sinh 6K = 1.
If the conjectures would be true, the specific heat of the simple orthorhombic
Ising system would show a logarithmic singularity at the critical point of the
phase transition. The spontaneous magnetization and the spin correlation
functions of the simple orthorhombic Ising ferromagnet are derived explicitly.
The putative critical exponents derived explicitly for the simple orthorhombic
Ising lattices are alpha = 0, beta = 3/8, gamma = 5/4, delta = 13/3, eta = 1/8
and nu = 2/3, showing the universality behavior and satisfying the scaling
laws. The cooperative phenomena near the critical point are studied and the
results obtained based on the conjectures are compared with those of the
approximation methods and the experimental findings. The 3D to 2D crossover
phenomenon differs with the 2D to 1D crossover phenomenon and there is a
gradual crossover of the exponents from the 3D values to the 2D ones.

size, mass, and density of satellites of exoplanets to be determined. Here we
present such an analysis using the photometric transit timing variation
($TTV_p$). We examined the light curve effects of both the transiting planet
and its satellite. We define the photometric central time of the transit that
is equivalent to the transit of a fixed photocenter. This point orbits the
barycenter, and leads to the photometric transit timing variations. The exact
value of $TTV_p$ depends on the ratio of the density, the mass, and the size of
the satellite and the planet. Since two of those parameters are independent, a
reliable estimation of the density ratio leads to an estimation of the size and
the mass of the exomoon. Upper estimations of the parameters are possible in
the case when an upper limit of $TTV_p$ is known. In case the density ratio
cannot be estimated reliably, we propose an approximation with assuming equal
densities. The presented photocenter $TTV_p$ analysis predicts the size of the
satellite better than the mass. We simulated transits of the Earth-Moon system
in front of the Sun. The estimated size and mass of the Moon are 0.020
Earth-mass and 0.274 Earth-size if equal densities are assumed. This result is
comparable to the real values within a factor of 2. If we include the real
density ratio (about 0.6), the results are 0.010 Earth-Mass and 0.253
Earth-size, which agree with the real values within 20%.

our analysis the chromohydrodynamical equations for the collective modes are
tackled in the linear response approximation. Such an approximation, valid for
short time scales, allows to study in a straightforward way the dependence of
the dispersion laws of the collective modes on the velocity of the jet, on the
magnitude of the momentum of the collective mode and on the angle between these
two quantities. We find that unstable modes arise for velocity of the jet
larger than the speed of the sound of the plasma and only modes with momenta
smaller than a certain values are unstable. Moreover, for ultrarelativistic
velocities of the jet the longitudinal mode becomes stable and the most
unstable modes correspond to relative angles between the velocity of the jet
and momentum of the collective mode larger than $\sim \pi/8$. Our results
suggest an alternative mechanism for the description of the jet quenching
phenomenon, where the jet crossing the plasma loses energy exciting colored

Consequently, a numerical programme for determining the metric of the universe
from observational data will soon become practical; and thereby realise the
ultimate application of Einstein's equations. Apart from detailing the cosmic
geometry, this would allow us to verify and quantify homogeneity, rather than
assuming it, as has been necessary up to now, and to do that on a metric level,
and not merely at the mass distribution level. This paper is the beginning of a
project aimed at such a numerical implementation. The primary observational
data from our past light cone consists of galaxy redshifts, apparent
luminosities, angular diameters and number densities, together with source
evolution functions, absolute luminosities, true diameters and masses of
sources. Here we start with the simplest case, that of spherical symmetry and a
dust equation of state, and execute an algorithm that determines the unknown
metric functions from this data. We discuss the challenges of turning the
theoretical algorithm into a workable numerical procedure, particularly
addressing the origin and the maximum in the area distance. Our numerical
method is tested with several artificial data sets for homogeneous and
inhomogeneous models, successfully reproducing the original models. This
demonstrates the basic viability of such a scheme. Although current surveys
don't have sufficient completeness or accuracy, we expect this situation to
change in the near future, and in the meantime there are many refinements and
generalisations to be added.

explanation. Studies of time-resolved GRB spectra, observed in the keV-MeV
range, show that a hybrid model consisting of two components, a photospheric
and a non-thermal component, in many cases fits bright, single-pulsed bursts as
well as, and in some instances even better than, the Band function. With an
energy coverage from 8 keV up to 300 GeV, GLAST will give us an unprecedented
opportunity to further investigate the nature of the prompt emission. In
particular, it will give us the possibility to determine whether a photospheric
component is the determining feature of the spectrum or not. Here we present a
short study of the ability of GLAST to detect such a photospheric component in
the sub-MeV range for typical bursts, using simulation tools developed within
the GLAST science collaboration.

$\chi$. In particular, local moment ferromagnets show a sharp peak in $\chi(T)$
near the Curie temperature, $T_c$. The peak amplitude decreases and shifts to
higher temperatures with very small applied dc fields. Anisotropic measurements
of CeVSb$_3$ show that this peak is present provided the magnetic easy axis is
aligned with the excitation field. In a striking contrast, small moment,
itinerant ferromagnets (i.e., ZrZn$_2$) show a broad maximum in $\chi(T)$ that
responds differently to applied field. We believe that TDO measurements provide
a very sensitive way to distinguish between local and itinerant moment magnetic
orders. Local moment antiferromagnets do not show a peak at the N\'eel
temperature, $T_N$, but only a sharp decrease of $\chi$ below $T_N$ due to the
loss of spin-disorder scattering changing the penetration depth of the ac
excitation field. Furthermore, we show that the TDO is capable of detecting
changes in spin order as well as metamagnetic transitions. Finally, critical
scaling of $\chi(T,H)$ in the vicinity of $T_C$ is discussed in CeVSb$_3$ and
CeAgSb$_2$.

galaxy formation model. Currently, physics processes dominating the evolution
of a SMBHB are unclear. An interesting question is whether we could
observationally determine the evolution of SMBHB and give constraints on the
physical processes. Jet precession have been observed in many AGNs and
generally attributed to disk precession. In this paper we calculate the time
variation of jet precession and conclude that jet precession is accelerated in
SMBHB systems but decelerated in others. The acceleration of jet precession
$dP_{\rm pr} / dt$ is related to jet precession timescale $P_{\rm pr}$ and
SMBHB evolution timescale $\tau_{\rm a}$, ${dP_{\rm pr} \over dt} \simeq -
\Lambda {P_{\rm pr} \over \tau_{\rm a}}$. Our calculations based on the models
for jet precession and SMBHB evolution show that $dP_{\rm pr} / dt$ can be as
high as about $- 1.0$ with a typical value -0.2 and can be easily detected. We
discussed the differential jet precession for NGC1275 observed in the
literature. If the observed rapid acceleration of jet precession is true, the
jet precession is due to the orbital motion of an unbound SMBHB with mass ratio
$q\approx 0.76$. When jets precessed from the ancient bubbles to the currently
active jets, the separation of SMBHB decrease from about $1.46 {\rm Kpc}$ to
$0.80 {\rm Kpc}$ with an averaged decreasing velocity $da/dt \simeq - 1.54
\times 10^6 {\rm cm/s}$ and evolution timescale $\tau_{\rm a} \approx 7.5\times
10^7 {\rm yr}$. However, if we assume a steady jet precession for many cycles,
the observations implies a hard SMBHB with mass ratio $q\approx 0.21$ and
separation $a\approx 0.29 {\rm pc}$.

growth conditions, exhibit complex branched growth patterns. In order to
investigate this phenomenon we present a simple hybrid cellular automaton model
of cell colony growth. In the model the growth of the colony is limited by a
nutrient that is consumed by the cells and which inhibits cell division if it
falls below a certain threshold. Using this model we have investigated how the
nutrient consumption rate of the cells affects the growth dynamics of the
colony. We found that for low consumption rates the colony takes on a Eden-like
morphology, while for higher consumption rates the morphology of the colony is
branched with a fractal geometry. These findings are in agreement with previous
results, but the simplicity of the model presented here allows for a linear
stability analysis of the system. By observing that the local growth of the
colony is proportional to the flux of the nutrient we derive an approximate
dispersion relation for the growth of the colony interface. This dispersion
relation shows that the stability of the growth depends on how far the nutrient
penetrates into the colony. For low nutrient consumption rates the penetration
distance is large, which stabilises the growth, while for high consumption
rates the penetration distance is small, which leads to unstable branched
growth. When the penetration distance vanishes the dispersion relation is
reduced to the one describing Laplacian growth without ultra-violet
regularisation. The dispersion relation was verified by measuring how the
average branch width depends on the consumption rate of the cells and shows
good agreement between theory and simulations.

examine a model of local mass media influence in cultural dynamics. Two
mechanisms of information feedback are investigated: (i) direct mass media
influence, where local or global mass media act as an additional element in the
network of interactions of each agent, and (ii) indirect mass media influence,
where global media acts as a filter of the influence of the existing network of
interactions of each agent. Our results generalize previous findings showing
that cultural diversity builds-up by increasing the strength of the mass media
influence. We find that this occurs independently of the mechanisms of action
(direct or indirect) of the mass media message. However, through an analysis of
the full range of parameters measuring cultural diversity, we establish that
the enhancement of cultural diversity produced by interaction with mass media
only occurs for strong enough mass media messages. In comparison with previous
studies a main different result is that weak mass media messages, in
combination with agent-agent interaction, are efficient in producing cultural
homogeneity. Moreover, the homogenizing effect of weak mass media messages are
more efficient for direct local mass media messages than for global mass media
messages or indirect global mass media influences.

important process for the dynamical evolution of the coronal magnetic field. In
this paper we extend our previous numerical investigations, by looking at the
process of flux interaction as an initially twisted flux tube emerges into a
plane parallel, coronal magnetic field. Significant differences are found in
the dynamical appearance and evolution of the emergence process depending on
the relative orientation between the rising flux system and any preexisting
coronal field. When the flux systems are nearly anti-parallel, the experiments
show substantial reconnection and demonstrate clear signatures of a high
temperature plasma located in the high velocity outflow regions extending from
the reconnection region. However, the cases that have a more parallel
orientation of the flux systems show very limited reconnection and none of the
associated features. Despite the very different amount of reconnection between
the two flux systems, it is found that the emerging flux that is still
connected to the original tube, reaches the same height as a function of time.
As a compensation for the loss of tube flux, a clear difference is found in the
extent of the emerging loop in the direction perpendicular to the main axis of
the initial flux tube. Increasing amounts of magnetic reconnection decrease the
volume, which confines the remaining tube flux.

rotating compact object (e.g., a millisecond magnetar), which could produce an
ultrarelativistic electron-positron-pair wind. The interaction of such a wind
with an outwardly expanding fireball ejected during the burst leads to a
relativistic wind bubble (RWB). We numerically calculate the dynamics and
radiative properties of RWBs and use this model to explain the shallow decay
phase of the early X-ray afterglows observed by Swift. We find that RWBs can
fall into two types: forward-shock-dominated and reverse-shock-dominated
bubbles. Their radiation during a period of $\sim 10^{2}-10^{5}$ seconds is
dominated by the shocked medium and the shocked wind, respectively, based on
different magnetic energy fractions of the shocked materials. For both types,
the resulting light curves always have a shallow decay phase. In addition, we
provide an example fit to the X-ray afterglows of GRB 060813 and GRB 060814 and
show that they could be produced by forward-shock-dominated and
reverse-shock-dominated bubbles, respectively. This implies that, for some
early afterglows (e.g., GRB 060814), the long-lasting reverse shock emission is
strong enough to explain their shallow decay phase.

glitches that appear at the output of interferometric gravitational-wave (GW)
detectors.This veto method is `physical' in the sense that, in order to veto a
burst trigger, we make use of our knowledge of the coupling of different
detector subsystems to the main detector output. The main idea behind this
method is that the noise in an instrumental channel X can be \emph{transferred}
to the detector output (channel H) using the \emph{transfer function} from X to
H, provided the noise coupling is \emph{linear} and the transfer function is
\emph{unique}. If a non-stationarity in channel H is causally related to one in
channel X, the two have to be consistent with the transfer function. We
formulate two methods for testing the consistency between the burst triggers in
channel X and channel H. One method makes use of the \emph{null-stream}
constructed from channel H and the \emph{transferred} channel X, and the second
involves cross-correlating the two. We demonstrate the efficiency of the veto
by `injecting' instrumental glitches in the hardware of the GEO 600 detector.
The \emph{veto safety} is demonstrated by performing GW-like hardware
injections. We also show an example application of this method using 5 days of

Owing to their large surface-to-volume ratio, the surfaces and interfaces of
NCs play a crucial role in determining their properties. Here we focus on
positron 2D angular correlation of annihilation radiation (2D-ACAR) and

getting estimates for the Ginzburg-Landau energy with external magnetic field

that for configurations close to minimizers or local minimizers of the energy,
the vorticity mass of the configuration $(u,A)$ is comparable to the
$L^{2,\infty}$ Lorentz space norm of $\nabla_A u$. We also establish
convergence of the gauge-invariant Jacobians (vorticity measures) in the dual

An implementation as an external super-symmetry $\C{E}=ic\C{P}$ is suggested,
generalizing the Wick rotation ``trick''. Taking advantage of the
interpretation of entropy as a measure of symmetry, it is naturally asimilated

  Hence, in Dynkin types A and D, all higher cluster phenomena are implicit in

ability to accurately determine intrinsic switching field distributions in
interacting granular magnetic materials such as perpendicular recording media.
In particular, we study how this methodology fails for large ferromagnetic
inter-granular interactions, at which point the associated strongly correlated
magnetization reversal cannot be properly represented by the mean-field
approximation, upon which the $\Delta H(M,\Delta M)$ method is based. In this
study, we use a 2-dimensional array of symmetric hysterons that have an
intrinsic switching field distribution of standard deviation $\sigma$ and
ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor interactions $J$. We find the $\Delta H(M,\Delta
M)$ method to be very accurate for small $J/\sigma$ values, while substantial
errors develop once the effective exchange field becomes comparable with
$\sigma$, corroborating earlier results from micromagnetic simulations. We
furthermore demonstrate that this failure is correlated with deviations from
data set redundancy, which is a key property of the mean-field approximation.
Thus, the $\Delta H(M,\Delta M)$ method fails in a well defined and
quantifiable manner that can be easily assessed from the data sets alone.

on electrons in quasi-elastic (e,e') scattering is often accounted for by the
effective momentum approximation. This method is a plane wave Born
approximation which takes the twofold effect of the attractive nucleus on
initial and final state electrons into account, namely the modification of the
electron momentum in the vicinity of the nucleus, and the focusing of electrons
towards the nuclear region leading to an enhancement of the corresponding wave
function amplitudes. The focusing effect due to the attractive Coulomb field of
a homogeneously charged sphere on a classical ensemble of charged particles
incident on the field is calculated in the highly relativistic limit and
compared to results obtained from exact solutions of the Dirac equation. The
result is relevant for the theoretical foundation of the effective momentum
approximation and describes the high energy behavior of the amplitude of
continuum Dirac waves in the potential of a homogeneously charged sphere. Our
findings indicate that the effective momentum approximation is a useful
approximation for the calculation of Coulomb corrections in (e,e') scattering
off heavy nuclei for sufficiently high electron energies and momentum transfer.
