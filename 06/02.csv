deformation-induced interaction between two colloidal particles trapped at a
fluid interface in the regime of small deformations. In many studies, this
interaction has been computed with the ansatz that the actual interface
configuration for the pair is given by the linear superposition of the
interface deformations around the single particles. Here we assess the validity
of this approach and compute the leading term of the effective interaction for
large interparticle separation beyond this so-called superposition
approximation. As an application, we consider the experimentally relevant case
of interface deformations owing to the electrostatic field emanating from
charged colloidal particles. In mechanical isolation, i.e., if the net force
acting on the total system consisting of the particles plus the interface
vanishes, the superposition approximation is actually invalid. The effective
capillary interaction is governed by contributions beyond this approximation
and turns out to be attractive. For sufficiently small surface charges on the
colloids, such that linearization is strictly valid, and at asymptotically
large separations, the effective interaction does not overcome the direct
electrostatic repulsion between the colloidal particles.

a regime characterised by shorter average path length, lower degree
assortativity and higher central point dominance. In the second part of the

The model gives reliable folding rate predictions provided excluded volume
terms that induce minor structural cooperativity are included in the
interaction potential. In general, the cooperative folding routes have sharper
interfaces between folded and unfolded regions of the folding nucleus and
higher free energy barriers. The calculated free energy barriers are strongly
correlated with native topology as characterized by contact order. Increasing
the rigidity of the folding nucleus changes the local structure of the
transition state ensemble non-uniformly across the set of protein studied.
Neverthless, the calculated prefactors k0 are found to be relatively uniform
across the protein set, with variation in 1/k0 less than a factor of five. This
direct calculation justifies the common assumption that the prefactor is
roughly the same for all small two-state folding proteins. Using the barrier

we find that 1/k0 (1-5)us (with average 1/k0 4us). This model can be extended

estimated the Doppler factor with the VLA or MERLIN core and the total 408 MHz
luminosity for a sample of 170 BL Lac objects. The intrinsic (comoving)
synchrotron peak frequency was then calculated by using the estimated Doppler
factor. Assuming a Lorentz factor of 5, the viewing angle of jets was
constrained. The high-resolution VLBI images of seven sources all show a
core-jet structure. We estimated the proper motions of three sources with the
VLBI archive data, and find that the apparent speed increases with the distance
of components to the core for all of them. In our BL Lacs sample, the Doppler
factor of LBLs is systematically larger than that of IBLs and HBLs. We find a
significant anti-correlation between the total 408 MHz luminosity and the
intrinsic synchrotron peak frequency. However, the scatter is much larger than
for the blazar sequence. Moreover, we find a significant positive correlation
between the viewing angle and the intrinsic synchrotron peak frequency. The BL
Lac objects show a continuous distribution on the viewing angle. While LBLs
have a smaller viewing angle than that of IBLs and HBLs, IBLs are comparable to
HBLs. We conclude that the intrinsic synchrotron peak frequency is not only
related to the intrinsic radio power (though with a large scatter), but also to
the viewing angle for the present sample.

proven useful but is inconsistent in the meaning assigned to each arrow (or

Conversely, modern high-throughput experiments give rise to standardized

we can embed classical pathways within large-scale networks and thus
demonstrate the crosstalk between them. As more diverse types of
high-throughput data become available, we can effectively merge both
perspectives, embedding pathways simultaneously in multiple networks. However,
the original problem still remains - the current edge representation is
inadequate to accurately convey all the information in pathways. Therefore, we
suggest that a standardized, well-defined, edge ontology is necessary and
propose a prototype here, as a starting point for reaching this goal.

pressure support becomes less important in large haloes, and this produces a

superconducting transition temperature Tc, creating an energy gap D in the
electronic density of states (DOS). In the high-Tc superconductors, a partial
gap in the DOS exists for a range of temperatures above Tc. A key question is
whether the gap in the DOS above Tc is associated with pairing, and what
determines the temperature at which incoherent pairs form. Here we report the
first spatially resolved measurements of gap formation in a high-Tc
superconductor, measured on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d samples with different Tc values
(hole concentration of 0.12 to 0.22) using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Over
a wide range of doping from 0.16 to 0.22 we find that pairing gaps nucleate in
nanoscale regions above Tc. These regions proliferate as the temperature is
lowered, resulting in a spatial distribution of gap sizes in the
superconducting state. Despite the inhomogeneity, we find that every pairing
gap develops locally at a temperature Tp, following the relation 2D/kBTp = 8.
At very low doping (<0.14), systematic changes in the DOS indicate the presence
of another phenomenon, which is unrelated and perhaps competes with electron
pairing. Our observation of nanometre-sized pairing regions provides the
missing microscopic basis for understanding recent reports of fluctuating
superconducting response above Tc in hole-doped high-Tc copper oxide

remains passive as long as it is isolated. However, when a green cluster comes
in touch with the red substance, it is immediately invaded by the latter, stops
growing and starts to act as red substance itself. In our main model space is
represented by a graph, of which initially each vertex is randomly green, red
or white (vacant), and the growth of the green clusters is similar to that in
first-passage percolation. The main issues we investigate are whether the model
is well-defined on an infinite graph (e.g. the $d$-dimensional cubic lattice),
and what can be said about the distribution of the size of a green cluster just
before it is paralyzed. We show that, if the initial density of red vertices is
positive, and that of white vertices is sufficiently small, the model is indeed
well-defined and the above distribution has an exponential tail. In fact, we
believe this to be true whenever the initial density of red is positive. This
research also led to a relation between invasion percolation and critical
Bernoulli percolation which seems to be of independent interest.

been measured, at least three appear to be considerably larger than theoretical
estimates suggest. It has been proposed by Bodenheimer, Lin & Mardling that
undetected companions acting to excite the orbital eccentricity are responsible
for these oversized planets, as they find new equilibrium radii in response to
being tidally heated. In the case of HD 209458, this hypothesis has been
rejected by some authors because there is no sign of such a companion at the 5
m/s level, and because it is difficult to say conclusively that the
eccentricity is non-zero. Transit timing analysis [...]. Whether or not a
companion is responsible for the large radius of HD 209458b, almost certainly
some short-period systems have companions which force their eccentricities to
nonzero values. This paper is dedicated to quantifying this effect.
  The eccentricity of a short-period planet will only be excited as long as its
(non-resonant) companion's eccentricity is non-zero. Here we show that the
latter decays on a timescale which depends on the structure of the interior
planet, a timescale which is often shorter than the lifetime of the system.
This includes Earth-mass planets in the habitable zones of some stars. We
determine which configurations are capable of sustaining significant
eccentricity for at least the age of the system, and show that these include
systems with companion masses as low as a fraction of an Earth mass. The
orbital parameters of such companions are consistent with recent calculations
which show that the migration process can induce the formation of low mass
planets external to the orbits of hot Jupiters. Systems with inflated planets
are therefore good targets in the search for terrestrial planets.

Our goal is to investigate the situation between these two extremes. Using
recently proposed \emph{effective capacity} concept, we derive a closed-form
formula for this tradeoff. For SISO case, an asymptotically tight upper bound
for our distortion-delay curve is derived, which approaches to the infinite
delay lower bound as $\mathcal{D}_\infty \exp(\frac{C}{\tau_n})$, with $\tau_n$

continuous-symmetry spins is more realistic than the rather better understood
Ising variant. In principle, the nature of an occurring spin-glass phase in
such systems might be inferred from an analysis of the zero-temperature
properties. Unfortunately, with few exceptions, the problem of finding
ground-state configurations is a non-polynomial problem computationally, such
that efficient approximation algorithms are called for. Here, we employ the
recently developed genetic embedded matching (GEM) heuristic to investigate the
nature of the zero-temperature phase of the bimodal XY spin glass in two
dimensions. We analyze bulk properties such as the asymptotic ground-state
energy and the phase diagram of disorder strength vs. disorder concentration.
For the case of a symmetric distribution of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
bonds, we find that the ground state of the model is unique up to a global O(2)
rotation of the spins. In particular, there are no extensive degeneracies in
this model. The main focus of this work is on an investigation of the
excitation spectrum as probed by changing the boundary conditions. Using
appropriate finite-size scaling techniques, we consistently determine the
stiffness of spin and chiral domain walls and the corresponding fractal
dimensions. Most noteworthy, we find that the spin and chiral channels are
characterized by two distinct stiffness exponents and, consequently, the system
displays spin-chirality decoupling at large length scales. Results for the
overlap distribution do not support the possibility of a multitude of
thermodynamic pure states.

evaluates plausible alternatives to the side chain conformations found by
conventional peptide or protein structure determination methods. The proposed
analysis determines the populations of side chain rotational isomers and the
probability distribution of these populations. The following steps are repeated
for each side chain of a peptide or protein: first, extract the local molecular
mechanics of side chain rotational isomerization from a single representative
global conformation; second, expand the predominant set of rotational isomers
to include all probable rotational isomers down to those that constitute just a
small percentage of the population; and third, evaluate the constraints vicinal
coupling constants and NOESY cross relaxation rates place on rotational isomer
populations. In this article we apply conformational gel analysis to the cobalt
glycyl-leucine dipeptide and detail the steps necessary to generalize the
analysis to other amino acid side chains in other peptides and proteins. For a
side chain buried within a protein interior, it is noteworthy that the set of
probable rotational isomers may contain one or more rotational isomers that are
not identified by conventional NMR structure determination methods. In cases
such as this the conformational gel graphics fully accounts for the interplay
of molecular mechanics and NMR data constraints on the population estimates.
The analysis is particularly suited to identifying side chain rotational
isomers that constitute a small percentage of the population, but nevertheless
might be structurally and functionally very significant.

analysis with a model of the coronal magnetic field, we compute the magnetic

explained in terms of a localized magnetic reconnection process occurring at a
coronal magnetic null point. This null point is also present at the same
location one day later, on 28 October, 2003. Magnetic energy release at this

physical phenomena can be influenced by certain control parameters or inputs.
Although these models are very powerful when dealing with physical phenomena,
they are less suitable to describe software and hardware interfacing the
physical world. For this reason there is a growing interest in describing
control systems through symbolic models that are abstract descriptions of the
continuous dynamics, where each ""symbol"" corresponds to an ""aggregate"" of
states in the continuous model. Since these symbolic models are of the same
nature of the models used in computer science to describe software and
hardware, they provide a unified language to study problems of control in which
software and hardware interact with the physical world. Furthermore the use of
symbolic models enables one to leverage techniques from supervisory control and
algorithms from game theory for controller synthesis purposes. In this paper we
show that every incrementally globally asymptotically stable nonlinear control
system is approximately equivalent (bisimilar) to a symbolic model. The
approximation error is a design parameter in the construction of the symbolic
model and can be rendered as small as desired. Furthermore if the state space
of the control system is bounded the obtained symbolic model is finite. For
digital control systems, and under the stronger assumption of incremental
input-to-state stability, symbolic models can be constructed through a suitable
quantization of the inputs.

considerable extended emission, not only from the main arms I S and I N, but
also from the weaker arms. The large--scale magnetic field exhibits
well--ordered spiral structure with almost the same orientation as that of the
optical spiral arms, however, it does not show a clear structural correlation

polarization that is frequency-dependent. We found that the ring mean spectral
index versus radius increases faster beyond $R$ = 4 kpc. At each wavelength,
the exponential scale length is larger inside than outside $R$ = 4 kpc. From
the larger scales lengths at $R$ $<$ 4 kpc, we conclude that star forming
regions are mainly spread over the region $R$ $<$ 4 kpc without a dominant
nuclear concentration. Furthermore, at $R$ $<$ 4 kpc, a spatial correlation
between cosmic rays and star forming regions may exist. From the behaviour of
the mean spectral indices obtained from different pairs of the radio continuum

alignment between the orientation of the group central substructure (GCS) and
the distribution of its satellites, radial alignment between the orientation of
a satellite and the direction towards its GCS, and direct alignment between the
orientation of the GCS and that of its satellites. In analogy we use the
directions of satellite velocities and probe three further types of alignment:
the radial velocity alignment between the satellite velocity and connecting
line between satellite and GCS, the halo velocity alignment between the
orientation of the GCS and satellite velocities and the auto velocity alignment
between the satellites orientations and their velocities. We find that
satellites are preferentially located along the major axis of the GCS within at
least 6 Rvir (the range probed here). Furthermore, satellites preferentially
point towards the GCS. The most pronounced signal is detected on small scales
but a detectable signal extends out to 6 Rvir. The direct alignment signal is
weaker, however a systematic trend is visible at distances < 2 Rvir. All
velocity alignments are highly significant on small scales. Our results suggest
that the halo alignment reflects the filamentary large scale structure which
extends far beyond the virial radii of the groups. In contrast, the main
contribution to the radial alignment arises from the adjustment of the
satellite orientations in the group tidal field. The projected data reveal good
agreement with recent results derived from large galaxy surveys. (abridged)

that predicted by the standard Jaynes-Cummings model. %The model developed can

exciton transition frequency, a duplet is appeared with one component shifted

the strong light--mater coupling regime arises in the weak-field limit. A
physical interpretation of the predicted effects has been proposed.

components of the digital watermarking systems. Thus in this work, we discuss
how to design a better embedder and detector (or decoder). I first give a
summary of the prospective applications of watermarking technology and major
watermarking schemes in the literature. My review on the literature closely
centers upon how the side information is exploited at both embedders and
detectors. In Chapter 3, I explore the optimum detector or decoder according to
a particular probability distribution of the host signals. We found that the
performance of both multiplicative and additive spread spectrum schemes depends
on the shape parameter of the host signals. For spread spectrum schemes, the
performance of the detector or the decoder is reduced by the host interference.
Thus I present a new host-interference rejection technique for the
multiplicative spread spectrum schemes. Its embedding rule is tailored to the
optimum detection or decoding rule. Though the host interference rejection
schemes enjoy a big performance gain over the traditional spread spectrum
schemes, their drawbacks that it is difficult for them to be implemented with
the perceptual analysis to achieve the maximum allowable embedding level
discourage their use in real scenarios. Thus, in the last chapters of this
work, I introduce a double-sided technique to tackle this drawback. It differs
from the host interference rejection schemes in that it utilizes but does not
reject the host interference at its embedder. The perceptual analysis can be
