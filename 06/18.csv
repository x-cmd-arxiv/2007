ferroelectric devices. It turns out that at reduced scales and dimensionalities
the material's properties depend crucially on the intricacies of domain
formation, that is, the way the crystal splits into regions with polarization

Surprisingly that in the equilibrium state a PBH growth is a long-lived process

Eddington limit. This should lead to considerable expansion of a star and a
global stability loss. Microscopic PBHs can exist in the interior of planetary
bodies too. To produce the required excess of thermal energy on Jupiter and

previously by us in such a way in which every member in the class is
non-\textit{PT}-symmetric. For every member of the class, the ground state is a
constant with zero energy eigen value. Instead of using an infinite set of
coupled operator equations to calculate the metric operator we used a simple
realization to obtain the class of closed form metric operators corresponding
to the class of non-Hermitian and non-\textit{PT}-symmetric Hamiltonians
introduced. The trick is that, if $\psi$ is an eigen function of $H$, then
$\phi=\eta\psi$ is an eigen function of $H^{\dagger}$ with the same eigen
value. Thus, knowing any pair $(\psi ,\phi)$ one can deduce the form of the
exact metric operator. We note that, the class of Hamiltonians generalized in
this work has the form of that of imaginary magnetic field which can be
absorbed by the quasi-gauge transformations represented by metric operators.
Accordingly, it is expected that the $Q$ operators will disappear for the whole
members in the class in the path integral formulation. However, the detailed
analysis of this issue will appear in another work.

possible evidence for a small-scale cluster-subcluster merger as a cause of the

considerably better understandings but also new details of the complex

transitions fall into two classes: the first presents the critical behaviors of

significantly delayed in the WMAP3 cosmology, because the initial matter
fluctuation amplitude is lower on the relevant scales. The decrease in dark
matter clustering strength is, however, almost entirely offset by an increase
in halo bias, so predictions for galaxy clustering are barely altered. In both
cosmologies several combinations of physical parameters can reproduce observed,
low-redshift galaxy properties; the star formation, supernova feedback and AGN
feedback efficiencies can be played off against each other to give similar
results. Models which fit observed luminosity functions predict projected
2-point correlation functions which scatter by about 10-20 per cent on large
scale and by larger factors on small scale, depending both on cosmology and on
details of galaxy formation. Measurements of the pairwise velocity distribution
prefer the WMAP1 cosmology, but careful treatment of the systematics is needed.
Given current modelling uncertainties, it is not easy to distinguish the WMAP1
and WMAP3 cosmologies on the basis of low-redshift galaxy properties. Model
predictions diverge more dramatically at high redshift. Better observational
data at z>2 will better constrain galaxy formation and perhaps also
cosmological parameters.

QCD-vacuum behavior close to the regime of asymptotic freedom. QCD-vacuum
behaves effectively like a ""paramagnetic system"" of a classical theory in the
sense that virtual color charges (gluons) emerge in it as spin effect of a
paramagnetic material when a magnetic field aligns their microscopic magnetic
dipoles. Making a classical analogy with the paramagnetism of Landau's
theory,we are able to introduce a kind of Landau effective action without
temperature and phase transition for simply representing QCD-vacuum behavior at
higher energies as magnetization of a paramagnetic material in the presence of
a magnetic field H. This reasoning allows us to use Thompson's heuristic
approach in order to extract an ""effective susceptibility"" ($\chi>0$) of
QCD-vacuum. It depends on logarithmic of energy scale u to investigate hadronic
matter. Consequently,we are able to get an ""effective magnetic permeability""
($\mu>1$) of such a ""paramagnetic vacuum"". As QCD-vacuum must obey Lorentz
invariance,the attainment of $\mu>1$ must simply require that the ""effective
electrical permissivity"" is $\epsilon<1$,in such a way that $\mu\epsilon=1$
(c^2=1).This leads to the antiscreening effect, where the asymptotic freedom
takes place. On the other hand, quarks cofinement, a subject which is not
treatable by perturbative calculations, is worked by the present approach. We
apply the method to study this subject in order to obtain the string constant,
which is in agreement with the experiments.

reference sample of isolated galaxies in order to estimate the environmental
effects on the formation and evolution of galaxies. The goal of this paper is
to provide a measure of the environment of the isolated galaxies in the AMIGA
sample, quantifying the influence of the candidate neighbours identified in our
previous work and their potential effects on the evolution of the primary
galaxies. Here we provide a quantification of the isolation degree of the
galaxies in this sample. Our starting sample is the Catalogue of Isolated
Galaxies (CIG). We used two parameters to estimate the influence exerted by the
neighbour galaxies on the CIG galaxy: the local number density of neighbour
galaxies and the tidal strength affecting the CIG galaxy. We show that both
parameters together provide a comprehensive picture of the environment. For
comparison, those parameters have also been derived for galaxies in denser
environments such as triplets, groups and clusters. The CIG galaxies show a
continuous spectrum of isolation, as quantified by the two parameters, from
very isolated to interacting. The fraction of CIG galaxies whose properties are
expected to be influenced by the environment is however low (159 out of 950
galaxies). The isolated parameters derived for the comparsion samples gave
higher values than for the CIG and we found clear differences for the average
values of the 4 samples considered, proving the sensitivity of these
parameters. The environment of the galaxies in the CIG has been characterised,
using two complementary parameters quantifying the isolation degree, the local
number density of the neighbour galaxies and the tidal forces affecting the
isolated galaxies. (Abridged)

exoplanet, impressively demonstrated the sensitivity of the microlensing
technique to extra-solar planets below 10 M_earth. A planet of 1 M_earth in the
same spot would have provided a detectable deviation with an amplitude of ~ 3 %
and a duration of ~ 12 h. An early detection of a deviation could trigger
higher-cadence sampling which would have allowed the discovery of an Earth-mass
planet in this case. Here, we describe the implementation of an automated
anomaly detector, embedded into the eSTAR system, that profits from immediate
feedback provided by the robotic telescopes that form the RoboNet-1.0 network.
It went into operation for the 2007 microlensing observing season. As part of
our discussion about an optimal strategy for planet detection, we shed some new
light on whether concentrating on highly-magnified events is promising and
planets in the 'resonant' angular separation equal to the angular Einstein
radius are revealed most easily. Given that sub-Neptune mass planets can be
considered being common around the host stars probed by microlensing
(preferentially M- and K-dwarfs), the higher number of events that can be
monitored with a network of 2m telescopes and the increased detection
efficiency for planets below 5 M_earth arising from an optimized strategy gives
a common effort of current microlensing campaigns a fair chance to detect an
Earth-mass planet (from the ground) ahead of the COROT or Kepler missions. The
detection limit of gravitational microlensing extends even below 0.1 M_earth,
but such planets are not very likely to be detected from current campaigns.
However, these will be within the reach of high-cadence monitoring with a
network of wide-field telescopes or a space-based telescope.

HII region, driving a CO bipolar outflow, and located at the center of a

maser observations suggest that the HC region is expanding and accretion onto
the star is halted. Aims. This study aims to confirm the expansion scenario
proposed for the HC region on the basis of recent H2O maser observations.
Methods. We carried out continuum VLA observations at 1.3cm and 7mm with the A
array plus Pie Town configuration to map the HC region towards G24 A1. Results.
The emission of the HC region has been resolved and shows a ring shape
structure. The profiles of the emission obtained by taking slices at different
angles passing through the barycenter of the HC region confirm the shell
structure of the emission. The ratio between the inner and the outer radius of
the shell, Ri/Ro, derived fitting the normalized brightness temperature profile
passing through the peak of the 7mm emission, is 0.9, which indicates that the
shell is thin. The deconvolved outer radius estimated from the fit is 590 AU.
These results imply that the HC region in G24 A1 cannot be described in terms
of a classical, homogeneous HII region but is instead an ionized shell. This
gives support to the model of an expanding wind-driven, ionized shell suggested
by the kinematics and distribution of the H2O masers associated with the HC
region. According to this model, the HC region is expanding on very short times
scales, 21-66 yr.

proposed to explain these results and, hence, to contribute significantly to
the mass budget of our Galaxy. However, several constraints on the role played
by regular carbon-oxygen white dwarfs exist. Massivewhite dwarfs are thought to
be made of a mixture of oxygen and neon. Correspondingly, their cooling rate is
larger than those of typical carbon-oxygen white dwarfs and they fade to
invisibility in short timescales. Consequently, they constitute a good
candidate for explaining the microlensing results. Here, we examine in detail
this hypothesis by using the most recent and up-to-date cooling tracks for
massive white dwarfs and a Monte Carlo simulator which takes into account the
most relevant Galactic inputs. We find that oxygen-neon white dwarfs cannot
account for a substantial fraction of the microlensing depth towards the LMC,
independently of the adopted initial mass function, although some microlensing
events could be due to oxygen--neon white dwarfs. The white dwarf population
contributes at most a 5% to the mass of the Galactic halo.

markedly different astrophysical scenarios. The communality is that they are
all emitted in the formation of a black hole with small or null angular
momentum. The following sequence appears to be canonical: the vacuum
polarization process creating an optically thick self accelerating
electron-positron plasma; the engulfment of baryonic mass during the plasma
expansion; the adiabatic expansion of the optically thick ""fireshell"" up to the
transparency; the interaction of the remaining accelerated baryons with the
interstellar medium (ISM). This leads to the canonical GRB composed of a proper
GRB (P-GRB), emitted at the moment of transparency, followed by an extended
afterglow. The parameters are the plasma total energy, the fireshell baryon
loading and the ISM filamentary distribution around the source. In the limit of
no baryon loading the total energy is radiated in the P-GRB. In this limit, the
canonical GRBs explain as well the short GRBs.

pulsars with spin-down derived magnetic fields in the magnetar range. However,
their observational properties appears to be more similar to classical radio
pulsars than to magnetars. To shed light on this puzzle we first have to
determine whether the spin-down derived magnetic field values for these radio
pulsars are indeed representative of the actual neutron star magnetic field or
if they are polluted, e.g. by the effects of a torque from a fallback disk. To
investigate this possibility, we have performed deep IR observations of one of
these high magnetic field radio pulsars (PSR J1119-6127) with the ESO VLT to
search for IR emission which can be associated with a disk. No IR emission is
detected from the pulsar position down to J=24, H=23, Ks=22. By comparing our

that we can only exclude the presence of a disk with accretion rate dot M
>3x10^16 g/s. This lower limit cannot rule out the presence of a substantial
disk torque on the pulsar, which would then lead to overestimate the value of
the magnetic field inferred from P and dot P.

correlations between them, and the physics behind them, are still not well
understood. Apart from accretion rates and black hole masses, density and
outflows were speculated to be among the main drivers of the NLS1 phenomenon.
Here, we utilize the diagnostic power of the [SII]6716,6731 intensity ratio to
measure the density of the NLR systematically and homogeneously for a large
sample of NLS1 galaxies, and we perform a comparison with a sample of
broad-line type 1 AGN. We report the discovery of a zone of avoidance in
density in the sense that AGN with broad lines (FWHM_Hbeta > 2000 km/s) avoid
low densities, while NLS1 galaxies show a wider distribution in the NLR
density, including a significant number of objects with low densities. A
correlation analysis further shows that the Eddington ratio L/L_Edd
anti-correlates with density. We investigate a number of different models for
the zone of avoidance in density. Supersolar metallicities and temperature
effects, a strong starburst contribution in NLS1 galaxies, different NLR
extents and selective obscuration are considered unlikely. Possible differences
in the fraction of matter-bounded clouds and differences in the interstellar
media of the host galaxies of NLS1 galaxies and broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLS1)
galaxies can only be tested further with future observations. We tentatively
favor the effects of winds/outflows, stronger in NLS1 galaxies than in BLS1
galaxies, to explain the observations.

trivially decisive (for every set F), this also holds for many classes of
infinite Markov chains. Infinite Markov chains which contain a finite attractor
are decisive w.r.t. every set F. In particular, this holds for probabilistic
lossy channel systems (PLCS). Furthermore, all globally coarse Markov chains
are decisive. This class includes probabilistic vector addition systems (PVASS)
and probabilistic noisy Turing machines (PNTM). We consider both safety and
liveness problems for decisive Markov chains, i.e., the probabilities that a
given set of states F is eventually reached or reached infinitely often,
respectively. 1. We express the qualitative problems in abstract terms for
decisive Markov chains, and show an almost complete picture of its decidability

of the theory of extreme values is applied to the maximal extremes of the time

chosen threshold and a generalized Pareto distribution is fitted to the tail of
the empirical cumulative distribution. A maximum likelihood method is used to
estimate the parameters of the generalized Pareto distribution and confidence
levels are also given to the parameters. Due to the lack of an automatic
procedure for selecting the threshold, we analyze the sensitivity of the fitted
generalized Pareto distribution to the exact value of the threshold. According
to the available data, that only spans the previous ~250 years, the cumulative
distribution of the time series is bounded, yielding an upper limit of 324 for
the sunspot number. We also estimate that the return value for each solar cycle
is ~188, while the return value for a century increases to ~228. Finally, the
results also indicate that the most probable return time for a large event like
the maximum at solar cycle 19 happens once every ~700 years and that the
probability of finding such a large event with a frequency smaller than ~50
years is very small. In spite of the essentially extrapolative character of
these results, their statistical significance is very large.

clustering to the simple case of the Zeldovich dynamics. Using the well-known
exact solution of the Zeldovich dynamics we can compare the predictions of
these various perturbative methods with the exact nonlinear result and study
their convergence properties. We find that most systematic expansions fail to
recover the decay of the response function in the highly nonlinear regime.
``Linear methods'' lead to increasingly fast growth in the nonlinear regime for
higher orders, except for Pade approximants that give a bounded response at any
order. ``Nonlinear methods'' manage to obtain some damping at one-loop order
but they fail at higher orders. Although it recovers the exact Gaussian
damping, a resummation in the high-k limit is not justified very well as the
generation of nonlinear power does not originate from a finite range of
wavenumbers (hence there is no simple separation of scales). No method is able
to recover the relaxation of the matter power spectrum on highly nonlinear
scales. It is possible to impose a Gaussian cutoff in a somewhat ad-hoc fashion
to reproduce the behavior of the exact two-point functions for two different
times. However, this cutoff is not directly related to the clustering of matter
and disappears in exact equal-time statistics such as the matter power
spectrum. On a quantitative level, the usual perturbation theory, and the
nonlinear scheme to which one adds an ansatz for the response function with
such a Gaussian cutoff, are the two most efficient methods. These results
should hold for the gravitational dynamics as well (this has been checked at
one-loop order), since the structure of the equations of motion is identical
for both dynamics.

has a size of 0.19 x 0.13 arcsec and a 1.3mm brightness temperature of 90K.
This implies that the dust ring in the West nucleus has a high opacity, with

and far-IR, but it is surrounded by the previously-known, rapidly rotating
molecular disk of size 0.5 arcsec that is also optically thick in the mid-IR.
The molecular ring is cooler than the hot dust disk because the CO(2-1) line is
seen in absorption against the dust disk. The dust ring is massive (1E9 solar
masses), compact (radius 35pc), and hot (true dust temperature 170K). It
resembles rather strikingly the dust ring detected around the quasar APM
08279+52, and is most unlike the warm, extended dust sources in starburst
galaxies. Because there is a strong temperature gradient from the hot dust ring
to the cooler molecular disk, the heating must come from a concentrated source,
an AGN accretion disk that is completely invisible at optical wavelengths, and
heavily obscured in hard X-rays.

random recurrent neural networks with biological connectivity, i.e. sparse
connections and separate populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We
furthermore consider that the neuron dynamics may occur at a (shorter) time
scale than synaptic plasticity and consider the possibility of learning rules
with passive forgetting. We show that the application of such Hebbian learning
leads to drastic changes in the network dynamics and structure. In particular,
the learning rule contracts the norm of the weight matrix and yields a rapid
decay of the dynamics complexity and entropy. In other words, the network is
rewired by Hebbian learning into a new synaptic structure that emerges with
learning on the basis of the correlations that progressively build up between
neurons. We also observe that, within this emerging structure, the strongest
synapses organize as a small-world network. The second effect of the decay of
the weight matrix spectral radius consists in a rapid contraction of the
spectral radius of the Jacobian matrix. This drives the system through the
``edge of chaos'' where sensitivity to the input pattern is maximal. Taken
together, this scenario is remarkably predicted by theoretical arguments
derived from dynamical systems and graph theory.

cryptography. It allows to transform a raw key about which an attacker has some
limited knowledge into a fully secure random key, on which the attacker has
essentially no information. Up to date, only very few randomness-extraction
techniques are known to work against an attacker holding quantum information on
the raw key. This is very much in contrast to the classical (non-quantum)
setting, which is much better understood and for which a vast amount of
different techniques are known and proven to work.
  We prove a new randomness-extraction technique, which is known to work in the
classical setting, to be secure against a quantum attacker as well. Randomness
extraction is done by XOR'ing a so-called delta-biased mask to the raw key. Our
result allows to extend the classical applications of this extractor to the
quantum setting. We discuss the following two applications. We show how to
encrypt a long message with a short key, information-theoretically secure
against a quantum attacker, provided that the attacker has enough quantum
uncertainty on the message. This generalizes the concept of entropically-secure
encryption to the case of a quantum attacker. As second application, we show
how to do error-correction without leaking partial information to a quantum
attacker. Such a technique is useful in settings where the raw key may contain
errors, since standard error-correction techniques may provide the attacker
with information on, say, a secret key that was used to obtain the raw key.

matter structures, independent of the dynamical or hydrostatic equilibrium
properties of the deflecting system. However, it depends on the kinematic
status. In fact, either a translational motion or a coherent rotation of the
mass distribution can affect the lensing properties. Here, light deflection by
galaxy clusters in motion is considered. Even if gravitational lensing mass
measurements of galaxy clusters are regarded as very reliable estimates, the
kinematic effect should be considered. A typical peculiar motion with respect
to the Hubble flow brings about a systematic error < 0.3%, independent of the
mass of the cluster. On the other hand, the effect of the spin increases with
the total mass. For cluster masses ~ 10^{15}M_{sun}, the effect of the
gravitomagnetic term is < 0.04% on strong lensing estimates and < 0.5% in the
weak lensing analyses. The total kinematic effect on the mass estimate is then
< 1%, which is negligible in current statistical studies. In the weak lensing
regime, the rotation imprints a typical angular modulation in the tangential
shear distortion. This would allow in principle a detection of the
gravitomagnetic field and a direct measurement of the angular velocity of the
cluster but the required background source densities are well beyond current
tecnological capabilities.

relevance to the analysis of the spatial distribution of crystalline dust

meteorites and comets in our own solar system.
  A debate has gone on in the recent literature on the ratio of the effective
viscosity coefficient $\nu$ (responsible for accretion) to the turbulent
diffusion coefficient $D$ (responsible for mixing). Numerical
magneto-hydrodynamic simulations have yielded values between $\nu/D\simeq 10$

are based on elegant, though strongly simplified assumptions. We argue that
whichever of these numbers comes closest to reality may be determined {\em
observationally} by using spatially resolved mid-infrared measurements of
protoplanetary disks around Herbig stars. If meridional flows are present in
the disk, then we expect less abundance of crystalline dust in the surface
layers, a prediction which can likewise be observationally tested with
mid-infrared interferometers.

imperfect information about the history of a play, namely, on the past sequence

not see the private state of the plant. Our main results are twofold. First, we
give a fixed-point algorithm for computing the set of states from which a
player can win with a deterministic observation-based strategy for any
omega-regular objective. The fixed point is computed in the lattice of
antichains of state sets. This algorithm has the advantages of being directed
by the objective and of avoiding an explicit subset construction on the game
graph. Second, we give an algorithm for computing the set of states from which
a player can win with probability 1 with a randomized observation-based

of perfect information, randomized strategies are more powerful than
deterministic ones. We show that our algorithms are optimal by proving matching

examined. Two types of laboratory experiments aimed at seeking and measuring
the local space anisotropy are proposed. In terms of the conventional special
relativity theory, which treats 3D space to be locally isotropic, the
experiments are of the type of ``null-experiments''. In the first-type
experiments, a feasible Doppler shift of frequency is measured by the
M\""ossbauer effect, with the M\""ossbauer source and absorber being located at
two identical and diametrically opposed distances from the center of a rapidly
rotating rotor, while the $\gamma$-quanta are recorded by two stationary and
oppositely positioned proportional counters. Either of the counters records
only those $\gamma$-quanta that passed through the absorber at the moment of
the passage of the latter near a counter. The second-type experiments are made
using the latest radio physics techniques for generating monochromatic
oscillations and for recording weak signals. The effect expected due to space
anisotropy consists in frequency modulation of the harmonic oscillations coming
to a receiver that rotates at a constant velocity around the monochromatic wave
emitter. In this case the modulation depth proves to be proportional to the
space anisotropy magnitude.

69 nearby galaxies chosen to span a wide range of Hubble types. Our goal is to
determine how useful a pixel approach is for studying galaxies according to
their stellar light distributions and content. The galaxy images were analysed
on a pixel-by-pixel basis to reveal the structure of the individual pCMDs. We
find that the average surface brightness (or projected mass density) in each
pixel varies according to galaxy type. Early-type galaxies exihibit a clear
``prime sequence'' and some pCMDs of face-on spirals reveal ``inverse-L''
structures. We find that the colour dispersion at a given magnitude is found to
be approximately constant in early-type galaxies but this quantity varies in
the mid and late-types. We investigate individual galaxies and find that the
pCMDs can be used to pick out morphological features. We discuss the discovery
of ``Red Hooks'' in the pCMDs of six early-type galaxies and two spirals and
postulate their origins. We develop quantitative methods to characterise the
pCMDs, including measures of the blue-to-red light ratio and colour
distributions of each galaxy and we organise these by morphological type. We
compare the colours of the pixels in each galaxy with the stellar population
models of Bruzual & Charlot (2003) to calculate star formation histories for
each galaxy type and compare these to the stellar mass within each pixel. Maps
of pixel stellar mass and mass-to-light ratio are compared to galaxy images. We
apply the pCMD technique to three galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field to
test the usefulness of the analysis at high redshift. We propose that these
results can be used as part of a new system of automated classification of
galaxies that can be applied at high redshift.

  University",,,,"gr-qc hep-th math-ph math.MP",,"  In the last 20 years, loop quantum gravity, a background independent approach
to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics, has been widely
investigated. The aim of loop quantum gravity is to construct a mathematically
rigorous, background independent, nonperturbative quantum theory for the
Lorentzian gravitational field on a four-dimensional manifold. In this
approach, the principles of quantum mechanics are combined with those of
general relativity naturally. Such a combination provides us a picture of
""quantum Riemannian geometry"", which is discrete at a fundamental scale. In the
investigation of quantum dynamics, the classical expressions of constraints are
quantized as operators. The quantum evolution is contained in the solutions of
the quantum constraint equations. On the other hand, the semi-classical
analysis has to be carried out in order to test the semiclassical limit of the
quantum dynamics.
  In this thesis, the structure of the dynamical theory in loop quantum gravity
is presented pedagogically. The outline is as follows: first we review the
classical formalism of general relativity as a dynamical theory of connections.
Then the kinematical Ashtekar-Isham-Lewandowski representation is introduced as
a foundation of loop quantum gravity. We discuss the construction of a
Hamiltonian constraint operator and the master constraint programme, for both
the cases of pure gravity and matter field coupling. Finally, some strategies
are discussed concerning testing the semiclassical limit of the quantum
dynamics.

deep {\it Spitzer} images. The {\it Spitzer} data used in this analysis are
obtained in the course of the GOODS project from which we select four
independent $10^\prime\times10^\prime$ regions observed at both 3.6 and 4.5
\um. ACS source catalogs for all of these areas are used to construct maps
containing only their emissions in the ACS $B, V, i, z$-bands. We find that
deep Spitzer data exhibit CIB fluctuations remaining after removal of
foreground galaxies of a very different clustering pattern at both 3.6 and 4.5
\um than the ACS galaxies could contribute. We also find that there are very
good correlations between the ACS galaxies and the {\it removed} galaxies in
the Spitzer maps, but practically no correlations remain with the residual
Spitzer maps used to identify the CIB fluctuations. These contributions become
negligible on larger scales used to probe the CIB fluctuations arising from
clustering. This means that the ACS galaxies cannot contribute to the
large-scale CIB fluctuations found in the residual Spitzer data. The absence of
their contributions also means that the CIB fluctuations arise at $z\gsim 7.5$
as the Lyman break of their sources must be redshifted past the longest ACS
band, or the fluctuations have to originate in the more local but extremely low
luminosity galaxies.

  edited by Z. Wang (Springer, Heidelberg)",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  The production of nanopatterns on the surfaces of targets irradiated by ion
beams at low and intermediate energies has developed during the present decade
to a salient degree of control over the main pattern features. However, there
is still a wide experimental scatter in the type and relevance of various
dynamic interfacial properties induced by this technique as a function of
system type and parameters. In parallel, diverse theoretical models exist that
differ in their capabilities to reproduce such a wide range of experimental
features. We provide an overview of the most recent studies of nanoripple and
dot production by ion-beam sputtering, with special attention to the comparison
between experiments and (continuum) models, and with a focus on those issues
that remain open or, at least, ambiguous. These are perhaps more evident for
the case of nanodot patterns on amorphizable targets than for the case of
nanoripples due, possibly, to the relative novelty of the former. The pattern
properties to be considered are those of potential increased technological
importance, such as the variation of nanodot size with parameters like ion
energy, target temperature and sputtering time (i.e., fluence), as well as the
conditions under which the quality of the pattern order is enhanced, issues
such as wavelength coarsening and order enhancement becoming relevant.

suggest how to generalize the method to systems in dimensions that are powers

of progress in recent years, especially with the advent of surveys like the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Here, we study the newly discovered tidal tails of
the Galactic globular cluster NGC 5466. By means of numerical simulations, we
reproduce the shape, direction and surface density of the tidal tails, as well
as the structural and kinematical properties of the present-day NGC 5466.
Although its tails are very extended in SDSS data (> 45 degrees), NGC 5466 is
only losing mass slowly at the present epoch and so can survive for probably a
further Hubble time. The effects of tides at perigalacticon and disc crossing
are the dominant causes of the slow dissolution of NGC 5466, accounting for
about 60 % of the mass loss over the course of its evolution. The morphology of
the tails provides a constraint on the proper motion -- the observationally
determined proper motion has to be refined (within the stated error margins) to
match the location of the tidal tails.

The theoretical relations are in general good agreement with their
observational counterparts though there exist some discrepancy for short period
(log [P] < 1) Cepheids. We outline a physical mechanism which can, in
principle, be one factor to explain the observed PC/AC relations for the long
and short period Cepheids in the Galaxy, LMC and SMC. Our explanation relies on
the hydrogen ionization front-photosphere interaction and the way this
interaction changes with pulsation period, pulsation phase and metallicity.
Since the PC relation is connected with the period-luminosity (PL) relation, it
is postulated that such a mechanism can also explain the observed properties of
the PL relation in these three galaxies.
