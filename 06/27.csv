by the data. Inflation also makes predictions which have not been well tested
by current data but can be by future experiments, most notably a deviation from
a scale-invariant power spectrum and the production of primordial gravitational
waves. A scale-invariant spectrum is disfavored by current data, but not
conclusively. Tensor modes are currently poorly constrained, and slow-roll
inflation does not make an unambiguous prediction of the expected amplitude of
primordial gravitational waves. A tensor/scalar ratio of $r \simeq 0.01$ is
within reach of near-future measurements.

curiously decreasing functions of its center of mass acceleration towards
neighbouring mass concentrations. A tentative indication of this breaking of
the Strong Equivalence Principle in field galaxies is the RAVE-observed escape
speed in the Milky Way. Another consequence is that satellites of field
galaxies will move on nearly Keplerian orbits at large radii (100 - 500 kpc),
with a declining speed below the asymptotically constant naive MOND prediction.
But consequences of an environment-sensitive gravity are even more severe in
clusters, where member galaxies accelerate fast: no more Dark-Halo-like
potential is present to support galaxies, meaning that extended axisymmetric
disks of gas and stars are likely unstable. These predicted reappearance of
asymptotic Keplerian velocity curves and disappearance of ""stereotypic
galaxies"" in clusters are falsifiable with targeted surveys.

energy EOS by diagonalizing the covariance matrix. We find three independent
constraints, which taken together imply that the equation of state is more
negative than -0.2 at the 68% confidence level in the redshift range 0<z<1.8,
independent of the flat universe assumption. Our estimates argue against
previous claims of dark energy ``metamorphosis,'' where the EOS was found to be
strongly varying at low redshifts. Our results are inconsistent with extreme
models of dynamical dark energy, both in the form of ``freezing'' models where
the dark energy EOS begins with a value greater than -0.2 at z > 1.2 and rolls
to a value of -1 today, and ``thawing'' models where the EOS is near -1 at high
redshifts, but rapidly evolves to values greater than -0.85 at z < 0.2.
Finally, we propose a parameterization-independent figure-of-merit, to help
assess the ability of future surveys to constrain dark energy. While previous
figures-of-merit presume specific dark energy parameterizations, we suggest a
binning approach to evaluate dark energy constraints with a minimum number of
assumptions.

review here the detectability of a signature of life from the planet's surface,
i.e. the green vegetation. The vegetation reflectance has indeed a specific
spectrum, with a sharp edge around 700 nm, known as the ""Vegetation Red Edge""
(VRE). Moreover vegetation covers a large surface of emerged lands, from
tropical evergreen forest to shrub tundra. Thus considering it as a potential
global biomarker is relevant. Earthshine allows to observe the Earth as a
distant planet, i.e. without spatial resolution. Since 2001, Earthshine
observations have been used by several authors to test and quantify the
detectability of the VRE in the Earth spectrum. The egetation spectral
signature is detected as a small 'positive shift' of a few percents above the
continuum, starting at 700 nm. This signature appears in most spectra, and its
strength is correlated with the Earth's phase (visible land versus visible
ocean). The observations show that detecting the VRE on Earth requires a
photometric relative accuracy of 1% or better. Detecting something equivalent
on an Earth-like planet will therefore remain challenging, moreover considering
the possibility of mineral artifacts and the question of 'red edge'
universality in the Universe.

treatment for the disruption of dwarf galaxies by gravitational forces and
galaxy encounters within galaxy clusters. This is implemented a posteriori in a
semi-analytic model by considering the stability of cluster dark matter
sub-haloes at z=0. We assume that a galaxy whose dark matter substructure has
been disrupted will itself disperse, while its stars become part of the
population of intracluster stars responsible for the observed intracluster
light. Despite the simplicity of this assumption, our results show a
substantial improvement over previous models and indicate that the inclusion of
galaxy disruption is indeed a necessary ingredient of galaxy formation models.
We find that galaxy disruption suppresses the number density of dwarf galaxies
by about a factor of two. This makes the slope of the faint end of the galaxy
luminosity function shallower, in agreement with observations. In particular,
the abundance of faint, red galaxies is strongly suppressed. As a result, the
luminosity function of red galaxies and the distinction between the red and the
blue galaxy populations in colour-magnitude relationships are correctly
predicted. Finally, we estimate a fraction of intracluster light comparable to
that found in clusters of galaxies.

with it, and therefore it has been proposed as an additional tracer of
potential interest for high $z$ galaxies, whose FIR emission is redshifted to
the sub-mm range. In this communication we analyze the evolution of the X-ray

both for constant stellar formation and instantaneous bursts. The results are

$\rho_{xy}$ depends neither on the tunneling conductance nor on the intragrain

$n^*$ differs from the carrier density $n$ inside the grains by a numerical
coefficient determined by the shape of the grains and type of granular lattice.
Further, we study the effects of Coulomb interactions by calculating
first-order in $1/g_T$ corrections and find that (i) in a wide range of

Systematic extrapolation of roughness and dynamical exponents and the
comparison of roughness distributions indicate that the top surface has
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang scaling for any ratio F of the flux between large and small
particles. A scaling theory predicts the characteristic time of the crossover
from random to correlated growth in BBD and provides relations between the
amplitudes of roughness scaling and F in the KPZ regime. The porosity of the
deposits monotonically increases with F and scales as F^{1/2} for small F,
which is also explained by the scaling approach and illustrates the possibility
of connecting surface growth rules and bulk properties. The suppression of
relaxation mechanisms in BBD enhances the connectivity of the deposits when
compared to other ballisticlike models, so that they percolate down to F~0.05.
The fractal dimension of the internal surface of the percolating deposits is
D_F~2.9, which is very close to the values in other ballisticlike models and

end of inflation, associated with reheating or preheating, could contribute a
blue component to the spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations, with the
dependence k^3. We explore the possibility that they could be observably large
in CMB, LSS, and Lyman-alpha data. We find that a k^3 component with a cutoff
at some maximum k can modestly improve the fits (Delta chi^2=2.0, 5.4) of the
low multipoles (l ~ 10 - 50) or the second peak (l ~ 540) of the CMB angular
spectrum when the three-year WMAP data are used. Moreover, the results from
WMAP are consistent with the CBI, ACBAR, 2dFGRS, and SDSS data when they are
included in the analysis. Including the SDSS galaxy clustering power spectrum,
we find weak positive evidence for the k^3 component at the level of Delta chi'
= 2.4, with the caveat that the nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum may
not be properly treated in the presence of the k^3 distortion. To investigate
the high-k regime, we use the Lyman-alpha forest data (LUQAS, Croft et al., and
SDSS Lyman-alpha); here we find evidence at the level Delta chi^2' = 3.8.
Considering that there are two additional free parameters in the model, the
above results do not give a strong evidence for features; however, they show
that surprisingly large bumps are not ruled out. We give constraints on the
ratio between the k^3 component and the nearly scale-invariant component, r_3 <
1.5, over the range of wave numbers 0.0023/Mpc < k < 8.2/Mpc. We also discuss
theoretical models which could lead to the k^3 effect, including ordinary
hybrid inflation and double D-term inflation models. We show that the
well-motivated k^3 component is also a good representative of the generic
spikelike feature in the primordial perturbation power spectrum.

used to measure the distance to SS Cyg to be $166\pm12$ pc, it became apparent
that at this distance the disc instability model fails to explain the absolute
magnitude during outburst. It remained, however, an open question whether the
model or the distance have to be revised. Recent observations led to a revision
of the system parameters of SS Cyg and seem to be consistent with a distance of
$d\gta 140$ pc. We re-discuss the problem taking into account the new binary
and stellar parameters measured for SS Cyg. We confront not only the
observations with the predictions of the disc instability model but also
compare SS Cyg with other dwarf novae and nova-like systems. We assume the disc
during outburst to be in a quasi stationary state and use the black-body
approximation to estimate the accretion rate during outburst as a function of
distance. Using published analysis of the long term light curve we determine
the mean mass transfer rate of SS Cyg as a function of distance and compare the
result with mass transfer rates derived for other dwarf novae and nova-like
systems. At a distance of $d\gta 140$ pc, both the accretion rate during
outburst as well as the mean mass transfer rate of SS Cyg contradict the disc
instability model. More important, at such distances we find the mean mass
transfer rate of SS Cyg to be higher or comparable to those derived for
nova-like systems. Our findings show that a distance to SS Cyg $\gta 140$ pc
contradicts the main concepts developed for accretion discs in cataclysmic
variables during the last 30 years. Either our current picture of disc
accretion in these systems must be revised or the distance to SS Cyg is $\sim

dwarfs (including our data from the very old open cluster, NGC 6791). This
extention of the relation represents a four fold increase in the total number
of hydrogen burning stars for which the integrated mass loss can now be
calculated, assuming a Salpeter initial mass function. The new leverage at the
low mass end is used to derive a purely empirical initial-final mass relation
without the need for any indirectly derived anchor points. The sample of white
dwarfs in these clusters also shows several very interesting systems that we
discuss further: a DB (helium atmosphere) white dwarf, a magnetic white dwarf,
a DAB (mixed hydrogen/helium atmosphere or a double degenerate DA+DB) white
dwarf(s), and two possible equal mass DA double degenerate binary systems.

cosmology in which the universe existed before the big bang. The simplest model
relies on two scalar fields, whose entropy perturbation leads to a
scale-invariant spectrum of density fluctuations. The ekpyrotic solution has a
tachyonic instability along the entropy field direction which, a priori,
appears to require fine-tuning of the initial conditions. In this paper, we
show that these can be achieved naturally by adding a small positive mass term
for the tachyonic field and coupling to light fermions. Then, for a wide range
of initial conditions, the tachyonic field gets stabilized with the appropriate
values well before the onset of the ekpyrotic phase. Furthermore, we show that
ekpyrotic theory is successful in solving the flatness, horizon and homogeneity
problems of standard big bang cosmology. Motivated by the analysis of the
tachyonic instability, we propose a simplification of the model in terms of new
field variables. Instead of requiring two exponential potentials, one for each
scalar field, it suffices to consider a single nearly exponential potential for
one of the fields and a tachyonic mass term along the orthogonal direction in
field space. All other terms in the potential are essentially arbitrary. This
greatly widens the class of ekpyrotic potentials and allows substantial freedom
in determining the spectral index and possible non-Gaussianity. We present a
generalized expression for the spectral index which is easily consistent with
the observed red tilt. We also argue that for a wide range of potentials
non-Gaussianity can be substantial, within the reach of current observations.

the period of high muon intensity is from $\sim 8.0h$ up to $\sim 19.0h$ (local

muon intensity is due to a contribution of solar protons (ions) on the muon
intensity produced by the galactic cosmic rays, responsible for the low muon
intensity. This implies that the solar particle spectrum extends to energies
beyond 1 GeV. We show that this picture can explain the solar daily variation
origin, and it is a most accurate scenario than the assumption of corotating

we demonstrate that these two distinct transit time definitions give connected
results where, however, the phase time (group delay) accurately describes the
exact position of the scattered particles. The analytical difficulties that
arise when the stationary phase method is employed for obtaining phase
(traversal) times are all overcome. Multiple wave packet decomposition allows
us to recover the exact position of the reflected and transmitted waves in
terms of the phase time, which, in addition to the exact relation between the
phase time and the dwell time, leads to right interpretation for both of them.

a Kroupa IMF) and their spectra are characterized by broad, extended Br-gamma
emission, so we refer to them as emission-line clusters (ELCs) to distinguish
them from older SSCs. The Brgamma lines of most ELCs have supersonic widths
(60-110 km/s FWHM) and non-Gaussian wings whose velocities exceed the clusters'
escape velocities. This high-velocity unbound gas is flowing out in winds that
are powered by the clusters' massive O and W-R stars over the course of at
least several crossing times. The large sizes of some ELCs relative to those of
older SSCs may be due to expansion caused by these outflows; many of the ELCs
may not survive as bound stellar systems, but rather dissipate rapidly into the
field population. The observed tendency of older ELCs to be more compact than
young ones is consistent with the preferential survival of the most
concentrated clusters at a given age.

Imaging Survey being carried out by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)
satellite. In the (NUV-r)_{0.1} vs. M_{r,0.1} galaxy color-magnitude diagram,
the galaxies separate into two well-defined blue and red sequences. The
(NUV-r)_{0.1} color distribution at each M_{r,0.1} is not well fit by the sum
of two Gaussians due to an excess of galaxies in between the two sequences. The
peaks of both sequences become redder with increasing luminosity with a
distinct blue peak visible up to M_{r,0.1}\sim-23. The r_{0.1}-band luminosity
functions vary systematically with color, with the faint end slope and
characteristic luminosity gradually increasing with color. After correcting for
attenuation due to dust, we find that approximately one quarter of the color
variation along the blue sequence is due to dust with the remainder due to star
formation history and metallicity. Finally, we present the distribution of
galaxies as a function of specific star formation rate and stellar mass. The
specific star formation rates imply that galaxies along the blue sequence
progress from low mass galaxies with star formation rates that increase
somewhat with time to more massive galaxies with a more or less constant star
formation rate. Above a stellar mass of ~10^10.5 M_{sun}, galaxies with low
ratios of current to past averaged star formation rate begin to dominate.

  detections of mass concentrations","ApJ in press",,"10.1086/521182",,"astro-ph",,"  In this paper we investigate the influence of the intrinsic alignment of
background galaxies on weak lensing detections of mass concentrations.
Specifically, we analyze the number counts of false peaks resulting from
intrinsic ellipticities in lensing convergence maps. Including the alignment of
source galaxies, the full noise variance from intrinsic ellipticites in
convergence $\kappa$-maps can be written as
$\sigma^2_0=\sigma^2_{0ran}+\sigma^2_{0corr}$, where $\sigma^2_{0ran}$ is the
noise contributed from randomly oriented source galaxies and $\sigma^2_{0corr}$
denotes the additional noise from intrinsic alignments. However, it is
observationally difficult to measure $\sigma^2_{0corr}$ and usually only
$\sigma^2_{0ran}$ can be estimated in weak lensing observations. Thus the
observational signal-to-noise ratio is often defined with respect to
$\sigma_{0ran}$, which is denoted as $\nu_{ran}$ in this paper. The true
signal-to-noise ratio $\nu$ in terms of $\sigma_0$ is then
$\nu=\nu_{ran}/(1+\sigma^2_{0corr}/\sigma^2_{0ran})^{1/2}$. Given a detection
threshold on $\nu_{ran}$, a larger value of $\sigma^2_{0corr}/\sigma^2_{0ran}$
leads to a lower threshold on $\nu$ and therefore a larger expected number of
false peaks. With $\sigma^2_{0corr}/\sigma^2_{0ran}\sim 10%$, the average
number of false peaks with $\nu_{ran}\ge 3.5$ nearly doubles compared to that
without considering the alignment, and for $\nu_{ran}\ge 5$, the number is
tripled. As a result, the efficiency of weak lensing cluster detection degrades
significantly. (Abridged)

observer effects, terrestrial atmospheric effects or processes tied to the

factors determine the distribution of TLP reports. I divide the sample
according to variables which should produce varying results if determining
factors involve humans e.g., historical epoch or geographical location of the
observer, not reflecting phenomena tied to the lunar surface. Regardless of how
we split the ample, the results are similar: ~50% of the reports involve crater
Aristarchus nd vicinity, ~16% from Plato, ~6% from other recent, major impacts,
plus a few at Grimaldi. Mare Crisium produces a robust signal for three of five
averages of up to 7% of the reports (however, Crisium is an extended feature).
The consistency in TLP report counts for specific features indicates that >~80%
of reports are consistent with being real (perhaps excepting Crisium). Some
commonly reported sites disappear from the robust averages, including
Alphonsus, Ross D and Gassendi. TLP reports supporting these sites originate
almost entirely after year 1955, when TLPs became more popular targets of
observation and many more (and inexperienced) observers searched for TLPs. In a
companion paper, we compare the spatial distribution of robust TLP sites of
transient outgassing (seen on Apollo and Lunar Prospector). To a high
confidence against the random hypothesis, robust TLP sites and those of lunar
outgassing correlate strongly, further arguing for the reality of TLPs.

discriminating statistical filter robust against sites of spurious reports, and
produces a restricted sample that may be largely reliable. This subset is
highly correlated geographically with the catalog of outgassing events seen by
the Apollo 15, 16 and Lunar Prospector alpha-particle spectrometers for
episodic Rn-222 gas release. Both this robust TLP sample and even the larger,
unfiltered sample are highly correlated with the boundary between mare and
highlands, as are both deep and shallow moonquakes, as well as Po-210, a
long-lived product of Rn-222 decay and a further tracer of outgassing. This
offers another significant correlation relating TLPs and outgassing, and may
tie some of this activity to sagging mare basalt plains (perhaps mascons).
Additionally, low-level but likely significant TLP activity is connected to
recent, major impact craters (while moonquakes are not), which may indicate the
effects of cracks caused by the impacts, or perhaps avalanches, allowing
release of gas. The majority of TLP (and Rn-222) activity, however, is confined
to one site that produced much of the basalt in the Procellarum Terrane, and it
seems plausible that this TLP activity may be tied to residual outgassing from
the formerly largest volcanic ffusion sites from the deep lunar interior. With
the coming in the next few years of robotic spacecraft followed by human
exploration, the study of TLPs and outgassing is both promising and imperiled.
We will have an unprecedented pportunity to study lunar outgassing, but will
also deal with a greater burden of anthropogenic lunar gas than ever produced.
There is a pressing need to study lunar atmosphere and its sources while still
pristine. [Abstract abridged.]

lunar surface might interact with the regolith, and in what respects this might
affect or cause the appearance of optical Transient Lunar Phenomena (TLPs). We
consider briefly a range of phenomena, but concentrate at the extremes of high
and low gas flow rate, which might represent the more likely behaviors.
Extremely fast i.e., explosive, expulsion of gas from the surface is
investigated by examining the minimal amount of gas needed to displace a plug
of regolith above a site of gaseous overpressure at the regolith's base. The
area and timescale of this disturbance, it is consistent with observed TLPs.
Furthermore there are several ways in which such an explosion might be expected
to change the lunar surface appearance in a way consistent with many TLPs,
including production of obscuration, brightening and color changes. At the slow
end of the volatile flow range, gas seeping from the interior is retained below
the surface for extensive times due to the low diffusivity of regolith
material. A special circumstance arises if the volatile flow contains water
vapor, because water is uniquely capable of freezing as it passes from the base
to the surface of the regolith. For a large TLP site, it is plausible to think
of areas on the square-km scale accumulating significant bodies of water ice.
Furthermore, as the system evolves over geological time, the ice accumulation
zone will evolve downwards into the regolith. Since many reactions possible
between the volatiles and regolith, depending on the additional gases besides
water, can act to decrease diffusivity in the regolith, it is plausible that
the volatiles produce a barrier between the seepage source and vacuum, forcing
the ice zone to expand to larger areas.

related to lunar outgassing, albeit in ways not fully understood. Here we

are being realized for the first time. Given the optical transient/outgassing
connection, progress can be made by remote sensing, and we suggest programs of
imaging, spectroscopy and combinations thereof. However, as found in Paper II,
many aspects of lunar outgassing seem covert in nature. TLPs betray outgassing,
but not all outgassing produces TLPs. Some outgassing may never appear at the
surface, but remain trapped in the regolith. We also suggest more intrusive
techniques, from radar mapping to in-situ probes. Understanding these volatiles
seems promising in terms of a resource for humans on the Moon and beyond, and
offers an interesting scientific goal in its own right. Hence this paper is a
series of proposed techniques, some in practice, some which might be soon, and
some requiring significant future investment, some of which may prove unwise
pending results from predecessor investigations. These point towards
enhancement of our knowledge of lunar outgassing, its relation to other lunar
processes, and an increase in our understanding of how volatiles are involved
in the evolution of the Moon. We emphasize certain ground-based observations in

differential equations (ODEs), examine properties of the magnetosonic critical
curve, obtain various asymptotic and global semi-complete similarity MHD
solutions, and qualify the applicability of our results. Unique to a magnetized
gas cloud, a novel asymptotic MHD solution for a collapsing core is
established. Physically, the similarity MHD inflow towards the central dense
core proceeds in characteristic manners before the gas material eventually
encounters a strong radiating MHD shock upon impact onto the central compact
object. Sufficiently far away from the central core region enshrouded by such
an MHD shock, we derive regular asymptotic behaviours. We study asymptotic
solution behaviours in the vicinity of the magnetosonic critical curve.
Numerically, we construct global semi-complete similarity MHD solutions that
cross the magnetosonic critical curve zero, one, and two times. For comparison,
counterpart solutions in the case of an isothermal unmagnetized and magnetized
gas flows are demonstrated in the present MHD framework at nearly isothermal
and weakly magnetized conditions. For a polytropic index $\gamma=1.25$ or a

particle spectra for different grain shapes, with the following results: i) The
absorption efficiency factors both of calcite and dolomite are extremely

applied to one end of the polymer. At small to moderate forces, satisfying the
condition $FN^{\nu}/k_BT\lesssim1$, where $\nu\approx0.588$ is the Flory
exponent for the polymer, we find that $\tau_N$, the mean time the polymer
takes to leave the pore, scales as $N^{2+\nu}$ independent of $F$, in agreement
with our earlier result for F=0. At strong forces, i.e., for
$FN^{\nu}/k_BT\gg1$, the behaviour of the passage time crosses over to
$\tau_N\sim N^2/F$. We show here that these behaviours stem from the polymer
dynamics at the immediate vicinity of the pore -- in particular, the memory
effects in the polymer chain tension imbalance across the pore.

its properties are consistent with a polar-cap origin. Phase-resolved

stochastic model defined in terms of N coupled Langevin equations, we derive a
nonlinear mean field Fokker-Planck equation governing the evolution of the
distribution function of the system in phase space. By taking the successive
moments of this kinetic equation and using a local thermodynamic equilibrium
condition, we derive a set of hydrodynamic equations involving a damping term.
In the limit of small frictions, we obtain a hyperbolic model describing the
formation of network patterns (filaments) and in the limit of strong frictions
we obtain a parabolic model which is a generalization of the standard
Keller-Segel model describing the formation of clusters (clumps). Our approach
connects and generalizes several models introduced in the chemotactic
literature. We discuss the analogy between bacterial colonies and
self-gravitating systems and between the chemotactic collapse and the
gravitational collapse (Jeans instability). We also show that the basic
equations of chemotaxis are similar to nonlinear mean field Fokker-Planck
equations so that a notion of effective generalized thermodynamics can be
developed.

this hypothesis in the context of modern developments in condensed matter and
cold atoms physics, aimed at realizing macroscopic quantum states. We first
consider 'micromechanical' quantum states, analyzing the capacity of an atomic
force microscopy based single spin detector to measure the gravitational state
reduction, but we conclude that it seems impossible to suppress environmental
decoherence to the required degree. We subsequently discuss 'split' cold atom
condensates to find out that these are at present lacking the required mass
scale by many orders of magnitude. We then extent Penrose's analysis to
superpositions of mass current carrying states, and we apply this to the flux
quantum bits realized in superconducting circuits. We find that the flux qubits
approach the scale where gravitational state reduction should become
measurable, but bridging the few remaining orders of magnitude appears to be
very difficult with present day technology.

assumed to be Markovian with a general order of dependence. An auxiliary Markov

most unstable modes correspond to relative angles between the velocity of the

alternative mechanism for the description of the jet quenching phenomenon,
where the jet crossing the plasma loses energy exciting colored unstable modes.

by the E.I.H. method that properly defined point charges, appended at the
right-hand side of the field equation $R_{[[\mu\nu],\lambda]}=0$, interact
mutually with Coulomb-like forces, provided that a mutual force independent of
distance is present too. This unwanted, but unavoidable addition, could not but
lay further disbelief on the efforts initiated by Einstein and Schroedinger one
decade earlier. However in 1980 Treder himself recalled that the potential
$\phi=a/r+cr$, found by him in 1957, was the one used by particle physicists to
account phenomenologically for the spectrum of bound quark systems like mesons.

resonance in a quantum dot tuned to the local moment regime. We employ Wilson's
numerical renormalization group method, extended to handle leads with a spin
asymmetric density of states, to identify the effects of (i) a finite spin
polarization in the leads (at the Fermi-surface), (ii) a Stoner splitting in
the bands (governed by the band edges) and (iii) an arbitrary shape of the
leads density of states. For a generic lead density of states the quantum dot
favors being occupied by a particular spin-species due to exchange interaction
with ferromagnetic leads leading to a suppression and splitting of the Kondo
resonance. The application of a magnetic field can compensate this asymmetry
restoring the Kondo effect. We study both the gate-voltage dependence (for a
fixed band structure in the leads) and the spin polarization dependence (for
fixed gate voltage) of this compensation field for various types of bands.
Interestingly, we find that the full recovery of the Kondo resonance of a
quantum dot in presence of leads with an energy dependent density of states is
not only possible by an appropriately tuned external magnetic field but also
via an appropriately tuned gate voltage. For flat bands simple formulas for the
splitting of the local level as a function of the spin polarization and gate
voltage are given.

species concentrations and mass density of the mixture. The procedure is
applied to two under-expanded sonic jets discharged into a different gas
ambient - Helium into Argon and Argon into Helium - to measure the
concentration and density distribution along the jet axis and across it. A
comparison with experimental and numerical results obtained by other authors

only allows for the 1S bottomonium to be bound above $T_c$, with a dissociation
temperature around $1.5\times T_c$. The situation is very different with the

at higher temperatures because of a positive barrier appearing in the

radio lobe of Centaurus A, first described by Kraft et al. (2003). We find that
the sharp X-ray surface brightness discontinuity extends around $\sim$75% of
the periphery of the radio lobe, and detect significant temperature jumps in
the brightest regions of this discontinuity nearest to the nucleus. This
demonstrates that this discontinuity is indeed a strong shock which is the
result of an overpressure which has built up in the entire lobe over time.
Additionally, we demonstrate that if the mean free path for ions to transfer
energy and momentum to the electrons behind the shock is as large as the
Spitzer value, the electron and proton temperatures will not have equilibrated
along the SW boundary of the radio lobe where the shock is strongest. Thus the
proton temperature of the shocked gas could be considerably larger than the
observed electron temperature, and the total energy of the outburst
correspondingly larger as well. We investigate this using a simple
one-dimensional shock model for a two-fluid (proton/electron) plasma. We find
that for the thermodynamic parameters of the Cen A shock the electron
temperature rises rapidly from $\sim$0.29 keV (the temperature of the ambient
ISM) to $\sim$3.5 keV at which point heating from the protons is balanced by
adiabatic losses. The proton and electron temperatures do not equilibrate in a
timescale less than the age of the lobe. We note that the measured electron
temperature of similar features in other nearby powerful radio galaxies in poor
environments may considerably underestimate the strength and velocity of the
shock.

temperature represents the gravitational mass of the cluster, or if this is an
already high ($\sim$ 11 keV) temperature cluster that has been heated
transiently. We detect a surface brightness discontinuity in the gas that
extends $\sim$600 kpc through the cluster. The radio galaxy 3C 438 is too small
($\sim$110 kpc across) and too weak to have created this large disturbance in
the gas. The discontinuity must be the result of either an extremely powerful
nuclear outburst or the major merger of two massive clusters. If the observed
features are the result of a nuclear outburst, it must be from an earlier epoch

essentially changes the type of the driving martingale. Such a feature does not
seem to have been investigated in any existing stochastic control literature.
We shall first provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for the control
problem by establishing an existence result for the multidimensional structure
equation on a Wiener--Poisson space, given an arbitrary bounded jump size
control process; and by providing an auxiliary counterexample showing the
nonuniqueness for such solutions. Based on these theoretical results, we then
formulate the control problem and prove the Bellman principle, and derive the
corresponding Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation, which in this case is a
mixed second-order partial differential/difference equation. Finally, we prove
a uniqueness result for the viscosity solution of such an HJB equation.

that, when the system is in a chaotic regime (specifically, at thermal
equilibrium), ergodicity is essentially verified, and the Pdfs of the sums
appear to be Gaussians, consistently with the standard CLT. When the system is,
instead, only weakly chaotic (specifically, along longstanding metastable
Quasi-Stationary States), nonergodicity (i.e., discrepant ensemble and time
averages) is observed, and robust $q$-Gaussian attractors emerge, consistently
with recently proved generalizations of the CLT.

1.8 galaxy ESO113-G010 performed in November 2005, in order to study over a
longer time-scale its main X-ray properties. The source was found in a
higher/softer time-averaged flux state, and timing analysis of this source
reveals strong, rapid variability. The Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis
indicates (at 95% c.l.) a break at 3.7 x 10^-4 Hz. This cut-off frequency is
comparable to those measured in some other rapidly-variable Seyferts, such as
MCG-6-30-15 and NGC4051. From the mass-luminosity-time-scale, we infer that
M_BH ranges from 4 x 10^6 - 10^7 M_odot and the source is accreting at or close
to the Eddington rate (or even higher). The existing data cannot distinguish
between spectral pivoting of the continuum and a two-component origin for the
spectral softening, primarily because the data do not span a broad enough flux
range. In the case of the two-component model, the fractional offsets measured
in the flux-flux plots increase significantly toward higher energies (similar
to what is observed in MCG-6-30-15) as expected if there exists a constant
reflection component. Contrary to May 2001, no significant highly redshifted
emission line is observed (which might be related to the source flux level),
while two narrow emission lines at about 6.5keV and 7keV are observed. The S/N
is not high enough to establish if the lines are variable or constant. As
already suggested by the 2001 observation, no significant constant narrow
6.4keV FeK line (EW~32eV) is observed, hence excluding any dominant emission
from distant cold matter such as a torus in this Seyfert type 1.8 galaxy.

striking feature of the model, we demonstrate the possibility of fermionic
matter oscillations between the two four-dimensional sections and hyper-fast
displacements in case of asymmetric warping (without conflicting special
relativity). This result, similar to previous reported ones in brane-world
theories, is completely original as it is derived by using quantum mechanics
only without recourse to general relativity and bulk geodesics calculation. The
model allows causal contact between normally disconnected regions. If it proves
to be physically founded, its practical aspects could have deep implications

  The extreme stability of NaCl(100) is ideal for a study of the nanofriction
in the high temperature regime, close to and even above the bulk melting
temperature (T_M). Our simulations reveal in this regime two distinct and
opposite phenomena for plowing and for grazing friction. We found a frictional
drop close to T_M for deep ploughing and wear, but on the contrary a frictional
rise for grazing, wearless sliding. For both phenomena we obtain a fresh
microscopic understanding, relating the former to ``skating'' through a local
liquid cloud, the latter to softening of the free substrate surface. It is
argued that both phenomena, to be pursued experimentally, should be much more
general than the specific NaCl surface case. Most metals in particular
possessing one or more close packed non-melting surface, such as Pb, Al or

  Results. We present a homogeneous study of model atmosphere temperature

it applies to CP stars. In particular, we found that Si, Cr and Fe are the main
elements to influence model atmospheres of CP stars, and thus to be considered
in order to assess the adequacy of model atmospheres with scaled solar
abundances in application to CP stars. We provide a theoretical explanation of
the robust property of the Delta_a photometric system to recognize CP stars
with peculiar Fe content. Also, the results of our numerical tests using model
atmospheres with one or several elements overabundant (Si and Fe by +1 dex, Cr
by +2 dex) suggest that the uncertainty of abundance analysis in the
atmospheres of CP stars using models with scaled abundances is less than
plus/minus 0.25 dex. If the same homogeneous models are used for the abundance
stratification analysis then we find that the uncertainty of the value of the
vertical abundance gradient is within an 0.4 dex error bar.
  Conclusions. Model atmospheres with individual abundance patterns should be
used in order to match the actual anomalies of CP stars and minimize analysis
errors.

sporadic. This suggests that energetic processes at the small scale (i.e. ~tens
of pc) do not dominate the energy balance within the ISM of the Bridge, which
therefore hosts a pristine turbulent structure, otherwise inaccessible within

establishing a complexity bound for a given modal logic is often a laborious
task. The present work is a step towards a general theory of the complexity of
modal logics. Our main result is that all rank-1 logics enjoy a shallow model
property and thus are, under mild assumptions on the format of their
axiomatisation, in PSPACE. This leads to a unified derivation of tight
PSPACE-bounds for a number of logics including K, KD, coalition logic, graded
modal logic, majority logic, and probabilistic modal logic. Our generic
algorithm moreover finds tableau proofs that witness pleasant proof-theoretic
properties including a weak subformula property. This generality is made
possible by a coalgebraic semantics, which conveniently abstracts from the
details of a given model class and thus allows covering a broad range of logics
in a uniform way.

reformulate the standard D=4 Yang-Mills theory as a renormalizable system of
two interacting fields a_{\mu} and B_{\mu} which faithfully represent high- and
low-energy degrees of freedom of the single gauge field A_{\mu} in the original
formulation. It opens a possibility to synthesize an infrared-nonsingular
weak-coupling series, employed to integrate over a_{\mu} for a given background
B_{\mu}, with qualitatively different methods. These methods are to be applied
to evaluate the resulting (after the a_{\mu}-integration) representation of
<{\cal Q}[A_{\mu}]>_{A} in terms of gauge-invariant generically non-local
low-energy observables, like Wilson loops. The latter observables are averaged
over B_{\mu} with respect to a gauge-invariant Wilsonean effective action
S_{eff}[B]. To avoid a destructive dissipation between the high- and low-energy
excitations, we implement a specific fine-tuning of the interaction between the
pair of the fields: prior to the integration over B_{\mu}, the expectation
value <a_{\mu}>_{a} vanishes, in the tree order of the loop-wise expansion, for
an arbitrary configuration of B_{\mu}.
