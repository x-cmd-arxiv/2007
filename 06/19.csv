spatial dimensions. A simulation method is proposed to measure the angle
dependent interfacial tension g(theta), with theta the anchoring angle of the
nematic phase at the interface. In addition, an alternative liquid crystal
model is introduced, defined on a lattice. The advantage of the lattice model
is that accurate simulations of anchoring effects become possible. For the
lattice model, g(theta) depends sensitively on the nearest-neighbor pair
interaction, and both stable and metastable anchoring angles can be detected.
We also measure g(theta) for an off-lattice fluid of soft rods. For soft rods,
only one stable anchoring angle is found, corresponding to homogeneous
alignment of the nematic director in the plane of the interface. This finding
is in agreement with most theoretical predictions obtained for hard rods.

inflation induce sudden changes in the mass of the inflaton, thus interrupting
its slow-roll. In a previous paper we calculated the resulting curvature
perturbation and showed how the oscillations arise. Here we perform a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo fitting exercise using the 3-year WMAP data to determine how
the fitted cosmological parameters vary when such a primordial spectrum is used
as an input, rather than the usually assumed power-law spectrum. The
'concordance' LCDM model is still a good fit when there is just a 'step' in the
spectrum. However if there is a 'bump' in the spectrum (due e.g. to two phase
transitions in rapid succession), the precision CMB data can be well-fitted by
a flat Einstein-de Sitter cosmology without dark energy. This however requires
the Hubble constant to be h ~ 0.44 which is lower than the locally measured
value. To fit the SDSS data on the power spectrum of galaxy clustering requires
a ~10% component of hot dark matter, as would naturally be provided by 3
species of neutrinos of mass ~0.5 eV. This CHDM model cannot however fit the
position of the baryon acoustic peak in the LRG redshift two-point correlation
function. It may be possible to overcome these difficulties in an inhomogeneous
Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi cosmological model with a local void, which can
potentially also account for the SN Ia Hubble diagram without invoking cosmic

mixing scenario between nu_e and another flavor nu_x and assume the usual

the deleptonization flux which is the one crucial parameter. The transition
between the quasi single-angle behavior and multi-angle decoherence is abrupt
as a function of epsilon. For typical choices of other parameters, multi-angle
decoherence is suppressed for epsilon>0.3, but a much smaller asymmetry
suffices if the neutrino mass hierarchy is normal and the mixing angle small.
The critical epsilon depends logarithmically on the neutrino luminosity. In a
realistic supernova scenario, the deleptonization flux is probably enough to
suppress multi-angle decoherence.

two-sublattice fermionic infinite-range Ising spin glass (SG) model in a
transverse field $\Gamma$. The problem is formulated in a Grassmann path
integral formalism within the static approximation. In this model, a parallel
magnetic field $H$ breaks the symmetry of the sublattices. It destroys the
antiferromagnetic (AF) order, but it can favor the nonergodic mixed phase
(SG+AF) characterizing an asymmetric RSB region. In this region,
intra-sublattice disordered interactions $V$ increase the difference between
the RSB solutions of each sublattice. The freezing temperature shows a higher
increase with $H$ when $V$ enhances. A discontinue phase transition from the
replica symmetry (RS) solution to the RSB solution can appear with the presence
of an intra-sublattice ferromagnetic average coupling. The $\Gamma$ field
introduces a quantum spin flip mechanism that suppresses the magnetic orders
leading them to quantum critical points. Results suggest that the quantum
effects are not able to restore the RS solution. However, in the asymmetric RSB
region, $\Gamma$ can produce a stable RS solution at any finite temperature for
a particular sublattice while the other sublattice still presents RSB solution
for the special case in which only the intra-sublattice spins couple with
disordered interactions.

  accelerators",,"Phys.Rev.STAccel.Beams10:111002,2007","10.1103/PhysRevSTAB.10.111002",,"physics.acc-ph physics.comp-ph",,"  One of the main concerns in the design of low emittance linear accelerators
(linacs) is the preservation of beam emittance. Here we discuss one possible
source of emittance dilution, the coupler kick, due to transverse
electromagnetic fields in the accelerating cavities of the linac caused by the
power coupler geometry. In addition to emittance growth, the coupler kick also
produces orbit distortions. It is common wisdom that emittance growth from
coupler kicks can be strongly reduced by using two couplers per cavity mounted
opposite each other or by having the couplers of successive cavities
alternation from above to below the beam pipe so as to cancel each individual
kick. We therefore analyze consequences of alternate coupler placements.
  We show here that for sufficiently large Q values, alternating the coupler
location from before to after the cavity leads to a cancellation of the orbit
distortion but not of the emittance growth, whereas alternating the coupler
location from before and above to behind and below the cavity cancels the
emittance growth but not the orbit distortion. These compensations hold even
when each cavity is individually detuned, e.g. by microphonics. Another
effective method for reducing coupler kicks that is studied is the optimization
of the phase of the coupler kick. This technique is independent of the coupler
geometry but relies on operating on crest. A final technique studied is
symmetrization of the cavity geometry in the coupler region with the addition
of a stub opposite the coupler, which reduces the amplitude of the off axis
fields and is thus effective for off crest acceleration as well.
  We show applications of these techniques to the energy recovery linac (ERL)
planned at Cornell University.

$N\equiv \ln a$ is the e-folding time) during inflation. We show that the model
with $|\alpha|<0.25$ and $\beta<0$ can easily satisfy inflationary constraints,
including the spectral index of scalar fluctuations ($n_s=0.96\pm 0.013$),
tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r<0.28$) and also the bound imposed on $\Omega_\phi$

construction, the scalar field potential always scales proportionally to the
square of the Hubble expansion rate. One may thereby account for the two vastly
different energy scales associated with the Hubble parameters at early and late
epochs. The inflaton energy could also produce an observationally significant
effective dark energy at a late epoch without violating local gravity tests.

that restframe UV- and optically bright (K<20) z~2 star forming galaxies are
dynamically similar, and follow the same velocity-size relation as disk
galaxies at z~0. In the theoretical framework of rotating disks forming from
dissipative collapse in dark matter halos, the two samples require a spin
parameter ranging from 0.06 to 0.2. In contrast bright SMGs have larger
velocity widths and are much more compact. Hence, SMGs have lower angular
momenta and higher matter densities than either of the UV- or optically
selected populations. This indicates that dissipative major mergers may
dominate the SMGs population, resulting in early spheroids, and that the
majority of UV/optically bright galaxies have evolved less violently [...].
These early disks may later evolve into spheroids via disk instabilities or
mergers. Because of their small sizes and large densities, SMGs lie at the high
surface density end of a universal (out to z=2.5) ""Schmidt-Kennicutt"" relation

rotors and various ansatzes for the spinon ground state. We illustrate this
approach with a number of examples relevant to ongoing experiments in strongly
correlated electronic systems such as: (i) the phase diagram of the isotropic
triangular lattice organic Mott insulators, (ii) quasiparticle excitations and
tunneling asymmetry in the weakly doped cuprate superconductors, and (iii) the
cyclotron mass of carriers in commensurate spin-density wave and U(1) staggered

quantum vortex has a divergent energy cost in the bulk due to the associated
{\it unscreened} spin current, which requires two half-quantum vortices with
opposite spin winding to pair. We show that the stability of such a pair in

making this distinction precise, we are led to a novel classification of hidden
variable models of quantum theory. Indeed, representatives of each class can be
found among existing constructions for two-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Our
approach also provides a fruitful new perspective on arguments for the
nonlocality and incompleteness of quantum theory. Specifically, we show that
for models wherein the quantum state has the status of something real, the
failure of locality can be established through an argument considerably more
straightforward than Bell's theorem. The historical significance of this result
becomes evident when one recognizes that the same reasoning is present in
Einstein's preferred argument for incompleteness, which dates back to 1935.
This fact suggests that Einstein was seeking not just any completion of quantum
theory, but one wherein quantum states are solely representative of our
knowledge. Our hypothesis is supported by an analysis of Einstein's attempts to
clarify his views on quantum theory and the circumstance of his otherwise
puzzling abandonment of an even simpler argument for incompleteness from 1927.

flat surface to uniform ion irradiation at any incidence angle. We relax the
assumption of the classical theory that the average surface erosion rate is
determined by a Gaussian response function representing the effect of the
collision cascade and consider the surface dynamics for other
physically-motivated response functions. We show that although instability of
flat surfaces at any beam angle results from all Gaussian and a wide class of
non-Gaussian erosive response functions, there exist classes of modifications
to the response that can have a dramatic effect. In contrast to the classical
theory, these types of response render the flat surface linearly stable, while
imperceptibly modifying the predicted sputter yield vs. incidence angle. We
discuss the possibility that such corrections underlie recent reports of a
``window of stability'' of ion-bombarded surfaces at a range of beam angles for
certain ion and surface types, and describe some characteristic aspects of
pattern evolution near the transition from unstable to stable dynamics. We
point out that careful analysis of the transition regime may provide valuable
tests for the consistency of any theory of pattern formation on ion sputtered

Brown, Preston, and Singleton (BPS) to calculate transport quantities in a

not specialists in quantum field theory, where the technique of dimensional
continuation exploited by BPS first arose. The method is highlighted by the
interesting analogy between the Coulomb logarithm of Lyman Spitzer on the one
hand, and the Lamb shift as calculated by Hans Bethe on the other. BPS employed
the method in a novel way that provides the leading and subleading behavior for
processes with competing disparate length or energy scales. They calculated the
temperature equilibration rate to leading and next-to-leading order in the
plasma number density for any two species in a plasma that are in thermal
equilibrium with themselves, but not necessarily with each other. A special
case of this calculation is the electron-ion temperature equilibration rate. It
should be emphasized that the BPS result is not a model, but rather it is an
exact calculation of the leading terms in a well-defined perturbation theory.

and these fields may be expressed in terms of the differential rotation
${\Omega}(r,{\theta}(s))$. In the case of non-cyclonic dynamos the torsion in
the Frenet frame is compute in terms of the dynamo constant. The flux tube

tube case is shown to be trivial in the sense that does not support any dynamo
action. This case is in agreement with Cowling antidynamo theorem, since in the

rules out. We also show that it is consistent with the Zeldovich antidynamo
theorem which rules out planar dynamos. Knowledge of the differential rotation

the problem of 3He overproduction, reconciling stellar and big bang

10^8 yrs) once the hydrogen burning shell approaches the material homogenized

material obtained at Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, with time baselines of
34 and 87 years, respectively. Both clusters show clear evidence of mass
segregation, but they do not exhibit any significant velocity-mass (or,
equivalently, a velocity-luminosity) dependence. This provides strong support
for the suggestion that the observed mass segregation is -- at least partially
-- due to the way in which star formation has proceeded in these complex

related to the clusters' published initial mass functions, in conjunction with
our new measurements of their internal velocity dispersions (35 and 8 km/s for

the dissolution of NGC 2244 on very short time-scales, while we speculate that

spectroscopic redshifts of about 400 compact object candidates with 19.2 < V <
22.4 mag in the central region of the Centaurus galaxy cluster (d=43Mpc), using
VIMOS@VLT. The luminosity range of the candidates covers that of bright

the cluster membership of 27 compact objects, covering an absolute magnitude
range -12.2 < M_V < -10.9 mag. We do not find counterparts to the two very
large and bright UCDs in Fornax and Virgo with M_V=-13.5 mag, possibly due to
survey incompleteness. The compact objects' distribution in magnitude and space
is consistent with that of the GC population. Their kinematics and spatial
distribution associate them to the central galaxies rather than to the overall
cluster potential. The compact objects have a mean metallicity consistent with
that of the metal-rich globular cluster sub-population. Compact objects with
high S/N spectra exhibit solar [alpha/Fe] abundances, consistent with typical
dwarf elliptical galaxy values and unlike galactic bulge globular clusters. HST
based size estimates for a sub-sample of eight compact objects reveal the
existence of one very large object with half-light radius r_h around 30 pc,
having M_V=-11.6 mag (~10^7 M_sun). This source shows super-solar [alpha/Fe]
abundances. Seven further sources are only marginally larger than typical GCs
with r_h in the range 4 to 10 pc. Conclusions: We consider the largest compact
object found to be the only bona-fide UCD detected in our study. In order to
improve our understanding of UCDs in Centaurus, a significant increase of our
survey completeness is necessary.

outburst of RS Ophiuchi. We detect extended emission in both [O III] and [Ne V]
lines. In both lines, the remnant has a double ring structure. The E-W
orientation and total extent of these structures (580+-50 AU at d=1.6kpc) is
consistent with that expected due to expansion of emitting regions imaged
earlier in the outburst at radio wavelengths. Expansion at high velocity
appears to have been roughly constant in the E-W direction (v_{exp} = 3200+-300
km/s in the plane of the sky), with tentative evidence of deceleration N-S. We
present a bipolar model of the remnant whose inclination is consistent with
that of the central binary. The true expansion velocities of the polar
components are then v = 5600+-1100 km/s. We suggest that the bipolar morphology
of the remnant results from interaction of the outburst ejecta with a
circumstellar medium that is significantly denser in the equatorial regions of
the binary than at the poles. This is also consistent with observations of
shock evolution in the X-ray and the possible presence of dust in the infrared.
Furthermore, it is in line with models of the shaping of planetary nebulae with
close binary central systems, and also with recent observations relating to the
progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, for which recurrent novae are a proposed
candidate. Our observations also reveal more extended structures to the S and E
of the remnant whose possible origin is briefly discussed.

precludes coherent states with a large number of fermionic particles, we find
that a large number of fermionic coherent states, each containing at most one
particle, can be used to achieve the same effect as a bosonic coherent state
for the purposes of this problem. The discussion of superselection rules arises
naturally in this context, because their applicability to a given situation
prohibits the use of coherent states. This limitation particularly affects the

interacting with a spin-bath, in the presence of a time-dependent magnetic
field is studied. The magnetic field is static along $\hat{z}$ direction and
oscillatory in the transverse plane. The transition probability and Rabi
oscillations between the spin-states of a single qubit is shown to depend on
the size of bath, the distribution of qubit-bath couplings and the initial bath
polarization. In contrast to the fast Gaussian decay for short times, the
polarization of the qubit shows an oscillatory power-law decay for long times.
The loss of entanglement for the maximally entangled two-qubit states, can be
controlled by tuning the frequency of the rotating field. The decay rates of
entanglement and purity for all the Bell-states are same when the qubits are
non-interacting, and different when they are interacting.

circumnuclear starformation regions differ from the properties of galaxies with
fainter central regions. The overall supply of molecular gas and the spread of
the line width distribution is larger. When comparing the far-infrared with the

interest, and is relevant for many solid-state qubit designs. Instead of

detailed study of the dynamics of the nuclear spin bath in the Mn12-ac
single-molecule magnet, probed by NMR experiments down to very low temperatures
(T = 20 mK). We find that the longitudinal relaxation rate of the 55Mn nuclei
in Mn12-ac becomes roughly T-independent below T = 0.8 K, and can be strongly
suppressed with a longitudinal magnetic field. This is consistent with the
nuclear relaxation being caused by quantum tunneling of the molecular spin, and
we attribute the tunneling fluctuations to the minority of fast-relaxing
molecules present in the sample. The transverse nuclear relaxation is also
T-independent for T < 0.8 K, and can be explained qualitatively and
quantitatively by the dipolar coupling between like nuclei in neighboring
molecules. We also show that the isotopic substitution of 1H by 2H leads to a
slower nuclear longitudinal relaxation, consistent with the decreased tunneling
probability of the molecular spin. Finally, we demonstrate that, even at the
lowest temperatures, the nuclear spins remain in thermal equilibrium with the
lattice phonons, and we investigate the timescale for their thermal
equilibration. After a review of the theory of macroscopic spin tunneling in
the presence of a spin bath, we argue that most of our experimental results are

discrete string of Fermi points, with respective electron fields that, due to
their mutual interaction, acquire anomalous scaling dimensions depending on the
point of the string. Using bosonization methods, we show that the anomalous
scaling dimensions vanish when the number of coupled chains goes to infinity,
implying the Fermi liquid behavior of a 2D system in that limit. However, when
the Fermi level is at the Van Hove singularity arising from the saddle points
of the 2D dispersion, backscattering and Cooper-pair scattering lead to the
breakdown of the metallic behavior at low energies. These interactions are
taken into account through their renormalization group scaling, studying in
turn their influence on the nonperturbative bosonization of the model. We show
that, at a certain low-energy scale, the anomalous electron dimension diverges
at the Fermi points closer to the saddle points of the 2D dispersion. The
d-wave superconducting correlations become also large at low energies, but
their growth is cut off as the suppression of fermion excitations takes place
first, extending progressively along the Fermi points towards the diagonals of
the 2D Brillouin zone. We stress that this effect arises from the vanishing of
the charge stiffness at the Fermi points, characterizing a critical behavior

for the entropy profiles of clusters starting from the configuration
established by gravitational shock heating and radiative cooling. At large
radii, gravitational heating accounts for the observed profiles and their
scalings well. However, at small and intermediate radii, radiative cooling and
gravitational heating cannot be combined to explain the observed profiles of
either type of cluster. The inferred entropy profiles of NCC clusters require
that material is preheated prior to cluster collapse in order to explain the
absence of low entropy (cool) material in these systems. We show that a similar
modification is also required in CC clusters in order to match their properties
at intermediate radii. In CC clusters, this modification is unstable, and an
additional process is required to prevent cooling below a temperature of a few
keV. We show that this can be achieved by adding a self-consistent AGN feedback
loop in which the lowest-entropy, most rapidly cooling material is heated so
that it rises buoyantly to mix with material at larger radii. The resulting
model does not require fine tuning and is in excellent agreement with a wide
variety of observational data. Some of the other implications of this model are

general relation which is proven uniformly (i.e. without appealing to the
classification of finite Coxeter groups) using basic facts about noncrossing
partitions. We solve these recursions for each finite Coxeter group in the
classification. Among other results, we obtain a simpler proof of a known
uniform formula for the number of maximal chains of noncrossing partitions and
a new uniform formula for the number of edges in the noncrossing partition

compact binaries, and the effect of large kick velocity is a signature that can
be used as an observational test for this hypothesis. Intracluster SGRBs that
escaped from a host galaxy in a galaxy cluster are interesting in this context,
since they would escape more easily by cluster tidal force, and would have
brighter afterglow luminosity by dense intracluster gas, than those in general
field galaxies. Here we calculate the escape fraction of compact binaries from
their host galaxies in a galaxy cluster, and discuss some observational
implications. We found that the escape fraction strongly depends on the nature
of dark matter subhalos associated with member galaxies. If the amount of dark
matter around member galaxies is not large and the gravitational potential for
an escaping binary is determined mostly by stellar mass, most of SGRBs should
escape and be observed as hostless, which is a much higher fraction than those
in the field. Hence, statistics of intracluster SGRBs could give important
information about the dark matter distribution in galaxy clusters, as well as
hints for the origin of SGRBs.

Since it covers a wide range in luminosity (from a few to 50 x 10^{36} erg
s^{-1}) and shows clear spectral state transitions, it represents a good
laboratory to test the accretion models proposed for atoll sources. We analysed
the energy spectrum accumulated with BeppoSAX observations (43.5 ksec) in
August 2000 when the source was in a soft spectral state. The continuum of the
wide band energy spectrum is well described by the sum of a blackbody
(kT_{bb}~0.56 keV) and a Comptonized component (seed-photon temperature kT_W~1
keV, electron temperature kT_e~2.7 keV, and optical depth ~11). A hard tail was
detected at energies above ~25 keV. The latter can be modeled by a power law
having a photon index ~2.9 which contributes ~11% of the total flux in the
range 0.1-200 keV. A broad emission line, possibly from a relativistic
accretion disk, models the feature in the Fe K line region of the spectrum.
This is the first time that a high energy tail has been observed during a soft
state of the source.

chiral and vector multiplets can admit viable metastable vacua with
spontaneously broken supersymmetry and realistic cosmological constant. To do
so, we impose that on the vacuum the scalar potential and all its first
derivatives vanish, and derive a necessary condition for the matrix of its
second derivatives to be positive definite. We study then the constraints set
by the combination of the flatness condition needed for the tuning of the
cosmological constant and the stability condition that is necessary to avoid
unstable modes. We find that the existence of such a viable vacuum implies a
condition involving the curvature tensor for the scalar geometry and the charge
and mass matrices for the vector fields. Moreover, for given curvature, charges
and masses satisfying this constraint, the vector of F and D auxiliary fields
defining the Goldstino direction is constrained to lie within a certain domain.
The effect of vector multiplets relative to chiral multiplets is maximal when
the masses of the vector fields are comparable to the gravitino mass. When the
masses are instead much larger or much smaller than the gravitino mass, the
effect becomes small and translates into a correction to the effective
curvature. We finally apply our results to some simple classes of examples, to
illustrate their relevance.

clusters, filaments, sheets and voids, the Cosmic Web. For the understanding of
its dynamical and hierarchical history it is crucial to identify objectively
its complex morphological components. One of the most characteristic aspects is
that of the dominant underdense Voids, the product of a hierarchical process
driven by the collapse of minor voids in addition to the merging of large ones.
In this study we present an objective void finder technique which involves a
minimum of assumptions about the scale, structure and shape of voids. Our void
finding method, the Watershed Void Finder (WVF), is based upon the Watershed
Transform, a well-known technique for the segmentation of images. Importantly,
the technique has the potential to trace the existing manifestations of a void
hierarchy. The basic watershed transform is augmented by a variety of
correction procedures to remove spurious structure resulting from sampling
noise. This study contains a detailed description of the WVF. We demonstrate
how it is able to trace and identify, relatively parameter free, voids and
their surrounding (filamentary and planar) boundaries. We test the technique on
a set of Kinematic Voronoi models, heuristic spatial models for a cellular
distribution of matter. Comparison of the WVF segmentations of low noise and
high noise Voronoi models with the quantitatively known spatial characteristics
of the intrinsic Voronoi tessellation shows that the size and shape of the
voids are succesfully retrieved. WVF manages to even reproduce the full void
size distribution function.

this product is proved. It is equivalent to subadditivity of the entropy of
bistochastic maps with respect to their composition, where the entropy of a map
is the entropy of the corresponding state under the Jamiolkowski isomorphism.
Strong dynamical subadditivity of a concatenation of three bistochastic maps is
established. Analogous bounds for the entropy of a composition are derived for
general stochastic maps. In the classical case they lead to new bounds for the

grain size decreases from 29 to 6 nm as the non-magnetic Al content increases,

grain size. Magnetic hysteresis loops were measured at room temperature with a
maximum applied magnetic field of 1T. As aluminum content increases, the
measured magnetic hysteresis curves become more and more narrow and the
saturation magnetization and remanent magnetization both decreased. The
reduction of agnetization compared to bulk is a consequence of spin
non-collinearity. Further reduction of magnetization with increase of aluminum
content is caused by non-magnetic Al^{3+} ions and weakened interaction between
sublattices. This, as well as the decrease in hysteresis was understood in

theory on a spatial three-torus contains a certain number of bound states,
characterized by their discrete abelian magnetic and electric 't Hooft fluxes.
At weak coupling, the wave-functions of these states are supported near points
in the moduli space of flat connections where the unbroken gauge group is
semi-simple. The number of such states is related to the number of normalizable
bound states at threshold in the supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics with
16 supercharges based on this unbroken group. Mathematically, the determination
of the spectrum relies on the classification of almost commuting triples with
semi-simple centralizers. We complete the work begun in a previous paper, by
computing the spectrum of bound states in theories based on the
even-dimensional spin groups and the exceptional groups. The results satisfy
the constraints of S-duality in a rather non-trivial way.

neighbor decoders, which can be easily implemented on most practical coded
modulation systems, we derive a decoding metric that minimizes the average of
the transmission error probability over all channel estimation errors. This
metric, for arbitrary memoryless channels, achieves the capacity of a composite
(more noisy) channel. Next, according to the notion of estimation-induced
outage capacity (EIO capacity) introduced in our previous work, we characterize
maximal achievable information rates associated to the proposed decoder. The
performance of the proposed decoding metric over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading
MIMO channels is compared to both the classical mismatched maximum-likelihood
(ML) decoder and the theoretical limits given by the EIO capacity (i.e. the
best decoder in presence of channel estimation errors). Numerical results show
that the derived metric provides significant gains, in terms of achievable
information rates and bit error rate (BER), in a bit interleaved coded
modulation (BICM) framework, without introducing any additional decoding
complexity.

The devil wins if the angel does not find any more white squares to land on.

strategy such that the devil will never capture her. This deceptively
