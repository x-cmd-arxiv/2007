further reduction of the effective charge. Finite contributions to dielectric
screening are expected in all orders of perturbation theory.

changing the electron density of an insulator in which the electron spins are
antiferromagnetically ordered. A key characteristic of the superconductor is
that electrons can be extracted from them at zero energy only if their momenta
take one of four specific values (the `nodal points'). A central enigma has
been the evolution of the zero energy electrons in the metallic state between
the antiferromagnet and the superconductor, and recent experiments yield
apparently contradictory results. The oscillation of the resistance in this
metal as a function of magnetic field indicate that the zero energy electrons
carry momenta which lie on elliptical `Fermi pockets', while ejection of
electrons by high intensity light indicates that the zero energy electrons have
momenta only along arc-like regions. We present a theory of new states of
matter, which we call `algebraic charge liquids', which arise naturally between
the antiferromagnet and the superconductor, and reconcile these observations.
Our theory also explains a puzzling dependence of the density of
superconducting electrons on the total electron density, and makes a number of
unique predictions for future experiments.

of the observed HI line fluxes obtained with the two different telescopes,
characterized by half-power beam widths of 9 arcmin and 21 arcmin respectively,
exploits a ``beam matching'' technique to yield a statistical determination of
the occurrence of diffuse HI components in their disks. A simple model of the
HI distribution within a galaxy well describes ~75 % of the sample and accounts
for all of the HI line flux density. The remaining galaxies are approximately
evenly divided into two categories: ones which appear to possess a
significantly more extensive HI distribution than the model predicts, and ones
for which the HI distribution is more centrally concentrated than predicted.
Examples of both extremes can be found in the literature but little attention
has been paid to the centrally concentrated HI systems. Our sample has
demonstrated that galaxies do not commonly possess extended regions of low
surface brightness HI gas which is not accounted for by our current
understanding of the structure of HI disks. Eight HI-rich companions to the

provide robust predictions. We obtain these predictions by first showing that
the matrix V_M, product of the quark (CKM) and lepton (PMNS) mixing matrices,
may have a zero (1,3) entry which is favored by experimental data.
  We obtain that any theoretical model with a vanishing (1,3) entry of V_M that
is in agreement with quark data, solar, and atmospheric mixing angle leads to
$\theta_{13}^{PMNS}=(9{^{+1}_{-2}})^\circ$. This value is consistent with the
present 90% CL experimental upper limit. We also investigate the prediction on
the lepton phases. We show that the actual evidence, under the only assumption
that the correlation matrix V_M product of CKM and PMNS has a zero in the entry
(1,3), gives us a prediction for the three CP-violating invariants J, S_1, and
S_2. A better determination of the lepton mixing angles will give stronger
prediction for the CP-violating invariants in the lepton sector. These will be
tested in the next generation experiments. Finally we compute the effect of non
diagonal neutrino mass in ""l_i -> l_j gamma"" in SUSY theories with non trivial
Quark-Lepton complementarity and a flavor symmetry. The Quark-Lepton
complementarity and the flavor symmetry strongly constrain the theory and we
obtain a clear prediction for the contribution to ""mu -> e gamma"" and the ""tau""
decays ""tau -> e gamma"" and ""tau -> mu gamma"". If the Dirac neutrino Yukawa
couplings are degenerate but the low energy neutrino masses are not degenerate,
then the lepton decays are related among them by the V_M entries. On the other
hand, if the Dirac neutrino Yukawa couplings are hierarchical or the low energy
neutrino masses are degenerate, then the prediction for the lepton decays comes
from the CKM hierarchy.

B514, obtained from HST/ACS observations. Coupling the analysis of the
distribution of the integrated light with star counts we can reliably follow
the profile of the cluster out to r~35"", corresponding to ~130pc. The profile
is well fitted, out to ~15 core radii, by a King Model having C=1.65. With an
estimated core radius r_c=0.38"", this corresponds to a tidal radius of r_t~17""
(~65pc). We find that both the light and the star counts profiles show a
departure from the best fit King model for r>~8"" - as a surface brightness
excess at large radii, and the star counts profile shows a clear break in
correspondence of the estimated tidal radius. Both features are interpreted as
the signature of the presence of extratidal stars around the cluster. We also
show that B514 has a half-light radius significantly larger than ordinary
globular clusters of the same luminosity. In the M_V vs. log r_h plane, B514
lies in a region inhabited by peculiar clusters, like Omega Cen, G1, NGC2419
and others, as well as by the nuclei of dwarf elliptical galaxies.

constructed from the second Gaussian derivative gives access to the

In the present work, the non-Gaussianity of the WMAP temperature data of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) is analyzed in terms of the first four
moments of the statistically isotropic random fields associated with these
local morphological measures, at wavelet scales corresponding to angular sizes
between 27.5 arcminutes and 30 degrees on the celestial sphere. While no
detection is made neither in the orientation analysis nor in the elongation
analysis, a strong detection is made in the excess kurtosis of the
signed-intensity of the WMAP data. The non-Gaussianity is observed with a
significance level below 0.5% at a wavelet scale corresponding to an angular
size around 10 degrees, and confirmed at neighbour scales. This supports a
previous detection of an excess of kurtosis in the wavelet coefficient of the
WMAP data with the axisymmetric Mexican hat wavelet (Vielva et al. 2004).
Instrumental noise and foreground emissions are not likely to be at the origin
of the excess of kurtosis. Large-scale modulations of the CMB related to some
unknown systematics are rejected as possible origins of the detection. The
observed non-Gaussianity may therefore probably be imputed to the CMB itself,
thereby questioning the basic inflationary scenario upon which the present
concordance cosmological model relies. Taking the CMB temperature angular power
spectrum of the concordance cosmological model at face value, further analysis
also suggests that this non-Gaussianity is not confined to the directions on
the celestial sphere with an anomalous signed-intensity.

the same matter density profile for each method, which we choose to be an NFW

constrain both the NFW scale radius and central density, we estimate the scale
radius using a fitting function for the concentration derived from cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations and an X-ray estimate of the mass assuming
isothermality. We keep this scale radius in common for both X-ray and
weak-lensing profiles, and fit for the central density, which scales linearly
with mass. We find that for three of these clusters, there is agreement between
X-ray and weak-lensing NFW central densities, and thus masses. For the other
cluster, the X-ray central density is higher than that from weak-lensing by 2
sigma. X-ray images suggest that this cluster may be undergoing a merger with a
smaller cluster. This work serves as an additional step towards understanding
the possible biases in X-ray and weak-lensing cluster mass estimation methods.

this partitioning problem arises at certain phases of the MinD and MinE
oscillations with respect to septal closure and it persists independently of
parameter variation. At most 85% of the daughter cells exhibit Min oscillation
following septation. Enhanced MinD binding at the static polar and dynamic

collapse of supermassive stars (M > 10^3M_sun) and to very massive Pop III
stars. We model our initial configurations by n=3 polytropes. The ratio of
magnetic to rotational kinetic energy in these configurations is chosen to be
small (1% and 10%). We find that such magnetic fields do not affect the initial
collapse significantly. The core collapses to a black hole, after which black
hole excision is employed to continue the evolution long enough for the hole to
reach a quasi-stationary state. We find that the black hole mass is M_h = 0.95M
and its spin parameter is J_h/M_h^2 = 0.7, with the remaining matter forming a
torus around the black hole. We freeze the spacetime metric (""Cowling
approximation"") and continue to follow the evolution of the torus after the
black hole has relaxed to quasi-stationary equilibrium. In the absence of
magnetic fields, the torus settles down following ejection of a small amount of
matter due to shock heating. When magnetic fields are present, the field lines
gradually collimate along the hole's rotation axis. MHD shocks and the MRI
generate MHD turbulence in the torus and stochastic accretion onto the central
black hole. When the magnetic field is strong, a wind is generated in the
torus, and the torus undergoes radial oscillations that drive episodic
accretion onto the hole. These oscillations produce long-wavelength
gravitational waves potentially detectable by LISA. The final state of the
magnetorotational collapse always consists of a central black hole surrounded
by a collimated magnetic field and a hot, thick accretion torus. This system is
a viable candidate for the central engine of a long-soft gamma-ray burst.

long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are particularly well-suited for creating
the massive star progenitors of these GRBs. Motivated by the hypothesis that
massive young star clusters located in metal-poor, low-metallicity galaxies are
a natural birthsite for GRB progenitors, we present a comparison study of the
ISM properties along the sightline toward the super star cluster, NGC1705-1,
and those in distant GRB hosts. Using the same set of metal transitions in the
UV and applying known ISM structures in NGC1705, we find that NGC1705-1
resembles distant GRB host galaxies in its high neutral gas column, low
molecular gas fraction, low metallicity, alpha-element enhancement,and low dust
depletion. The lack of molecular gas is due to the enhanced UV radiation field
in the starburst environment, consistent with the expectations for GRB
progenitors. In addition, the known presence of dense neutral gas clouds at
r<500 pc from NGC1705-1 provides a natural reservoir of C^+, Si^+, and Fe^+
ions that may be subsequently excited by the afterglow UV radiation field to
produce excited lines commonly seen in GRB host ISM. We further argue that the
apparent offset in the velocity profiles of low- and high-ionization
transitions from absorption-line observations alone already offers important
clues for related starburst episodes in GRB host galaxies. Our study shows that
a statistical comparison between the ISM around star clusters and high-redshift
GRB progenitors is important for identifying the key physical parameters that
facilitate the formation of GRBs.

presence of structured, frequently non-uniform, connectivity. Because diverse

because they provide the means to identify and classify several types of
complex networks, it becomes important to obtain meaningful measurements of the
local network topology. In addition to traditional features such as the node
degree, clustering coefficient and shortest path, motifs have been introduced
in the literature in order to provide complementary description of the networks
connectivity. The current work proposes a new type of motifs, namely chains of
nodes, namely sequences of connected nodes with degree two. These chains have
been subdivided into cords, tails, rings and handles, depending on the type of
their extremities (e.g. open or connected). A theoretical analysis of the
density of such motifs in random and scale free networks is described, and an
algorithm for identifying those motifs in general networks is presented. The
potential of considering chains for network characterization has been
illustrated with respect to five categories of real-world networks including 16
cases. Several interesting findings were obtained, including the fact that
several chains were observed in the real-world networks, especially the WWW,

abundance can be significantly enhanced compared to that obtained from freeze
out in a radiation-dominated universe. Collider measurements then will
simultaneously probe both dark matter and dark energy. In this article, we
investigate the precision to which the LHC and ILC can determine the dark

illustrative set of four benchmark points in minimal supergravity in analogy
with the four LCC benchmark points. The precision achievable together at the

the assumption that the WIMPs are the only dark matter component. The LHC and

algebra $T(V^*)$ by relations $x_i\otimes x_j-x_j\otimes x_i=R_{ij}(\hbar)$
where $R_{ij}(\hbar)\in T(V^*)\otimes\hbar \mathbb{C}[[\hbar]]$, $R_{ij}=\hbar
\Sym(\alpha_{ij})+\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2)$, with one relation for each pair of
$i,j=1...\dim V$. We prove that the constructed algebra obeys the PBW property,
and this is a generalization of the Poincar\'{e}-Birkhoff-Witt theorem. In the
case of a linear Poisson structure we get the PBW theorem itself, and for a
quadratic Poisson structure we get an object closely related to a quantum
$R$-matrix on $V$. At the same time we get a free resolution of the deformed
algebra (for an arbitrary $\alpha$).
  The construction of this PBW algebra is rather simple, as well as the proof
of the PBW property. The major efforts should be undertaken to prove the
conjecture that in this way we get an algebra isomorphic to the Kontsevich
star-algebra.

measure preferred-frame effects (PFEs) in binary pulsars that exhibit a high
rate of periastron advance. We show that in these systems the existence of a
preferred frame for gravity leads to an observable characteristic `signature'
in the timing data, which uniquely identifies this effect. We expand the
standard Damour-Deruelle timing formula to incorporate this `signature' and
show how this new PFE timing model can be used to either measure or constrain
the parameters related to a violation of the local Lorentz invariance of
gravity in the strong internal fields of neutron stars. In particular, we
demonstrate that in the presence of PFEs we expect a set of the new timing
parameters to have a unique relationship that can be measured and tested
incontrovertibly. This new methodology is applied to the Double Pulsar, which
turns out to be the ideal test system for this kind of experiments.The
currently available dataset allows us only to study the impact of PFEs on the
orbital precession rate, d omega/dt, providing limits that are, at the moment,
clearly less stringent than existing limits on PFE strong-field parameters.
However, simulations show that the constraints improve fast in the coming
years, allowing us to study all new PFE timing parameters and to check for the
unique relationship between them. Finally, we show how a combination of several
suitable systems in a ""PFE antenna array"", expected to be availabe for instance
with the Square-Kilometre-Array (SKA), provides full sensitivity to possible
violations of local Lorentz invariance in strong gravitational fields in all
directions of the sky. This PFE antenna array may eventually allow us to
determine the direction of a preferred frame should it exist.

response is ubiquitous in cell signaling. If each site contributes an
additional, equivalent binding site, then one consequence of an increase in the
number of phosphorylations may be to increase the probability that, upon
disassociation, a ligand immediately rebinds to its receptor. How such effects
may influence cell signaling systems has been less studied. Here, a
self-consistent integral equation formalism for ligand rebinding, in
conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations, is employed to further investigate
the effects of multiple, equivalent binding sites on shaping biological
responses. Multiple regimes that characterize qualitatively different physics
due to the differential prevalence of rebinding effects are predicted.
Calculations suggest that when ligand rebinding contributes significantly to
the dose response, a purely allovalent model can influence the binding curves
nonlinearly. The model also predicts that ligand rebinding in itself appears
insufficient to generative a highly cooperative biological response.

that there exists a well-defined relation between the solution for energy gap
parameter amplitude $|\Delta_{\bf k}|$ for a general interaction $V_{{\bf
k},{\bf k}'}$ and energy gap $\Delta$ obtained by using the cut-off
approximation. The relation between $|\Delta_{\bf k}|$ and $\Delta$ indicates
that $\Delta$ is a weighted average over $|\Delta_{\bf k}|$ of electronic
states within cut-off energy $\xi_c$ around the Fermi surface. In this
interpretation for $\Delta$, $\xi_c$ is not a property of $V_{{\bf k},{\bf

average over $|\Delta_{\bf k}|$ is taken. We show that the proper choice for
the value of $\xi_c$ is only a few $k_BT_c$ (i.e., $\xi_c/k_BT_c$ is about 3 or
4). We also show that the cut-off approximation, even with
$\xi_c/k_BT_c=\infty$, is a good approximation when it is used to calculate
quantities such as the condensation energy and the specific heat, but it leads
to significant overestimation for the Josephson critical current density of a

for energy gap parameter amplitude $|\Delta_{\bf k}|$ as a function of wave
vector {\bf k}, temperature $T$ and vector potential {\bf a}; and the second is
a London-like relation between electrical current density {\bf j} and vector
potential {\bf a}, with an ``effective superconducting electron density'' $n_s$
that is both $T$- and {\bf a}-dependent. The two equations allow determination
of spatial variations of {\bf a} and $|\Delta_{\bf k}|$ in a superconductor for
given temperature $T$, applied magnetic field ${\bf H}_a$ and sample geometry.
The theory shows the existence of a ``partly-paired state,'' in which paired
electrons (having $|\Delta_{\bf k}|>0$) and de-paired electrons (having
$|\Delta_{\bf k}|=0$) co-exist. Such a ``partly-paired state'' exists even at
T=0 when $H_a$ is above a threshold for a given sample, giving rise to a
non-vanishing Knight shift at T=0 for $H_a$ above the threshold. We expect the
theory to be valid for highly-local superconductors for all temperatures and
magnetic fields below the superconducting transition. In the low-field limit,
the theory reduces to the local-limit result of BCS. As examples, we apply the
theory to the case of a semi-infinite superconductor in an applied magnetic
field ${\bf H}_a$ parallel to the surface of the superconductor and the case of
an isolated vortex in an infinite superconductor, and determine, in each case,

probe the same density fluctuations. We explore the question of whether this
information can be used twice -- once in weak lensing and then again in halo
clustering to calibrate cluster masses -- or whether the combined dark energy
constraints are weaker than the sum of the individual constraints. For a survey
like the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we find that the cosmic shearing of source
galaxies at high redshifts is indeed highly correlated with halo clustering at
lower redshifts. Surprisingly, this correlation does not degrade cosmological
constraints for a DES-like survey, and in fact, constraints are marginally
improved since the correlations themselves act as additional observables. This
considerably simplifies the analysis for a DES-like survey: when weak lensing
and halo clustering are treated as independent experiments, the combined dark
energy constraints (cluster counts included) are accurate if not slightly
conservative. Our findings mirror those of Takada and Bridle, who investigated
correlations between the cosmic shear and cluster counts.

whether new experiments, using improved experimental techniques, could make
useful contributions to testing the Standard Model (SM). We find that, if
parity experiments in hydrogen can be done, they remain highly desirable
because there is negligible atomic-physics uncertainty and low energy tests of
weak neutral current interactions are needed to probe for new physics beyond
the SM. Of particular interest would be a measurement of the nuclear spin
independent coupling C_{1D} for the deuteron at a combined error (theory +
experiment) of 0.3%. This would provide a factor of three improvement to the
precision on sin^2 theta_W at very low momentum transfer provided by heavy atom
Atomic Parity Violation (APV) experiments. Also, experiments in H and D could
provide precise measurements of three other electron-nucleon,
weak-neutral-current coupling constants: C_{1p}, C_{2p},and C_{2D}, which have
not been accurately determined to date. Analysis of a generic APV experiment in
deuterium indicates that a 0.3% measurement of C_{1D} requires development of a
slow (77K) metastable beam of ~ 5x10^14 D(2S) s^-1 per hyperfine component. The
advent of UV radiation from free electron laser (FEL) technology could allow
production of such a beam.

analyse the gauge of the local observer, which represents the gauge of a
laboratory environment on Earth. The gauge-invariance between the two gauges is
shown in its full angular and frequency dependences. In previous works in the
literature this gauge-invariance was shown only in the low frequencies
approximation or in the simplest geometry of the interferometer in respect to
the propagating GW (i.e. both of the arms of the interferometer are
perpendicular to the propagating GW). As far as the computation of the response
functions in the gauge of the local observer is concerned, a common
misconception about interferometers is also clarifed.

multifractality in heart rate fluctuations in healthy state has been reported
[Ivanov et al., Nature {\bf 399}, 461 (1999)]. This multifractal character
could be manifested as a dependence on scale or beat number of the probability
density functions (PDFs) of the heart rate increments. On the other hand, scale
invariance has been recently reported in a detrended analysis of healthy heart
rate increments [Kiyono et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 93}, 178103 (2004)]. In
this paper, we resolve this paradox by clarifying that the scale invariance
reported is actually exhibited by the PDFs of the sum of detrended healthy
heartbeat intervals taken over different number of beats, and demonstrating
that the PDFs of detrended healthy heart rate increments are scale dependent.
Our work also establishes that this scale invariance is a general feature of
human heartbeat dynamics, which is shared by heart rate fluctuations in both
healthy and pathological states.

polaritons, they force the condensate to be linearly polarized--as observed. In
bulk, they also force linear polarization, but of dark states, due to interband
Coulomb scatterings. To evidence this dark condensate, we thus need indirect
processes, like the shift it induces on the (bright) exciton line.
