simultaneously tested by astronomical observations and laboratory experiments.
The dark energy is a field with slightly sub-gravitational couplings to matter,
a logarithmic self-interaction potential with a scale tuned to $\sim 10^{-3}
{\rm eV}$, as is usual in quintessence models, and an effective mass $m_\phi$
influenced by the environmental energy density. Its forces may be suppressed
just below the current bounds by the chameleon-like mimicry, whereby only outer
layers of mass distributions, of thickness $1/m_\phi$, give off appreciable
long range forces. After inflation and reheating, the field is relativistic,
and attains a Planckian expectation value before Hubble friction freezes it.
This can make gravity in space slightly stronger than on Earth. During the
matter era, interactions with nonrelativistic matter dig a minimum close to the
Planck scale. However, due to its sub-gravitational matter couplings the field
will linger away from this minimum until the matter energy density dips below
$\sim 10^{-12} {\rm eV}^4$. Then it starts to roll to the minimum, driving a
period of cosmic acceleration. Among the signatures of this scenario may be
dark energy equation of state $w \ne -1$, stronger gravity in dilute mediums,
that may influence BBN and appear as an excess of dark matter, and
sub-millimeter corrections to Newton's law, close to the present laboratory
limits.

current circulating around the closed graphene ring, as well as on the ring
conductance. We explicitly confirm this prediction analytically for a circular
ring with a smooth boundary modelled by a space-dependent mass term in the
Dirac equation. This model describes rings with zero or weak intervalley
scattering so that the valley isospin is a good quantum number. The tunable
breaking of the valley degeneracy by the flux allows for the controlled
manipulation of valley isospins. We compare our analytical model to another
type of ring with strong intervalley scattering. For the latter case, we study
a ring of hexagonal form with lattice-terminated zigzag edges numerically. We
find for the hexagonal ring that the orbital degeneracy can still be controlled
via the flux, similar to the ring with the mass confinement.

a common component of many more complex algorithms and therefore is a widely

  Not much is new in the proposed dualheap selection algorithm: the heap data
structure is from J.W.J.Williams, the bottom-up heap construction is from R.W.
Floyd, and the concept of a two heap data structure is from J.W.J. Williams and
D.E. Knuth. The algorithm's novelty is limited to a few relatively minor
implementation twists: 1) the two heaps are oriented with their roots at the
partition values rather than at the minimum and maximum values, 2)the coding of
one of the heaps (the heap of smaller values) employs negative indexing, and 3)
the exchange phase of the algorithm is similar to a bottom-up heap
construction, but navigates the heap with a post-order tree traversal.
  When run on a single processor, the dualheap selection algorithm's
performance is competitive with quickselect with median estimation, a common
variant of C.A.R. Hoare's quicksort algorithm. When run on parallel processors,
the dualheap selection algorithm is superior due to its subtasks that are
easily partitioned and innately balanced.

the isotropic liquid-drop phase known as the collapsed globule. On the other
hand, strongly favouring the hydrogen-like interactions give rise to an
anisotropic folded (solid-like) phase on lowering the temperature. We use Monte
Carlo simulations up to a length of 256 to map out the phase diagram in the
plane of parameters and determine the order of the associated phase
transitions. We discuss the connections to semi-flexible polymers and other
polymer models. Importantly, we demonstrate that for a range of energy
parameters two phase transitions occur on lowering the temperature, the second

Spitzer 24, 70, and 160 micron data. Our primary interest is to improve the
constraints on the total IR luminosities, L(IR), of these galaxies. We combine
the Spitzer data in the southern Extended Chandra Deep Field with a
K-band-selected galaxy sample and photometric redshifts from the
Multiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile. We used a stacking analysis to measure
the average 70 and 160 micron flux densities of 1.5 < z < 2.5 galaxies as a
function of 24 micron flux density, X-ray activity, and rest-frame near-IR
color. Galaxies with 1.5 < z < 2.5 and S(24)=53-250 micro-Jy have L(IR) derived
from their average 24-160 micron flux densities within factors of 2-3 of those
derived from the 24 micron flux densities only. However, L(IR) derived from the
average 24-160 micron flux densities for galaxies with S(24) > 250 micro-Jy and
1.5 < z < 2.5 are lower than those derived using only the 24 micron flux
density by factors of 2-10. Galaxies with S(24) > 250 micro-Jy have S(70)/S(24)
flux ratios comparable to sources with X-ray detections or red rest-frame IR
colors, suggesting that warm dust possibly heated by AGN may contribute to the
high 24 micron emission. Based on the average 24-160 micron flux densities,
nearly all 24 micron-selected galaxies at 1.5 < z < 2.5 have L(IR) < 6 x 10^12
solar luminosities, which if attributed to star formation corresponds to < 1000
solar masses per year. This suggests that high redshift galaxies may have
similar star formation efficiencies and feedback processes as local analogs.
Objects with L(IR) > 6 x 10^12 solar luminosities are quite rare, with a
surface density ~ 30 +/- 10 per sq. deg, corresponding to ~ 2 +/- 1 x 10^-6
Mpc^-3 over 1.5 < z < 2.5.

curriculum on this topic including an interactive computer simulation,
interactive lectures with peer instruction, and conceptual and mathematical

correctly predict the results of photoelectric effect experiments, and (2)
describe how these results lead to the photon model of light. We designed two
exam questions to test these learning goals. Our instruction leads to better
student mastery of the first goal than either traditional instruction or
previous reformed instruction, with approximately 85% of students correctly
predicting the results of changes to the experimental conditions. On the
question designed to test the second goal, most students are able to correctly
state both the observations made in the photoelectric effect experiment and the
inferences that can be made from these observations, but are less successful in
drawing a clear logical connection between the observations and inferences.
This is likely a symptom of a more general lack of the reasoning skills to
logically draw inferences from observations.

Swedish ESO Submillimeter Telescope, towards eighteen luminous IRAS point
sources, all with colors typical of compact HII regions and associated with

regions. Emission was detected toward all the IRAS objects. We find that the

sizes of 0.4 pc, dust temperatures of 30 K, masses of 2x10^3 Msun, column
densities of 3x10^23 cm^-2, and densities of 4x10^5 cm^-3. We refer to these
dust structures as massive and dense cores. Most of the 1.2-mm sources show
single-peaked structures, several of which exhibit a bright compact peak
surrounded by a weaker extended envelope. The observed radial intensity
profiles of sources with this type of morphology are well fitted with power-law
intensity profiles with power-law indices in the range 1.0-1.7. This result
indicates that massive and dense cores are centrally condensed, having radial
density profiles with power-law indices in the range 1.5-2.2. We also find that
the UC HII regions detected with ATCA towards the IRAS sources investigated
here (Paper I) are usually projected at the peak position of the 1.2-mm dust
continuum emission, suggesting that massive stars are formed at the center of
the centrally condensed massive and dense cores.

mesoscopic modes that depend critically on the ratio of the transverse (to the

systems and unveil the fundamental mechanisms of planet formation. An important
aspect of the problem, which remains largely unknown, is to understand how the
planet formation process depends on the mass of the parent star. In particular,
as most planets discovered to date orbit a solar-mass primary, little is known
about planet formation around more massive stars. Aims. To investigate this
point, we present first results from a radial velocity planet search around red
giants in the clump of intermediate-age open clusters. We choose clusters
harbouring red giants with masses between 1.5 and 4 M_sun, using the well-known
cluster parameters to accurately determine the stellar masses. We are therefore
exploring a poorly-known domain of primary masses, which will bring new
insights into the properties of extrasolar planetary systems. Methods. We are
following a sample of about 115 red giants with the Coralie and HARPS
spectrographs to obtain high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements and
detect giant planets around these stars. We use bisector and activity index
diagnostics to distinguish between planetary-induced RV variations and stellar
photospheric jitter. Results. We present the discoveries of a giant planet and
a brown dwarf in the open clusters NGC 2423 and NGC 4349, orbiting the 2.4
M_sun-star NGC2423 No3 (TYC 5409-2156-1) and the 3.9 M_sun-star NGC4349 No127
(TYC 8975-2606-1). These low-mass companions have orbital periods of 714 and
678 days and minimum masses of 10.6 and 19.8 M_jup, respectively. Combined with
the other known planetary systems, these detections indicate that the frequency
of massive planets is higher around intermediate-mass stars, and therefore
probably scales with the mass of the protoplanetary disk.

Universe is speeding up and not slowing, revealing the presence of some form of
repulsive gravity. Within the context of general relativity the cause of cosmic
acceleration is a highly elastic (p\sim -rho), very smooth form of energy
called ``dark energy'' accounting for about 75% of the Universe. The
``simplest'' explanation for dark energy is the zero-point energy density
associated with the quantum vacuum; however, all estimates for its value are
many orders-of-magnitude too large. Other ideas for dark energy include a very
light scalar field or a tangled network of topological defects. An alternate
explanation invokes gravitational physics beyond general relativity.
Observations and experiments underway and more precise cosmological
measurements and laboratory experiments planned for the next decade will test
whether or not dark energy is the quantum energy of the vacuum or something
more exotic, and whether or not general relativity can self consistently
explain cosmic acceleration. Dark energy is the most conspicuous example of
physics beyond the standard model and perhaps the most profound mystery in all
of science.

relations as a function of host halo mass. Selection can mimic evolution; the
\lm and \lt relations from shallow X-ray flux-limited samples will deviate from
mass-limited expectations at nearly all scales while the relations from deep

low-order moments of the luminosity distribution at fixed temperature, and show

covariance affects the redshift behavior of halo counts and mean luminosity in
a manner that is nearly degenerate with intrinsic population evolution.

the challenges for realizing a particular class of structures in semiconductor

Two are familiar: a cold, dilute phase of confined hadrons, where the pressure
is ~ 1, and a hot phase of deconfined quarks and gluons, with pressure ~ N_c^2.
When the quark chemical potential mu ~ 1, the deconfining transition
temperature, T_d, is independent of mu. For T < T_d, as mu increases above the
mass threshold, baryons quickly form a dense phase where the pressure is ~ N_c.
As illustrated by a Skyrme crystal, chiral symmetry can be both spontaneously
broken, and then restored, in the dense phase. While the pressure is ~ N_c,
like that of (non-ideal) quarks, the dense phase is still confined, with
interactions near the Fermi surface those of baryons, and not of quarks. Thus
in the chirally symmetric region, baryons near the Fermi surface are parity
doubled. We suggest possible implications for the phase diagram of QCD.

asymptotic gauge fields in the (4, 5, 6, 7) directions are forbidden in this
gauge, so the SU(3) symmetry is broken down to an SU(2)xU(1) symmetry
asymptotically.

capture, charged- and neutral-current neutrino reactions, and electron
scattering - are described by a set of multipole operators carrying definite
parity and angular momentum, obtained by projection from the underlying nuclear
charge and three-current operators. If these nuclear operators are approximated
by their one-body forms and expanded in the nucleon velocity through order
|\vec{p}|/M, where \vec{p} and M are the nucleon momentum and mass, a set of
seven multipole operators is obtained. Nuclear structure calculations are often
performed in a basis of Slater determinants formed from harmonic oscillator
orbitals, a choice that allows translational invariance to be preserved.
Harmonic-oscillator single-particle matrix elements of the multipole operators
can be evaluated analytically and expressed in terms of finite polynomials in
q^2, where q is the magnitude of the three-momentum transfer. While results for
such matrix elements are available in tabular form, with certain restriction on
quantum numbers, the task of determining the analytic form of a response
function can still be quite tedious, requiring the folding of the tabulated
matrix elements with the nuclear density matrix, and subsequent algebra to
evaluate products of operators. Here we provide a Mathematica script for
generating these matrix elements, which will allow users to carry out all such
calculations by symbolic manipulation. This will eliminate the errors that may
accompany hand calculations and speed the calculation of electroweak nuclear
cross sections and rates. We illustrate the use of the new script by
calculating the cross sections for charged- and neutral-current neutrino
scattering in ^{12}C.

maximum planar matching (maximum planar subgraph) of at most d edges to a
signed sum of restricted lattice walks in Z^d, and to the number of pairs of
standard Young tableaux of the same shape and with a ``descend--type''

proofs through which Gessel's identity can be obtained (an identity that is
crucial in the derivation of a bivariate generating function associated to the
distribution of LISs, and key to the analytic attack on Ulam's problem).

A",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.76.013828",,"physics.optics",,"  In this article, localized linear defect modes due to bandgap guidance in
two-dimensional photonic lattices with localized or non-localized defects are
investigated theoretically. First, when the defect is localized and weak,
eigenvalues of defect modes bifurcated from edges of Bloch bands are derived
analytically. It is shown that in an attractive (repulsive) defect, defect
modes bifurcate out from Bloch-band edges with normal (anomalous) diffraction
coefficients. Furthermore, distances between defect-mode eigenvalues and
Bloch-band edges are exponentially small functions of the defect strength,
which is very different from the one-dimensional case where such distances are
quadratically small with the defect strength. It is also found that some
defect-mode branches bifurcate not from Bloch-band edges, but from quasi-edge
points within Bloch bands, which is very unusual. Second, when the defect is
localized but strong, defect modes are determined numerically. It is shown that
both the repulsive and attractive defects can support various types of defect
modes such as fundamental, dipole, quadrupole, and vortex modes. These modes
reside in various bandgaps of the photonic lattice. As the defect strength
increases, defect modes move from lower bandgaps to higher ones when the defect
is repulsive, but remain within each bandgap when the defect is attractive,
similar to the one-dimensional case. The same phenomena are observed when the
defect is held fixed while the applied dc field (which controls the lattice
potential) increases. Lastly, if the defect is non-localized (i.e. it persists
at large distances in the lattice), it is shown that defect modes can be
embedded inside the continuous spectrum, and they can bifurcate out from edges
of the continuous spectrum algebraically rather than exponentially.

the 0.075-0.030 Msun mass range. Our estimate is three times larger than the
binary fractions reported from high-resolution imaging surveys of field
ultracool dwarfs and Pleiades brown dwarfs. However, it is marginally
consistent with our earlier ``peculiar'' photometric binary fraction of
50+/-10% presented in Pinfield et al. (2003), in good agreement with the 32-45%
binary fraction derived from the recent Monte-Carlo simulations of Maxted &
Jeffries (2005) and compatible with the 26+/-10% frequency recently estimated

  Science Publishers Inc., New York. 46 pages",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  In this chapter we review our findings on the bonding structure and growth
mechanisms of carbon-based thin solid films with fullerene-like (FL)
microstructure. The so-called FL arrangements arise from the curvature and
cross-linking of basal planes in graphitic-like structures, partially
resembling that of molecular fullerenes. This three-dimensional superstructure
takes advantage of the strength of planar pi bonds in sp2 hybrids and confers
the material interesting mechanical properties, such as high hardness, high
elastic recovery, low-friction and wear-resistance. These properties can be
tailored by controlling the curvature, size and connectivity of the FL
arrangements, making these materials promising coatings for tribological
applications. We have focused our interest mostly on carbon nitride (CNx) since
nitrogen promotes the formation of FL arrangements at low substrate
temperatures and they are emerging over pure carbon coatings in tribological
applications such as protective overcoats in magnetic hard disks. We address
structural issues such as origin of plane curvature, nature of the
cross-linking sites and sp2 clustering, together with growth mechanisms based
on the role of film-forming precursors, chemical re-sputtering or concurrent
ion assistance during growth.

For one-dimensional systems the Luttinger liquid approach provides insight into
universal properties. Much is known of the equilibrium state, both in the
weakly and strongly interacting regime. However, it remains a challenge to
probe the dynamics by which this equilibrium state is reached. Here we present
a direct experimental study of the coherence dynamics in both isolated and
coupled degenerate 1d Bose gases. Dynamic splitting is used to create two 1d
systems in a phase coherent state. The time evolution of the coherence is
revealed in local phase shifts of the subsequently observed interference
patterns. Completely isolated 1d Bose gases are observed to exhibit a universal
sub-exponential coherence decay in excellent agreement with recent predictions
by Burkov et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 200404 (2007)]. For two coupled 1d Bose
gases the coherence factor is observed to approach a non-zero equilibrium value
as predicted by a Bogoliubov approach. This coupled-system decay to finite
coherence is the matter wave equivalent of phase locking two lasers by
injection. The non-equilibrium dynamics of superfluids plays an important role
in a wide range of physical systems, such as superconductors, quantum-Hall
systems, superfluid Helium, and spin systems. Our experiments studying
coherence dynamics show that 1d Bose gases are ideally suited for investigating
this class of phenomena.

The first stage is short and leads to the appearance of a step density wave,
with a wavelength roughly independent of the surface orientation. The second
stage is much slower, and leads to the formation of a hill-and-valley
structure, the period of which depends on the initial surface orientation. A
simple continuum model enables us to point out why the wavelength of the step
density wave does not depend on the microscale details of the surface. The
final wavelength is controlled by the competition between elastic step-step

undulator setup with arbitrary undulator parameter, taking into account a
finite transverse size of the electron bunch. Earlier studies considered a line
density-distribution of electrons instead. We focus our attention on the
long-wavelength asymptote (compared with resonance wavelength), at large
distance of the electron bunch from the undulator entrance compared to the
overtaking length, and for large vacuum-chamber size compared to the typical
transverse size of the field. These restrictions define a parameter region of
interest for practical applications. We calculate a closed expression for
impedance and wake function that may be evaluated numerically in the most
general case. Such expression allows us to derive an analytical solution for a
Gaussian transverse and longitudinal bunch shape. Finally, we study the
feasibility of current-enhanced SASE schemes (ESASE) recently proposed for
LCLS, that fall well-within our approximations. Numerical estimations presented
in this paper indicate that impedance-induced energy spread is sufficient to
seriously degrade the FEL performance. Our conclusion is in contrast with
results in literature, where wake calculations for the LCLS case are given in
free-space, as if the presence of the undulator were negligible.

X-ray emission from a coeval pair of substellar objects. The spatial resolution
of XMM-Newton is not sufficient to separate contributions from the two
components in the binary. The X-ray source detected with XMM-Newton has a
column density compatible with the infrared extinction of component A. On the

X-ray emission. Combined with previous sensitive X-ray observations from
low-mass members of ChaI, we find a decline of X-ray luminosity with decreasing
(sub)stellar mass that is typical for star forming regions. 2M1101B is the

a proximity effect where the superconducting correlations leak into the normal
metal. An additional contact close to the first one makes it possible to carry
a supercurrent through the metal. Forcing this supercurrent flow along with an
additional quasiparticle current from one or many normal-metal reservoirs makes
rise to many interesting effects. The supercurrent can be used to tune the
local energy distribution function of the electrons. This mechanism also leads
to finite thermoelectric effects even in the presence of electron-hole
symmetry. Here we review these effects and discuss to which extent the existing
observations of thermoelectric effects in metallic samples can be explained
through the use of the dirty-limit quasiclassical theory.

technique to obtain high diversity and coding gain on a block-fading MIMO
channel. Its maximum-likelihood (ML) performance is computed under ideal
interleaving conditions, which enables a global optimization taking into
account channel coding. Thanks to a diversity upperbound derived from the
Singleton bound, an appropriate choice of the time dimension of the space-time
coding is possible, which maximizes diversity while minimizing complexity.
Based on the analysis, an optimized interleaver and a set of linear precoders,
called dispersive nucleo algebraic (DNA) precoders are proposed. The proposed
precoders have good performance with respect to the state of the art and exist
for any number of transmit antennas and any time dimension. With turbo codes,
they exhibit a frame error rate which does not increase with frame length.

the different kinds of resonances in the transmission spectra and by the number
of scattering channels, into the amount of quantum correlations between the two
identical carriers. It is shown that the entanglement between their energy
states is not sensitive to the presence of Breit-Wigner resonances, while it
presents a peculiar behavior in correspondence of Fano peaks: two close maxima
separated by a minimum, for a two-channel scattering, a single maximum for a
multi-channel scattering. Such a behavior is ascribed to the different
mechanisms characterizing the two types of resonances. Our results suggest that
the production and detection of entanglement in quantum dot structures may be
controlled by the manipulation of Fano resonances through external fields.

nevertheless, directly from the asymptotic field one can extract a complex
analytic world-line defined in complex Minkowski space that gives a unified
Lorentz invariant meaning to both the electric and magnetic dipole moments. In
some sense the world-line defines a `complex center of charge' around which
both electric and magnetic dipole moments vanish.
  The question of how and where does this complex world-line arise is one of
the two main subjects of this work. The other subject concerns what is known in
the mathematical literature as a CR structure. In GR, CR structures naturally
appear in the physical context of shear-free (or asymptotically shear-free)
null geodesic congruences in space-time. For us, the CR structure is associated
with the embedding of Penrose's real three-dimensional null infinity, I^+, as a
surface in a two complex dimensional space, C^2. It is this embedding, via a
complex function, (a CR function), that is our other area of interest.
Specifically we are interested in the `decomposition' of the CR function into
its real and imaginary parts and the physical information contained in this
decomposition.
