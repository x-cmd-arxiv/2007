  Solar Neighborhood","ApJ published version","ApJ, 2007, 671, 761","10.1086/522228",,"astro-ph",,"  Low mass helium-core white dwarfs (M < 0.45 Msun) can be produced from
interacting binary systems, and traditionally all of them have been attributed
to this channel. However, a low mass white dwarf could also result from a
single star that experiences severe mass loss on the first ascent giant branch.
A large population of low mass He-core white dwarfs has been discovered in the
old metal-rich cluster NGC 6791. There is therefore a mechanism in clusters to
produce low mass white dwarfs without requiring binary star interactions, and
we search for evidence of a similar population in field white dwarfs. We argue
that there is a significant field population (of order half of the detected
systems) that arises from old metal rich stars which truncate their evolution
prior to the helium flash from severe mass loss. There is a consistent absence
of evidence for nearby companions in a large fraction of low mass white dwarfs.
The number of old metal-rich field dwarfs is also comparable with the
apparently single low mass white dwarf population, and our revised estimate for
the space density of low mass white dwarfs produced from binary interactions is
also compatible with theoretical expectations. This indicates that this channel
of stellar evolution, hitherto thought hypothetical only, has been in operation
in our own Galaxy for many billions of years. One strong implication of our
model is that single low mass white dwarfs should be good targets for planet
searches because they are likely to arise from metal-rich progenitors. We also
discuss other observational tests and implications, including the potential
impact on SN Ia rates and the frequency of planetary nebulae.

results in a hydrodynamic thermonuclear runaway, in which the nuclear heating
time becomes shorter than the local dynamical time. We model the resulting

We solve the reactive fluid flow and show that the detonation propagates
through the deepest layers of fuel and drives a shock wave that steepens as it
travels upward into lower density material. The shock is sufficiently strong
upon reaching the freshly accreted H/He layer that it triggers unstable 4He
burning if the superburst occurs during the latter half of the regular Type I
bursting cycle; this is likely the origin of the bright Type I precursor bursts
observed at the onset of superbursts. The cooling of the outermost shock-heated
layers produces a bright, ~0.1s, flash that precedes the Type I burst by a few
seconds; this may be the origin of the spike seen at the burst onset in 4U
1820-30 and 4U 1636-54, the only two bursts observed with RXTE at high time
resolution. The dominant products of the 12C detonation are 28Si, 32S, and

shallow as to support only two bound states, and we prepare the atoms in the
ground state. The lattice is oriented vertically, leading to a tilted-washboard
potential analogous to those encountered in condensed-matter systems.
Experimentally, we find that a square pulse consisting of lattice displacements
and a delay is more efficient than single-step and Gaussian pulses. This is
described as an example of coherent control. It is striking that contrary to
the intuition that soft pulses minimize loss, the Gaussian pulse is
outperformed by the square pulse. Numerical calculations are in strong
agreement with our experimental results and show the superiority of the square
pulse to the single-step pulse for all lattice depths and to the Gaussian pulse
for lattice depths greater than 7 lattice recoil energies. We also compare the
effectiveness of these pulses for reviving oscillations of atoms in vibrational
superposition states using the pulse-echo technique. We find that the square
and Gaussian pulses result in higher echo amplitudes than the single-step
pulse. These improved echo pulses allow us to probe coherence at longer times
than in the past, measuring a plateau which has yet to be explained. In
addition, we show numerically that the vibrational state coupling due to such
lattice manipulations is more efficient in shallow lattices than in deep
lattices.

flux is associated with sources detected by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
This paper uses the existing CDF-N data to constrain the X-ray flux
distribution of these X-ray undetected HST sources, by comparing the number of
0.5-2 keV X-ray counts at the HST positions to those expected for model flux
distributions. In the simple case where all the undetected HST X-ray sources
have the same 0.5-2 keV flux, the data are best fit by 1.5-3 counts per source
in 2 Ms, compared to a detection limit (at 10% completeness) of 9 counts.
Assuming a more realistic power-law logN-logS distribution [N(>S) S^-alpha],
the data favor a relatively steep flux distribution, with alpha=1.1^+0.5_-0.3
(limits are 99% confidence). This slope is very similar to that previously
found for faint normal and starburst galaxies in the CDF-N. These results
suggest deeper Chandra observations will detect a new population of faint X-ray
sources, but extremely deep exposures are needed to resolve the remainder of
the soft CXB. In the most optimistic scenario, when the HST sources have the
flattest allowed flux distribution and all the sources without HST counterparts
are detected, observations 5 times more sensitive than the existing ones would
resolve at most ~60% of the remaining soft CXB.

in the afterglow phase of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), and in other environments
where relativistic flows interact with the interstellar medium. A particular
regime of shocks in an unmagnetized plasma has generated much interest for GRB
applications. In this paper we present ab-initio particle-in-cell simulations
of unmagnetized relativistic electron-ion shocks. Using long-term
2.5-dimensional simulations with ion-electron mass ratios from 16 to 1000 we
resolve the shock formation and reach a steady-state shock structure beyond the

unmagnetized shocks can be effectively mediated by the ion Weibel instability
with a typical shock thickness of ~50 ion skin-depths. Upstream of the shock
the interaction with merging ion current filaments heats the electron
component, so that the postshock flow achieves near equipartition between the
ions and electrons, with electron temperature reaching 50% of the ion
temperature. This energy exchange helps to explain the large electron energy

  http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v9/shafer08a.html",,,"cs.LG stat.ML",,"  Conformal prediction uses past experience to determine precise levels of
confidence in new predictions. Given an error probability $\epsilon$, together
with a method that makes a prediction $\hat{y}$ of a label $y$, it produces a
set of labels, typically containing $\hat{y}$, that also contains $y$ with
probability $1-\epsilon$. Conformal prediction can be applied to any method for
producing $\hat{y}$: a nearest-neighbor method, a support-vector machine, ridge
regression, etc.
  Conformal prediction is designed for an on-line setting in which labels are
predicted successively, each one being revealed before the next is predicted.
The most novel and valuable feature of conformal prediction is that if the
successive examples are sampled independently from the same distribution, then
the successive predictions will be right $1-\epsilon$ of the time, even though
they are based on an accumulating dataset rather than on independent datasets.
  In addition to the model under which successive examples are sampled
independently, other on-line compression models can also use conformal
prediction. The widely used Gaussian linear model is one of these.
  This tutorial presents a self-contained account of the theory of conformal
prediction and works through several numerical examples. A more comprehensive
treatment of the topic is provided in ""Algorithmic Learning in a Random World"",

minimising at constant volume the total energy (bulk and surface energies)

Epitaxial strain acts against wetting (adhesion) so that globally it leads to a
thickening of the ES. (2) Owing to strain the ES changes with size. More
precisely the various facets extension changes, some facets decreasing, some
others increasing. (3) Each dislocation entrance, necessary for relaxing
plastically too large crystals abruptly modifies the ES and thus the different
facets extension in a jerky way. (4) In all cases the usual self-similarity

universe and could represent a substantial fraction of the Dark Matter: the
so-called Super Heavy Dark Matter (SHDM). The decay of SHDM represents also a
possible source of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR), with a reliably
calculated spectrum of the particles produced in the decay $(\propto
E^{-1.9})$. The SHDM model for the production of UHECR can explain
quantitatively only the excess of UHE events observed by AGASA. In the case of
an observed spectrum not showing the AGASA excess the SHDM model can provide
only a {\it subdominant} contribution to the UHECR flux. We discuss here the
basic features of SHDM for the production of a {\it subdominant} UHECR flux, we
refer our study to the possible signatures of the model at the Auger
observatory discussing in particular the expected chemical composition and
anisotropy.

planetary cores within shorter timescales than those involved in the standard

protoplanetary disks with an embedded giant planet with planet to star mass
ratio $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$. Two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a
protoplanetary disk with a planet are performed using two different numerical
methods. The results of the non-linear simulations are compared with a
time-resolved modal analysis of the azimuthally averaged surface density
profiles using linear perturbation theory. Finite-difference methods
implemented in polar coordinates generate vortices moving along the gap created
by Neptune-mass to Jupiter-mass planets. The modal analysis shows that unstable
modes are generated with growth rate of order $0.3 \Omega_K$ for azimuthal
numbers m=4,5,6, where $\Omega_K$ is the local Keplerian frequency.
Shock-capturing Cartesian-grid codes do not generate very much vorticity around
a giant planet in a standard protoplanetary disk. Modal calculations confirm
that the obtained radial profiles of density are less susceptible to the growth
of linear modes on timescales of several hundreds of orbital periods.
Navier-Stokes viscosity of the order $\nu=10^{-5}$ (in units of $a^2 \Omega_p$)
is found to have a stabilizing effect and prevents the formation of vortices.
This result holds at high resolution runs and using different types of boundary
conditions. Giant protoplanets of Neptune-mass to Jupiter-mass can excite the
Rossby wave instability and generate vortices in thin disks. The presence of
vortices in protoplanetary disks has implications for planet formation, orbital
migration, and angular momentum transport in disks.

of the cosmological constant problem by producing a smooth, and approximately
constant, distribution of potentially observable values of Lambda. The low

anthropically acceptable vacua to have a minimum life-time of 10 billion years,
then for reasonable parameters a typical observer should expect their vacuum to

massive black hole at their center, but that these black holes are not always
in an actively accreting phase. X-ray emission is often used to identify
accreting sources, but for galaxies that are not harboring quasars
(low-luminosity active galaxies), the X-ray flux may be weak, or obscured by
dust. To aid in the understanding of weakly accreting black holes in the local
universe, a large sample of galaxies with X-ray detections is needed. We
cross-match the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS) with galaxies from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 (SDSS DR4) to create such a sample. Because
of the high SDSS source density and large RASS positional errors, the
cross-matched catalog is highly contaminated by random associations. We
investigate the overlap of these surveys and provide a statistical test of the
validity of RASS-SDSS galaxy cross-matches. SDSS quasars provide a test of our
cross-match validation scheme, as they have a very high fraction of true RASS
matches. We find that the number of true matches between the SDSS main galaxy
sample and the RASS is highly dependent on the optical spectral classification
of the galaxy; essentially no star-forming galaxies are detected, while more
than 0.6% of narrow-line Seyferts are detected in the RASS. Also, galaxies with
ambiguous optical classification have a surprisingly high RASS detection
fraction. This allows us to further constrain the SEDs of low-luminosity active
galaxies. Our technique is quite general, and can be applied to any
cross-matching between surveys with well-understood positional errors.

and without rotation in a cylindrical geometry. The corresponding hydrostatic
equilibria are most relevant to the dynamics of the protosolar nebula before
and during the stages of planet and satellite formation. The nonrotating
solution for the mass density is analytic, nonsingular, monotonically
decreasing with radius, and it satisfies easily the usual physical boundary
conditions at the center. When differential rotation is added to the
Lane--Emden equation, an entire class of exact solutions for the mass density
appears. We have determined all of these solutions analytically as well. Within
this class, solutions that are power laws or combinations of power laws are not
capable of satisfying the associated boundary--value problem, but they are
nonetheless of profound importance because they constitute ""baselines"" to which
the actual solutions approach when the central boundary conditions are imposed.
Numerical integrations that enforce such physical boundary conditions show that
the actual radial equilibrium density profiles emerge from the center close to
the nonrotating solution, but once they cross below the corresponding
baselines, they cease to be monotonic. The actual solutions are forced to
oscillate permanently about the baseline solutions without ever settling onto
them because the central boundary conditions strictly prohibit such settling,
even in the asymptotic regime of large radii. Based on our results, we expect
that quasistatically--evolving protoplanetary disks should develop oscillatory
density profiles in their midplanes during their isothermal phase. The peaks in
these profiles correspond to local potential minima and their locations are
ideal sites for the formation of protoplanets ...

outflow from winds generated by the hidden massive companion, and 2) mass from
the bright O9.7 Ibpe supergiant flowing from the region near the L2 point to
fill out a large, dense circumbinary disk. This circumbinary disk (radius ~ 1

a baryon loading B=10^{-2} which coincides with the upper limit for the

density shows a radial dependence n_{cbm} \propto r^{-\alpha} with
1.0<\alpha<1.7 and monotonically decreases from 1 to 10^{-6} particles/cm^3.
Such a behavior is interpreted as due to a fragmentation in the fireshell.
Analogies with the fragmented density and filling factor characterizing Novae

complete data set available for GRB060218 and of the fact that it fulfills the
Amati relation. We fit GRB060218, usually considered as an X-Ray Flash (XRF),
as a ""canonical GRB"" within our theoretical model. The smallest possible black
hole, formed by the gravitational collapse of a neutron star in a binary

associated with SNe Ib/c. We give the first evidence for a fragmentation in the
fireshell. Such a fragmentation is crucial in explaining both the unusually

thin magnetic layer is `draped' over a core merging into a larger cluster; the
same process also appears to be at work at a bubble rising from the cluster
centre. Such a thin magnetic layer could thermally isolate the core from the
cluster medium, but only if the same shear process which generates the layer
does not later disrupt it. On the other hand, if the magnetized layer can
stabilize against the shear instabilities, then the magnetic layer can have the
additional dynamical effect of reducing the shear-driven mixing of the core's
material during the merger process. These arguments could equally well to
underdense cluster bubbles, which would be even more prone to disruption. While
it is well known that magnetic fields can suppress instabilities, it is less
clear that a thin layer can suppress instabilities on scales significantly
larger than its thickness. Here we consider the stability imparted by a thin
magnetized layer. Such a layer can have a significant stabilizing effect even
on modes with wavelengths much larger than the thickness of the layer l; to
stabilize modes ten times larger requires only that the Alfv\'en speed in the
magnetized layer is comparable to the relevant destabilizing velocity -- the
shear velocity in the case of pure Kelvin-Helmholtz like instability, or a
typical buoyancy velocity in the case of pure Rayleigh-Taylor. We confirm our
calculations with two-dimensional numerical experiments using the Athena code.

The extended mathematics of complexity contains the truly universal definition
of dynamic complexity, randomness (chaoticity), classification of all possible
dynamic regimes, and the unifying principle of any system dynamics and
evolution, the universal symmetry of complexity. Every real system has a
non-zero (and actually high) value of unreduced dynamic complexity determining,
in particular, ""mysterious"" behaviour of quantum systems and relativistic
effects causally explained now as unified manifestations of complex interaction
dynamics. The observed differences between various systems are due to different
regimes and levels of their unreduced dynamic complexity. We outline
applications of universal concept of dynamic complexity emphasising cases of
""truly complex"" systems from higher complexity levels (ecological and living

cross-correlation of the 21 cm brightness and the CMB Doppler fluctuations on
large angular scales can be used to study this epoch. We employ a new model of
the growth of large scale fluctuations of the ionized fraction as reionization
proceeds. We take into account the peculiar velocity field of baryons and show
that its effect on the cross correlation can be interpreted as a mixing of
Fourier modes. We find that the cross-correlation signal is strongly peaked
toward the end of reionization and that the sign of the correlation should be
positive because of the inhomogeneity inherent to reionization. The signal
peaks at degree scales (l~100) and comes almost entirely from large physical
scales (k~0.01 Mpc). Since many of the foregrounds and noise that plague low
frequency radio observations will not correlate with CMB measurements, the
cross correlation might appear to provide a robust diagnostic of the
cosmological origin of the 21 cm radiation around the epoch of reionization.
Unfortunately, we show that these signals are actually only weakly correlated
and that cosmic variance dominates the error budget of any attempted detection.
We conclude that the detection of a cross-correlation peak at degree-size
angular scales is unlikely even with ideal experiments.

at geothermal hot springs, such as those at Yellowstone National Park, and
speleothems, particularly stalactites and stalagmites. The theory couples the
precipitation front dynamics with shallow water flow, including corrections for
turbulent drag and curvature effects. In the absence of capillarity and with a
laminar flow profile, the theory predicts a one-parameter family of steady
state solutions to the moving boundary problem describing the precipitation
front. These shapes match well the measured shapes near the vent at the top of
observed travertine domes. Closer to the base of the dome, the solutions
deviate from observations, and circular symmetry is broken by a fluting
pattern, which we show is associated with capillary forces causing thin film
break-up. We relate our model to that recently proposed for stalactite growth,
and calculate the linear stability spectrum of both travertine domes and
stalactites. Lastly, we apply the theory to the problem of precipitation
pattern formation arising from turbulent flow down an inclined plane, and
identify a linear instability that underlies scale-invariant travertine terrace

engineering the structure and dynamics of biochemical networks is high.
Recently an algorithm for reverse engineering of biochemical networks was
developed by Laubenbacher and Stigler. It is a top-down approach using time
discrete dynamical systems. One of its key steps includes the choice of a term
order. The aim of this paper is to identify minimal requirements on data sets
to be used with this algorithm and to characterize optimal data sets. We found
minimal requirements on a data set based on how many terms the functions to be
reverse engineered display. Furthermore, we identified optimal data sets, which
we characterized using a geometric property called ""general position"".
Moreover, we developed a constructive method to generate optimal data sets,
provided a codimensional condition is fulfilled. In addition, we present a
generalization of their algorithm that does not depend on the choice of a term
order. For this method we derived a formula for the probability of finding the
correct model, provided the data set used is optimal. We analyzed the
asymptotic behavior of the probability formula for a growing number of
variables n (i.e. interacting chemicals). Unfortunately, this formula converges
to zero as fast as r^(q^n), where q is a natural number and 0<r<1. Therefore,
even if an optimal data set is used and the restrictions in using term orders
are overcome, the reverse engineering problem remains unfeasible, unless
prodigious amounts of data are available. Such large data sets are
experimentally impossible to generate with today's technologies.

both allowed by the tight and most reliable constraints from two stars Ter 5 I

$V$-band) for spectroscopy, which are located within a circular region with the
radius of 30"" around the center of SNR Tycho. If the ejecta of young supernova
remnants, such as SNR Tycho, have a sufficient amount of Fe I, we should be
able to detect absorption lines at 3720 \AA and 3860 \AA associated with
transitions from the ground state of Fe I in the spectrum of the companion
star. To identify the companion star of a SN Ia using these characteristic
absorption lines of Fe I, we made optical low-resolution spectroscopy of their
targets using FOCAS on the Subaru Telescope. In our spectroscopic observations,
we obtained spectra of 17 stars in the SNR Tycho region and compare them with
template stellar spectra. We detect significant absorption lines from two stars
at 3720 \AA. Since widths of their absorption lines are broad, it is likely
that the detected absorptions are due to Fe I in the expanding ejecta of SNR
Tycho. However, none of stars exhibits a clear red wing in the observed
profiles of the absorption, though a star in the background of the SNR should
show it. Hence, we suggest another interpretation that the detected absorption
lines might be caused by the peculiarity of stars. A star named Tycho(E) has
the absorption line at 3720 \AA and its projected position is close to the
center of SNR Tycho. Based on our observations, Tycho(E) is a new candidate as
the companion star of Tycho's supernova.

of BaTiO_3 single crystals using Landau thermodynamic potential is addressed.
Our results suggest that when using the sixth-power free energy expansion of
the thermodynamic potential, remarkably different values of the fourth-power
coefficient, \beta (the coefficient of P^4_i terms), are required to adequately
reproduce the nonlinear dielectric behavior of the paraelectric phase and the
electric field induced ferroelectric phase, respectively. In contrast, the
eighth-power expansion with a common set of coefficients enables a good
description for both phases at the same time. These features, together with the
data available in literature, strongly attest to the necessity of the
eighth-power terms in Landau thermodynamic potential of BaTiO_3. In addition,
the fourth-power coefficients, \beta and \xi (the coefficient of P^2_i P^2_j
terms), were evaluated from the nonlinear dielectric responses along [001],
[011], and [111] orientations in the paraelectric phase. Appreciable
temperature dependence was evidenced for both coefficients above T_C. Further
analysis on the linear dielectric response of the single domain crystal in the
tetragonal phase demonstrated that temperature dependent anharmonic
coefficients are also necessary for an adequate description of the dielectric
behavior in the ferroelectric phase. As a consequence, an eighth-power
thermodynamic potential, with some of the anharmonic coefficients being
temperature dependent, was proposed and compared with the existing potentials.
In general, the potential proposed in this work exhibits a higher quality in
reproducing the dielectric and ferroelectric properties of this prototypic

sources projected into the cluster diffuse emission and exclude them from the
analysis to estimate the ``correct'' X-ray observables. In order to verify the
incidence of point sources on the cluster thermal emission and to evaluate the
impact of their non-thermal emission on the determination of cluster
properties, we used a sample of 18 high-z (0.25 < z < 1.01) clusters from the
Chandra archive. We performed a detailed analysis of the cluster properties and
compared the changes observed in the X-ray observables, like temperature and
luminosity or their inter-relation, when one keeps the point sources in the
analysis. The point sources projected into the cluster extended emission affect
the estimates of cluster temperature or luminosity considerably (up to 13% and
17% respectively). These percentages become even larger for clusters with z >
0.7 where temperature and luminosity increase up to 24% and 22%, respectively.
Thus the point sources should be removed to correctly estimate the cluster
properties. However the inclusion of the point sources does not impact
significantly the slope and normalization of the L-T relationship since for
each cluster the correction to be applied to T and L produces a moderate shift
in the L-T plane almost parallel to the best-fit of the ``correct'' L-T
relation.

three independent modes, enables us to deduce constrained ranges for the mass

theta Oph and to prove the occurrence of core overshooting (alpha_ov = 0.44 +/-

quantum dynamics in a non-harmonic potential well. Both the H2 rotational

extracted from the Chandra archive supplemented with additional clusters from
the literature, either observed by Chandra or XMM-Newton, to form a final
sample of 39 high redshift (0.25 < z < 1.3) objects. Different statistical
approaches are adopted to analyze the L_X-T relation. The slope of the L_X-T
relation of high redshift clusters is steeper than expected from the
self-similar model predictions and steeper, even though still compatible within
the errors, than the local L_X-T slope. The distant cluster L_X-T relation
shows a significant evolution with respect to the local Universe: high-z
clusters are more luminous than the local ones by a factor ~2 at any given
temperature. The evolution with redshift of the L_X-T relation cannot be
described by a single power law nor by the evolution predicted by the
self-similar model. We find a strong evolution, similar or stronger than the
self-similar model, from z = 0 to z <0.3 followed by a much weaker, if any,
evolution at higher redshift. The weaker evolution is compatible with
non-gravitational models of structure formation. According to us a
statistically significant sample of nearby clusters (z < 0.25) should be
observed with the current available X-ray telescopes to completely exclude
observational effects due to different generation detectors and to understand
this novel result.

monitored V1647 Ori in outburst between February 2004 and January 2006. The
optical spectrum is characterized by Halpha and Hbeta in P-Cygni profile and by
many weak FeI and FeII emission lines. Short timescale variability was measured
in the continuum and line emission. On January 2006 we detected for the first
time forbidden emission lines ([OI], [SII] and [FeII]). These lines are likely
produced by an Herbig-Haro object driven by V1647 Ori. The mid infrared the
spectrum of V1647 Ori is flat and featureless at all epochs. The SED changed
drastically: the source was much redder in the early outburst than in the final
phase. The magnitude rise and the SED of V1647 Ori resembles that of a FUor
while the duration and recurrence of the outburst resemble that of a EXor. The
optical spectrum is clearly distinct from either the absorption line spectrum
of a FUor or the T Tauri-like spectrum of an EXor. Our data are consistent with
a disk instability event which led to an increase of the mass accretion rate.
The data also suggest the presence of a circumstellar envelope around the
star+disk system. The peculiar N band spectrum might be explained by dust
sublimation in the outer layers of the disk. The presence of the envelope and
the outburst statistics suggest that these instability events occur only in a
specific stage of a Class I source (e.g. in the transition phase to an
optically visible star surrounded by a protoplanetary disk). We discuss the
outburst mechanisms in term of the thermal instability model.

gold coated sphere and a gold coated plate. The data are compared with a new
theoretical approach to the thermal Casimir force based on the use of the
Lifshitz formula, combined with a generalized plasma-like dielectric
permittivity which takes into account interband transitions of core electrons.
The theoretical Casimir pressures calculated using the new approach are
compared with those computed in the framework of the previously used impedance
approach and also with the Drude model approach. The latter is shown to be
excluded by the data at a 99.9% confidence level within a wide separation range
from 210 to 620 nm. The level of agreement between the data and theoretical
approaches based on the generalized plasma model, or the Leontovich surface
impedance, is used to set stronger constraints on the Yukawa forces predicted
from the exchange of light elementary particles and/or extra-dimensional
physics. The resulting constraints are the strongest in the interaction region
from 20 to 86 nm with a largest improvement by a factor of 4.4 at 26 nm.

predict an inversion between them. This inversion occurs near $^{48}$Ca as well
as very far from stability where the two states systematically cross each other

suggested that chiral symmetry is approximately restored in excited hadrons at
zero temperature/density (effective symmetry restoration). If correct, this
implies that mass generation mechanisms and physics in excited hadrons is very
different as compared to the lowest states. One needs an alternative and
independent experimental information to confirm this conjecture. Using very
general chiral symmetry arguments it is shown that strict chiral restoration in
a given excited nucleon forbids its decay into the N \pi channel. Hence those
excited nucleons which are assumed from the spectroscopic patterns to be in
approximate chiral multiplets must only ""weakly"" decay into the N \pi channel,
(f_{N^*N\pi}/f_{NN\pi})^2 << 1. However, those baryons which have no chiral
partner must decay strongly with a decay constant comparable with f_{NN\pi}.
Decay constants can be extracted from the existing decay widths and branching
ratios. It turnes out that for all those well established excited nucleons
which can be classified into chiral doublets N_+(1440) - N_-(1535), N_+(1710) -

established excited nucleon for which the chiral partner cannot be identified
from the spectroscopic data, N(1520), has a decay constant into the N\pi

An adequate fractionation of polydisperse polymers is therefore mandatory.
  Very efficient means are available for analytical purposes. However, these

grams. In order to gain access to large enough quantities of sufficiently
uniform polymer samples, we have developed a special kind of extraction process
called Continuous Spin Fractiona-tion (CSF). The better soluble macromolecular
species are preferentially transferred from a feed phase (concentrated polymer
solution) into a pickup phase (solvent of tai-lored thermodynamic quality). The
main problem of the procedure lies in the high vis-cosities of reasonably
concentrated polymer solutions, impeding the attainment of ther-modynamic
equilibria. This hurdle could be cleared by means of spinning nozzles through
which the feed is pressed into the pickup phase. CSF can be implemented to any
soluble polymer and is likewise apt for the production of small and of large
amounts of polymer samples with the required uniformity. This contribution
explains how to customize CSF to the polymer of interest and presents a number

functional is strongly indefinite. Second, the Euler-Lagrange equations are
linear or nonlinear eigenvalue problems with eigenvalues lying in a spectral
gap (between the negative and positive continuous spectra). Moreover, since we
work in the space domain R^3, the Palais-Smale condition is not satisfied. For
these reasons, the problems discussed in this review pose a challenge in the
Calculus of Variations. The existence proofs involve sophisticated tools from
nonlinear analysis and have required new variational methods which are now
applied to other problems.

young stars has been a point of debate. To both address this issue and obtain a
better understanding of the formation of BSSs in different environments we have
analysed a sample of BSS candidates in two nearby Galactic dSphs, Draco and
Ursa Minor. We have determined their radial and luminosity distributions from
wide field multicolour imaging data extending beyond the tidal radii of both
galaxies.
  BSS candidates are uniformly distributed through the host galaxy, whereas a
young population is expected to show a more clumpy distribution. Furthermore,
the observed radial distribution of BSSs, normalized to both red giant branch
(RGB) and horizontal branch (HB) stars, is almost flat, with a slight decrease
towards the centre. Such a distribution is at odds with the predictions for a
young stellar population, which should be more concentrated. Instead, it is
consistent with model predictions for BSS formation by mass transfer in
binaries (MT-BSSs). Such results, although not decisive, suggest that these
candidates are indeed BSSs and that MT-BSSs form in the same way in Draco and
Ursa Minor as in globular clusters. This favours the conclusion that Draco and
Ursa Minor are truly 'fossil' galaxies, where star formation ceased completely
more than 8 billion years ago.

launched from the resistive accretion disc is mainly accelerated by the
magneto-centrifugal force. We also show that when a dense inner stellar wind
occurs, the resulting disc-driven jet have a different structure, namely a
magnetic structure where poloidal magnetic field lines are more inclined

both an enhanced mass ejection rate in the disc-driven jet and a larger radial

Masers at 6030 MHz are usually a factor of a few weaker than at 6035 MHz but

much more closely correlated than in the ground state, likely due to the
smaller spatial separation between Zeeman components. Hydroxyl maser peaks at

ejected stellar embryos in star-forming clusters. Such a formation mechanism
can result in different spatial distributions of stars and substellar objects.
We aim to investigate the spatial structure of stellar and substellar objects
in two well sampled and nearby embedded clusters, namely IC348 and the Orion
Trapezium Cluster (OTC) to test this hypothesis. Methods:Deep near-infrared
K-band data complete enough to sample the substellar population in IC348 and
OTC are obtained from the literature. The spatial distribution of the K-band
point sources is analysed using the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) method. The Q
parameter and the spanning trees are evaluated for stellar and substellar
objects as a function of cluster core radius R$_c$. Results: The stellar
population in both IC348 and OTC display a clustered distribution whereas the
substellar population is distributed homogeneously in space within twice the
cluster core radius. Although the substellar objects do not appear to be bound
by the cluster potential well, they are still within the limits of the cluster
and not significantly displaced from their birth sites. Conclusions: The
spatially homogeneous distribution of substellar objects is best explained by
assuming higher initial velocities, distributed in a random manner and going
through multiple interactions. The overall spatial coincidence of these objects
with the cluster locations can be understood if these objects are nevertheless
travelling slowly enough so as to feel the gravitational effect of the cluster.
The observations support the formation of substellar objects as ``ejected
stellar embryos''. Higher ejection velocities are necessary but net spatial
displacements may not be necessary to explain the observational data.

RESULTS: We carried out millimetric registrations on real data and guidance
experiments on a kidney phantom showed encouraging results of 4.7 mm between
planned and reached targets. We noticed that the most significant error was
related to the needle deflection during the puncture. CONCLUSION: Preliminary
results are encouraging. Further work will be undertaken to improve efficiency

stochastic volatility models in which the disturbances have rational
probability density functions. This includes the Cauchy distributions and
Student t-distributions with odd number of degrees of freedom. Using state
space realizations to represent the rational probability density functions we
are able to solve the filtering problem exactly. However the size of the
involved state space matrices grows exponentially with each time step of the
filter. Therefore we use stochastically balanced truncation techniques to
approximate the high order rational functions involved. In a simulation study
we show the applicability of this approach. In addition a simple method of

study cool moderately dense gas with high sensitivity and angular resolution in
a cloud that existed half a Hubble time ago. Observations of the radio
continuum and six formaldehyde (H2CO) lines were carried out with the VLA, the
Plateau de Bure interferometer, and the Effelsberg 100-m telescope. Three radio
continuum maps indicate a flux density ratio between the two main images, A and
B, of ~ 3.4 +/- 0.2. Within the errors the ratio is the same at 8.6, 14.1, and
43 GHz. The 1_{01}-0_{00} line of para-H2CO is shown to absorb the continuum of
image A. Large Velocity Gradient radiative transfer calculations are performed
to reproduce the optical depths of the observed two cm-wave ""K-doublet"" and
four mm-wave rotational lines. These calculations also account for a likely
frequency-dependent continuum cloud coverage. Confirming the diffuse nature of
the cloud, an n(H2) density of < 1000 cm^{-3} is derived, with the best fit
suggesting n(H2) ~ 200 cm^{-3}. The H2CO column density of the main velocity
component is ~5 * 10^{13} cm^{-2}, to which about 7.5 * 10^{12} cm^{-2} has to
be added to also account for a weaker feature on the blue side, 13 km/s apart.
N(H2CO)/N(NH3) ~ 0.6, which is four times less than the average ratio obtained
from a small number of local diffuse (galactic) clouds seen in absorption. The
ortho-to-para H2CO abundance ratio is 2.0 - 3.0, which is consistent with the
kinetic temperature of the molecular gas associated with the lens of B0218+357.
With the gas kinetic temperature and density known, it is found that optically
thin transitions of CS, HCN, HNC, HCO+, and N2H+ (but not CO) will provide
excellent probes of the cosmic microwave background at redshift z=0.68.

photon-nucleon (nucleus) interactions. The current LHC detector configurations
can explore small $x$ hard phenomena with nuclei and nucleons at photon-nucleon
center-of-mass energies above 1 TeV, extending the $x$ range of HERA by a
factor of ten. In particular, it will be possible to probe diffractive and
inclusive parton densities in nuclei using several processes. The interaction
of small dipoles with protons and nuclei can be investigated in elastic and
quasi-elastic $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ production as well as in high $t$
$\rho^0$ production accompanied by a rapidity gap. Several of these phenomena
provide clean signatures of the onset of the new high gluon density QCD regime.
The LHC is in the kinematic range where nonlinear effects are several times
larger than at HERA. Two-photon processes in UPCs are also studied. In
addition, while UPCs play a role in limiting the maximum beam luminosity, they
can also be used a luminosity monitor by measuring mutual electromagnetic
dissociation of the beam nuclei. We also review similar studies at HERA and
RHIC as well as describe the potential use of the LHC detectors for UPC
measurements.

formation of the first structures and reduce the total star mass in the
smallest halos.

in processes of $e^+e^-$ annihilation at energies $\sqrt{s}$ 14 -- 206.2 GeV.
The experimental data are compared to data, obtained with Monte Carlo
simulation in PYTHIA in the Lund quark string model. It is shown, that both
experimental and simulated data are described by the same distribution function
in the KNO form. It is shown, that the KNO scaling is consequence of quark
string hadronization dynamics in the Lund string model.

"0706.3359","Edward Witten","Edward Witten","Three-Dimensional Gravity Revisited","82 pp",,,,"hep-th",,"  We consider the problem of identifying the CFT's that may be dual to pure
gravity in three dimensions with negative cosmological constant. The c-theorem
indicates that three-dimensional pure gravity is consistent only at certain
values of the coupling constant, and the relation to Chern-Simons gauge theory
hints that these may be the values at which the dual CFT can be holomorphically
factorized. If so, and one takes at face value the minimum mass of a BTZ black
hole, then the energy spectrum of three-dimensional gravity with negative
cosmological constant can be determined exactly. At the most negative possible
value of the cosmological constant, the dual CFT is very likely the monster
theory of Frenkel, Lepowsky, and Meurman. The monster theory may be the first
in a discrete series of CFT's that are dual to three-dimensional gravity. The
partition function of the second theory in the sequence can be determined on a
hyperelliptic Riemann surface of any genus. We also make a similar analysis of
supergravity.

  Phys.: 63 pages, 36 figures",,"10.1103/RevModPhys.80.1215",,"cond-mat.other",,"  The physics of quantum degenerate Fermi gases in uniform as well as in
harmonically trapped configurations is reviewed from a theoretical perspective.
Emphasis is given to the effect of interactions which play a crucial role,
bringing the gas into a superfluid phase at low temperature. In these dilute
systems interactions are characterized by a single parameter, the s-wave
scattering length, whose value can be tuned using an external magnetic field
near a Feshbach resonance. The BCS limit of ordinary Fermi superfluidity, the
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of dimers and the unitary limit of large
scattering length are important regimes exhibited by interacting Fermi gases.
In particular the BEC and the unitary regimes are characterized by a high value
of the superfluid critical temperature, of the order of the Fermi temperature.
Different physical properties are discussed, including the density profiles and
the energy of the ground-state configurations, the momentum distribution, the
fraction of condensed pairs, collective oscillations and pair breaking effects,
the expansion of the gas, the main thermodynamic properties, the behavior in
the presence of optical lattices and the signatures of superfluidity, such as
the existence of quantized vortices, the quenching of the moment of inertia and
the consequences of spin polarization. Various theoretical approaches are
considered, ranging from the mean-field description of the BCS-BEC crossover to
non-perturbative methods based on quantum Monte Carlo techniques. A major goal
of the review is to compare the theoretical predictions with the available
experimental results.

analytical approximations and numerical methods, we find various types of
polarized states, including: patterns of the Thomas-Fermi type; structures with
a pulse-shape in one component inducing a hole in the other components; states
with holes in all three components; and domain walls. A Bogoliubov-de Gennes
analysis reveals that families of these states contain intervals of a weak
oscillatory instability, except for the domain walls, which are always stable.
The development of the instabilities is examined by means of direct numerical
simulations.

components of the eclipsing binary NY Vir as a critical test for the formation
scenarios of subdwarf B stars. We obtained high-resolution time series VLT/UVES
spectra and high-speed multicolour VLT/ULTRACAM photometric observations of NY
Vir, a rapidly pulsating subdwarf B star in a short period eclipsing binary.
Combining the radial velocity curve obtained from the VLT/UVES spectra with the
VLT/ULTRACAM multicolour lightcurves, we determined numerical orbital solutions
for this eclipsing binary. Due to the large number of free parameters and their
strong correlations, no unique solution could be found, only families of
solutions. We present three solutions of equal statistical significance, two of
which are compatible with the primary having gone through a core He-flash and a
common-envelope phase described by the $\alpha$-formalism. These two models
have an sdB primary of 0.466 \msol and 0.389 \msol, respectively. Finally, we
report the detection of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for NY Vir.

be removed by supposing, for example, that the singularities giving rise to

gamma decays in nuclei from excited states to be correlated with electrons from
their subsequent short-lived beta decay. This technique is ideal for studying
nuclei very far from stability and improves in sensitivity for very short-lived
decays and for high decay Q-values. The method has allowed excited states in
78Y to be observed for the first time, as well as an extension in the knowledge
of T=1 states in 74Rb. From this new information it has been possible to
compare Coulomb energy differences (CED) between T=1 states in 70Br/70Se,
74Rb/74Kr, and 78Y/78Sr. The A=70 CED exhibit an anomalous behavior which is
inconsistent with all other known CED. This behavior may be accounted for
qualitatively in terms of small variations in the Coulomb energy arising from
shape changes.
