be approximated by a power-law distribution, dN/dt propto t^-beta, with
-beta=-0.70+/-0.05 or -beta=-0.84+/-0.04, depending on the model used to derive
the ages. Predictions for a cluster population without dissolution limited by a
V-band detection result in a power-law dN/dt distribution with an index of
~-0.7. This is because the limiting cluster mass increases with age, due to
evolutionary fading of clusters, reducing the number of observed clusters at
old ages. When a mass cut well above the limiting cluster mass is applied, the
dN/dt distribution is flat up to 1 Gyr. We conclude that cluster dissolution is
of small importance in shaping the dN/dt distribution and incompleteness causes
dN/dt to decline. The reason that no (mass independent) infant mortality of
star clusters in the first ~10-20 Myr is found is explained by a detection bias
towards clusters without nebular emission, i.e. cluster that have survived the
infant mortality phase. The reason we find no evidence for tidal (mass
dependent) cluster dissolution in the first Gyr is explained by the weak tidal
field of the SMC. Our results are in sharp contrast to the interpretation of
Chandar et al. (2006), who interpret the declining dN/dt distribution as rapid
cluster dissolution. This is due to their erroneous assumption that the sample
is limited by cluster mass, rather than luminosity.

51 intervening (z_{abs} << z_{QSO}) O VI systems comprised of 77 individual
components, and we find 14 ""proximate"" systems (z_{abs} ~ z_{QSO}) containing
34 components. For intervening systems [components] with rest-frame equivalent
width W_{r} > 30 mA, the number of O VI absorbers per unit redshift dN/dz =
15.6(+2.9/-2.4) [21.0(+3.2/-2.8)], and this decreases to dN/dz = 0.9(+1.0/-0.5)
[0.3(+0.7/-0.3)] for W_{r} > 300 mA. The number per redshift increases steeply
as z_{abs} approaches z_{QSO}, and some proximate absorbers have substantially
lower H I/O VI ratios. The lower proximate ratios could be partially due to
ionization effects but also require higher metallicities. We find that 37% of
the intervening O VI absorbers have velocity centroids that are well-aligned
with corresponding H I absorption. If the O VI and the H I trace the same gas,
the relatively small differences in line widths imply the absorbers are cool
with T < 10^{5} K. Most of these well-aligned absorbers have the
characteristics of metal-enriched photoionized gas. However, the O VI in the
apparently simple and cold systems could be associated with a hot phase with T
~ 10^{5.5} K if the metallicity is high enough to cause the associated broad Ly
alpha absorption to be too weak to detect. We show that 53% of the intervening
O VI systems are complex multiphase absorbers that can accommodate both lower
metallicity collisionally-ionized gas with T > 10^{5} K and cold photoionzed
gas.

emission-line objects downstream of a star-forming galaxy ESO 137-001 in the
rich, nearby cluster A3627. The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc
X-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray
tail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and
the sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO
137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with
both an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all
distributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from
the galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of
the background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29
emission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density
and luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously
known examples of isolated HII regions in clusters. We suggest that star
formation may proceed in the stripped ISM, in both the galactic halo and
intracluster space. The total mass of formed stars in the stripped ISM of ESO
137-001 may approach several times 10^7 solar masses. Therefore, stripping of
the ISM not only contributes to the ICM, but also adds to the intracluster
stellar light through subsequent star formation. The data also imply that ESO
137-001 is in an active stage of transformation, accompanied by the build-up of
a central bulge and depletion of the ISM.

medium (ISM) in which supernova ejecta follow a long (10^8 yr) journey before
falling back onto the galactic disk in the form of metal-rich ``droplets'',
These droplets do not become fully mixed with the interstellar medium until
they become photoionized in HII regions. We investigate the hypothesis that the
photoionization of these highly metallic droplets can explain the observed
``abundance discrepancy factors'' (ADFs), which are found when comparing
abundances derived from recombination lines and from collisionally excited
lines, both in Galactic and extragalactic HII regions. We derive bounds of
10^{13}--10^{15} cm on the droplet sizes inside HII regions in order that (1)
they should not have already been detected by direct imaging of nearby nebulae,
and (2) they should not be too swiftly destroyed by diffusion in the ionized
gas. From photoionization modelling we find that, if this inhomogeneous
enrichment scenario holds, then the recombination lines strongly overestimate
the metallicities of the fully mixed HII regions. The abundances derived from
collisionally excited lines also suffer some bias, although to a much lesser
extent. In the absence of any recipe for correcting these biases, we recommend
the discarding of all objects showing large ADFs from studies of galactic
chemical evolution. These biases must also be kept in mind when comparing the
galactic abundance gradients for elements derived from recombination lines with
those derived from collisionally excited lines. Finally, we propose a set of
observations that could be undertaken to test our scenario and improve our
understanding of element mixing in the ISM.

process, and knowledge of the distribution and temperature of inner disk
material is crucial for understanding terrestrial planet formation, giant
planet migration, and accretion onto the central star. While the inner regions
of protoplanetary disks in nearby star forming regions subtend only a few
nano-radians, near-IR interferometry has recently enabled the spatial
resolution of these terrestrial zones. Most observations have probed only dust,
which typically dominates the near-IR emission. Here I report spectrally
dispersed near-IR interferometric observations that probe gas (which dominates
the mass and dynamics of the inner disk), in addition to dust, within one
astronomical unit of the young star MWC 480. I resolve gas, including water
vapor and atomic hydrogen, interior to the edge of the dust disk; this
contrasts with results of previous spectrally dispersed interferometry
observations. Interactions of this accreting gas with migrating planets may
lead to short-period exoplanets like those detected around main-sequence stars.
The observed water vapor is likely produced by the sublimation of migrating icy
bodies, and provides a potential reservoir of water for terrestrial planets.

algorithm that extends the inflationary flow formalism to models with general
speed of sound. For an ensemble of D-brane inflation models parameterized by
the Hubble parameter and the speed of sound as polynomial functions of the

numerical models with analytical warp factors considered in the literature.
Finally, we derive and apply a generalized microphysical bound on the inflaton
field variation during brane inflation. While a large number of models are
consistent with current cosmological constraints, almost all of these models
violate the compactification constraint on the field range in four-dimensional

quasar activity, we demonstrate that this naturally reproduces the observed

LFs, fractions, host galaxy colors, and clustering as a function of redshift

natural prediction of the model, as mergers preferentially occur in regions
with excess small-scale galaxy overdensities. We show that quasar environments
at all observed redshifts correspond closely to the empirically determined
small group scale, where mergers of gas-rich galaxies are most efficient. We
contrast with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars/disk
instabilities, and show that while these modes probably dominate at Seyfert
luminosities, the constraints from clustering (large and small-scale),
pseudobulge populations, disk MFs, luminosity density evolution, and host
galaxy colors argue that they must be a small contributor to the z>1 quasar
luminosity density.

times of spheroids as a function of mass, and the fraction of quenched galaxies

a variety of semi-analytic models in which quenching is primarily driven by
halo mass considerations or secular/disk instabilities, we demonstrate that our

of the color-morphology-density relations at high z, and the fraction of

favor a model in which galaxies quench after a major merger builds a massive
spheroid, and disfavor quenching via secular or pure halo processes. We discuss
a variety of physical possibilities for this quenching, and propose a mixed
scenario in which traditional quenching in hot, massive halos is supplemented
by the feedback associated with star formation and quasar activity in a major

field, we measure the Fermi velocity and then obtain the Fermi energy (as well
as the electron density), which is comparable to that extracted from
photoluminescence for moderate electron densities, assuming a bare band-edge
mass. At large electron densities, the Fermi energies derived from Raman
scattering and photoluminescence differ. For an applied in-plane magnetic field
and zero wave vector transferred to the electron gas, Raman scattering spectra
show peaks at both the Zeeman energy $Z$, resulting from collective excitations
of the spin-polarized electron gas, and the one electron spin-flip energy
$Z^*$. Magneto-photoluminescence spectra show conduction band splitting that
are equivalent to $Z$, suggesting that collective effects are present in the
photoluminescence spectra. Assuming (as before) an uncorrected mass, the degree
of spin polarization $\zeta$ determined from the magneto-photoluminescence
lineshape is found to differ from that derived from the magnetic field
dependent Raman scattering measurements for large electron densities. We
attribute the discrepancy in measuring $\zeta$ and the Fermi energy to the

$\theta^{\mu \nu} = -\theta^{\nu \mu}=$ constant.) When $\theta^{0i} \neq 0$,
it contributes to breaking also ${\bf P}$ and ${\bf CPT}$. It is known that the
$S$-matrix in a non-abelian theory depends on $\theta^{\mu \nu}$ only through
$\theta^{0i}$. The $S$-matrix is frame dependent. It breaks (the identity
component of the) Lorentz group. All the noncommutative effects vanish if the
scattering takes place in the center-of-mass frame, or any frame where
$\theta^{0i}P^{\textrm{in}}_{i} = 0$, but not otherwise. ${\bf P}$ and ${\bf
CPT}$ are good symmetries of the theory in this special case.

  MRI-driven Turbulent Protoplanetary Disks","12 pages in preprint format, 2 figures, accepted ApJ Letters",,"10.1086/520718",,"astro-ph",,"  The first challenge in the formation of both terrestrial planets and the
cores of gas giants is the retention of grains in protoplanetary disks. In most
regions of these disks, gas attains sub-Keplerian speeds as a consequence of a
negative pressure gradient. Hydrodynamic drag leads to orbital decay and
depletion of the solid material in the disk, with characteristic timescales as
short as only a few hundred years for meter-sized objects at 1 AU. In this
paper, we suggest a particle retention mechanism which promotes the
accumulation of grains and the formation of planetesimals near the water
sublimation front or ``snow line.'' This model is based on the assumption that,
in the regions most interesting for planet formation, the viscous evolution of
the disk is due to turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability
(MRI) in the surface layers of the disk. The depth to which MRI effectively
generates turbulence is a strong function of the grain size and abundance. A
sharp increase in the grain-to-gas density ratio across the snow line reduces
the column depth of the active layer. As the disk evolves towards a
quasi-steady-state, this change in the active layer creates a local maximum in
radial distribution of the gas surface density and pressure, causing the gas to
rotate at super-Keplerian speed and halting the inward migration of grains.
This senario presents a robust process for grain retention which may aid in the
formation of proto-gas-giant cores preferentially near the snow line.

thanks to the discovery of their optical and X-ray afterglows. However, some
key aspects are still poorly understood, including the collimation level of the
outflow, the duration of the central engine activity, and the properties of the
progenitor systems. We want to constrain the physical properties of the short
GRB 050724 and of its host galaxy, and make some inferences on the global short
GRB population. We present optical observations of the afterglow of GRB 050724
and of its host galaxy, significantly expanding the existing dataset for this
event. We compare our results with models, complementing them with available
measurements from the literature. We study the afterglow light curve and
spectrum including X-ray data. We also present observations of the host galaxy.
The observed optical emission was likely related to the large flare observed in
the X-ray light curve. The apparent steep decay was therefore not due to the
jet effect. Available data are indeed consistent with low collimation, in turn
implying a large energy release, comparable to that of long GRBs. The flare
properties also constrain the internal shock mechanism, requiring a large
Lorentz factor contrast between the colliding shells. This implies that the
central engine was active at late times, rather than ejecting all shells
simultaneously. The host galaxy has red colors and no ongoing star formation,
consistent with previous findings on this GRB. However, it is not a pure
elliptical, and has some faint spiral structure. GRB 050724 provides the most
compelling case for association between a short burst and a galaxy with old
stellar population. It thus plays a pivotal role in constraining progenitors
models, which should allow for long delays between birth and explosion.

galaxy clusters are highly suppressed. Observed AGN-induced cavities/bubbles
are a leading candidate for suppressing cooling, usually via some form of
mechanical heating. At the same time, observed X-ray cavities and synchrotron
emission point toward a significant non-thermal particle population. Previous
studies have focused on the dynamical effects of cosmic-ray pressure support,
but none have built successful models in which cosmic-ray heating is
significant. Here we investigate a new model of AGN heating, in which the
intracluster medium is efficiently heated by cosmic-rays, which are injected
into the ICM through diffusion or the shredding of the bubbles by
Rayleigh-Taylor or Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. We include thermal
conduction as well. Using numerical simulations, we show that the cooling
catastrophe is efficiently suppressed. The cluster quickly relaxes to a
quasi-equilibrium state with a highly reduced accretion rate and temperature
and density profiles which match observations. Unlike the conduction-only case,
no fine-tuning of the Spitzer conduction suppression factor f is needed. The
cosmic ray pressure, P_c/P_g <~ 0.1 and dP_c/dr <~ 0.1 \rho g, is well within
observational bounds. Cosmic ray heating is a very attractive alternative to
mechanical heating, and may become particularly compelling if GLAST detects the
gamma-ray signature of cosmic-rays in clusters.

naturally in a range that varies between values close to the LEP experimental
limit and about 160 GeV. This mass range may be probed at the Tevatron and at
the LHC. We analyze the KK spectrum and briefly discuss the phenomenology of
the light resonances arising in our model.

bicategorical notions do not work well in these cases, because the `morphisms

resulting `framed bicategories' assemble into 2-categories, with attendant
notions of equivalence, adjunction, and so on which are more appropriate for
our examples than are the usual bicategorical ones.
  We then describe two ways to construct framed bicategories. One is an
analogue of rings and bimodules which starts from one framed bicategory and
builds another. The other starts from a `monoidal fibration', meaning a
parametrized family of monoidal categories, and produces an analogue of the
framed bicategory of spans. Combining the two, we obtain a construction which
includes both enriched and internal categories as special cases.

was made available as an option of water during 10 days to mice living in group

stress exposure they were provided with both vanillin sucrose solution and
water using a free two bottles choice paradigm. In the other experiment,
vanillin sucrose solution were first offered to mice after 8 days of exposure
to social defeat stress. Males familiar with vanillin sucrose solution showed
vanillin sucrose preference while experiencing defeat stress: consumption of
vanillin sucrose solution was about 70% of total liquid consumption. However,
the consumption of vanillin sucrose solution per gram of body weight in mice
imposed to social stress during 20 days was significantly lower than in control
males. In the second experiment, males after 8 days of social defeat stress

high energy complexity in the form of a break or cut-off is not required for

which causes important fluctuations of the membrane potential (Vm). We review
here different methods to characterize this activity and its impact on spike
generation. The simplified, fluctuating point-conductance model of synaptic
activity provides the starting point of a variety of methods for the analysis
of intracellular Vm recordings. In this model, the synaptic excitatory and
inhibitory conductances are described by Gaussian-distributed stochastic
variables, or colored conductance noise. The matching of experimentally
recorded Vm distributions to an invertible theoretical expression derived from
the model allows the extraction of parameters characterizing the synaptic
conductance distributions. This analysis can be complemented by the matching of
experimental Vm power spectral densities (PSDs) to a theoretical template, even
though the unexpected scaling properties of experimental PSDs limit the
precision of this latter approach. Building on this stochastic characterization
of synaptic activity, we also propose methods to qualitatively and
quantitatively evaluate spike-triggered averages of synaptic time-courses
preceding spikes. This analysis points to an essential role for synaptic
conductance variance in determining spike times. The presented methods are
evaluated using controlled conductance injection in cortical neurons in vitro
with the dynamic-clamp technique. We review their applications to the analysis
of in vivo intracellular recordings in cat association cortex, which suggest a
predominant role for inhibition in determining both sub- and supra-threshold
dynamics of cortical neurons embedded in active networks.

Sr3NiRhO6 and Sr3NiPtO6 containing magnetic chains arranged in a triangular
fashion in the basal plane and crystallizing in K4CdCl6-derived rhombohedral
structure. The results establish that both the compounds are magnetically
frustrated, however in different ways. In the case of the Rh compound, the
susceptibility data reveal that there are two magnetic transitions, one in the
range 10 -15 K and the other appearing as a smooth crossover near 45 K, with a
large frequency dependence of ac susceptibility in the range 10 to 40 K; in
addition, the features in C(T) are smeared out at these temperatures. The
magnetic properties are comparable to those of previously known few compounds
with partially disordered antiferromagnetic structure. On the other hand, for
Sr3NiPtO6, there is no evidence for long-range magnetic ordering down to 1.8 K
despite large value of paramagnetic Curie temperature.

Such are, for example : Formal series with variables in a vector space and
coefficients in some other vector space. Derivation of a formal series relative
to another formal series. The Lie algebra of a vector space. Formal actions of
Lie algebras over vector spaces. The basic formal action of a Lie algebra over
itself (as a formal version of the analytic aspect of the infinitesimal
operation law of a Lie groupuscule). More generally, the wreath product of two
Lie algebras is defined, relative to a formal action of the second onto an
arbitrary vector space. Main features are : A description of the triangular
actions of wreath products over product vector spaces, and a Kaloujnine-Krasner
type theorem : In essence, it says that all Lie extensions of a given Lie
algebra by another Lie algebra are, indeed, subalgebras of their wreath

Anti-de-Sitter Universe. Since this space is not globally hyperbolic, the
Cauchy problem is not, {\it a priori}, well-posed. Nevertheless we can prove
that there exists unitary dynamics, but its uniqueness crucially depends on the
ratio beween the mass $M$ of the field and the cosmological constant
$\Lambda>0$ : it appears a critical value, $\Lambda/12$, which plays a role
similar to the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound for the scalar fields. When
$M^2\geq \Lambda/12$ there exists a unique unitary dynamics. In opposite, for
the light fermions satisfying $M^2<\Lambda/12$, we construct several asymptotic
conditions at infinity, such that the problem becomes well-posed. In all the
cases, the spectrum of the hamiltonian is discrete. We also prove a result of
equipartition of the energy.

network (RNN) experts model, which can acquire the ability to generate desired
sequences by dynamically switching between experts. Our method is based on
maximum likelihood estimation, using a gradient descent algorithm. This
approach is similar to that used in conventional methods; however, we modify
the likelihood function by adding a mechanism to alter the variance for each
expert. The proposed method is demonstrated to successfully learn Markov chain
switching among a set of 9 Lissajous curves, for which the conventional method
fails. The learning performance, analyzed in terms of the generalization
capability, of the proposed method is also shown to be superior to that of the
conventional method. With the addition of a gating network, the proposed method
is successfully applied to the learning of sensory-motor flows for a small
humanoid robot as a realistic problem of time series prediction and generation.
