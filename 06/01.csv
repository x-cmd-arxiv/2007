domain wall in a ferromagnetic strip of submicron width under the influence of
an external magnetic field. The model exhibits three distinct dynamical
regimes. In a viscous regime at low fields the wall moves rigidly with a
velocity proportional to the field. Above a critical field the motion becomes
underdamped as the vortex moves periodically across the strip; these
oscillations are accompanied by a slow drift with a decreasing velocity. At
still higher fields the drift velocity starts rising linearly with the field
again but with a much lower mobility dv/dH than in the low-field regime. We
calculate the relevant quantities and compare them to experimentally observed

continuously dissipate energy into their physical surroundings leading to
entropy production and time-reversal symmetry breaking. This letter discusses
these issues in the context of quantum impurity models driven out of
equilibrium by attaching the impurity to leads at different chemical potentials
and temperatures. We start by pointing out that entropy production is often
hidden in traditional treatments of quantum-impurity models. We then use simple
thermodynamic arguments to define the rate of entropy production. Using the
scattering framework recently developed by the authors we show that the rate of
entropy production has a simple information theoretic interpretation in terms
of the Shannon entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence of nonequilibrium
distribution function. This allows us to show that the entropy production is
strictly positive for any nonequilibrium steady-state. We conclude by applying
these ideas to the Resonance Level Model and the Kondo model.

of signal transduction. A remarkable feature of this system is the coexistence
of precise adaptation in population with large fluctuating cellular behavior in
single cells (Korobkova et al. 2004, Nature, 428, 574). Using a stochastic
model, we found that the large behavioral variability experimentally observed
in non-stimulated cells is a direct consequence of the architecture of this
adaptive system. Reversible covalent modification cycles, in which methylation
and demethylation reactions antagonistically regulate the activity of
receptor-kinase complexes, operate outside the region of first-order kinetics.
As a result, the receptor-kinase that governs cellular behavior exhibits a
sigmoidal activation curve. This curve simultaneously amplifies the inherent
stochastic fluctuations in the system and lengthens the relaxation time in
response to stimulus. Because stochastic fluctuations cause large behavioral
variability and the relaxation time governs the average duration of runs in
response to small stimuli, cells with the greatest fluctuating behavior also
display the largest chemotactic response. Finally, Large-scale simulations of
digital bacteria suggest that the chemotaxis network is tuned to simultaneously
optimize the random spread of cells in absence of nutrients and the cellular
response to gradients of attractant.

flow. Nevertheless, a bulk analysis suggests that certain such flows lead to
local CFTs in the infra-red. Since the flows are non-local, they can either
increase or decrease the central charge of the CFT. In fact, given any local
renormalization-group flow within a certain general class which leads from a UV

non-local flow in which the endpoints are interchanged: the non-local theory
flows from CFT_2 in the IR to CFT_1 in the UV. We work at large N, but the

region between white dwarf formation and core collapse. This includes the
super-asymptotic giant branch (super-AGB, SAGB) stars, which have massive
enough cores to ignite carbon burning and form an oxygen-neon (ONe) core. The
most massive SAGB stars have cores that may grow to the Chandrasekhar mass
because of continued shell-burning. Their cores collapse, triggering a so
called electron capture supernovae (ECSN). From stellar evolution models we
find that the initial mass range for SAGB evolution is 7.5 ... 9.25\msun. We
perform calculations with three different stellar evolution codes to
investigate the sensitivity of this mass range to some of the uncertainties in
current stellar models. The mass range significantly depends on the treatment
of semiconvective mixing and convective overshooting. To consider the effect of
a large number of thermal pulses, as expected in SAGB stars, we construct
synthetic SAGB models that include a semi-analytical treatment of dredge-up,
hot-bottom burning, and thermal pulse properties. This synthetic model enables
us to compute the evolution of the main properties of SAGB stars from the onset
of thermal pulses until the core reaches the Chandrasekhar mass or is uncovered
by the stellar wind. Thereby, we determine the stellar initial mass ranges that
produce ONe-white dwarfs and electron-capture supernovae. The latter is found
to be 9.0 ... 9.25\msun for our fiducial model, implying that electron-capture
supernovae would constitute about 4% of all supernovae in the local universe.
Our synthetic approach allows us to explore the uncertainty of this number
imposed by uncertainties in the third dredge-up efficiency and ABG mass loss
rate. We find for ECSNe a upper limit of ~20% of all supernovae (abridged).

low energies can be described by fields satisfying equations of motion formally
indistinguishable from those of relativistic field theory. The finite speed of
propagation of the disturbances in the effective fields (in the simplest
models, the speed of sound) plays here the role of the speed of light in
fundamental physics. However, these apparently relativistic fields are immersed
in an external Newtonian world (the condensed matter system itself and the
laboratory can be considered Newtonian, since all the velocities involved are
much smaller than the velocity of light) which provides a privileged coordinate
system and therefore seems to destroy the possibility of having a perfectly
defined relativistic emergent world. In this essay we ask ourselves the
following question: In a homogeneous condensed matter medium, is there a way
for internal observers, dealing exclusively with the low-energy collective
phenomena, to detect their state of uniform motion with respect to the medium?
By proposing a thought experiment based on the construction of a
Michelson-Morley interferometer made of quasi-particles, we show that a real
Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction takes place, so that internal observers are
unable to find out anything about their `absolute ' state of motion. Therefore,
we also show that an effective but perfectly defined relativistic world can
emerge in a fishbowl world situated inside a Newtonian (laboratory) system.
This leads us to reflect on the various levels of description in physics, in
particular regarding the quest towards a theory of quantum gravity.

Cooling of the dipolar reservoir occurs during polarization transport through
the magnetic field gradient around the paramagnetic impurity, and is rapidly
communicated to the bulk by dipolar spin diffusion. As dipolar spin diffusion

cools faster than the Zeeman reservoir. This process can be exploited to

to the robustness and evolvability of biological networks is believed to be
their modularity of function, with modules defined as sets of genes that are
strongly interconnected but whose function is separable from those of other
modules. Here, we investigate the in silico evolution of modularity and
robustness in complex artificial metabolic networks that encode an increasing
amount of information about their environment while acquiring ubiquitous
features of biological, social, and engineering networks, such as scale-free
edge distribution, small-world property, and fault-tolerance. These networks
evolve in environments that differ in their predictability, and allow us to
study modularity from topological, information-theoretic, and gene-epistatic
points of view using new tools that do not depend on any preconceived notion of
modularity. We find that for our evolved complex networks as well as for the
yeast protein-protein interaction network, synthetic lethal pairs consist
mostly of redundant genes that lie close to each other and therefore within
modules, while knockdown suppressor pairs are farther apart and often straddle
modules, suggesting that knockdown rescue is mediated by alternative pathways
or modules. The combination of network modularity tools together with genetic
interaction data constitutes a powerful approach to study and dissect the role
of modularity in the evolution and function of biological networks.

First, the curve and surface theory, as the geometric representation of the

method. The elastic theory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, bending-soften rod,
fluid membrane, and solid shell is revisited. Secondly, the application and
availability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in
bio-structures, including short DNA rings, lipid membranes, and cell membranes,
are discussed. The kink stability of short DNA rings is addressed by using the
theory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, and bending-soften rod. The lipid
membranes obey the theory of fluid membrane. A cell membrane is simplified as a
composite shell of lipid bilayer and membrane skeleton, which is a little
similar to the solid shell. It is found that the membrane skeleton enhances
highly the mechanical stability of cell membranes. Thirdly, the application and
availability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in
nano-structures, including graphene and carbon nanotubes, are discussed. A
revised Lenosky lattice model is proposed based on the local density
approximation. Its continuum form up to the second order terms of curvatures
and strains is the same as the free energy of 2D solid shells. Several typical
mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are revisited and investigated based
on this continuum form. It is possible to avoid introducing the controversial

centrally-concentrated bursts of star formation and warm dust temperatures. At
z~0.7, the bulk of intensely star-forming galaxies are relatively undisturbed

oblateness of the stellar halo 0.5<c/a<0.8, and halo stellar masses between
Galactocentric radii of 1 and 40kpc of (3.7+/-1.2)x10^8 M_sun. The density
profile of the stellar halo is approximately r^{-3}; it is possible that the
power law slope is shallower inside 20kpc and steeper outside that radius. Yet,
we found that all smooth and symmetric models were very poor fits to the
distribution of stellar halo stars because the data exhibit a great deal of
spatial substructure. We quantified deviations from a smooth oblate/triaxial
model using the RMS of the data around the model profile on scales >~100pc,
after accounting for the (known) contribution of Poisson uncertainties. The
fractional RMS deviation of the actual stellar distribution from any smooth,
parameterized halo model is >~40%: hence, the stellar halo is highly
structured. We compared the observations with simulations of galactic stellar
halos formed entirely from the accretion of satellites in a cosmological
context by analysing the simulations in the same way as the data. While the
masses, overall profiles, and degree of substructure in the simulated stellar
halos show considerable scatter, the properties and degree of substructure in

density gas disks in their circumnuclear (CN) region (0.1 to a few kpc). Yet,
ellipticals, especially luminous ones, show little signs of recent star
formation (SF). To investigate the possible cause of the dearth of SF in these
systems, we study the gravitational stability of CN gas disks embedded within
the potentials of both the stellar bulge and the central massive black hole
(BH) in ellipticals. We find that CN disks in higher mass galaxies are
generally more stable than those in lower mass galaxies, because higher mass
galaxies tend to have more massive BHs and more centrally concentrated stellar
density profiles. We also consider the case in which the central stellar
density profile has a core, which is often observed for ellipticals whose total
stellar mass is higher than about 10^11 Msun. Such a cored stellar density
profile leads to more unstable CN disks than the power-law density profile
characteristic of less massive galaxies. However, the more massive BHs in
high-mass galaxies act to stabilize the CN disk. Our results demonstrate that
the gravitational potentials of both the central BH and the stellar component
should be taken into account when studying the properties of CN disks, as their
stability is sensitive to both the BH mass and the stellar density profile. Our
results could explain the observed trend that less luminous ellipticals have a
greater tendency to exhibit ongoing SF than giant ellipticals.

Hubble time. Expressing the phase-space density by the NFW parameters, Q(r)=Qs
(r/Rs)^{-beta}, the evolution of Q is determined by Qs. We have found that the
effective mass surface density within Rs, Sigma_s = rhos Rs, remains constant
throughout the evolution of a given DM halo along the main branch of its
merging tree. This invariance entails that Qs ~ Rs^{-5/2} and Q(r) ~
Sigma_s^{-1/2} Rs^{-5/2} (r/ Rs)^{-beta}. It follows that the phase-space
density remains constant, in the sense of Qs=const., in the quiescent phases
and it decreases as Rs^{-5/2} in the violent ones. The physical origin of the
NFW density profile and the phase-space density power law is still unknown.
Yet, the numerical experiments show that halos recover these relations after
the violent phases. The major mergers drive Rs to increase and Qs to decrease
discontinuously while keeping Qs Rs^{5/2} = const. The virial equilibrium in
the quiescent phases implies that a DM halos evolves along a sequence of NFW
profiles with constant energy per unit volume (i.e., pressure) within Rs.

Theorem and the rational reconstruction to recover the rational determinant
from its modular images. Then we show a preconditioning for the determinant
which allows us to skip the rational reconstruction process and reconstruct an
integer result. We compare those approaches with matrix preconditioning which
allow us to treat integer instead of rational matrices. This allows us to
introduce integer determinant algorithms to the rational determinant problem.
In particular, we discuss the applicability of the adaptive determinant
algorithm of [9] and compare it with the integer Chinese Remaindering scheme.
We present an analysis of the complexity of the strategies and evaluate their
experimental performance on numerous examples. This experience allows us to
develop an adaptive strategy which would choose the best solution at the run
time, depending on matrix properties. All strategies have been implemented in

appear to have old stellar populations and luminosities of only $M_V \sim -1$
mag. Their observed sizes of $\sim 3$ pc are well within the expected tidal
limit of $\sim$10 pc at that distance. Together with Palomar 1, AM 4 and
Whiting 1, these new clusters are the lowest luminosity globulars orbiting the

similar result on Omega_m and detect the effects of dark energy on the

non-flat LCDM model. The detection of dark energy is comparable in significance
to recent SNIa studies and represents strong, independent evidence for cosmic
acceleration. Systematic scatter remains undetected in the fgas data, despite a
weighted mean statistical scatter in the distance measurements of only ~5%. For
a flat cosmology with constant w, we measure Omega_m=0.28+-0.06 and
w=-1.14+-0.31. Combining the fgas data with independent constraints from CMB

tighter constraints: Omega_m=0.253+-0.021 and w=-0.98+-0.07 for the same
constant-w model. More general analyses in which we relax the assumption of
flatness and/or allow evolution in w remain consistent with the cosmological

uncertainties. The small systematic scatter and tight constraints bode well for
future dark energy studies using the fgas method. (Abridged)

desirable features both at the level of the lattice calculations as well as in
the construction and implementation of the low energy mixed action effective
field theory. In this work we show that when such a mixed action effective
field theory is projected onto the valence sector, both the Lagrangian and the
extrapolation formulae become universal in form through next to leading order,
for all variants of discretization methods used for the sea fermions. Our
conclusion relies on the chiral nature of the valence quarks. The result
implies that for all sea quark methods which are in the same universality class
as QCD, the numerical values of the physical coefficients in the various mixed
action chiral Lagrangians will be the same up to lattice spacing dependent
corrections. This allows us to construct a prescription to determine the mixed
action extrapolation formulae for a large class of hadronic correlation
functions computed in partially quenched chiral perturbation theory at the
one-loop level. For specific examples, we apply this prescription to the
nucleon twist--2 matrix elements and the nucleon--nucleon system. In addition,
we determine the mixed action extrapolation formula for the neutron EDM as this
provides a nice example of a theta-dependent observable; these observables are

exact background (the two dimensional black hole) and string theory in flat
space with a tachyon-like potential. We generalize previous results in this
subject by discussing a twisted version of the
Fateev-Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov conjecture. This duality is shown to hold at
the level of N-point correlation functions on the sphere topology, and connects
tree-level string amplitudes in the Euclidean version of the 2D black hole (x
time) to correlation functions in a non-linear sigma-model in flat space but in
presence of a tachyon wall potential and a linear dilaton. The dual CFT
corresponds to the perturbed 2D quantum gravity coupled to c<1 matter (x time),
where the operator that describes the tachyon-like potential can be seen as a
n=2 momentum mode perturbation, while the usual sine-Liouville operator would
correspond to the vortex sector n =1. We show how the sine-Liouville
interaction term arises through a twisting of the marginal deformation
introduced here, and discuss such 'twisting' as a non-trivial realization of
the symmetries of the theory. After briefly reviewing the computation of
correlation functions in sine-Liouville CFT, we give a precise prescription for
computing correlation functions in the twisted model. To show the new version
of the correspondence we make use of a formula recently proven by S. Ribault
and J. Teschner, which connects the correlation functions in the
Wess-Zumino-Witten theory to correlation functions in the Liouville theory.
Conversely, the duality discussed here can be thought of as a free field
realization of such remarkable formula.

clusters with parametric methods, and to rank models quantitatively using the
Bayesian evidence. We use a publicly available Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC)
sampler ('Bayesys'), allowing us to avoid local minima in the likelihood
functions. To illustrate the power of the MCMC technique, we simulate three
clusters of galaxies, each composed of a cluster-scale halo and a set of
perturbing galaxy-scale subhalos. We ray-trace three light beams through each
model to produce a catalogue of multiple images, and then use the MCMC sampler
to recover the model parameters in the three different lensing configurations.
We find that, for typical Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-quality imaging data,
the total mass in the Einstein radius is recovered with ~1-5% error according
to the considered lensing configuration. However, we find that the mass of the
galaxies is strongly degenerated with the cluster mass when no multiple images
appear in the cluster centre. The mass of the galaxies is generally recovered
with a 20% error, largely due to the poorly constrained cut-off radius.
Finally, we describe how to rank models quantitatively using the Bayesian
evidence. We confirm the ability of strong lensing to constrain the mass
profile in the central region of galaxy clusters in this way. Ultimately, such
a method applied to strong lensing clusters with a very large number of
multiple images may provide unique geometrical constraints on cosmology. The
implementation of the MCMC sampler used in this paper has been done within the
framework of the Lenstool software package, which is publicly available.

Two crucial references added","Chin.Phys.C32:96-99,2008","10.1088/1674-1137/32/2/004",,"hep-ph",,"  The observation of neutrino oscillations requires new physics beyond the
standard model (SM). A SM-like gauge theory with p lepton families can be
extended by introducing q heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos but preserving
its SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y gauge symmetry. The overall neutrino mass matrix M turns
out to be a symmetric (p+q) x (p+q) matrix. Given p>q, the rank of M is in
general equal to 2q, corresponding to 2q non-zero mass eigenvalues. The
existence of (p-q) massless left-handed Majorana neutrinos is an exact
consequence of the model, independent of the usual approximation made in
deriving the Type-I seesaw relation between the effective p x p light Majorana
neutrino mass matrix M_\nu and the q x q heavy Majorana neutrino mass matrix
M_R. In other words, the numbers of massive left- and right-handed neutrinos
are fairly matched. A good example to illustrate this seesaw fair play rule is
the minimal seesaw model with p=3 and q=2, in which one massless neutrino sits
on the unbalanced seesaw.

over the cloud (the so-called cold front). We argue that near the stagnation
point of the flow conduction creates a spatially extended layer of constant
thickness $\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is of order $\sim\sqrt{kR/U}$, and $R$ is
the curvature radius of the cloud, $U$ is the velocity of the flow at infinity,
and $k$ is the conductivity of the gas. For typical parameters of the observed
fronts, one finds $\Delta \ll R$. The formation time of such a layer is $\sim
R/U$. Once the layer is formed, its thickness only slowly varies with time and
the quasi-steady layer may persist for many characteristic time scales. Based
on these simple arguments one can use the observed width of the cold fronts in
galaxy clusters to constrain the effective thermal conductivity of the
intra-cluster medium.

responsible for an additional scattering term in the resistivity, which can be
suppressed by a magnetic field. Above $T_C$ these regions prevent the process
of percolation of magnetic polarons (MPs), acting as ""spacers"" between MPs. We

to understand the origin and evolution of tidal dwarf galaxies and their
correspondence with local objects, the first step is to understand how these
galaxies (which are supposed to have a limited amount of dark matter) react to
the feedback of the ongoing star formation. Methods: We make use of 2-D
chemodynamical calculations in order to study the early evolution of isolated,
dark matter-free dwarf galaxies. We present models in which feedback parameters
are varied. We also compare the results with dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxy
models. Results: All the considered models show that the star formation
proceeds for more than 300 Myr, therefore dwarf galaxies without large dark
matter halos are not necessarily quickly destroyed. The chemical evolution of
these objects is consistent with the main chemical properties of the dSphs of
the Local Group. Models with large dark matter halos show results consistent
with models free of dark matter, indicating that the distribution of gas is
more important than the depth of the potential well in determining the global
behaviour of dSph-sized dwarf galaxies.

radial velocity trend suggesting a massive planet in large orbit. The survey
was carried out in the L-band using adaptive optics assisted imaging with
NAOS-CONICA (NACO) at the VLT. The chosen observation wavelength is well suited
to search for close companions around young stars and delivers unprecedented
detection limits. The presented technique reaches some of the best
sensitivities as of today and is currently the most sensitive method for the
contrast limited detection of substellar companions that are cooler than about
1000K. The companion to 51 Eri, GJ 3305, was found to be a very close binary on
an eccentric orbit. No substellar companions were found around the target
stars, although the method permitted to detect companions down to a few Jupiter
masses at orbital distances of typically 5 astronomical units. A planet with a
mass >1 M_Jup at distances >5 AU around AU Mic can be excluded at the time of
our observations. The absence of detected planets sets constraints on the
frequency distribution and maximum orbital distance of giant exoplanets. For
example, a radial distribution power law index of 0.2 in combination with a
maximum orbital radius exceeding 30 AU can be rejected at a 90% confidence
level.

calculus. That sort of reduction permits unlimited reusage of the computational
resource represented by the antecedent. An at least equally basic and natural
sort of algorithmic reduction, however, is the one that does not allow such
reusage. The present article shows that turning the logic of the first sort of
reduction into the logic of the second sort of reduction takes nothing more
than just deleting the contraction rule from its Gentzen-style axiomatization.
The first (Turing) sort of interactive reduction is also shown to come in three
natural versions. While those three versions are very different from each
other, their logical behaviors (in isolation) turn out to be indistinguishable,
with that common behavior being precisely captured by implicative
intuitionistic logic. Among the other contributions of the present article is

presence of Zeeman spin splittings and a spatially inhomogeneous Rashba
interaction. The Zeeman interaction is extended along the wire and produces
gaps in the energy spectrum which allow electron propagation only for spinors
lying along a certain direction. For spins in the opposite direction the waves
are evanescent far away from the Rashba region, which plays the role of the
scattering center. The most interesting case occurs when the magnetic field is
perpendicular to the Rashba field. Then, the spins of the asymptotic
wavefunctions are not eigenfunctions of the Rashba Hamiltonian and the
resulting coupling between spins in the Rashba region gives rise to sudden
changes of the transmission probability when the Fermi energy is swept along
the gap. After briefly examining the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of a
wire with extended Rashba coupling, we analyze the transmission through a
region of localized Rashba interaction, in which a double interface separates a
region of constant Rashba interaction from wire leads free from spin-orbit
coupling. For energies slightly above the propagation threshold, we find the
ubiquitous occurrence of transmission zeros (antiresonances) which are analyzed
by matching methods in the one-dimensional limit. We find that a a minimal
tight-binding model yields analytical transmission lineshapes of Fano
antiresonance type. More general angular dependences of the external magnetic
field is treated within projected Schroedinger equations with Hamiltonian
matrix elements mixing wavefunction components. Finally, we consider a
realistic quantum wire where the energy subbands are coupled via the Rashba
intersubband coupling term and discuss its effect on the transmission zeros.

approach the last stable orbit for a system, various re-summation methods have
been used to improve the standard post-Newtonian waveforms. In this work we
present a new family of templates for the detection of gravitational waves from
the inspiral of two comparable-mass black hole binaries. These new adiabatic
templates are based on re-expressing the derivative of the binding energy and
the gravitational wave flux functions in terms of shifted Chebyshev
polynomials. The Chebyshev polynomials are a useful tool in numerical methods
as they display the fastest convergence of any of the orthogonal polynomials.
In this case they are also particularly useful as they eliminate one of the
features that plagues the post-Newtonian expansion. The Chebyshev binding
energy now has information at all post-Newtonian orders, compared to the
post-Newtonian templates which only have information at full integer orders. In
this work, we compare both the post-Newtonian and Chebyshev templates against a
fiducially exact waveform. This waveform is constructed from a hybrid method of
using the test-mass results combined with the mass dependent parts of the
post-Newtonian expansions for the binding energy and flux functions. Our
results show that the Chebyshev templates achieve extremely high fitting
factors at all PN orders and provide excellent parameter extraction. We also
show that this new template family has a faster Cauchy convergence, gives a
better prediction of the position of the Last Stable Orbit and in general
recovers higher Signal-to-Noise ratios than the post-Newtonian templates.

  Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/522917",,"astro-ph",,"  A large-scale closed magnetic field can transfer angular momentum and energy
between a black hole (BH) and its surrounding accretion flow. We investigate
the effects of this magnetic coupling (MC) process on the dynamics of a hot
accretion flow (e.g., an advection dominated accretion flow, hereafter ADAF).
The energy and angular momentum fluxes transported by the magnetic field are
derived by an equivalent circuit approach. For a rapidly rotating BH, it is
found that the radial velocity and the electron temperature of the accretion
flow decrease, whereas the ion temperature and the surface density increase.
The significance of the MC effects depends on the value of the viscous
parameter \alpha. The effects are obvious for \alpha=0.3 but nearly ignorable
for \alpha=0.1. For a BH with specific angular momentum, a_*=0.9, and
\alpha=0.3, we find that for reasonable parameters the radiative efficiency of
a hot accretion flow can be increased by about 30%.

that in the regime of the ultralow temperatures $2\pi k_BT\lesssim\Delta$
($\Delta $ being the mean level spacing), the electron interaction strongly
affects the conductance oscillations and their statistics leading to a drastic
deviation from the corresponding predictions for noninteracting electrons. In
particular, it causes smearing of conductance oscillations, which is similar to
the effect of temperature or inelastic scattering. For $2\pi k_BT\gtrsim\Delta$
the influence of electron interaction on the conductance becomes strongly
diminished. Our calculations (that are free from phenomenological parameters of
the theory) are in good quantitative agreement with the observed ultralow
temperature statistics (Huibers \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{81},
1917 (1998)). Our findings question a conventional interpretation of the
ultralow temperature saturation of the coherence time in open dots which is
based on the noninteracting theories where the electron interaction is
neglected and the agrement with the experiment is achieved by introducing
additional phenomenological channels of dephasing.

a new set of lensing observables for the two images involving these

paper a broad band spectral analysis of the complete EPIC-pn data sets. We were
able to test two different models for the soft excess, a relativistically
blurred photoionized reflection (\r model) and a relativistically smeared
ionized absorption (\a model). The continuum is modeled by a simple cut-off
power law and we also add a neutral reflection. These observations reveal the
extreme and puzzling spectral and temporal behaviors of the soft excess and
iron line. The 0.5-3 keV soft X-ray flux decreases by a factor 3 between 2001

components. We succeed in describing this complex broad-band 0.5-10 keV
spectral variability using either \r or \a to fit the soft excess. Both models
give statistically equivalent results even including simultaneous BeppoSAX data
up to 200 keV. Both models are consistent with the presence of remote
reflection characterized by a constant narrow component in the data. However
they differ in the presence of a broad line component present in \r but not
needed in \a. This study also reveals the sporadic presence of relativistically
redshifted narrow iron lines.

for flows with high density gradients. In a previous paper (Greenshields &

structure of shock waves in argon in the range Mach 1.0-12.0 (while
conventional Navier-Stokes equations are known to fail above about Mach 2).
However, some areas of concern with this model were a somewhat arbitrary choice
of modelling coefficient, and potentially unphysical and unstable solutions. In
this paper, we therefore present slightly different modifications to include
molecule mass diffusion fully in the Navier-Stokes equations. These
modifications are shown to be stable and produce physical solutions to the
shock problem of a quality broadly similar to those from the family of extended
hydrodynamic models that includes the Burnett equations. The modifications
primarily add a diffusion term to the mass conservation equation, so are at
least as simple to solve as the Navier-Stokes equations; there are none of the
numerical implementation problems of conventional extended hydrodynamics
models, particularly in respect of boundary conditions. We recommend further
investigation and testing on a number of different benchmark non-equilibrium

spin-dependent and strongly sensitive to the relative angle between exchange

presents a complete spin-polarization in a wide range of bias voltages, even in

spin-dependent, though quite sensitive to inelastic collisions. By tunnel
coupling the normal region to an additional superconducting electrode we show
that it is possible to implement a spin-polarized current source of both spin

Our analysis suggests that the dynamical evolution of a quantum entity

change provoked by a measurement often referred to as collapse, but a limiting
case, with only one way to collapse. The biological transition to coded
replication is seen as a means of preserving structure in the fact of
context-driven change, and sextual replication as a means of increasing
potentiality thus enhancing diversity through interaction with context. The

with the above two models, where the postsynaptic potentials decay
exponentially and can be forgotten only after triggering. The finiteness of
memory in the binding neuron allows one to construct fast recurrent networks

characterized in terms of interspike interval probability density distribution
if the binding neuron has threshold 2. For higher thresholds, the distribution
is calculated numerically. The distributions are compared with those found for
binding neuron without feedback, and for leaky integrator. Sample distributions

between hemispheric Hubble diagrams with the equatorial frame seems to point
toward a systematic error in the SN search, observation, analysis or data
reduction. We also find that our model independent test cannot exclude the case

to make use of the Kullback-Leibler distance to estimate the information

also show how to use this distance to measure the stability of filtering
procedures with respect to statistical uncertainty. We explain the
effectiveness of our method by comparing four filtering procedures, two of them

We compare these techniques as applied both to simulations of factor models and
empirical data. We investigate the ability of these filtering procedures in
recovering the correlation matrix of models from simulations. We discuss such
an ability in terms of both the heterogeneity of model parameters and the
length of data series. We also show that the two spectral techniques are

indehiscent with highly sclerified pod walls. In contrast, persistent pods
collected in Uruguay after a wet winter and spring (2002) were partially
dehiscent, inducing the deterioration of the woody pods, and consequently
exposing the seeds. These persistent pods are a natural refuge for insect
species, namely two bruchid beetles (Pseudopachymeria spinipes, Stator
furcatus), one scolytidae (Dendroctonus sp), lepidopterous larvae, ant colonies
(Camponotus sp),one species of oophagous parasitoid (Uscana espinae group

of M. dorsiplana is frequently formed by 1 son +7 daughters.

on a subset $\omega\subset \Omega$ decays exponentially in time as soon as
$\omega$ satisfies a geometrical condition known as the ""Bardos-Lebeau-Rauch""
condition. The rate $\tau(\omega)$ of this decay satisfies $\tau(\omega)= 2
\min(-\mu(\omega), g(\omega))$ (see Lebeau [Math. Phys. Stud. 19 (1996)
73-109]). Here $\mu(\omega)$ denotes the spectral abscissa of the damped wave
equation operator and $g(\omega)$ is a number called the geometrical quantity
of $\omega$ and defined as follows. A ray in $\Omega$ is the trajectory
generated by the free motion of a mass-point in $\Omega$ subject to elastic
reflections on the boundary. These reflections obey the law of geometrical
optics. The geometrical quantity $g(\omega)$ is then defined as the upper limit
(large time asymptotics) of the average trajectory length. We give here an
algorithm to compute explicitly $g(\omega)$ when $\omega$ is a finite union of
squares.

Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) with realistic parameter values are investigated
using a system of cosmological evolution equations which allows for an
unrestricted energy exchange between the vacuum and the matter sector. It is
demonstrated that the scale dependence of the gravitational parameters, the
cosmological constant in particular, leads to an entropy production in the
matter system. The picture emerges that the Universe started out from a state
of vanishing entropy, and that the radiation entropy observed today is
essentially due to the coarse graining (RG flow) in the quantum gravity sector
which is related to the expansion of the Universe. Furthermore, the RG improved
field equations are shown to possess solutions with an epoch of power law
inflation immediately after the initial singularity. The inflation is driven by
the cosmological constant and ends automatically once the RG running has
reduced the vacuum energy to the level of the matter energy density.

dependent oscillations in the local density of states around the position of
the bump. The corrections are estimated to be of a few percent of the flat

the morphology with the electronics. We discuss the connection of the present

Nevertheless nowadays there has been an increment in the number of electron

mechanisms of information processing and transmission, opening ample fields of
opportunities in the theoretical developed of new models. In this spirit we
have calculated the resonant tunneling characteristics curves in double-barrier

means of the diagrammatic techniques for non equilibrium processes following

take into account the production in oscillations as well as in direct decays

the Universe as a function of the mixing and the reheating parameters. It is
shown that sterile neutrinos with non-negligible mixing angles do not
necessarily lead to $N_\nu\sim 4$ and that sterile neutrinos may have the right
relic density to explain the dark matter of the Universe. If dark matter
consists of sterile neutrinos produced in oscillations, X-rays measurements set
a strong limit on the reheating temperature, $\tr\gtrsim 7\mev$. We also point
out that the direct decay opens up a new production mechanism for sterile
neutrino dark matter where cosmological constraints can be satisfied.

inflationary era. We solve, in the continuum limit, the second order difference
equation governing the quantum evolution in loop quantun cosmology, assuming
both a fixed and a dynamically varying lattice in a suitable refinement model.
We thus impose a constraint on the potential of a scalar field, so that the
continuum approximation is not broken. Considering that such a scalar field
could play the role of the inflaton, we obtain a second constraint on the
inflationary potential so that there is consistency with the CMB data on large
angular scales. For a $m^2\phi^2/2$ inflationary model, we combine the two
constraints on the inflaton potential to impose an upper limit on $m$, which is
severely fine-tuned in the case of a fixed lattice. We thus conclude that
lattice refinement is necessary to achieve a natural inflationary model.

to determine the non-resonant part of the reaction amplitude reliably. The
model amplitude is then used to predict observables for photon energies below 3
