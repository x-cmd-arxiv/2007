post-Newtonian (PN) waveforms. We focus on one of the PN approximants that has
been proposed for use in gravitational-wave data analysis, the restricted 3.5PN
``TaylorT1'' waveforms, and compare these with a section of the numerical
waveform from the second to the eighth orbit, which is about one and a half
orbits before merger. This corresponds to a gravitational-wave frequency range
of $M\omega = 0.0455$ to 0.1. Depending on the method of matching PN and NR
waveforms, the accumulated phase disagreement over this frequency range can be
within numerical uncertainty. Similar results are found in comparisons with an
alternative PN approximant, 3PN ``TaylorT3''. The amplitude disagreement, on
the other hand, is around 6%, but roughly constant for all 13 cycles that are
compared, suggesting that only 4.5 orbits need be simulated to match PN and NR
waves with the same accuracy as is possible with nine orbits. If, however, we
model the amplitude up to 2.5PN order, the amplitude disagreement is roughly
within numerical uncertainty up to about 11 cycles before merger.

the solidity of glass-forming liquids. Paper IV proposed a model where the
density field is described by a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation of the
nonconserved type with rates in $k$ space of the form $\Gamma_0+Dk^2$. The
model assumes that $D\gg\Gamma_0a^2$ where $a$ is the average intermolecular
distance; this inequality expresses a long-wavelength dominance of the dynamics
which implies that the Hamiltonian (free energy) to a good approximation may be
taken to be ultralocal. In the present paper we argue that this is the simplest
model consistent with the following three experimental facts: 1) Viscous
liquids approaching the glass transition do not develop long-range order; 2)
The glass has lower compressibility than the liquid; 3) The alpha process
involves several decades of relaxation times shorter than the mean relaxation
time. The paper proceeds to list six further experimental facts characterizing
equilibrium viscous liquid dynamics and shows that these are readily understood
in terms of the model; some are direct consequences, others are quite natural
when viewed in light of the model.

154 minutes effective on-time (EOT) on September 24 between 20h58 and 23h41

based on phase-mismatched second-harmonic generation (\textit{i.e.}, the
cascaded quadratic nonlinearity) in bulk quadratic nonlinear media. The
single-cycle propagation equations in the temporal domain including
higher-order nonlinear terms are presented. The balance between the quadratic
(SHG) and the cubic (Kerr) nonlinearity plays a crucial role: we define an
effective soliton number -- related to the difference between the SHG and the
Kerr soliton numbers -- and show that it has to be larger than unity for
successful pulse compression to take place. This requires that the phase
mismatch be below a critical level, which is high in a material where the
quadratic nonlinearity dominates over the cubic Kerr nonlinearity. Through
extensive numerical simulations we find dimensionless scaling laws, expressed
through the effective soliton number, which control the behaviour of the
compressed pulses. These laws hold in the stationary regime, in which
group-velocity mismatch effects are small, and they are similar to the ones
observed for fiber soliton compressors. The numerical simulations indicate that
clean compressed pulses below two optical cycles can be achieved in a
$\beta$-barium borate crystal at appropriate wavelengths, even for picosecond
input pulses.

raising the question of whether the two objects can be distinguished at all.
Leaving aside the debate about the processes that would lead to the formation
of a gravastar and the astronomical evidence in their support, we here address
two basic questions: Is a gravastar stable against generic perturbations? If
stable, can an observer distinguish it from a black hole of the same mass? To
answer these questions we construct a general class of gravastars and determine
the conditions they must satisfy in order to exist as equilibrium solutions of
the Einstein equations. For such models we perform a systematic stability
analysis against axial-perturbations, computing the real and imaginary parts of
the eigenfrequencies. Overall, we find that gravastars are stable to axial
perturbations, but also that their quasi-normal modes differ from those of a
black hole of the same mass and thus can be used to discern, beyond dispute, a
gravastar from a black hole.

in studying the thermodynamics of a sphere of given radius embedded in a frozen

surface of the free sphere. The pinning field forces the sphere to stay in the
metastable phase as long as its size is smaller than the critical nucleus. We
test our method in two first-order systems, both on a two-dimensional lattice:
a system where the parameter tuning the transition is the magnetic field, and a
second system where the tuning parameter is the temperature. In both cases the
results are satisfying. Unlike previous techniques, our method does not require
an infinite volume limit to compute the surface tension, and it therefore gives
reliable estimates even by using relatively small systems. However, our method
cannot be used at, or close to, the critical point, i.e. at coexistence, where
the critical nucleus becomes infinitely large.

the origin of the IMF, we investigated the internal and relative motions of

continuum at 1.2mm in the L1688 protocluster of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud
complex. The starless condensations have a mass spectrum resembling the IMF and
are therefore likely representative of the initial stages of star formation in
the protocluster. We carried out detailed molecular line observations,
including some N2H+(1-0) mapping, of the Ophiuchus protocluster condensations
using the IRAM 30m telescope. We measured subsonic or at most transonic levels
of internal turbulence within the condensations, implying virial masses which
generally agree within a factor of ~ 2 with the masses derived from the 1.2mm
dust continuum. This supports the notion that most of the L1688 starless
condensations are gravitationally bound and prestellar in nature. We measured a
global one-dimensional velocity dispersion of less than 0.4 km/s between
condensations. This small relative velocity dispersion implies that, in
general, the condensations do not have time to interact with one another before
evolving into pre-main sequence objects. Our observations support the view that
the IMF is partly determined by cloud fragmentation at the prestellar stage.
Competitive accretion is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism at the
protostellar stage in the Ophiuchus protocluster, but it may possibly govern
the growth of starless, self-gravitating condensations initially produced by
gravoturbulent fragmentation toward an IMF, Salpeter-like mass spectrum.

effective hadronic lagrangian; with the techniques of Infrared Regularization,
it is possible to separate out the short-range contributions and to write them

virtually any galactic potential. This result has been seen as a potential
contradiction with observations of supermassive black holes residing in the

merger tree model, we show that, even in the limit of very large ejection
probability, after a small number of merger generations there should still be
an appreciable fraction (>50%) of galaxies with supermassive black holes today.
We go on to argue that the inclusion of more realistic physics ingredients in
the merger model should systematically increase this retention fraction,
helping to resolve a potential conflict between theory and observation. Lastly,
we develop a more realistic Monte Carlo model to confirm the qualitative
arguments and estimate occupation fractions as a function of the central

explain the generation of galactic warps. A cup-shaped distortion is expected,
due to the transmission of the linear momentum; but, this effect is small for

transmission of angular momentum, i.e. a torque giving an integral-sign shaped
warp. The torque produced by a flow of velocity ~100 km/s and baryon density
~10^{-25} kg/m^3, which is within the possible values for the intergalactic
medium, is enough to generate the observed warps and this mechanism offers
quite a plausible explanation. The inferred rate of infall of matter, ~1
M_sun/yr, to the Galactic disc that this theory predicts agrees with the
quantitative predictions of chemical evolution resolving key issues, notably
the G-dwarf problem.
  Sanchez-Salcedo (2006) suggests that this mechanism is not plausible because
it would produce a dependence of the scaleheight of the disc with the
Galactocentric azimuth in the outer disc, but rather than being an objection
this is another argument in favour of the mechanism because this dependence is
actually observed in our Galaxy.

frequency accompanies a spectral transition of the source from its island to
its banana states. The banana-states' Fourier-resolved spectra are well fitted
by a single blackbody component with $kT \sim 2-3$ keV depending on the source
position in the color -- color diagram and the Fourier frequency, thus
indicating that this spectral component is responsible for the source
variability on these timescales. This result is in approximate agreement with
similar behavior exhibited by the Z sources, suggesting that, as in that case,
the boundary layer -- the likely source of the thermal component -- is
supported by radiation pressure. Furthermore, it is found that the iron line at
$\sim$6.6 keV, clearly present in the averaged spectra, not apparent within the
limitations of our measurements in the frequency-resolved spectra irrespective
of the frequency range. This would indicate that this spectral component
exhibits little variability on time scales comprising the interval
$10^{-2}-10^2$ seconds. In the island state the single blackbody model proved
inadequate, particularly notable in our lowest frequency band ($0.008-0.8$ Hz).

However, so far it has not been possible to show how two SMBHs bind during a

formation of a SMBH binary down to scales of a few light years following the

surprising result that many bursts have large X-ray flares superimposed on the
underlying afterglow. The flares were sometimes intense, had rapid rise and
decay phases, and occurred late relative to the ``prompt'' phase. Some
remarkable flares are observed with fluence comparable to the prompt GRB
fluence. Many GRBs have several flares, which are sometimes overlapping. Short,
intense, repetitive, and late flaring can be most easily understood within the
context of the standard fireball model with the internal engine that powers the
prompt GRB emission in an active state at late times. However, other models for
flares have been proposed. Flare origin can be investigated by comparing the
flare spectra to that of the afterglow and the initial prompt emission. In this
work, we have analyzed all significant X-ray flares from the first 110 GRBs
observed by Swift. From this sample 33 GRBs were found to have significant
X-ray flares, with 77 flares that were detected above the 3$\sigma$ level. In
addition to temporal analysis presented in a companion paper, a variety of
spectral models have been fit to each flare. In some cases, we find that the
spectral fits favor a Band function model, which is more akin to the prompt
emission than to that of an afterglow. We find that the average fluence of the
flares is 2.4e-7 erg/cm^2/s in the 0.2-10 keV energy band, which is
approximately a factor of ten below the average prompt GRB fluence. These
results, when combined with those presented in the companion paper on temporal
properties of flares, supports the hypothesis that most X-ray flares are
late-time activity of the internal engine that spawned the initial GRB; not an
afterglow related effect.

overexpressed in many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In
silcio modeling is considered to be an increasingly promising tool to add
useful insights into the dynamics of the EGFR signal transduction pathway.
However, most of the previous modeling work focused on the molecular or the
cellular level only, neglecting the crucial feedback between these scales as
well as the interaction with the heterogeneous biochemical microenvironment.
  Results We developed a multiscale model for investigating expansion dynamics
of NSCLC within a two-dimensional in silico microenvironment. At the molecular
level, a specific EGFR-ERK intracellular signal transduction pathway was
implemented. Dynamical alterations of these molecules were used to trigger
phenotypic changes at the cellular level. Examining the relationship between
extrinsic ligand concentrations, intrinsic molecular profiles and microscopic
patterns, the results confirmed that increasing the amount of available growth
factor leads to a spatially more aggressive cancer system. Moreover, for the
cell closest to nutrient abundance, a phase-transition emerges where a minimal
increase in extrinsic ligand abolishes the proliferative phenotype altogether.
  Conclusions Our in silico results indicate that, in NSCLC, in the presence of
a strong extrinsic chemotactic stimulus, and depending on the cell's location,
downstream EGFR-ERK signaling may be processed more efficiently, thereby
yielding a migration-dominant cell phenotype and overall, an accelerated
spatio-temporal expansion rate.

cosmic rays is their mass composition. Primary photons and neutrinos produce
markedly different showers from nuclei, while showers of different nuclear
species are not easy to distinguish. To maximise the discrimination with the
Pierre Auger Observatory ideally all mass-sensitive observables should be
combined, but the 10% duty cycle of the fluorescence detector limits the use of
direct measurements of shower maximum at the highest energies. Therefore, we
investigate mass-sensitive observables accessible with the surface detectors
alone. These are the signal risetime in the Cherenkov stations, the curvature
of the shower front, the muon-to-electromagnetic ratio, and the azimuthal
signal asymmetry. Risetime and curvature depend mainly on the depth of the
shower development in the atmosphere, and thus on primary energy and mass. The
muon content of a shower depends on the primary energy and the number of
nucleons, while asymmetry about the shower core is due to geometric effects and
attenuation, which are dependent on the primary mass. The mass sensitivity of
these variables is demonstrated and their application for composition studies
is discussed.

three aspects - a) To systematically study classes of microscopic (string/$M$

physics (electroweak scale), b) To find patterns of experimental observables
which are sensitive to the properties of the underlying theoretical
constructions thereby allowing us to distinguish among different constructions,
and c) To try to get insights about the qualitative features of the theoretical
model from data in a bottom-up approach which complements the top-down approach
and strengthens it as well. This thesis studies all the above aspects in
detail. The methods used and results obtained in this thesis will hopefully be
of great importance in solving the Inverse Problem.

evolution of the system after tunneling. The bounce is seen to correspond to a
sequence of configurations interpolating between initial and final
configurations on either side of the tunneling barrier, all of which are
restricted to the static patch. The final configuration, which gives the
initial data on the static patch for evolution after tunneling, is obtained
from one half of a slice through the center of the bounce, while the other half
gives the configuration before tunneling. The formalism makes no statement

On length scales shorter than a crossover length (which grows with the strength
of surface tension), the effective interface roughness exponent $\zeta$ is
$\simeq 1.20$, close to the expected value for the universality class of the
quenched Edwards-Wilkinson model. We find that the waiting times between
avalanches are fully uncorrelated, as the wavelet transform of their
autocorrelations scales as white noise. Similarly, detrended size-size
correlations give a white-noise wavelet transform. Consideration of finite
driving rates, still deep within the intermittent regime, shows the wavelet
transform of correlations scaling as $1/f^{1.5}$ for intermediate frequencies.
This behavior is ascribed to intra-avalanche correlations.

velocity coherence of the filaments, one can be traced back to its origin in
what we identify as the SouthEast HI Overdensity (SEHO) of the Large Magellanic

be traced back to the SEHO in velocity and position. Therefore, at least

integrable systems. Section 1 reviews the classical results on integrable
systems. New examples of integrable systems, which have been discovered, are
based on the Lax representation of the equations of motion. These systems can
be realized as straight line motions on a Jacobi variety of a so-called
spectral curve. In section 2, we study a Lie algebra theoretical method leading
to integrable systems and we apply the method to several problems. In section
3, we discuss the concept of the algebraic complete integrability (a.c.i.) of
hamiltonian systems. Algebraic integrability means that the system is
completely integrable in the sens of the phase space being folited by tori,
which in addition are real parts of a complex algebraic tori (abelian
varieties). The method is devoted to illustrate how to decide about the a.c.i.
of hamiltonian systems and is applied to some examples. Finally, in section 4
we study an a.c.i. in the generalized sense which appears as covering of a.c.i.
system. The manifold invariant by the complex flow is covering of abelian
variety.

for luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and galaxy clusters through simple empirical
methods. The data used is from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). I show that
with three bands only ({\it gri}) it is possible to achieve results as accurate
as the ones obtained by other techniques, generally based on more filters. In
particular, the use of the $(g-i)$ color helps improving the final redshifts
(especially for clusters), as this color monotonically increases up to $z \sim
0.8$. For the LRGs I generate a catalog of $\sim 1.5$ million objects at $z <
0.70$. The accuracy of this catalog is $\sigma = 0.027$ for $z \le 0.55$ and
$\sigma = 0.049$ for $0.55 < z \le 0.70$. The photometric redshift technique
employed for clusters is independent of a cluster selection algorithm. Thus, it
can be applied to systems selected by any method or wavelength, as long as the
proper optical photometry is available. When comparing the redshift listed in
literature to the photometric estimate, the accuracy achieved for clusters is
$\sigma = 0.024$ for $z \le 0.30$ and $\sigma = 0.037$ for $030 < z \le 0.55$.
However, when considering the spectroscopic redshift as the mean value of SDSS
galaxies on each cluster region, the accuracy is at the same level as found by
other authors: $\sigma = 0.011$ for $z \le 0.30$ and $\sigma = 0.016$ for $030
< z \le 0.55$. The photometric redshift relation derived here is applied to
thousands of cluster candidates selected elsewhere. I have also used galaxy
photometric redshifts available in SDSS to identify groups in redshift space
and then compare the redshift peak of the nearest group to each cluster
redshift (ABRIDGED).

variable linking length in transverse and radial direction to eliminate
selection effects and to find reliably as many groups as possible to track the
supercluster network. We take into account various selection effects due to the
use of a magnitude limited sample. To determine linking length scaling we study
the luminosity-density relation in observed groups. We follow the changes in
group sizes and mean galaxy number densities within groups when shifting nearby
groups to larger distances. As a result we show that the linking length should
be a slowly growing function with distance. Our final sample contains 17143
groups in the equatorial, and 33219 groups in the northern part of the DR5
survey with membership N_g >= 2. The group catalogue is available at our

this survey has been obtained by moderately growing linking length scaling law
up to redshift z = 0.12. Above this redshift the scaling law turns down. In the

extended over more than 50 Mpc at redshift z=3.1, and exhibits a considerably
weak angular correlation. Such properties of LAE distributions appear to be
incompatible with the standard biased galaxy formation scenario in the CDM
cosmology. In this paper, by considering the possibility that LAEs are
short-lived events, we attempt to build up the picture of LAEs concordant with
the CDM cosmology. We find that if the lifetime of LAEs is as short as (6.7 \pm
0.6) \times 10^7 yr, the distributions of simulated galaxies successfully match
the extension and morphology of large-scale structure of LAEs at z=3.1, and
also the weak angular correlation function. This result implies that LAEs at
z=3.1 do not necessarily reside in high density peaks, but tends to be located
in less dense regions, in a different way from the expectation by the standard
biased galaxy formation scenario. In addition, we make a prediction for the
angular correlation function of LAEs at redshifts higher than 3. It is found
that the prediction deviates from that by the standard biased galaxy formation

charged pions in proton--tantalum collisions emitted at large angles from the
incoming beam direction is presented. The data were taken in 2002 with the HARP
detector in the T9 beam line of the CERN PS. The pions were produced by proton
beams in a momentum range from 3 \GeVc to 12 \GeVc hitting a tantalum target
with a thickness of 5% of a nuclear interaction length. The angular and
momentum range covered by the experiment ($100 \MeVc \le p < 800 \MeVc$ and
$0.35 \rad \le \theta <2.15 \rad$) is of particular importance for the design
of a neutrino factory. The produced particles were detected using a
small-radius cylindrical time projection chamber (TPC) placed in a solenoidal
magnet. Track recognition, momentum determination and particle identification
were all performed based on the measurements made with the TPC. An elaborate
system of detectors in the beam line ensured the identification of the incident
particles. Results are shown for the double-differential cross-sections
${{\mathrm{d}^2 \sigma}} / {{\mathrm{d}p\mathrm{d}\theta}}$ at four incident
proton beam momenta (3 \GeVc, 5 \GeVc, 8 \GeVc and 12 \GeVc). In addition, the
pion yields within the acceptance of typical neutrino factory designs are shown
as a function of beam momentum. The measurement of these yields within a single
experiment eliminates most systematic errors in the comparison between rates at
different beam momenta and between positive and negative pion production.

of the system are generally split into an Ising transition and an XY

variables are expected to be disordered before the Ising variables when thermal

zero perpendicular hoppings, the finite temperature transition is a
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition driven by proliferation of hybrid half vortices,
and the zero temperature quantum phase transition is split into a bond order
transition and a 3D XY transition, which can be driven by the condensation of
either single vortices or half vortices. After the condensation of half
vortices the resultant state is a Mott Insulator of paired bosons. A small
perpendicular hopping $J_b$ leads to a 2D Ising transition at low temperature

eventual termination of short-term persistent activity. Using the model, we
reproduced the features of reverberating activity that were observed in small
(50-100 cells) networks of cultured hippocampal neurons, such as the appearance
of polysynaptic current clusters, the typical inter-cluster intervals, the
typical duration of reverberation, and the response to changes in
extra-cellular ionic composition. The model relies on action
potential-triggered residual presynaptic calcium, which we suggest plays an
important role in sustaining reverberations. We show that reverberatory
activity is maintained by enhanced asynchronous transmitter release from
pre-synaptic terminals, which in itself depends on the dynamics of residual
presynaptic calcium. Hence, asynchronous release, rather than being a ""synaptic
noise"", can play an important role in network dynamics. Additionally, we found
that a fast timescale synaptic depression is responsible for oscillatory
network activation during reverberations, whereas the onset of a slow timescale
depression leads to the termination of reverberation. The simplicity of our
model enabled a number of predictions that were confirmed by additional
analyses of experimental manipulations.

velocity of rotation associated with the eleven-year activity cycle, are a
manifestation of the interaction among the interior magnetic fields, amplified
and modulated by the solar dynamo, and rotation, meridional flow and turbulent
thermal transport. Therefore, they can be used, at least in principle, to put
constraints on that interaction. Similar phenomena are expected to be observed
in solar-like stars and can be modelled to shed light on analogous interactions
in different environments. The source of the torsional oscillations is
investigated by means of a model for the angular momentum transport within the
convection zone. A description of the torsional oscillations is introduced,
based on an analytical solution of the angular momentum equation in the
mean-field approach. It provides information on the intensity and location of
the torques producing the redistribution of the angular momentum within the
convection zone of the Sun along the activity cycle. The method can be extended
to solar-like stars for which some information on the time-dependence of the
differential rotation is becoming available. Illustrative applications to the
Sun and solar-like stars are presented. Under the hypothesis that the solar
torsional oscillations are due to the mean-field Lorentz force, the mean
amplitude of the Maxwell stresses and the phase relationship between poloidal
and toroidal field components are obtained. Our preliminary results show the
capability of the proposed approach to constrain the amplitude, phase and
location of the perturbations leading to the observed torsional oscillations.

is given to the approach toward the hard-sphere limit, and to the effect of

indicate, surprisingly, that even a modest degree of softness in the pair
potential governing the direct interactions between the particles may lead to a
significantly more attractive total effective potential for the big spheres

phase behavior, structure and dynamics of a binary mixture of soft repulsive

diagram of an effective system of big spheres interacting via depletion forces
for a size ratio of small and big spheres of 0.2; this diagram includes the
usual fluid-solid transition but, in the soft-sphere case, the metastable
fluid-fluid transition, which is probably absent in hard-sphere mixtures, is
close to being stable with respect to direct fluid-solid coexistence. From
these results the interesting possibility arises that, for sufficiently soft

the DDE has a purely imaginary eigenvalue) are parameterized. We show how the

  The parametrization is done by solving a {\em quadratic eigenvalue problem}

typically of large size. For commensurate delay differential equations, the
corresponding equation is a polynomial eigenvalue problem. As a special case of

the profile widths which are, respectively, very intense and very wide in YHGs.
The abundances obtained for IRC+10420 agree with those found in AGB stars, but
in general those found in AFGL2343, except for 13CO, are too low. This
apparently low molecular abundance in AFGL2343 could be due to the fact that

practical limitation to ultra-high-precision astrometry, e.g. in the context of
exoplanet searches, and to quantify the expected effects in different regions
of the HR-diagram. Stellar surface structures are likely to produce
fluctuations in the integrated flux and radial velocity of the star, as well as
a variation of the observed photocentre, i.e. astrometric jitter, and closure
phase. We use theoretical considerations supported by Monte Carlo simulations
to derive statistical relations between the corresponding astrometric,
photometric, and radial-velocity effects. For most stellar types the
astrometric jitter due to stellar surface structures is expected to be of order
10 micro-AU or greater. This is more than the astrometric displacement
typically caused by an Earth-size exoplanet in the habitable zone, which is
about 1-4 micro-AU for long-lived main-sequence stars. Only for stars with
extremely low photometric variability (<0.5 mmag) and low magnetic activity,
comparable to that of the Sun, will the astrometric jitter be of order 1
micro-AU, suffcient to allow the astrometric detection of an Earth-sized planet
in the habitable zone. While stellar surface structure may thus seriously
impair the astrometric detection of small exoplanets, it has in general
negligible impact on the detection of large (Jupiter-size) planets and on the
determination of stellar parallax and proper motion. From the starspot model we
also conclude that the commonly used spot filling factor is not the most
relevant parameter for quantifying the spottiness in terms of the resulting
astrometric, photometric and radial-velocity variations.

In this note we explore the possibility of generating the low energy spectra of
various nonsupersymmetric heterotic string vacua form the Horava--Witten model.
We argue that this can be achieved by imposing on the Horava--Witten model an
invariance with respect to some extra operators which identify the orbifold
fixed planes in a nontrivial way, and demonstrate it for the E_8 and
SO(16)XSO(16) heterotic string vacua in ten dimensions.

provide an infinite class of four-dimensional N=1 superconformal field theories

understood that these gauge theories are completely specified by certain
two-dimensional torus graphs, called brane tilings, and the combinatorics of
the dimer models on these graphs. In particular, knowledge of the dual
Sasaki-Einstein metric is not required to determine the gauge theory, only
topological and symplectic properties of the toric Calabi-Yau cone. By
analyzing the symmetries of the toric quiver theories we derive the dimer
models and use them to construct the moduli space of the theory both
classically and semiclassically. Using mirror symmetry the brane tilings are
shown to arise in string theory on the world-volumes of the fractional

Recently p modes have been detected on the bright solar-like star alpha Cen A

characterisation of these p modes is clearly needed to constrain theoretical
models. We observed alpha Cen A during five nights using the HARPS spectrograph
in order to improve our knowledge of the seismic properties of this star. We
performed high-precision radial-velocity sequences and computed the acoustic
spectrum of alpha Cen A. We identify 34 p modes with angular degree l=0-3 in
the frequency range 1.8-2.9 mHz and amplitude range 13-48 cm/s, in agreement
with previous seismic studies. We find an enhancement of the frequency scatter
with the angular degree l that indicates, considering the high inclination axis
of alpha Cen A, rotational splitting and explains the low values of previously
suggested mode lifetimes. We also derive new values for the small separations
that take the effect of rotational splitting into account . Our seismic study
of alpha Cen A leads to a list of now well identified p-mode frequencies and
shows the importance of taking the rotation into account in order to properly
characterise the p modes even in quite short campaigns.

intrinsic length scales and spatiotemporal correlations of LVs corresponding to
the leading unstable directions by translating the problem to the language of
scale-invariant growing surfaces. We find that the so-called 'characteristic'
LVs exhibit spatial localization, strong clustering around given spatiotemporal
loci, and remarkable dynamic scaling properties of the corresponding surfaces.
In contrast, the commonly used backward LVs (obtained through Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization) spread all over the system and do not exhibit dynamic
scaling due to artifacts in the dynamical correlations by construction.

Sf(x)=(f''(x)/f'(x))'-1/2(f''(x)/f'(x))^2 . A sufficient condition for a
function to behave chaotically is that its Schwarzian derivative is negative.
In this paper, we try to find a sufficient condition for a non-linear dynamical
system to behave chaotically. The solution function of this system is a higher
degree polynomial. We define n-th Schwarzian derivative to examine its general
properties. Our analysis shows that the sufficient condition for chaotic
behavior of higher order polynomial is provided if its highest order three
terms satisfy an inequality which is invariant under the degree of the
polynomial and the condition is represented by Hankel determinant of order 2.
Also the n-th order polynomial can be considered to be the partial sum of real
variable analytic function. Let this analytic function be the solution of
non-linear differential equation, then the sufficient condition for the
chaotical behavior of this function is the Hankel determinant of order 2
negative, where the elements of this determinant are the coefficient of the
terms of n, n-1, n-2 in Taylor expansion.

a steady state are those in which the planets are locked in a quadruple mean
motion resonance (i.e. each planet is in resonance with its neighbor). In total
we found 6 such configurations. For the gas disk parameters found in MC07,
these configurations are characterized by a negligible migration rate. After
the disappearance of the gas, and in absence of planetesimals, only two of
these six configurations (the least compact ones) are stable for a time of
hundreds of millions of years or more. The others become unstable on a
timescale of a few My. Our preliminary simulations show that, when a
planetesimal disk is added beyond the orbit of the outermost planet, the
planets can evolve from the most stable of these configurations to their
current orbits in a fashion qualitatively similar to that described in Tsiganis

physical dimensions, ii) the Lagrangian has no explicit dependence on any
physical constants except mass, and hence iii) all physical constants in the

in Kaluza-Klein theory to add fermion fields by defining higher dimensional
bispinor fields on the Kaluza-Klein manifold, these Kaluza-Klein theories do
not satisfy conditions (i), (ii), and (iii). In this paper, we show how
conditions (i), (ii), and (iii) can be satisfied by including bispinor fields
in a tetrad formulation of the Kaluza-Klein model, as well as in an equivalent
teleparallel model. This demonstrates an unexpected feature of Dirac's bispinor
equation, since conditions (i), (ii), (iii) imply a special relation among the
terms in the Kaluza-Klein or teleparallel Lagrangian that would not be

galaxy a dependence on luminosity is found between the three classes with the
unevolved dwarf objects having significantly higher effective temperatures. A
metallicity dependence is present between the SMC and Galactic dwarf objects,
and whilst the LMC stars are only slightly cooler than the SMC stars, they are
significantly hotter than their Galactic counterparts.

  Neutrinos","11 pages, revtex, 3 eps figures, references and constraint added,
  conclusions unchanged",,,"NUHEP-TH/07-06","hep-ph",,"  If the Standard Model particle content is extended by gauge singlet fermions
(right-handed neutrinos), active neutrinos generically acquire (Majorana)
masses, in agreement with our current understanding of the lepton sector. If
the right-handed neutrino masses are of the same order as the electroweak
symmetry breaking scale, it is usually expected that these will not mediate any
experimentally observable effects. Here, I explore the fact that this is not
necessarily the case. If neutrino masses are ""accidentally small"",
active-sterile mixing angles can, according to current experimental bounds, be
as large as several percent. If this is the case, I argue that the dominant
decay mode of light (M_H less than 130 GeV) Higgs bosons could be into an
active and a sterile neutrino. The sterile neutrino decays promptly into a
charge lepton and an on- or off-shell W-boson, so that the dominant Higgs boson
decay mode is H to leptons + jets + missing transverse energy.

current by a magnetic domain wall (DW) on a single-layered ferromagnetic wire.
A direct-current (DC) voltage is generated by the spin torque diode effect,
which is a consequence of magnetoresistance oscillation due to the resonant
spin wave excitation induced by the spin-polarized RF current. The DC voltage
spectrum strongly depends on the internal spin structure in the DW, which
corresponds to the magnetic fingerprint of the spin structure in the
ferromagnetic wire.

selection is achieved by a double reflection supermirror monochromator and the
collimator uses a novel multibeam design.

would also lead to superluminal signalling.

Landau-Lifshitz damping term in the micromagnetic equations of motion over that
of the more commonly accepted Gilbert damping form. Much of their argument
revolved around spin-torque driven domain wall motion in narrow magnetic wires,
since the presence of spin-torques can more acutely draw a distinction between
the two forms of damping. In this article, the author uses simple arguments and
examples to offer an alternative point of view favoring Gilbert.
