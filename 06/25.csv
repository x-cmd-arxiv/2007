pi^0 e^+ e^- and K_L -> pi^0 mu^+ mu^- are theoretically very clean and, being
strongly CKM suppressed, highly sensitive to New Physics (NP). Recent Flavour
Physics analyses show that they represent unique probes for revealing NP
effects and to provide information on the NP flavour structure. After a brief
discussion of the main properties that make rare K decays so promising and of
the basic ideas of the most interesting NP models, we review the results of
recent phenomenological analyses both within and beyond the framework of
Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV), where the sources of flavour violation are the
same as in the Standard Model. Within MFV we present the expectations found for
rare K decays from a model-independent analysis and in three MFV models: the
Littlest Higgs (LH) model, the (extra-dimension) Appelquist-Cheng-Dobrescu
model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with MFV. Beyond
MFV, we discuss the results recently found within the MSSM (without MFV), the
LH model with T-parity (LHT) and the 3-3-1 (Z') model. While in MFV models only
small (<30%) NP effects are allowed in the branching ratios of K_L -> pi^0 nu
{bar nu}, K^+ -> pi^+ nu {bar nu}, K_L -> pi^0 e^+ e^- and K_L -> pi^0 mu^+
mu^-, beyond MFV, in particular in the MSSM and in the LHT model, large (up to
an order of magnitude) enhancements w.r.t. the SM turn out to be possible.

which the net outcome of a collision is accumulation into a larger body instead
of mass erosion. For each binary configuration, we derive the critical radial
distance from the binary barycenter beyond which planetesimal accretion is
possible. This critical radial distance is smallest for equal-mass binaries on
almost circular orbits. It shifts to larger values for increasing
eccentricities and decreasing mass ratio. The importance of the planetesimals'

  Memorial Seminar, 19 April 2007, Florida A&M University",,,,"gr-qc",,"  The introduction of coordinates representing the points of view of various
observers results in the possibility of horizons when acceleration and
gravitation are included. A horizon is a surface of possible light beams in a
region of space of finite distance from the observer, which means that since
nothing travels faster than light, events on the far side of a horizon cannot
influence those on the causal side. A black hole has such a horizon, where some
radially outgoing light beams can never reach a distant (or even nearby)
observer. However, since one suspects that black holes can swallow energy, and
even evaporate by Hawking radiation, such horizons must take on a time
dependency. A naive introduction of temporal dependency results in infinities
(singularities) in energy densities, suggesting in such descriptions that an
in-falling observer would encounter a hard surface at the horizon. However, if
coordinates representing space-time as analogous to a ""flowing river"" are used
to describe the dynamics of a black hole, no such singularities are
encountered. Such a parameterization of time dependent horizons will be offered
in this presentation. A Penrose space-time diagram (which represents the entire
space-time on a finite diagram with light beams always moving at a 45 degree
angle to vertical) describing the growth and evaporation of an example black
hole, along with the resulting coordinate anomaly, will be constructed.

dynamics is controlled by the short-pitched helix, while there is a cross-over
at larger amplitude to control by the axial helix. We find far better, and

Condensation (BEC) can be understood in terms of lowest order mean field
theory, whereby the entire system is assumed to be condensed, with thermal and
quantum fluctuations completely ignored. Such a treatment leads to the
Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE) used extensively throughout this book. Although
this theory works remarkably well for a broad range of experimental parameters,
a more complete treatment is required for understanding various experiments,
including experiments with solitons and vortices. Such treatments should
include the dynamical coupling of the condensate to the thermal cloud, the
effect of dimensionality, the role of quantum fluctuations, and should also
describe the critical regime, including the process of condensate formation.
The aim of this Chapter is to give a brief but insightful overview of various
recent theories, which extend beyond the GPE. To keep the discussion brief,
only the main notions and conclusions will be presented. This Chapter
generalizes the presentation of Chapter 1, by explicitly maintaining
fluctuations around the condensate order parameter. While the theoretical
arguments outlined here are generic, the emphasis is on approaches suitable for
describing single weakly-interacting atomic Bose gases in harmonic traps.
Interesting effects arising when condensates are trapped in double-well
potentials and optical lattices, as well as the cases of spinor condensates,

changes the characteristic behavior of Josephson current. In addition to
spin-singlet Cooper pairs, equal-spin triplet pairs penetrate into a half
metal. Such equal-spin pairs have an unusual symmetry property called
odd-frequency symmetry and carry the Josephson current through a half metal.
The penetration of odd-frequency pairs into a half metal enhances the low

by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We will also show that odd-frequency pairs

finally, optimize data management by taking into account checkpoint application

Sky Survey. We find that the surface number-density of satellites declines with
the projected distance as a power law with the slope -1.5-2. The rms velocities
gradually decline: observations exclude constant velocities at a 10 sigma
level. We show that observational data strongly favor the standard model: all
three major statistics of satellites - the number-density profile, the
line-of-sight velocity dispersion, and the distribution function of the
velocities -- agree remarkably well with the predictions of the standard
cosmological model. Thus, that the success of the standard model extends to
scales (50-500) kpc, much lower than what was previously considered. MOND fails
on these scales for models which assume any single power-law number-density
profile of satellites and any constant velocity anisotropy by predicting nearly
constant rms velocities of satellites. Satellite data can be fit by fine-tuned
models, which require (1) specific non-power-law density profile, (2) very
radial orbits at large distances (velocity anisotropy beta =0.6-0.7 at 200-300
kpc), and (3) 2-2.5 times more stellar mass than what is found in the galaxies.
The external gravity force - a necessary component for MOND -- makes the
situation even worse. We argue that a combination of satellite data and
observational constraints on stellar masses make these models very problematic.

stationary distribution can be exactly computed using a recent result of Pal

point is imaged. The speed of the camera, up to 16000 fps, allows us to observe
and quantify the details of the peeling point motion during the stick and slip
phases: stick and slip velocities, durations and amplitudes. First, in contrast
with previous observations, the stick-slip regime appears to be only transient
in the force controlled peeling. Additionally, we discover that the stick and
slip phases have similar durations and that at high mean peeling velocity, the
slip phase actually lasts longer than the stick phase. Depending on the mean
peeling velocity, we also observe that the velocity change between stick and
slip phase ranges from a rather sudden to a smooth transition. These new
observations can help to discriminate between the various assumptions used in
theoretical models for describing the complex peeling of an adhesive tape. The
present imaging technique opens the door for an extensive study of the velocity
controlled stick-slip peeling of an adhesive tape that will allow to understand
the statistical complexity of the stick-slip in a stationary case.

group of gauge transformations that are trivial on the boundary. The moment map
is given by the square of curvature so that the 0-level set is the space of
flat connections. Thus the moduli space of flat connections is endowed with a
pre-symplectic structure. In case when the four-manifold is null-cobordant we
shall construct, on the moduli space of connections, as well as on that of flat
connections, a hermitian line bundle with connection whose curvature is given
by the pre-symplectic form. This is the Chern-Simons pre-quantum line bundle.
The group of gauge transformations on the boundary of the base manifold acts on
the moduli space of flat connections by an infinitesimally symplectic way. When
the base manifold is a 4-dimensional disc we show that this action is lifted to
the pre-quantum line bundle by its abelian extension. The geometric description
of the latter is related to the 4-dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten model. The

the final spatial velocity of the companion, which is mainly affected by the

tracers of low-density gas, high-density gas, molecular outflows/jets and
temperature effects. The SiO(2-1) observations reveal detections toward 18
sources. Assuming that SiO is exclusively produced by sputtering from dust
grains, this implies that at least in 40% of this sample star formation is
on-going. A broad range of SiO line-widths is observed (between 2.2 and
65km/s), and we discuss potential origins for this velocity spread. While the
low-density tracers 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(1-0) are detected in several velocity
components, the high-density tracer H13CO+(1--0) generally shows only a single
velocity component and is hence well suited for kinematic distance estimates of
IRDCs. Furthermore, the H13CO+ line-width is on average 1.5 times larger than
that of previously observed NH3(1,1). This is indicative of more motion at the
denser core centers, either due to turbulence or beginning star formation
activity. In addition, we detect CH3CN toward only six sources whereas CH3OH is
observed toward approximately 40% of the sample. Estimates of the CH3CN and
CH3OH abundances are low with average values of 1.2x10^{-10} and 4.3x10^{-10},

features of the motion, namely (i) a cell cannot directly detect a

chemoattractant concentration, (ii) rather than being entirely random, tumbles
exhibit persistence of direction, meaning that the new direction after a tumble
is more likely to be in the forward hemisphere, and (iii) rotational Brownian
motion makes it impossible for an E. coli cell to swim in a straight line
during a run. This paper presents an analytic calculation of the chemotactic
drift velocity taking account of (i), (ii) and (iii), for weak chemotaxis. The
analytic results are verified by Monte Carlo simulation. The results reveal a

stars observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope or with the Infrared Space

define 2 categories of FUors. Objects showing the silicate feature in
absorption (Category 1) are still embedded in a dusty and icy envelope. The
shape of the 10 micron silicate absorption bands is compared to typical dust
compositions of the interstellar medium and found to be in general agreement.
Only one object (RNO 1B) appears to be too rich in amorphous pyroxene dust, but
a superposed emission feature can explain the observed shape. We derive optical
depths and extinction values from the silicate band and additional ice bands at
6.0, 6.8 and 15.2 micron. In particular the analysis of the CO_2 ice band at
15.2 micron allows us to search for evidence for ice processing and constrains
whether the absorbing material is physically linked to the central object or in
the foreground. For objects showing the silicate feature in emission (Category
2), we argue that the emission comes from the surface layer of accretion disks.
Analyzing the dust composition reveals that significant grain growth has
already taken place within the accretion disks, but no clear indications for
crystallization are present. We discuss how these observational results can be
explained in the picture of a young, and highly active accretion disk. Finally,
a framework is proposed as to how the two categories of FUors can be understood
in a general paradigm of the evolution of young, low-mass stars. Only one
object (Parsamian 21) shows PAH emission features. Their shapes, however, are
often seen toward evolved stars and we question the object's status as a FUor
and discuss other possible classifications.

in our cosmological simulation. The first run-away collapse is triggered when
the gas cloud's mass is ~40 Msun. We show that the cloud core remains stable
against chemo-thermal instability and also against gravitational deformation

which accretes the surrounding hot gas at the rate ~10^{-3} Msun/year. We carry

expected to cause early chemical enrichment of the Universe by exploding as
black hole-forming super/hypernovae, and may also be progenitors of high

axially symmetric finite size disks. Potential/surface density pairs consist of
a ``homogeneous'' pair (a closed form expression) corresponding to a uniform
disk, and a ``residual'' pair. This residual component is converted into an
infinite series of integrals over the radial extent of the disk. For a certain
class of surface density distributions (like power laws of the radius), this
series is fully analytical. The extraction of the homogeneous pair is
equivalent to a convergence acceleration technique, in a matematical sense. In
the case of power law distributions, the convergence rate of the residual
series is shown to be cubic inside the source. As a consequence, very accurate
potential values are obtained by low order truncation of the series. At zero
order, relative errors on potential values do not exceed a few percent
typically, and scale with the order N of truncation as 1/N**3. This method is
superior to the classical multipole expansion whose very slow convergence is
often critical for most practical applications.

construction of classical confidence intervals"", in which confidence intervals
are computed in a Neyman construction using the likelihood ratio as ordering
quantity. In particular, two of the main results of a paper by Feldman and
Cousins (F&C) are discussed. It is shown that in the case of central intervals
the so-called flip-flopping problem, occuring in the specific scenario where
the experimenter decides to quote a standard upper limit or a confidence
interval depending on the measurement, can be easily avoided by choosing
appropriate confidence levels for the standard upper limits and confidence
intervals. In the F&C paper ""upper limit"" is defined as the upper edge of a
confidence interval, whose lower edge coincides with the physical limit. With
this definition of upper limit (F&C limit), in an approach which uses the
likelihood ratio as ordering quantity, two-sided confidence intervals
automatically change over to ""upper limits"" as the signal becomes weaker
(Unified approach). In the present paper it is pointed out that this behaviour
is not a special property of this approach, because approaches with other
ordering principles, like central intervals, symmetric intervals or
highest-probability intervals, exhibit the same behaviour. The Unified approach
is presented in the F&C paper as a solution to the flip-flopping problem. This
might suggest that the F&C limit is a standard upper limit. In order to exclude
any misunderstanding, it is proposed in the present paper to call the F&C limit
""upper edge of the confidence interval"", even if its lower edge coincides with
the physical limit.

observed using the integral-field spectrograph SAURON. The SAURON spectral
range allows the measurement of the Lick/IDS indices Hbeta, Fe5015 and Mgb,
which can be used to estimate the stellar population parameters. We present
here the two-dimensional line-strength maps for each galaxy. From the maps, we
learn that late-type spiral galaxies tend to have high Hbeta and low Fe5015 and
Mgb values, and that the Hbeta index has often a positive gradient over the
field, while the metal indices peak in the central region. We investigate the
relations between the central line-strength indices and their correlations with
morphological type and central velocity dispersion, and compare the observed
behaviour with that for ellipticals, lenticulars and early-type spirals from
the SAURON survey. We find that our galaxies lie below the Mg - sigma relation
determined for elliptical galaxies and that the indices show a clear trend with
morphological type. From the line-strength maps we calculate age, metallicity
and abundance ratio maps and discuss the results from a one-SSP approach and
from a two-SSP approach. Late-type galaxies are generally younger and more
metal poor than ellipticals and have abundance ratios closer to solar values.
We also explore a continuous star formation scenario, and try to recover the
star formation history using the evolutionary models of Bruzual & Charlot
(2003), assuming constant or exponentially declining star formation rate (SFR).
We find a correlation between the e-folding time-scale tau of the starburst and
the central velocity dispersion: more massive galaxies tend to have shorter
tau, suggesting that the star formation happened long ago and has now basically
ended, while for smaller objects with larger values of tau it is still active.

demonstrate that this approach encompasses the fundamental elements of a

interstellar medium (ISM). Both the ICM and ISM components are introduced as
SPH particles. As a galaxy arrives on a highly radial orbit from outskirts to
cluster center, it crosses the ICM density peak and experiences a time-varying
wind. Depending on the duration and intensity of the ISM-ICM interaction, early

distribution are found to show different stripping efficiencies, amounts of
reaccretion of the extra-planar ISM, and final masses. We compare the numerical
results with analytical approximations of different complexity and indicate the

importance, as the system evolves under the influence of its environment,
interacting via a quantum nondemoliton type of coupling, such that there is
decoherence without dissipation, as well as when it interacts via a dissipative
interaction, resulting in decoherence as well as dissipation. The system is
taken to be either a two-level atom (or equivalently, a spin-1/2 system) or a
harmonic oscillator, and the environment is modeled as a bath of harmonic
oscillators, starting out in a squeezed thermal state. The impact of the
different environmental parameters on the dynamics of the quantum phase
distribution for the system starting out in various initial states, is
explicitly brought out. An interesting feature that emerges from our work is
that the relationship between squeezing and temperature effects depends on the
type of system-bath interaction. In the case of quantum nondemolition type of
interaction, squeezing and temperature work in tandem, producing a diffusive
effect on the phase distribution. In contrast, in case of a dissipative
interaction, the influence of temperature can be counteracted by squeezing,
which manifests as a resistence to randomization of phase. We make use of the
phase distributions to bring out a notion of complementarity in atomic systems.
We also study the dispersion of the phase using the phase distributions

magnetised jets. We find that collimated supersonic jets do not excite
supersonic motions far from the vicinity of the jet. Supersonic fluctuations
are damped quickly and do not spread into the parent cloud. Instead subsonic,
non-compressional modes occupy most of the excited volume. This is a generic
feature which can not be fully circumvented by overdense jets or magnetic

the kernel of $f(t^2 \Delta)$. Suppose $f$ satisfies Daubechies' criterion, and
$b > 0$. For each $j$, write ${\bf M}$ as a disjoint union of measurable sets
$E_{j,k}$ with diameter at most $ba^j$, and comparable to $ba^j$ if $ba^j$ is

onto the constant functions). Moreover, we show that the ratio of the frame

Moreover, based upon how well-localized a function $F \in (I-P)L^2$ is in space

be regarded as a continuous wavelet on ${\bf M}$, and characterize the H\""older

down to another. Such a pair of dilatation structures leads to the intrinsic
definition of a distribution as a field of topological filters.
  To any pair of dilatation structures there is an associated notion of
differentiability which generalizes the Pansu differentiability. This allows
the introduction of the Radon-Nikodym property for dilatation structures, which
is the straightforward generalization of the Radon-Nikodym property for Banach
spaces.
  After an introducting section about length metric spaces and metric
derivatives, is proved that for a dilatation structure with the Radon-Nikodym
property the length of absolutely continuous curves expresses as an integral of
the norms of the tangents to the curve, as in Riemannian geometry.
  Further it is shown that Radon-Nikodym property transfers from any ""upper""
dilatation structure looking down to a ""lower"" dilatation structure, theorem
\ref{ttransfer}. Im my opinion this result explains intrinsically the fact that
absolutely continuous curves in regular sub-Riemannian manifolds are derivable
almost everywhere, as proved by Margulis-Mostow, Pansu (for Carnot groups) or

evidence on the heterogeneous properties of transportation and commuting
patterns among urban areas, we present a thorough analysis of the behavior of
infectious diseases in metapopulation models characterized by heterogeneous
connectivity and mobility patterns. We derive the basic reaction-diffusion
equation describing the metapopulation system at the mechanistic level and
derive an early stage dynamics approximation for the subpopulation invasion
dynamics. The analytical description uses degree block variables that allows us
to take into account arbitrary degree distribution of the metapopulation
network. We show that along with the usual single population epidemic threshold
the metapopulation network exhibits a global threshold for the subpopulation
invasion. We find an explicit analytic expression for the invasion threshold
that determines the minimum number of individuals traveling among
subpopulations in order to have the infection of a macroscopic number of
subpopulations. The invasion threshold is a function of factors such as the
basic reproductive number, the infectious period and the mobility process and
it is found to decrease for increasing network heterogeneity. We provide
extensive mechanistic numerical Monte Carlo simulations that recover the
analytical finding in a wide range of metapopulation network connectivity
patterns. The results can be useful in the understanding of recent data driven
computational approaches to disease spreading in large transportation networks

corresponding to all possible duality symmetries of the on-shell degrees of

that the non-linear realisation of this algebra accounts precisely for the form
fields present in the corresponding supersymmetric theory. We also find a
simple necessary condition for the roots to belong to a G^{+++} algebra.

produced by 610GeV/c Sigma- and 525GeV/c proton beams in the experiment SELEX
during the 1996/7 fixed target run at Fermilab. The polarization was measured
as a function of the Lambda longitudinal momentum fraction xF and transverse
momentum pt. For the Lambda0 produced by Sigma- the polarization is increasing
with xF, from slightly negative at x_F~0 to about 15% at large xF; it shows a
non-monotonic behavior as a function of pt. For the proton beam, the Lambda0
polarization is negative and decreasing as a function of xF and pt. The
antiLambda0 polarization is compatible with 0 for both beam particles over the
full kinematic range. The target dependence was examined but no statistically
significant difference was found.

properties of a collection of non-interacting three-dimensional (3D)
magnetically anisotropic nanoparticles in the light of classical statistical
physics. Pertaining to the angular dependence ($\alpha$) of the magnetic field
with the anisotropy axis, energy landscape plots are obtained which reveal a
continuous transition from a double well to a single well for
$\alpha=\frac{\pi}{2}$ and show asymmetric bistable shape for other values of
$\alpha$. The present analysis is related with the interpretation of
equilibrium magnetization and static susceptibility of nanomagnetic system as a
function of external magnetic field, $B$, and temperature, $T$. The
magnetization and susceptibility confirms the non Langevin behaviour of
magneto-anisotropic monodomain particles. The susceptibility analysis
establishes the ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic like coupling
for various $\alpha$. This study reveals the essential role of magneto
anisotropic energy in the interpretation of the magnetic behaviour of a
collection of noninteracting single domain nanoparticles.

aspects: (1) modelling more realistic (p,q) string networks than the Z_N
networks used so far and (2) investigating the effect of long-range
interactions on the evolution of the network. We model the network with no
long-range interactions using two sets of fields, complex scalars coupled to
gauge fields, with a potential chosen such that the two types of strings will
form bound states. This way we can model junctions of 3 strings with different
tension; in Z_N models used so far in simulations all the strings have
identical tensions. In order to introduce long-range interactions we also study
a network in which one of the scalars forms global strings. We observe that in
the absence of long-range interactions the formation of bound states has a
significant influence on the evolution of the network. When long-range
interactions are turned on the bound states are short-lived and have a minimal
effect on the network evolution.

  Mean-Field model","Submitted to Phys. Rev. E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.76.041117",,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  The Hamiltonian Mean-Field model has been investigated, since its
introduction about a decade ago, to study the equilibrium and dynamical
properties of long-range interacting systems. Here we study the long-time
behavior of long-lived, out-of-equilibrium, quasi-stationary dynamical states,
whose lifetime diverges in the thermodynamic limit. The nature of these states
has been the object of a lively debate, in the recent past. We introduce a new
numerical tool, based on the fluctuations of the phase of the instantaneous
magnetization of the system. Using this tool, we study the quasi-stationary
states that arise when the system is started from different classes of initial
conditions, showing that the new observable can be exploited to compute the
lifetime of these states. We also show that quasi-stationary states are present
not only below, but also above the critical temperature of the second order
magnetic phase transition of the model. We find that at supercritical
temperatures the lifetime is much larger than at subcritical temperatures.

following their propagation processes in several strengths of a structured
extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF). Comparing our result to observational one
by Akeno Giant Air Shower Array, we constrain the number density of UHE cosmic
ray sources with the small-scale anisotropy. As a result, the source number
density is $\sim 10^{-5} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ with uncertainty of about an order of
magnitude due to the small number of observed events. This hardly depends on
our structured EGMF strength. We also investigate future prospects for this
approarch. The near future observations, such as Pierre Auger Observatory, can
distinguish $10^{-6} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ accurately from the more source densities.
Number of events to discriminate between $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-5} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$
is dependent on the EGMF strength.

  revision",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13183.x",,"astro-ph",,"  The relativistic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect offers a method, independent
of X-ray, for measuring the temperature of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the
hottest systems. Here, using N-body/hydrodynamic simulations of three galaxy
clusters, we compare the two quantities for a non-radiative ICM, and for one
that is subject both to radiative cooling and strong energy feedback from
galaxies. Our study has yielded two interesting results. Firstly, in all cases,
the SZ temperature is hotter than the X-ray temperature and is within ten per
cent of the virial temperature of the cluster. Secondly, the mean SZ
temperature is less affected by cooling and feedback than the X-ray
temperature. Both these results can be explained by the SZ temperature being
less sensitive to the distribution of cool gas associated with cluster
substructure. A comparison of the SZ and X-ray temperatures (measured for a
sample of hot clusters) would therefore yield interesting constraints on the
thermodynamic structure of the intracluster gas.
