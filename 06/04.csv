  The evolution of magnetic fields as revealed by observations of Ap stars in
  open clusters and associations","Accepted by Astronomy & Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20077343",,"astro-ph",,"  The evolution of magnetic fields in Ap stars during the main sequence phase
is presently mostly unconstrained by observation because of the difficulty of
assigning accurate ages to known field Ap stars.
  We are carrying out a large survey of magnetic fields in cluster Ap stars
with the goal of obtaining a sample of these stars with well-determined ages.
In this paper we analyse the information available from the survey as it
currently stands.
  We select from the available observational sample the stars that are probably
(1) cluster or association members and (2) magnetic Ap stars. For the stars in
this subsample we determine the fundamental parameters T_eff, log(L/L_o), and
M/M_o. With these data and the cluster ages we assign both absolute age and
fractional age (the fraction of the main sequence lifetime completed). For this
purpose we have derived new bolometric corrections for Ap stars.
  Magnetic fields are present at the surfaces of Ap stars from the ZAMS to the
TAMS. Statistically for the stars with M > 3 M_o the fields decline with
advancing age approximately as expected from flux conservation together with
increased stellar radius, or perhaps even faster than this rate, on a time
scale of about 3 10^7 yr. In contrast, lower mass stars show no compelling
evidence for field decrease even on a timescale of several times 10^8 yr.
  Study of magnetic cluster stars is now a powerful tool for obtaining
constraints on evolution of Ap stars through the main sequence. Enlarging the
sample of known cluster magnetic stars, and obtaining more precise RMS fields,
will help to clarify the results obtained so far. Further field observations
are in progress.

distributions give rise to generation of either stochastic electric fields (in
the form of Langmuir waves, Buneman instability) or random quasi-static
magnetic fields (Weibel and filamentation instabilities) or both. These
two-stream instabilities are known to play a key role in collisionless shock
formation, shock-shock interactions, and shock-induced electromagnetic
emission. This paper applies the general non-perturbative stochastic theory of
radiation to study electromagnetic emission produced by relativistic particles,
which random walk in the stochastic electric fields of the Langmuir waves. This
analysis takes into account the cumulative effect of uncorrelated Langmuir
waves on the radiating particle trajectory giving rise to angular diffusion of
the particle, which eventually modifies the corresponding radiation spectra. We
demonstrate that the radiative process considered is probably relevant for
emission produced in various kinds of astrophysical jets, in particular, prompt
gamma-ray burst spectra, including X-ray excesses and prompt optical flashes.

electronic orbital (on the scale of the coherence length) coupled to a
standing-wave lattice vibration. This lattice vibration, effectively a bound
phonon, has wavevector 2kf and a near-resonant frequency (on the order of the
Debye frequency) that maximizes the attractive electrostatic interaction energy
with the electronic orbital. The present paper extends this picture to a
coherent standing-wave pattern of electron and phonon waves that traverses the
entire superconductor on the macroscopic scale. These parallel planes form a
diffractive waveguide for electron waves traveling parallel to the planes,
permitting lossless supercurrent. A similar picture may be extended to
unconventional superconductors such as the cuprates, with an array of standing
spin waves rather than phonons. Such coherent lattice vibrations should be
universal and distinctive indicators of the superconducting state, and should
be observable below Tc using standard x-ray and neutron diffraction techniques.
Further implications of this picture are discussed.

the associated renewal processes. We show that close to criticality, under

extended debris discs. We first aim to confirm results obtained for a
single-annulus system, namely that the size distribution in ""real"" debris discs
always departs from the theoretical collisional equilibrium
$dN\proptoR^{-3.5}dR$ power law, especially in the crucial size range of
observable particles (<1cm), where it displays a characteristic wavy pattern.
We also aim at studying how debris discs density distributions, scattered light
luminosity profiles, and SEDs are affected by the coupled effect of collisions
and radial mixing due to radiation pressure affected small grains. The size
distribution evolution is modeled from micron-sized grains to 50km-sized
bodies. The model takes into account the crucial influence of radiation
pressure-affected small grains. We consider the collisional evolution of a
fiducial a=120AU radius disc with an initial surface density in
$\Sigma(a)\propto a^{\alpha}$. We show that the system's radial extension plays
a crucial role: in most regions the collisional and size evolution of the dust
is imposed by small particles on eccentric or unbound orbits produced further
inside the disc. The spatial distribution of small grains strongly departs from
the initial profile, while the bigger objects, containing most of the system's
mass, still follow the initial distribution. This has consequences on the
scattered--light radial profiles which get significantly flatter, and we
propose an empirical law to trace back the distribution of large unseen parent
bodies from the observed profiles. We finally provide empirical formula for the
collisional size distribution and collision timescale that can be used for
future debris disc modeling.

factors relevant to the efficiency of phytoremediation of the plant, have been
investigated via the macro-physiological response of Brassica juncea seedlings

juncea, the logarithmic variation of Cp with Cs and the power-law dependence of
M on Cp. The sum total of these observations indicate that for the metal
accumulator B. juncea with regard to its capacity to accumulate Ni, the overall
metabolic nature of the plant is important; neither rapid biomass increase nor
a high metal concentration capability favor the removal of high metal mass from
the medium, but rather the plant with the moderate photosynthetically driven
biomass growth and moderate metal concentrations demonstrated the ability to
remove the maximum mass of metal from the medium. The implications of these
observations in the context of the perceived need in phytoremediation
engineering to maximize Cp and M simultaneously in the same plant, are
discussed.

finite part of the input amplitude to the end of the chain, where the gate
operations accumulate the information. For an appropriate sequence of

approach unity. We demonstrate the principle of operation of this transfer

unique analytic factor which is the same as that which appears along with the

produces a well-defined metric on fields only when the central charge is
restricted to those of the topological minimal models, and when the conformal
dimensions satisfy h>(c-1)/24. However, the theories considered here have a
continuous spectrum which excludes the degenerate representations appearing in

In particular, we investigate the transport of the shocked dust within the SN

distribution, and the total mass of dust surviving in SNR. We find that the
evolution of the reverse shock, and hence its effect on the processing of the
dust depends on the thickness of the envelope retained by the progenitor star.
Furthermore, the transport and survival of the dust grains depend on their
initial radius, a_{ini}, and composition: For Type II SNRs expanding into the
interstellar medium (ISM) with a density of n_{H,0}=1 cm^{-3}, small grains
with a_{ini} < ~ 0.05 micron are completely destroyed by sputtering in the
postshock flow, while grains with a_{ini}= 0.05--0.2 micron are trapped into
the dense shell behind the forward shock. Very large grains of a_{ini} > ~ 0.2
micron are ejected into the ISM without decreasing their sizes significantly.
We find that the total mass fraction of dust that is destroyed by the reverse
shock ranges from 0.2 to 1.0, depending on the energy of the explosion and the
density of the ambient ISM. The results of our calculations have significant
impact on the abundance pattern of subsequent generation of stars that form in

updated model of the evolution of the solar open magnetic flux. A list of grand
minima and maxima of solar activity is presented for the Holocene (since 9500
BC) and the statistics of both the length of individual events as well as the
waiting time between them are analyzed.
  The occurrence of grand minima/maxima is driven not by long-term cyclic
variability, but by a stochastic/chaotic process. The waiting time distribution
of the occurrence of grand minima/maxima deviates from an exponential
distribution, implying that these events tend to cluster together with long
event-free periods between the clusters. Two different types of grand minima
are observed: short (30--90 years) minima of Maunder type and long ($>$110
years) minima of Sp\""orer type, implying that a deterministic behaviour of the
dynamo during a grand minimum defines its length. The duration of grand maxima
follows an exponential distribution, suggesting that the duration of a grand
maximum is determined by a random process.

of the solar dynamo.

10000 K, the bulky gas would absorb Lyman lines fully, at 50000K it emits
superradiant lines. As superradiance de-excites the atoms strongly, nearly all
available energy is emitted in a few competing modes: Superradiance appears
only for beams which cross the largest column densities; for an observation
from Earth, these beams generate three elliptical hollow cylinders whose bases
are the observed rings; admitting that the Earth is not in a privileged
direction, these cylinders envelope ellipsoidal shells observed, for the
external rings, by photon echoes. For the equatorial ring, the brightness of
the superradiant beams is multiplied by a quasi-resonant induced scattering of
the rays emitted by the star. The de-excitation of atoms by emitted beams cools
the gas strongly, so that ionization decreases fast, the process self
accelerates. The energy of the high radiance rays from the star is strongly
scattered to the ring while the low radiance of the glow which surrounds the

filaments to control their local viscoelastic response by dynamically adjusting
the concentration and type of cross-linker molecules. The microstructure of the
resulting networks mainly determines their mechanical properties. It remains an
important challenge to relate structural transitions to both the molecular
properties of the cross-linking molecules and the mechanical response of the
network. This can be achieved best by well-defined in vitro model systems in
combination with microscopic techniques. Here, we show that with increasing
concentrations of the cross-linker HMM (heavy meromyosin) a transition in the
mechanical network response occurs. At low cross-linker densities the network
elasticity is dominated by the entanglement length of the polymer, while at
high HMM densities the cross-linker distance determines the elastic behavior.
Using microrheology the formation of heterogeneous networks is observed at low
cross-linker concentrations. Micro- and macrorheology both report the same
transition to a homogeneous cross-linked phase. This transition is set by a
constant average cross-linker distance. Thus, the micro- and macromechanical
properties of isotropically cross-linked in vitro actin networks are determined
by only one intrinsic network parameter.

061107 (2005)], the triangular lattice of triangular air holes may allow to
achieve a complete photonic band gap in two-dimensional photonic crystal slabs.
In this work we present a systematic theoretical study of this photonic lattice
in a high-index membrane, and a comparison with the conventional triangular
lattice of circular holes, by means of the guided-mode expansion method whose
detailed formulation is described here. Photonic mode dispersion below and
above the light line, gap maps, and intrinsic diffraction losses of
quasi-guided modes are calculated for the periodic lattice as well as for line-
and point-defects defined therein. The main results are summarized as follows:
(i) the triangular lattice of triangular holes does indeed have a complete
photonic band gap for the fundamental guided mode, but the useful region is
generally limited by the presence of second-order waveguide modes; (ii) the
lattice may support the usual photonic band gap for even modes (quasi-TE
polarization) and several band gaps for odd modes (quasi-TM polarization),
which could be tuned in order to achieve doubly-resonant frequency conversion
between an even mode at the fundamental frequency and an odd mode at the
second-harmonic frequency; (iii) diffraction losses of quasi-guided modes in
the triangular lattices with circular and triangular holes, and in line-defect
waveguides or point-defect cavities based on these geometries, are comparable.
The results point to the interest of the triangular lattice of triangular holes
for nonlinear optics, and show the usefulness of the guided-mode expansion
method for calculating photonic band dispersion and diffraction losses,
especially for higher-lying photonic modes.

semiconductor-based photonic crystal slabs is presented, in which quantum wells
are embedded within the waveguide core layer. A full quantum theory is
developed, by quantizing both the electromagnetic field with a spatial
modulation of the refractive index and the exciton center of mass field in a
periodic piecewise constant potential. The second-quantized hamiltonian of the
interacting system is diagonalized with a generalized Hopfield method, thus
yielding the complex dispersion of mixed exciton-photon modes including losses.
The occurrence of both weak and strong coupling regimes is studied, and it is
concluded that the new eigenstates of the system are described by
quasi-particles called photonic crystal polaritons, which can occur in two
situations: (i) below the light line, when a resonance between exciton and
non-radiative photon levels occurs (guided polaritons), (ii) above the light
line, provided the exciton-photon coupling is larger than the intrinsic
radiative damping of the resonant photonic mode (radiative polaritons). For a
square lattice of air holes, it is found that the energy minimum of the lower
polariton branch can occur around normal incidence. The latter result has
potential implications for the realization of polariton parametric interactions
in photonic crystal slabs.

distributed over 42 dB channel loss and 200 km of optical fibre. We employed
the differential phase shift quantum key distribution (DPS-QKD) protocol
implemented with a 10-GHz clock frequency, and superconducting single photon
detectors (SSPD) based on NbN nanowire. The SSPD offers a very low dark count
rate (a few Hz) and small timing jitter (60 ps full width at half maximum).
These characteristics allowed us to construct a 10-GHz clock QKD system and
thus distribute secure keys over channel loss of 42 dB. In addition, we
achieved a 17 kbit/s secure key rate over 105 km of optical fibre, which is two
orders of magnitude higher than the previous record, and a 12.1 bit/s secure
key rate over 200 km of optical fibre, which is the longest terrestrial QKD yet
demonstrated. The keys generated in our experiment are secure against both
general collective attacks on individual photons and a specific collective
attack on multi-photons, known as a sequential unambiguous state discrimination

reported works, the synthesised samples are too conductive at room temperature

report of a P(E) (polarization versus electric field) loop at room temperature

demonstrate that BiFeO3 is indeed ferroelectric at room-temperature through
evidence by Piezoresponse Force Microscopy and P(E) loops. The polarization is
found to be large, around 60 microC/cm2, a value that has only been reached in
thin films. Magnetic measurements using a SQUID magnetometer and Mossbauer

finite-difference scheme combined with an additional dissipation term. With the
dissipation term parameters in the model can be flexibly chosen so that the von
Neumann stability condition is satisfied. The influence of the various model
parameters on the numerical stability is analyzed and some reference values of
parameter are suggested. The new scheme works for both subsonic and supersonic
flows with a Mach number up to 30 (or higher), which is validated by well-known
benchmark tests. Simulations on Riemann problems with very high ratios
($1000:1$) of pressure and density also show good accuracy and stability.
Successful recovering of regular and double Mach shock reflections shows the
potential application of the lattice Boltzmann model to fluid systems where
non-equilibrium processes are intrinsic. The new scheme for stability can be

nearby galaxies that have already formed. The form of bias that results
possesses some features that are usually described in terms of stochastic
effects, but our model is entirely deterministic once the density field is
specified. Features in the large-scale galaxy power spectrum (such as wiggles
that might in an extreme case mimic the effect of baryons on the primordial

providing a survey of the theoretical development of the field during the last
decade, as well as a detailed discussion of relevant numerical simulations. The
Langevin formulation for the treatment of second-order IPT's is discussed.

finite-size scaling analysis of second-order IPT's is described. Special
attention is devoted to the description of recent progress in the study of
first-order IPT's observed upon catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide and the
reduction of nitrogen monoxide, using lattice gas reaction models. Only brief
comments are given on other reactions such as the oxidation of hydrogen,
ammonia synthesis, etc. Also, a discussion of relevant experiments is presented

Invoking the scaling theory of critical phenomena we provide clear evidence for
this effect. It implies that in type II superconductors there is a 3D to 1D
crossover line Hpi(T). Consequently, below Tc and above Hpi(T) uperconductivity
is confined to cylinders with diameter LHi(1D). Accordingly, there is no

atomic cloud is initially in static equilibrium with the surrounding hot
ionised gas. A shock propagating through the hot medium interacts with the
cloud. As a fast-mode shock propagates through the cloud, the gas behind it
becomes thermally unstable. The $\beta$ value of the gas also becomes much
smaller than the initial value of order unity. These conditions are ideal for
magnetohydrodynamic waves to produce high-density clumps embedded in a rarefied
warm medium. A slow-mode shock follows the fast-mode shock. Behind this shock a
dense shell forms, which subsequently fragments. This is a primary region for
the formation of massive stars. Our simulations show that only weak and

comparable to the QCD corrections to the DY channel. Decays of the doubly

conservation laws are described completely. They are in fact exhausted by local
conservation laws. For any equation from the above class the characteristic
space of local conservation laws is isomorphic to the solution set of the
adjoint equation. Effective criteria for the existence of potential symmetries
are proposed. Their proofs involve a rather intricate interplay between
different representations of potential systems, the notion of a potential
equation associated with a tuple of characteristics, prolongation of the
equivalence group to the whole potential frame and application of multiple dual
Darboux transformations. Based on the tools developed, a preliminary analysis
of generalized potential symmetries is carried out and then applied to
substantiate our construction of potential systems. The simplest potential
symmetries of the linear heat equation, which are associated with single
conservation laws, are classified with respect to its point symmetry group.

  eds. Wijers, R.A.M.J., Kaper, L, and van Eerten, H.J. (Elsevier: Amsterdam)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The association of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with Type Ib/c supernovae
implies that they explode into the winds of their Wolf-Rayet progenitor stars.
Although the evolution of some GRB afterglows is consistent with expansion into
a free wind, there is also good evidence for expansion into a constant density
medium. The evidence includes the evolution of X-ray afterglows (when X-rays
are below the cooling frequency), the evolution of the pre-jet break optical
and X-ray afterglow, and the sharp turn-on observed for some afterglows. Recent
observations of short bursts, which are expected to be interacting with a
constant density medium, provide a check on the standard afterglow model.
Although radio observations do not support the constant density model for long
bursts in some cases, the evidence for constant density interaction is strong.
The most plausible way to produce such a medium around a massive star is to
shock the progenitor wind. This requires a smaller termination shock than would
be expected, possibly due to a high pressure surroundings, a high progenitor
velocity, or the particular evolution leading to a GRB. However, the need for
the termination shock near the deceleration radius cannot be plausibly
accomodated and may indicate that some long bursts have compact binary
progenitors and explode directly into the interstellar medium.

used to define it. However, this variable scale is also captured by the
expansion along the geodesic, and this can be used to obtain a regularized
state space picture by means of a conformal transformation that factors out the
expansion. This leads to the conformal `Hubble-normalized' orthonormal frame
approach which allows one to translate methods and results concerning spatially
homogeneous models into the generic inhomogeneous context, which in turn
enables one to derive the dynamical nature of generic cosmological
singularities. Here we describe this approach and outline the derivation of the
`cosmological billiard attractor,' which describes the generic dynamical
asymptotic behavior towards a generic spacelike singularity. We also compare
the `dynamical systems picture' resulting from this approach with other work on
generic spacelike singularities: the metric approach of Belinskii, Lifschitz,
and Khalatnikov, and the recent Iwasawa based Hamiltonian method used by
Damour, Henneaux, and Nicolai; in particular we show that the cosmological
billiards obtained by the latter and the cosmological billiard attractor form
complementary `dual' descriptions of the generic asymptotic dynamics of generic

virtual sensor models which used data from real sensors (Lam Station sensors,
Optical Emission Spectroscopy, and RF Monitoring) to predict recipe setpoints

performed by comparing predicted recipe and wafer state values with expected
values. Models utilized include linear PLS, Polynomial PLS, and Neural Network
PLS. Prediction of recipe setpoints based upon sensor data provides a
capability for cross-checking that the machine is maintaining the desired
setpoints. Wafer state characteristics such as Line Width Reduction and
Remaining Oxide were estimated on-line using these same process sensors (Lam,
OES, RFM). Wafer-to-wafer measurement of these characteristics in a production
setting (where typically this information may be only sparsely available, if at
all, after batch processing runs with numerous wafers have been completed)
would provide important information to the operator that the process is or is
not producing wafers within acceptable bounds of product quality. Production
yield is increased, and correspondingly per unit cost is reduced, by providing
