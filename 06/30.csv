boundaries (''hulls''), and perimeters for curvature-driven two-dimensional
coarsening, employing a combination of exact analysis and numerical studies,
for various initial conditions. We show that the number of hulls per unit area,
$n_h(A,t) dA$, with enclosed area in the interval $(A,A+dA)$, is described, for
a disordered initial condition, by the scaling function $n_h(A,t) = 2c_h/(A +
\lambda_h t)^2$, where $c_h=1/8\pi\sqrt{3} \approx 0.023$ is a universal
constant and $\lambda_h$ is a material parameter. For a critical initial
condition, the same form is obtained, with the same $\lambda_h$ but with $c_h$
replaced by $c_h/2$. For the distribution of domain areas, we argue that the
corresponding scaling function has, for random initial conditions, the form
$n_d(A,t) = 2c_d (\lambda_d t)^{\tau'-2}/(A + \lambda_d t)^{\tau'}$, where
$c_d=c_h + {\cal O}(c_h^2)$, $\lambda_d=\lambda_h + {\cal O}(c_h)$, and $\tau'
= 187/91 \approx 2.055$. For critical initial conditions, one replaces $c_d$ by
$c_d/2$ (possibly with corrections of ${\cal O}(c_h^2)$) and the exponent is
$\tau = 379/187 \approx 2.027$. These results are extended to describe the
number density of the length of hulls and domain walls surrounding connected
clusters of aligned spins. These predictions are supported by extensive
numerical simulations. We also study numerically the geometric properties of
the boundaries and areas.

One of the key aspects of the detection process is the design of a template
bank that covers the astrophysically pertinent parameter space. In an earlier
paper, we described a template bank that is based on a square lattice. Although
robust, we showed that the square placement is over-efficient, with the
implication that it is computationally more demanding than required. In this
paper, we present a template bank based on an hexagonal lattice, which size is
reduced by 40% with respect to the proposed square placement. We describe the
practical aspects of the hexagonal template bank implementation, its size, and
computational cost. We have also performed exhaustive simulations to
characterize its efficiency and safeness. We show that the bank is adequate to
search for a wide variety of binary systems (primordial black holes, neutron
stars and stellar mass black holes) and in data from both current detectors
(initial LIGO, Virgo and GEO600) as well as future detectors (advanced LIGO and
EGO). Remarkably, although our template bank placement uses a metric arising
from a particular template family, namely stationary phase approximation, we
show that it can be used successfully with other template families (e.g., Pade
resummation and effective one-body approximation). This quality of being
effective for different template families makes the proposed bank suitable for
a search that would use several of them in parallel (e.g., in a binary black
hole search). The hexagonal template bank described in this paper is currently
used to search for non-spinning inspiralling compact binaries in data from the
Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).

candidate sources with the MAGIC telescope, based on the compilation of X-ray
blazars by Donato et al. (2001). The observations took place from December 2004
to March 2006 and cover sources on the northern sky visible under small zenith
distances zd < 30 degrees at culmination. The sensitivity of the search was
planned for detecting X-ray bright F(1 keV) > 2 uJy) sources emitting at least
the same energy flux at 200 GeV as at 1 keV. In order to avoid strong gamma-ray
attenuation close to the energy threshold, the redshift of the sources was
constrained to values z<0.3. Of the fourteen sources observed, 1ES 1218+304 and
1ES 2344+514 have been detected in addition to the known bright TeV blazars Mrk
421 and Mrk 501. A marginal excess of 3.5 sigma from the position of 1ES

advection and stretching by turbulence leads to formation of scalar-enriched
sheets of {\it strongly fluctuating thickness} $\eta_{c}$. The molecular-level
mixing is achieved by diffusion across these sheets (interfaces) separating the
reactants. Since diffusion time scale is $\tau_{d}\propto \eta_{c}^{2}$, the
knowledge of probability density $Q(\eta_{c},Re)$ is crucial for evaluation of
chemical reaction rates. In this paper we derive the probability density
$Q(\eta_{c},Re,Sc)$ and predict a transition in the reaction rate behavior from
${\cal R}\propto \sqrt{Re}$ ($Re\leq 10^{4}$) to the high-Re asymptotics ${\cal
R}\propto Re^{0}$. The theory leads to an approximate universality of
transitional Reynolds number $Re_{tr}\approx 10^{4}$. It is also shown that if

asymptotics. The first one corresponds to the Dirichlet counterterm method,
where local functionals of the boundary metric are added to the bulk action on
top of a Gibbons-Hawking-Myers term that defines the Dirichlet problem in
gravity. The generalized Gibbons-Hawking term can be found in any Lovelock
theory following the Myers' procedure to achieve a well-posed action principle
for a Dirichlet boundary condition on the metric, which is proved to be
equivalent to the Hamiltonian formulation for a radial foliation of spacetime.
In turn, a closed expression for the Dirichlet counterterms does not exist for
a generic Lovelock gravity. The second method supplements the bulk action with
boundary terms which depend on the extrinsic curvature (Kounterterms), and
whose explicit form is independent of the particular theory considered.
  In this paper, we use Dimensionally Continued AdS Gravity (Chern-Simons-AdS
in odd and Born-Infeld-AdS in even dimensions) as a toy model to perform the
first explicit comparison between both regularization prescriptions. This can
be done thanks to the fact that, in this theory, the Dirichlet counterterms can
be readily integrated out from the divergent part of the Dirichlet variation of
the action.
  The agreement between both procedures at the level of the boundary terms
suggests the existence of a general property of any Lovelock-AdS gravity:
intrinsic counterterms are generated as the difference between the Kounterterm
series and the corresponding Gibbons-Hawking-Myers term.

consistent with being dominated by slightly reddened normal stellar
populations. Galaxies that have the most significant PAH and/or hot dust
emission (as inferred from excess 8 micron flux) also tend to have larger
amounts of extinction and/or K-band excess and stronger 24 micron emission, all
of which suggest ongoing star formation activity. We separate the twelve HCGs
in our sample into three types based on the ratio of the group HI mass to
dynamical mass. We find evidence that galaxies in the most gas-rich groups tend
to be the most actively star forming. Galaxies in the most gas-poor groups tend
to be tightly clustered around a narrow range in colors consistent with the
integrated light from a normal stellar population. We interpret these trends as
indicating that galaxies in gas-rich groups experience star formation and/or
nuclear actively until their neutral gas consumed, stripped, or ionized. The
galaxies in this sample exhibit a ``gap'' between gas-rich and gas-poor groups
in infrared color space that is sparsely populated and not seen in the Spitzer
First Look Survey sample. This gap may suggest a rapid evolution of galaxy
properties in response to dynamical effects. These results suggest that the
global properties of the groups and the local properties of the galaxies are
connected.

Then we work out a microscopic approach based on detailed quantum mechanical

induced currents for all partial waves. As expected, the flux tube looses its
stability when particles can penetrate it: we make this condition precise by
calculating the critical value for the product of the flux tube size times the
particle momentum, above which the flux tube dissolves. Lattice static
potentials indicate that flux tubes seem to dissolve at $T>T_{dissolution}

the state of the system to operate. We study the effects of time delays in the
feedback for a protocol that performs an instantaneous maximization of the
center-of-mass velocity in the many particle case. For small delays the
center-of-mass velocity decreases for increasing delays (although not as fast
as in the few particle case). However, for large delays we find the surprising
result that the presence of a delay can improve the flux performance of the
ratchet. In fact, the maximum flux obtained with the optimal periodic protocol
is attained. This implies that the delayed feedback protocol considered can
perform better than its non-delayed counterpart. The improvement of the flux
observed in the presence of large delays is the result of the emergence of a
new dynamical regime where the presence of the delayed feedback stabilizes
quasiperiodic solutions that resemble the solutions obtained in a certain
closed-loop protocol with thresholds. In addition, in this new regime the
system presents multistability, i.e. several quasiperiodic solutions can be
stable for a fixed time delay.

that such gradients imply more metal rich stellar populations in the galaxies'

admits a simple and visual description in terms of the families of
one-dimensional first-return maps, which are constructed using the combination
of asymptotic and numerical techniques. The bifurcation structure of the
continuous system (specifically, the proximity to a degenerate AHB) endows the
Poincare map with distinct qualitative features such as unimodality and the
presence of the boundary layer, where the map is strongly expanding. This
structure of the map in turn explains the bifurcation scenarios in the
continuous system including chaotic mixed-mode oscillations near the border
between the regions of sub- and supercritical AHB. The proposed mechanism
yields the statistical properties of the mixed-mode oscillations in this

gravity does not have a purely affine formulation. We also show that this

the Jordan to the Einstein frame, in which F(R) gravity turns into general
relativity with a scalar field. This peculiar behavior of general relativity,
among relativistic theories of gravitation, with respect to purely affine,

interpolate among phenomenological behaviors at different scales.

emission parameters and the spatial distributions of derived quantities are
examined with respect to luminosity class. The X-ray source locations and their
corresponding temperatures are extracted by using the He-like f/i line ratios
and the H-like to He-like line ratios respectively. Our luminosity class study
reveals line widths increasing with luminosity. Although the majority of the OB
emission lines are found to be symmetric, with little central line
displacement, there is evidence for small, but finite, blue-ward line-shifts
that also increase with luminosity. The spatial X-ray temperature distributions
indicate that the highest temperatures occur near the star and steadily
decrease outward. This trend is most pronounced in the OB supergiants. For the
lower density wind stars, both high and low X-ray source temperatures exist
near the star. However, we find no evidence of any high temperature X-ray
emission in the outer wind regions for any OB star. Since the temperature
distributions are counter to basic shock model predictions, we call this the
""near-star high-ion problem"" for OB stars. By invoking the traditional OB
stellar mass loss rates, we find a good correlation between the fir-inferred

conclude by presenting some possible explanations to the X-ray source problems

accretion onto black hole X-ray binaries (BHBs) is the way the gas accretes at
very low Eddington ratios, in the so-called quiescent regime. While there is
general agreement that the X-rays are produced by a population of high-energy
electrons near to the BH, the controversy comes about in modeling the
contribution from inflowing vs. outflowing particles, and their relative energy
budget. Recent Spitzer observations of three quiescent BHBs have shown evidence
for excess emission with respect to the tail of the companion star between 8-24
micron. We suggest that synchrotron emission from a partially self-absorbed
outflow might be responsible for the observed mid-IR excess, in place of, or in
addition to, thermal emission from circumbinary material. If so, then the jet
synchrotron luminosity exceeds the measured 2-10 keV luminosity by a factor of
a few in these systems. In turn, the mechanical power stored in the jet exceeds
the bolometric X-ray luminosity at least by 4 orders of magnitude. We then
compile the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of A0620-00, the
lowest Eddington-ratio stellar mass BH with a known radio counterpart, by means
of simultaneous radio, optical and X-ray observations, and the archival Spitzer
data. We are able to fit the SED of A0620-00 with a `maximally jet-dominated'
model in which the radio through the soft X-rays are dominated by synchrotron
emission, while the hard X-rays are dominated by inverse Compton at the jet
base. The fitted parameters land in a range of values that is reminiscent of
the Galactic Center super-massive BH Sgr A*. Most notably, the inferred ratio
of the jet acceleration rate to local cooling rates is two orders of magnitude
weaker with respect to higher luminosity, hard state sources.

invisible particle (schematically, $pp\to YY+jets$ followed by each $Y$
decaying via $Y\to \ell X\to \ell\ell'N$ where $N$ is invisible). This topology
arises in many SUSY processes such as squark and gluino production and decay,
not to mention $t\anti t$ di-lepton decays. In the example where the final

and $N$ in the decay chain range from 4 GeV for 2000 events after cuts to 13

Our ability to determine masses comes from considering all the kinematic

necessary for a rigorous estimate of the locus of shock states accessible.
Plastic flow was estimated to contribute a temperature rise of 53K compared
with hydrodynamic flow. Simulations were performed of the operation of the
explosively-driven projectile system used to induce the shock in the Mo sample.
The simulations predicted that the projectile was significantly curved on
impact, and still accelerating. The resulting spatial variations in load,
including radial components of velocity, were predicted to increase the
apparent temperature that would be deduced from the width of the neutron
resonance by 160K. These corrections are sufficient to reconcile the apparent

a useful framework is provided in order to determine the optimal power

frequency selective channels for uplink CDMA. This scenario illustrates the
case of decentralized schemes, where limited information on the network is
available at the terminal. Various receivers are considered, namely the Matched
filter, the MMSE filter and the optimum filter. The goal of this paper is to
derive simple expressions for the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium as the
number of mobiles becomes large and the spreading length increases. To that end
two asymptotic methodologies are combined. The first is asymptotic random
matrix theory which allows us to obtain explicit expressions of the impact of
all other mobiles on any given tagged mobile. The second is the theory of
non-atomic games which computes good approximations of the Nash equilibrium as
the number of mobiles grows.

the first and second resonance regions. The developed model is based upon
conventional NR\gamma-interaction Lagrangians, introducing three form factors
for spin-3/2 resonances and two form factors for spin-1/2 nucleon excitations.
Lagrangian form factors are expressed as dispersionlike expansions with four or
five poles corresponding to the lowest excitations of the mesons \rho(770) and
\omega(782). Correct high-Q^2 form factor behavior predicted by perturbative
QCD is due to phenomenological logarithmic renormalization of electromagnetic
coupling constants and linear superconvergence relations between the parameters
of the meson spectrum. The model is found to be in good agreement with all the
experimental data on Q^2-dependence of the transitions N-\Delta(1232),

the continuum limit of the plane-wave matrix model expanded around the $N$
spherical membrane vacuum. The theory has an infinite number of classical BPS
vacua, labeled by a set of monopole numbers, described by dual supergravity
solutions. We first derive the Lagrangian and its supersymmetry transformations
as a deformation of the usual dimensional reduction of ${\cal N}=1$ gauge
theory in ten dimensions. Then we compute the partition function in the zero 't
Hooft coupling limit in different monopole backgrounds and with chemical
potentials for the $R$-charges. In the trivial vacuum we observe a first-order
Hagedorn transition separating a phase in which the Polyakov loop has vanishing
expectation value from a regime in which this order parameter is non-zero, in
analogy with the four-dimensional case. The picture changes in the monopole
vacua due to the structure of the fermionic effective action. Depending on the
regularization procedure used in the path integral, we obtain two completely
different behaviors, triggered by the absence or the appearance of a
Chern-Simons term. In the first case we still observe a first-order phase
transition, with Hagedorn temperature depending on the monopole charges. In the
latter the large $N$ behavior is obtained by solving a unitary multi-matrix

superconductor YBa2Cu4O8 using a tunnel-diode oscillator technique in pulsed
magnetic fields up to 85T. There is a clear signal, periodic in inverse field,
with frequency 660+/-15T and possible evidence for the presence of two
components of slightly different frequency. The quasiparticle mass is
m*=3.0+/-0.3m_e. In conjunction with the results of Doiron-Leyraud et al. for
YBa2Cu3O6.5, the present measurements suggest that Fermi surface pockets are a
general feature of underdoped copper oxide planes and provide information about
the doping dependence of the Fermi surface.

system interacting with an uncorrelated (zero squeezing) thermal bath. The
resulting dynamics, governed by a Lindblad-type evolution, extends the concept
of a generalized amplitude damping channel, which corresponds to a dissipative
interaction with a purely thermal bath. Here we present the Kraus
representation of this map, which we call the squeezed generalized amplitude
damping channel. As an application of this channel to quantum information, we
study the classical capacity of this channel.

nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs), where the DGLAP-evolving nPDFs
are constrained by nuclear hard process data from deep inelastic $l+A$
scattering (DIS) and the Drell-Yan (DY) process in $p+A$ collisions, and by sum
rules. The main improvements over our earlier work {\em EKS98} are the
automated $\chi^2$ minimization, better controllable fit functions and
possibility for error estimates. The obtained 16-parameter fit to N=514
datapoints is good, $\chi^2/{\rm d.o.f}=0.82$. Fit quality comparison and the
error estimates obtained show that the old {\em EKS98} parametrization is fully
consistent with the present automated reanalysis. Comparison with other global
nPDF analyses is presented as well. Within the DGLAP framework we also discuss
the possibility of incorporating a clearly stronger gluon shadowing, which is
suggested by the RHIC BRAHMS data from d+Au collisions.

unexplored and interesting physics, as well as advanced quantum communication
protocols. The orbital angular momentum of photons is a well suitable discrete
degree of freedom for implementing high-dimensional quantum systems. The
standard method to generate and manipulate such photon modes is to use bulk and
fixed optics. Here the authors demonstrate the utilization of a spatial light
modulator to manipulate the orbital angular momentum of entangled photons
generated in spontaneous parametric downconversion. They show that their setup
allows them to realize photonic entanglement of up to 21 dimensions, which in
principle can be extended to even larger dimensions.

that the irreducible spin-cascade embedded within four-vector is free from the

images by means of a gravitational tidal field, can be used to study the
relation between the matter and galaxy distribution. In this context, weak
lensing has so far only been used for considering a second-order correlation
function that relates the matter density and galaxy number density as a
function of separation. We implement two new, third-order correlation functions
that have recently been suggested in the literature, and apply them to the
Red-Sequence Cluster Survey. We demonstrate that it is possible, even with
already existing data, to make significant measurements of third-order lensing
correlations. We develop an optimised computer code for the correlation
functions. To test its reliability a set of tests are performed. The
correlation functions are transformed to aperture statistics, which allow easy
tests for remaining systematics in the data. In order to further verify the
robustness of our measurement, the signal is shown to vanish when randomising
the source ellipticities. Finally, the lensing signal is compared to crude
predictions based on the halo-model. On angular scales between roughly 1 arcmin
and 11 arcmin a significant third-order correlation between two lens positions
and one source ellipticity is found. We discuss this correlation function as a
novel tool to study the average matter environment of pairs of galaxies.
Correlating two source ellipticities and one lens position yields a less
significant but nevertheless detectable signal on a scale of 4 arcmin. Both
signals lie roughly within the range expected by theory which supports their
cosmological origin.[ABRIDGED]

of ejecta nebulae from individual stars, including the Homunculus associated
with eta Carinae and M1-67, associated with a Wolf-Rayet star. HST has
permitted individual massive stars to be spatially resolved in giant HII
regions located beyond the Local Group, such as NGC 604, plus individual
clusters, dominated by the light of massive stars within starburst galaxies at
larger distances, such as NGC 3125. UV spectroscopy of young, massive clusters
