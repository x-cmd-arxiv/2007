  Paper I","63 pages, 16 figures, submitted to AJ",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present extensive ugrizYHJK photometry and optical spectroscopy of SN
2005gj obtained by the SDSS-II and CSP Supernova Projects, which give excellent
coverage during the first 150 days after the time of explosion. These data show
that SN 2005gj is the second clear case, after SN 2002ic, of a thermonuclear
explosion in a dense circumstellar environment. Both the presence of singly and
doubly ionized iron-peak elements (FeIII and weak SII, SiII) near maximum light
as well as the spectral evolution show that SN 2002ic-like events are Type Ia
explosions. Independent evidence comes from the exponential decay in luminosity
of SN 2005gj, pointing to an exponential density distribution of the ejecta.
The interaction of the supernova ejecta with the dense circumstellar medium is
stronger than in SN 2002ic: (1) the supernova lines are weaker; (2) the Balmer
emission lines are more luminous; and (3) the bolometric luminosity is higher
close to maximum light. The velocity evolution of the Halpha components suggest
that the CSM around SN 2005gj is clumpy and it has a flatter density
distribution compared with the steady wind solution, in agreement with SN
2002ic. An early X-ray observation with Chandra gives an upper-limit on the
mass loss rate from the companion of < 2x10^{-4} Msun/yr.

variety of models: the conventional wounded nucleon model, a model admixing
binary collisions to the wounded nucleons, a model with hot spots, as well as
the hot-spot model where the deposition of energy occurs with a superimposed
probability distribution. We look in detail at the so-called participant
multipole moments, obtained by an averaging procedure where in each event the
system is translated to its center of mass and aligned with the major principal
axis of the ellipse of inertia. Quantitative comparisons indicate substantial
relative effects for eccentricity in variants of Glauber models. On the other
hand, the dependence of the scaled standard deviation of the participant
eccentricity on the chosen model is weak. For all models the values range from
about 0.5 for the central collisions to about 0.3-0.4 for peripheral
collisions, both for the gold-gold and copper-copper collisions. They are
dominated by statistics and change only by 10-15% from model to model. We
provide an approximate analytic expansion for the multipole moments and their
fluctuations given in terms of the fixed-axes moments. For central collisions
and in the absence of correlations it gives the simple formula for the scaled
standard deviation of the participant eccentricity: sqrt(4/pi-1). Similarly, we
obtain expansions for the radial profiles of the multipole distributions. We
investigate the relevance of the shape-fluctuation effects for jet quenching

smooth hydro leads to the known result v_4 ~ v_2^2, and further to the

modulus to bending stiffness increases. Strong bending stiffness favors smooth,
nearly spherical shapes, while weak bending stiffness leads to a sharply
faceted icosahedral shape. Based on the phonon spectrum of a simplified
mass-and-spring model of the shell, we interpret the transition from smooth to
faceted as a soft-mode transition. In contrast to the case of a disclinated
planar network where the transition is sharply defined, the mean curvature of
the sphere smooths the transitition. We define elastic susceptibilities as the
response to forces applied at vertices, edges and faces of an icosahedron. At
the soft-mode transition the vertex susceptibility is the largest, but as the
shell becomes more faceted the edge and face susceptibilities greatly exceed
the vertex susceptibility. Limiting behaviors of the susceptibilities are
analyzed and related to the ridge-scaling behavior of elastic sheets. Our
results apply to virus capsids, liposomes with crystalline order and other
shell-like structures with icosahedral symmetry.

encapsulated in the potential energy landscapes on which the atoms move - an
observation that suggests that the essentials of the dynamics ought to be
determined by the geometry of those landscapes. But what are the principal
geometric features that control the long-time dynamics? We suggest that the key
lies not in the local minima and saddles of the landscape, but in a more global
property of the surface: its accessible pathways. In order to make this notion
more precise we introduce two ideas: (1) a switch to a new ensemble that
removes the concept of potential barriers from the problem, and (2) a way of
finding optimum pathways within this new ensemble. The potential energy
landscape ensemble, which we describe in the current paper, regards the maximum
accessible potential energy, rather than the temperature, as a control
variable. We show here that while this approach is thermodynamically equivalent
to the canonical ensemble, it not only sidesteps the idea of barriers, it
allows us to be quantitative about the connectivity of a landscape. We
illustrate these ideas with calculations on a simple atomic liquid and on the
Kob-Andersen model of a glass-forming liquid, showing, in the process, that the
landscape of the Kob-Anderson model appears to have a connectivity transition
at the landscape energy associated with its mode-coupling transition. We turn
to the problem of finding the most efficient pathways through potential energy
landscapes in our companion paper.

resembles the conventional, adiabatic single neutrino
Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) mechanism, in that neutrinos and
antineutrinos remain in mass eigenstates as they evolve in flavor space. The
other solution is analogous to the regular precession of a gyroscopic pendulum
in flavor space, and has been discussed extensively in recent works. Results of
recent numerical studies are best explained with combinations of these
solutions in the following general scenario: (1) Near the neutrino sphere, the
MSW-like many-body solution obtains. (2) Depending on neutrino vacuum mixing
parameters, luminosities, energy spectra, and the matter density profile,
collective flavor transformation in the nutation mode develops and drives
neutrinos away from the MSW-like evolution and toward regular precession. (3)
Neutrino and antineutrino flavors roughly evolve according to the regular
precession solution until neutrino densities are low. In the late stage of the
precession solution, a stepwise swapping develops in the energy spectra of
$\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu/\nu_\tau$. We also discuss some subtle points regards
adiabaticity in flavor transformation in dense neutrino systems.

between the geometry of the landscape and the long-time dynamical behaviors of
systems such as supercooled liquids. We show, in particular, that the onset of
slow dynamics in such systems is governed directly by the lengths of their
geodesics - the shortest paths through their landscapes within the special
ensemble. The more convoluted and labyrinthine these geodesics are, the slower
that dynamics is. Geodesics in the landscape ensemble have sufficiently
well-defined characteristics that is straightforward to search for them
numerically, a point we illustrate by computing the geodesic lengths for an
ordinary atomic liquid and a binary glass-forming atomic mixture. We find that
the temperature dependence of the diffusion constants of these systems,

which fully incorporates the effects of the black hole spacetime as well as
magnetorotational turbulence that is the primary source of angular momentum
transport in the flow. This simulation shows dramatic differences from
comparable simulations of untilted disks. Accretion onto the hole occurs
predominantly through two opposing plunging streams that start from high
latitudes with respect to both the black-hole and disk midplanes. This is due
to the aspherical nature of the gravitational spacetime around the rotating
black hole. These plunging streams start from a larger radius than would be
expected for an untilted disk. In this regard the tilted black hole effectively
acts like an untilted black hole of lesser spin. Throughout the duration of the
simulation, the main body of the disk remains tilted with respect to the
symmetry plane of the black hole; thus there is no indication of a
Bardeen-Petterson effect in the disk at large. The torque of the black hole
instead principally causes a global precession of the main disk body. In this
simulation the precession has a frequency of $3 (M_\odot/M)$ Hz, a value
consistent with many observed low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations.
However, this value is strongly dependent on the size of the disk, so this
frequency may be expected to vary over a large range.

large $V/t$, to a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice. Using quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC) numerics, we map out the phase diagram of this model at
half-filling. At T=0, we show that this model exhibits a superfluid phase at
small $V/t$ and an insulating phase at large $V/t$, separated by a continuous
quantum phase transition at $V_c/t \approx 19.8$. The insulating phase at T=0
appears to have no conventional broken symmetries, and is thus a uniform Mott
insulator (a `spin liquid' in magnetic language). We characterize this
insulating phase as a uniform $Z_2$ fractionalized insulator from the
topological order in the ground state and estimate its vison gap. Consistent
with this identification, there is no apparent thermal phase transition upon
heating the insulator. The insulating phase instead smoothly crosses over into
the high temperature paramagnet via an intermediate cooperative paramagnetic
regime. We also study the superfluid-to-normal thermal transition for $V <
V_c$. We find that this is a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at small $V/t$ but
changes to a first order transition for $V$ closer to $V_c$. We argue that this
first order thermal transition is consistent with the presence of a nearby
$Z_2$ insulating ground state obtained from the superfluid ground state by

mass transfer rate centered at periastron, we find rates of secular change of
the orbital semi-major axis and eccentricity which are linearly proportional to
the magnitude of the mass transfer rate at periastron. The rates can be
positive as well as negative, so that the semi-major axis and eccentricity can
increase as well as decrease in time. Adopting a delta-function mass-transfer
rate of $10^{-9} M_\sun {\rm yr}^{-1}$ at periastron yields orbital evolution
timescales ranging from a few Myr to a Hubble time or more, depending on the
binary mass ratio and orbital eccentricity. Comparison with orbital evolution
timescales due to dissipative tides furthermore shows that tides cannot, in all
cases, circularize the orbit rapidly enough to justify the often adopted
assumption of instantaneous circularization at the onset of mass transfer. The
formalism presented can be incorporated in binary evolution and population

and dissipative heating on emission lines for number and column densities,
elemental abundances, and ionizations typical for the narrow emission line
regions (NLRs) of Seyfert galaxies. Earlier studies of NLR spectra generally
found good agreement between the observations and the model predictions for
most strong emission lines, such as [O III] $\lambda$5007, [O II]
$\lambda$3727, [N II] $\lambda$6583, [Ne III] $\lambda$3869, and the H and He
recombination lines. Nevertheless, the strengths of lines from species with
ionization potentials greater than that of He$^{+}$(54.4 eV), e.g. N$^{+4}$ and
Ne$^{+4}$, were often under-predicted. Among the explanations suggested for
these discrepancies were (selectively) enhanced elemental abundances and
contributions from shock heated gas. Interestingly, the NLR lines have widths
of several 100 km s$^{-1}$, well in excess of the thermal broadening. If this
is due to micro-turbulence, and the turbulence dissipates within the
emission-line gas, the gas can be heated in excess of that due to
photoionization. We show that the combined effects of turbulence and
dissipative heating can strongly enhance N V $\lambda$1240 (relative to He II
$\lambda$1640), while the heating alone can boost the strength of [Ne V]
$\lambda$3426. We suggest that this effect is present in the NLR, particularly
within $\sim$ 100 pc of the central engine. Finally, since micro-turbulence
would make clouds robust against instabilities generated during acceleration,
it is not likely to be a coincidence that the radially outflowing emission-line
gas is turbulent.

We also highlight the effects arising from mass modification of hadrons in hot
and dense hadronic matter, as well as their quantum statistical consequences:
the appearance of squeezed quantum states and the associated experimental
signatures, i.e., the back-to-back correlations of particle - anti-particle
pairs. We briefly review the theoretical results of these squeezed quanta,
generated by in-medium modified masses, starting from the first indication of
the existence of surprising particle - anti-particle correlations, and ending
by considering the effects of chiral dynamics on these correlation patterns. A
prerequisite for such a signature is the experimental verification that these
theoretically predicted back-to-back correlation of particle anti-particle
pairs are, in fact, observable in high energy heavy ion reactions. Therefore,
the experimental observation of back-to-back correlations in high energy heavy
ion reactions would be a unique signature, proving the existence of in-medium
mass modification of hadronic states. On the other hand, their disappearance at
some threshold centrality or collision energy would indicate that the hadron
formation mechanism would have qualitatively changed: asymptotic hadrons above
such a threshold are not formed from medium modified hadrons anymore, but
rather by new degrees of freedom characterizing the medium. Furthermore, the
disappearance of the squeezed BBC could also serve as a signature of a sudden,
non-equilibrium hadronization scenario from a supercooled quark-gluon plasma
phase.

dynamical structure factor S^{zz}(q,omega) for the anisotropic spin-1/2 chain

model, including the leading irrelevant operators (band curvature terms) which
account for boson decay processes. The coupling constants of the effective
model for finite anisotropy and finite magnetic field are determined exactly by
comparison with corrections to thermodynamic quantities calculated by Bethe
Ansatz. We show that a good approximation for the shape of the on-shell peak of
S^{zz}(q,omega) in the interacting case is obtained by rescaling the result for
free fermions by certain coefficients extracted from the effective Hamiltonian.
In particular, the width of the on-shell peak is argued to scale like delta
omega_{q} ~ q^2 and this prediction is shown to agree with the width of the
two-particle continuum at finite fields calculated from the Bethe Ansatz
equations. An exception to the q^2 scaling is found at finite field and large
anisotropy parameter (near the isotropic point). We also present the
calculation of the high-frequency tail of S^{zz}(q,\omega) in the region delta
omega_{q}<< omega-vq << J using finite-order perturbation theory in the band
curvature terms. Both the width of the on-shell peak and the high-frequency
tail are compared with S^{zz}(q,omega) calculated by Bethe Ansatz for finite

agreement is obtained. Finally, the accuracy of the form factors is checked

the remaining two outflows originate from the millimeter core G34.4+0.23 MM.
Modeling of the SEDs of the mid-IR sources identified 31 young stellar objects

22 sources were identified as probable cluster members based on the presence of

(2007) (for a total of 60 unique stars; the median star for our survey is a 30
Myr K2 star at 25 pc), we consider what distributions of planet masses and
semi-major axes can be ruled out by these data, based on Monte Carlo
simulations of planet populations. We can set this upper limit with 95%
confidence: the fraction of stars with planets with semi-major axis from 20 to
100 AU, and mass >4 M_Jup, is 20% or less. Also, with a distribution of planet
mass of dN/dM ~ M^-1.16 between 0.5-13 M_Jup, we can rule out a power-law
distribution for semi-major axis (dN/da ~ a^alpha) with index 0 and upper
cut-off of 18 AU, and index -0.5 with an upper cut-off of 48 AU. For the
distribution suggested by Cumming et al. (2007), a power-law of index -0.61, we
can place an upper limit of 75 AU on the semi-major axis distribution. At the
68% confidence level, these upper limits state that fewer than 8% of stars have
a planet of mass >4 M_Jup between 20 and 100 AU, and a power-law distribution
for semi-major axis with index 0, -0.5, and -0.61 cannot have giant planets
beyond 12, 23, and 29 AU, respectively. In general, we find that even null
results from direct imaging surveys are very powerful in constraining the
distributions of giant planets (0.5-13 M_Jup) at large separations, but more
work needs to be done to close the gap between planets that can be detected by
direct imaging, and those to which the radial velocity method is sensitive.

the central stellar velocity dispersion of the bulge (sigma) offers insights
into the relationship between the halo and the bulge. We have assembled
integrated H I line widths and central stellar velocity dispersions to study
the v_m-sigma relation for 792 galaxies spanning a broad range of Hubble types.
Contrary to earlier studies based on much smaller samples, we find that the
v_m-sigma relation exhibits significant intrinsic scatter and that its
zeropoint varies systematically with galaxy morphology, bulge-to-disk ratio,
and light concentration, as expected from basic dynamical considerations.
Nucleated but bulgeless late-type spiral galaxies depart significantly from the
v_m-sigma relation. While these results render questionable any attempt to
supplant the bulge with the halo as the fundamental determinant of the central
black hole mass in galaxies, the observed distribution of v_m/sigma, which
depends on both the density profile and kinematic structure of the galaxy,
offers a useful constraint on galaxy formation models. With the aid of a
near-infrared Tully-Fisher relation, we identify a population of otherwise
normal, luminous galaxies that have exceptionally low values of v_m/sigma. We
argue that a significant fraction of the H I gas in these kinematically
anomalous objects is dynamically unrelaxed, having been acquired externally
either through capture from tidal interactions or through cold accretion from
the intergalactic medium.

into the black hole. During the active phase relativistic protons with a
characteristic energy $\sim 6\times 10^{52}$ erg per capture are ejected. Over
90% of these relativistic protons disappear due to proton-proton collisions on
a timescale $\tau_{pp} \sim 10^4$ years in the small central bulge region with
radius $\sim 50$ pc within Sgr A*, where the density is $\ge 10^3$ cm^{-3}. The
gamma-ray intensity, which results from the decay of neutral pions produced by
proton-proton collisions, decreases according to $e^{-t/\tau_{pp}}$, where t is
the time after last stellar capture. Less than 5% of relativistic protons
escaped from the central bulge region can survive and maintain their energy for
>10^7 years due to much lower gas density outside, where the gas density can
drop to $\sim 1$ cm$^{-3}$. They can diffuse to a $\sim 500$ pc region before
disappearing due to proton-proton collisions. The observed diffuse GeV
gamma-rays resulting from the decay of neutral pions produced via collision
between these escaped protons and the gas in this region is expected to be
insensitive to time in the multi-injection model with the characteristic

  He claimed that Jaffe-Ruberman's theorem follows as a corollary since the

incorrect result stated by Casnati and Catanese asserted that the possible

galaxy clustering on galaxy stellar mass, at z~0.85.
  Methods: We measure the projected correlation function wp(rp) for sub-samples
with 0.5<z<1.2 covering different mass ranges between 10^9 and 10^11 Msun. We
quantify in detail the observational selection biases using 40 mock catalogues
built from the Millennium run and semi-analytic models.
  Results: Our simulations indicate that serious incompleteness in mass is
present only for log(M/Msun)<9.5. In the mass range log(M/Msun)=[9.0-9.5], the
photometric selection function of the VVDS misses 2/3rd of the galaxies. The
sample is virtually 100% complete above 10^10 Msun. We present the first direct
evidence for a clear dependence of clustering on the galaxy stellar mass at
z~0.85. The clustering length increases from r0 ~ 2.76 h^-1 Mpc for galaxies
with mass M>10^9 Msun to r0 ~ 4.28 h^-1 Mpc for galaxies more massive than
10^10.5 Msun. At the same time, the slope increases from ~ 1.67 to ~ 2.28.
  A comparison of the observed wp(rp) to local measurements by the SDSS shows
that the evolution is faster for objects less massive than ~10^10.5 Msun. This
is interpreted as a higher dependence on redshift of the linear bias b_L for
the more massive objects. While for the most massive galaxies b_L decreases
from 1.5+/-0.2 at z~0.85 to 1.33+/-0.03 at z~0.15, the less massive population
maintains a virtually constant value b_L~1.3. This result is in agreement with
a scenario in which more massive galaxies formed at high redshift in the
highest peaks of the density field, while less massive objects form at later
epochs from the more general population of dark-matter halos.

inductance ($L$) in series with a capacitatively ($C-$) shunted resistance
($R$) with $R = \sqrt{L/C}$, is known for its non-dispersive dissipative
response, $i.e.,$ with the input impedance $Z_0(\omega) = R$, independent of
the frequency ($\omega$). In this communication we examine the properties of a
novel equivalent network derived iteratively from this 2-terminal network by
replacing everywhere the elemental resistive part $R$ with the whole 2-terminal
network. This replacement suggests a recursion $Z_{n+1}(\omega) =
f(Z_n(\omega))$, with the recursive function $f(z) = (i\omega Lz/i\omega L + z)
+ (z/1+i\omega Cz)$. The recursive map has two fixed points -- an unstable
fixed point $Z_u^\star = 0$, and a stable fixed point $Z_s^\star = R$. Thus,
resistances at the boundary terminating the infinitely iterated network can now
be made arbitrarily small without changing the input impedance $Z_\infty (=
R)$. This, therefore, leads to realizing in the limit $n\to\infty$ an
effectively dissipative network comprising essentially non-dissipative reactive
elements ($L$ and $C$) only. Hence the oxymoron -- resistance without
resistors! This is best viewed as a classical anomaly akin to the one
encountered in turbulence. Possible application as a formal decoherence device
-- the {\it fake channel} -- is briefly discussed for its quantum analogue.

white dwarf. Previously published observations with Ginga and Chandra have also
revealed a broad X-ray orbital modulation, roughly antiphased with the eclipse,
and presumed to be due to absorption in an extended structure near the edge of
an accretion disc. The X-ray pulse profile is generally seen to be
double-peaked, although a single-peaked pulse was seen by RXTE during an
outburst in 1996.We intended to investigate the cause of the broad orbital
modulation in XY Ari to better understand the accretion flow in this system and
other intermediate polars. We observed XY Ari with RXTE and analysed previously
unpublished archival observations of the system made with ASCA and XMM-Newton.
These observations comprise six separate visits and span about ten years. The
various X-ray observations show that the broad orbital modulation varies in
phase and significance, then ultimately disappears entirely in the last few
years. In addition, the X-ray pulse profile shows variations in depth and
shape, and in the recent RXTE observations displays no evidence for changes in
hardness ratio. The observed changes indicates that both the pulse profile and
the orbital modulation are solely due to geometrical effects at the time of the
RXTE observations, rather than phase-dependent variations in photoelectric
absorption as seen previously. We suggest that this is evidence for a
precessing, tilted accretion disc in this system. The precession of the disc
moves structures out of our line of sight both at its outer edge (changing the
orbital modulation) and at its inner edge where the accretion curtains are
anchored (changing the pulse profile).

speeding up mixing has been introduced in [2]. The relaxation-enhancing
property of a flow has been shown to be intimately related to the properties of
the dynamical system it generates. In particular, time-independent flows $u$
such that the operator $u \cdot \nabla$ has sufficiently smooth eigenfunctions
are not relaxation-enhancing. Here we extend results of [2] to time-periodic
flows $u(x,t)$ and in particular show that there exist flows such that for each
fixed time the flow is Hamiltonian, but the resulting time-dependent flow is
relaxation-enhancing. Thus we confirm the physical intuition that time
dependence of a flow may aid mixing. We also provide an extension of our
results to the case of a nonlinear diffusion model. The proofs are based on a
general criterion for the decay of a semigroup generated by an operator of the

This allows us to study the effects of Lyman-Werner radiation on suppressing H2
cooling at low densities as well as the high-density evolution of the
collapsing core in a self-consistent cosmological framework. We find that the
addition of a photodissociating background results in a delay of the collapse
of high density gas at the center of the most massive halo in the simulation
and, as a result, an increase in the virial mass of this halo at the onset of
baryon collapse. We find that, contrary to previous results, Population III
star formation is not suppressed for J$_{21} \geq 0.1$, but occurs even with
backgrounds as high as J$_{21} = 1$. We find that H2 cooling leads to collapse
despite the depressed core molecular hydrogen fractions due to the elevated H2
cooling rates at $T=2-5 \times 10^3$ K. We observe a relationship between the
strength of the photodissociating background and the rate of accretion onto the
evolving protostellar cloud core, with higher LW background fluxes resulting in
higher accretion rates. Finally, we find that the collapsing halo cores in our
simulations do not fragment at densities below $n \sim 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) fossil structures storing total energies ~10^{60}
erg. The original active galacic nucleus (AGN) may be dead but the fossil will
retain its stable configuration resembling the reversed-field pinch (RFP)
encountered in laboratory MHD experiments.
  In an RFP the longitudinal magnetic field changes direction at a critical
distance from the axis, leading to magnetic re-connection there, and to slow
decay of the large-scale RFP field. We show that this field decay induces
large-scale electric fields which can accelerate cosmic rays with an E^{-2}
power-law up to ultra-high energies with a cut-off depending on the fossil
parameters. The cut-off is expected to be rigidity dependent, implying the
observed composition would change from light to heavy close to the cut-off if
one or two nearby AGN fossils dominate. Given that several percent of the
universe's volume may house such slowly decaying structures, these fossils may
even re-energize ultra-high energy cosmic rays from distant/old sources,
offsetting the ``GZK-losses'' due to interactions with photons of the cosmic
microwave background radiation and giving evidence of otherwise undetectable
fossils. In this case the composition would remain light to the highest
energies if distant sources or fossils dominated, but otherwise would be mixed.
It is hoped the new generation of cosmic ray experiments such as the Pierre
Auger Observatory and ultra-high energy neutrino telescopes such as ANITA and
lunar Cherenkov experiments will clarify this.

this situation, the effects of a fully inhomogeneous magnetic field are
scrutinized and constrained with particular attention to harmonics which are
relevant for the region of Doppler oscillations. Depending on the parameters of
the stochastic magnetic field a hump may replace the second peak of the angular
power spectrum. Detectable effects on the Doppler region are then expected only
if the magnetic power spectra have quasi-flat slopes and typical amplitude
(smoothed over a comoving scale of Mpc size and redshifted to the epoch of
gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy) exceeding 0.1 nG. If the magnetic
energy spectra are bluer (i.e. steeper in frequency) the allowed value of the
smoothed amplitude becomes, comparatively, larger (in the range of 20 nG). The
implications of this investigation for the origin of large-scale magnetic
fields in the Universe are discussed. Connections with forthcoming experimental
observations of CMB temperature fluctuations are also suggested and partially

show that the high amplitude limit, when performed on the moment operators,

homodyne detection achieves a measurement of that observable. We also consider,
in a general setting, the possibility of constructing a measurement of a single

level of moment operators of these observables. In this context, we show that
under some natural conditions (each of which is satisfied by the homodyne
detector example), the existence of the moment limits ensures that the
underlying probability measures converge weakly to the probability measure of
the limiting observable. The moment approach naturally requires that the
observables be determined by their moment operator sequences (which does not
automatically happen), and it turns out, in particular, that this is the case

  Series, submitted",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The Vector Spectromagnetograph (VSM) of the NSO's Synoptic Optical Long-Term
Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS) facility is now operational and obtains the
first-ever vector magnetic field measurements of the entire visible solar
hemisphere. To fully exploit the unprecedented SOLIS/VSM data, however, one
must first address two critical problems: first, the study of solar active
regions requires an automatic, physically intuitive, technique for
active-region identification in the solar disk. Second, use of active-region
vector magnetograms requires removal of the azimuthal $180^o$-ambiguity in the
orientation of the transverse magnetic field component. Here we report on an
effort to address both problems simultaneously and efficiently. To identify
solar active regions we apply an algorithm designed to locate complex,
flux-balanced, magnetic structures with a dominant E-W orientation on the disk.
Each of the disk portions corresponding to active regions is thereafter
extracted and subjected to the Nonpotential Magnetic Field Calculation (NPFC)
method that provides a physically-intuitive solution of the 180-degree
ambiguity. Both algorithms have been integrated into the VSM data pipeline and
operate in real time, without human intervention. We conclude that this
combined approach can contribute meaningfully to our emerging capability for
full-disk vector magnetography as pioneered by SOLIS today and will be carried
out by ground-based and space-borne magnetographs in the future.

In this way we prove that every solution $u$ is locally Lipschitz continuous

irreducible components of the divisor are of genus zero, then Voevodsky's
formalism allows us to construct certain one-extensions of Chow motives, as
canonical sub-quotients of the motive with compact support of the smooth part
of the surface. Specializing to Hilbert--Blumenthal surfaces, we recover a
motivic interpretation of a recent construction of A. Caspar.

II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. The search is divided into three-lepton
and four-or-more-lepton data samples. We observe six events in the three-lepton
sample and zero events in the >=4-lepton sample. Both numbers of events are
consistent with standard model background expectations. Within the framework of
an R-parity violating supergravity model, the results are interpreted as mass
limits on the lightest neutralino and chargino particles. For one particular
choice of model parameters, the limits are M_neutralino > 110 GeV/c^{2} and
M_chargino > 203 GeV/c^{2} at 95% confidence level; the variation of these mass
limits with model parameters is presented.

generalizes a result of Gromov for simply connected surfaces.
  We study the isoperimetric problem in dimension 3. We show that if the

"0706.4451","Victor Yakhot","Victor Yakhot","Turbulence models generator",,,,,"nlin.CG physics.flu-dyn",,"  In this paper we explore a possibility that all transport turbulent models
are contained in a coarse-grained kinetic equation. Building on a recent work
by H.Chen et al (2004), we account for fluctuations of a single -point
probability density in turbulence, by introducing a``two-level'' (${\bf
c,v}$)-phase-space, separating microscopic (${\bf c'\equiv c_{micro}= c-v}$)
and hydrodynamic (${\bf v'=v-V}$) modes. Unlike traditional kinetic theories,
with hydrodynamic approximations derived in terms of small deviations from
thermodynamic equilibrium, the theory developed in this work, is based on a
far- from -equilibrium isotropic and homogeneous turbulence as an unperturbed
state. The expansion in dimensionless rate of strain leads to a new class of
turbulent models, including the well-known ${\cal K}-{\cal E}$, Reynolds stress
and all possible nonlinear models. The role of interaction of the fluxes in
physical space with the energy flux across the scales, not present in standard
modeling, is demonstrated on example of turbulent channel flow. To close the
system, neither equation for turbulent kinetic energy nor information on
pressure-velocity correlations, contained in the derived coarse-grained kinetic
equation, are needed.
