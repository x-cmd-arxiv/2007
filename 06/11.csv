supplies one means, but protoplanetary disk gas is typically too poorly ionized
to be magnetically active. Here we show that the MRI can, in fact, explain
observed accretion rates for the sub-class of T Tauri disks known as
transitional systems. Transitional disks are swept clean of dust inside rim
radii of ~10 AU. Stellar coronal X-rays ionize material in the disk rim,
activating the MRI there. Gas flows from the rim to the star, at a rate limited
by the depth to which X-rays ionize the rim wall. The wider the rim, the larger
the surface area that the rim wall exposes to X-rays, and the greater the
accretion rate. Interior to the rim, the MRI continues to transport gas; the
MRI is sustained even at the disk midplane by super-keV X-rays that Compton
scatter down from the disk surface. Accretion is therefore steady inside the
rim. Blown out by radiation pressure, dust largely fails to accrete with gas.
Contrary to what is usually assumed, ambipolar diffusion, not Ohmic
dissipation, limits how much gas is MRI-active. We infer values for the
transport parameter alpha on the order of 0.01 for GM Aur, TW Hyd, and DM Tau.
Because the MRI can only afflict a finite radial column of gas at the rim, disk
properties inside the rim are insensitive to those outside. Thus our picture
provides one robust setting for planet-disk interaction: a protoplanet interior
to the rim will interact with gas whose density, temperature, and transport
properties are definite and decoupled from uncertain initial conditions. Our
study also supplies half the answer to how disks dissipate: the inner disk
drains from the inside out by the MRI, while the outer disk photoevaporates by
stellar ultraviolet radiation.

shown that an LC(RC)-loop is a left(right) universal loop. But an LC(RC)-loop
is a universal loop if and only if it is a right(left) universal loop. It is
observed that not all RC-loops or LC-loops or C-loops are universal loops. But
if an RC-loop(LC-loop, C-loop) is universal, then it is a right Bol loop(left
Bol loop, Moufang loop) respectively. If a loop and its right or left isotope
are commutative then the loop is a C-loop if and only if its right or left
isotope is a C-loop. If a C-loop is central square and its right or left
isotope is an alternative central square loop, then the latter is a C-loop.
Necessary and sufficient condition for an LC-loop(RC-loop) to be a
left(right)G-loop is established. Consequently, necessary and sufficient
conditions for an LC-loop, and an RC-loop to be a G-loop are established. A

telescope and a suite of larger aperture ground-based telescopes. An optical
afterglow was detected 20 s after the burst, the earliest rest-frame detection
of optical emission from any GRB. Spectroscopy performed with the VLT about 13
hours after the trigger shows a continuum break at lambda ~ 8070 A produced by
neutral hydrogen absorption at z~5.6. We also detect an absorption line at 8158
A which we interpret as SiII at z=5.467. Hence, GRB 060927 is the second most
distant GRB with a spectroscopically measured redshift. The shape of the red
wing of the spectral break can be fitted by a damped Lyalpha profile with a
column density with log(N_HI/cm^-2) ~ 22.5. We discuss the implications of this
work for the use of GRBs as probes of the end of the dark ages and draw three
main conclusions: i) GRB afterglows originating from z>6 should be relatively
easy to detect from the ground, but rapid NIR monitoring is necessary to ensure
that they are found; ii) The presence of large HI column densities in some GRBs
host galaxies at z>5 makes the use of GRBs to probe the reionization epoch via
spectroscopy of the red damping wing challenging; iii) GRBs appear crucial to
locate typical star-forming galaxies at z>5 and therefore the type of galaxies
responsible for the reionization of the universe.

that the HI gas is distributed in the form of clumps or clouds. The HI clouds
and clumps have been identified using a thresholding method with three separate
brightness temperature thresholds ($T_b$). Each catalog of HI cloud candidates
shows a power law relationship between the sizes and the velocity dispersions
of the clouds roughly following the Larson Law scaling $\sigma_v \propto
R^{0.5}$, with steeper indices associated with dynamically hot regions. The
clouds in each catalog have roughly constant virial parameters as a function
mass suggesting that that the clouds are all in roughly the same dynamical
state, but the values of the virial parameter are significantly larger than
unity showing that turbulent motions dominate gravity in these clouds. The mass
distribution of the clouds is a power law with differential indices between
-1.6 and -2.0 for the three catalogs. In contrast, the distribution of mean
surface densities is a log-normal distribution.

E 76, 061601 (2007)","10.1103/PhysRevE.76.061601",,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  We study numerically finite-size corrections in scaling relations for
roughness distributions of various interface growth models. The most common
relation, which considers the average roughness $<w_2>$ as scaling factor, is
not obeyed in the steady states of a group of ballistic-like models in 2+1
dimensions, even when very large system sizes are considered. On the other
hand, good collapse of the same data is obtained with a scaling relation that
involves the root mean square fluctuation of the roughness, which can be
explained by finite-size effects on second moments of the scaling functions. We
also obtain data collapse with an alternative scaling relation that accounts
for the effect of the intrinsic width, which is a constant correction term
previously proposed for the scaling of $<w_2>$. This illustrates how
finite-size corrections can be obtained from roughness distributions scaling.
However, we discard the usual interpretation that the intrinsic width is a
consequence of high surface steps by analyzing data of restricted
solid-on-solid models with various maximal height differences between
neighboring columns. We also observe that large finite-size corrections in the
roughness distributions are usually accompanied by huge corrections in height
distributions and average local slopes, as well as in estimates of scaling
exponents. The molecular-beam epitaxy model of Das Sarma and Tamborenea in 1+1
dimensions is a case example in which none of the proposed scaling relations
works properly, while the other measured quantities do not converge to the
expected asymptotic values. Thus, although roughness distributions are clearly
better than other quantities to determine the universality class of a growing
system, it is not the final solution for this task.

rate of coherent atom-photon coupling can be made larger than all decoherence
rates of the system. For single atoms, this strong coupling regime of cavity
quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has been the subject of spectacular experimental
advances, and great efforts have been made to control the coupling rate by
trapping and cooling the atom towards the motional ground state, which has been
achieved in one dimension so far. For N atoms, the three-dimensional ground
state of motion is routinely achieved in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates
(BECs), but although first experiments combining BECs and optical cavities have
been reported recently, coupling BECs to strong-coupling cavities has remained
an elusive goal. Here we report such an experiment, which is made possible by
combining a new type of fibre-based cavity with atom chip technology. This
allows single-atom cQED experiments with a simplified setup and realizes the
new situation of N atoms in a cavity each of which is identically and strongly
coupled to the cavity mode. Moreover, the BEC can be positioned
deterministically anywhere within the cavity and localized entirely within a
single antinode of the standing-wave cavity field. This gives rise to a
controlled, tunable coupling rate, as we confirm experimentally. We study the
heating rate caused by a cavity transmission measurement as a function of the
coupling rate and find no measurable heating for strongly coupled BECs. The
spectrum of the coupled atoms-cavity system, which we map out over a wide range
of atom numbers and cavity-atom detunings, shows vacuum Rabi splittings
exceeding 20 gigahertz, as well as an unpredicted additional splitting which we
attribute to the atomic hyperfine structure.

Here we thoroughly outline the elastic scattering theory for the
two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions in the presence of an axially symmetric
potential. While the massless limit is relevant for pristine graphene, keeping
finite mass allows for generalizations onto situations with broken symmetry
between the two sublattices, and provides a link to the scattering theory of
electrons in a parabolic band. We demonstrate that the Dirac theory requires
short-distance regularization for potentials which are more singular than 1/r.
The formalism is then applied to scattering off a smooth short-ranged
potential. Next we consider the Coulomb potential scattering, where the Dirac
theory is consistent for a point scatterer only for the effective impurity
strength below 1/2. From the scattering phase shifts we obtain the exact
Coulomb transport cross-section in terms of the impurity strength. The results
are relevant for transport in graphene in the presence of impurities that do
not induce scattering between the Dirac points in the Brillouin zone.

valued for research because they offer controls for unmeasured individual

approaches, which treat individual heterogeneity as part of the model error
term and use generalized least squares to estimate model parameters, are often
criticized because correlation between unobserved individual effects and other
model variables can lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates.
Starting with an examination of the relationship between random effects and
fixed effects estimators in the standard unobserved effects model, this article
demonstrates through analysis and simulation that the mixed model approach has
a ``bias compression'' property under a general model for individual
heterogeneity that can mitigate bias due to uncontrolled differences among
individuals. The general model is motivated by the complexities of longitudinal
student achievement measures, but the results have broad applicability to
longitudinal modeling.

many tutoring systems specific to a specific domain that, because of their

development of a generic tutoring system. AnITA, as a stand-alone application,
has been developed and implemented particularly for this purpose. However, in
the testing phase, we discovered that this architecture did not fully match the
user's intuitive understanding of the use of a learning tool. Therefore, AnITA
has been redesigned to exclusively work as a client/server application and
renamed to AnITA2. This paper discusses the evolvements made on the AnITA

re-use in any domain. Two experiments were conducted, and the results are

clear signal of the intrinsic correlations between the galaxy spins and the
intermediate principal axes of the tidal shears. The null hypothesis of no
correlation is rejected at 99.99 % confidence level. We also investigate the
dependence of the intrinsic correlations on the galaxy morphological type and
the environment. It is found that (i) the intrinsic correlation depends weakly
on the morphological type of the spiral galaxies but tends to decrease slightly
as the type increases; (ii) it is stronger in the high-density regions than in
the low-density regions. The observational result is quantitatively consistent
with analytic prediction based on the tidal torque theory. It is concluded that
the galaxy spin orientations may provide in principle a new complimentary probe
of the dark matter distribution.

notion of approximate joint measurement is introduced. Optimal approximate

measurements. The marginal observables found to be optimal approximators are
generally not among the coarse-grainings of the observables to be approximated.

$\bar{E}$ of the frame bundle over a given space-time, that is responsible for
this pathology. A singularity is called malicious if the equivalence class
$[p_0]$ related to the singularity remains in close contact with all other
equivalence classes, i.e., if $p_0 \in \mathrm{cl}[p]$ for every $p \in E$. We
formulate conditions for which such a situation occurs. The differential
structure of any space-time with malicious singularities consists only of
constant functions which means that, from the topological point of view,
everything collapses to a single point. It was noncommutative geometry that was
especially devised to deal with such situations. A noncommutative algebra on
$\bar{E}$, which turns out to be a von Neumann algebra of random operators,
allows us to study probabilistic properties (in a generalized sense) of
malicious singularities. Our main result is that, in the noncommutative regime,
even the strongest singularities are probabilistically irrelevant.

convolution allows to deduce, from the individual singular distributions, the
singular distribution of a sum of independent unitarily invariant rectangular

these free convolutions on the whole real line. More specifically, we try to
find continuous semigroups $(\mu_t)$ of probability measures such that $\mu_0$
is the Dirac mass at zero and such that for all positive $t$ and all

for $\mu$ in a continuous rectangular-convolution-semigroup, the rectangular
convolution of $\mu$ with $\nu$ either has an atom at the origin or doesn't put
any mass in a neighborhood of the origin, thus the expected property does not
hold. However, we give sufficient conditions for analyticity of the density of

  mixing with femtosecond laser pulses","12 pages, 5 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We propose a method to reconstruct the vibrational quantum state of molecules
excited by a general excitation laser pulse. Unlike existing methods, we do not
require the molecules before excitation to be in a pure state, allowing us to
treat the important case of initially thermally excited molecules. Even if only
a single initial level is appreciably populated, initial levels with small
populations can still give major contributions to the unknown vibrational
state, making it essential to take them into account. In addition to the
excitation pulse, the method uses two incident, short laser pulses in a
non-co-linear geometry to create four-wave mixing in the molecules. The
measurements used in the reconstruction are spectra of the outgoing four-wave
mixing pulse at different time delays of the excitation laser pulse. An
important point is that the method does not require detailed knowledge of
molecular transition moments between excited states nor of any of the incoming
laser pulses, but circumvents this requirement by using one or more calibration
laser pulses in a separate experiment either before or after the main data are
recorded. The only requirements for the calibration laser pulses are that the
constant parts of their spectrums should together cover the spectral range of
the excitation laser pulse, and the constant part of each should have
sufficient spectral overlap with one other calibration pulse to populate two of
the same levels. Finally, we discuss the extension of the reconstruction method
in this paper to more general situations, hereby presenting the new idea of
quantum state reconstruction through perturbations with calibration.

approximation of the difference between the real change-point and its

slaving of protein dynamics. Moreover, a significant increase in the relaxation

standard map can be estimated analytically. The mean exponent averaged over the
entire phase space behaves quite differently from all the other cumulants.
Whereas the mean carries information about the strength of the interaction, and
only indirect information about dynamical correlations, the higher cumulants
carry information about dynamical correlations and essentially no information
about the interaction strength. In particular, the variance and higher
cumulants of the exponent are very sensitive to dynamical correlations and
easily detect the presence of very small islands of regular motion via their
anomalous time-scalings. The average of the stability matrix' inverse trace is
even more sensitive to the presence of small islands and has a seemingly
fractal behavior in the standard map parameter. The usual accelerator modes and
the small islands created through double saddle node bifurcations, which come
halfway between the positions in interaction strength of the usual accelerator
modes, are clearly visible in the variance, whose time scaling is capable of
detecting the presence of islands as small as 0.01% of the phase space. We
study these quantities with a local approximation to the trace of the stability
matrix which significantly simplifies the numerical calculations as well as
allows for generalization of these methods to higher dimensions. We also
discuss the nature of this local approximation in some detail.

the system to operate with the aim of maximizing the performance of the system.
In this paper we investigate the effects of a time delay in the feedback for a
protocol that performs an instantaneous maximization of the center-of-mass
velocity. For the one and the few particle cases the flux decreases with
increasing delay, as an effect of the decorrelation of the present state of the
system with the information that the controller uses, but the delayed
closed-loop protocol succeeds to perform better than its open-loop counterpart
provided the delays are smaller than the characteristic times of the Brownian
ratchet. For the many particle case, we also show that for small delays the
center-of-mass velocity decreases for increasing delays. However, for large
delays we find the surprising result that the presence of the delay can improve
the performance of the nondelayed feedback ratchet and the flux can attain the
maximum value obtained with the optimal periodic protocol. This phenomenon is
the result of the emergence of a dynamical regime where the presence of the
delayed feedback stabilizes one quasiperiodic solution or several
(multistability), which resemble the solutions obtained in the so-called
threshold protocol. Our analytical and numerical results point towards the
feasibility of an experimental implementation of a feedback controlled ratchet
that performs equal or better than its optimal open-loop version.

embedding into an etale version of Voevodsky's triangulated category of
geometric motives. Our second main result is that this full embedding ""almost""
has a left adjoint, that we call \LAlb. Applied to the motive of a variety we
thus get a bounded complex of 1-motives, that we compute fully for smooth
varieties and partly for singular varieties. As an application we give motivic
proofs of Roitman type theorems (in characteristic 0).

analysis gives insights into the physics at work in young stellar coronae. The
Orion Nebula Cluster offers a unique opportunity to study large samples of
young low mass stars. This work is part of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep project
(COUP), an ~10 day long X-ray observation of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC).
Aims. Our main goal is to statistically characterize the flare-like variability
of 165 low mass (0.1-0.3 M_sun) ONC members in order to test and constrain the
physical scenario in which flares explain all the observed emission. Methods.
We adopt a maximum likelihood piece-wise representation of the observed X-ray
light curves and detect flares by taking into account both the amplitude and
time derivative of the count-rate. We then derive the frequency and energy
distribution of the flares. Results. The high energy tail of the energy
distribution of flares is well described by a power-law with index 2.2. We test
the hypothesis that light curves are built entirely by overlapping flares with
a single power law energy distribution. We constrain the parameters of this
simple model for every single light curve. The analysis of synthetic light
curves obtained from the model indicates a good agreement with the observed
data. Comparing low mass stars with stars in the mass interval (0.9-1.2M_sun),
we establish that, at ~1 Myr, low mass and solar mass stars of similar X-ray
luminosity have very similar flare frequencies. Conclusions. Our observational
results are consistent with the following model/scenario: the light curves are
entirely built by over- lapping flares with a power-law intensity distribution;
the intense flares are individually detected, while the weak ones merge and
form a pseudo-quiescent level, which we indicate as the characteristic level.

  Mexico, July 2007",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Traditionally, longitudinal shower profiles are reconstructed in fluorescence
light experiments by treating the Cherenkov light contribution as background.
Here we will argue that, due to universality of the energy spectra of electrons
and positrons, both fluorescence and Cherenkov light can be used simultaneously
as signal to infer the longitudinal shower development. We present a new
profile reconstruction method that is based on the analytic least-square
solution for the estimation of the shower profile from the observed light
signal and discuss the extrapolation of the profile with a Gaisser-Hillas
function.
