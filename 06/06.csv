that starts from (0,0), consists of steps (1,a) and (1,-b), stays above the

encountered in bioinformatics, in the analysis of similarity search algorithms.
They are also related to certain models of Lorentzian gravity in theoretical
physics. We first show that the language on a two letter alphabet that
naturally encodes culminating paths is not context-free. Then, we focus on the
enumeration of culminating paths. A step by step approach, combined with the
kernel method, provides a closed form expression for the generating fucntion of
culminating paths ending at a (generic) height k. In the case a=b, we derive
from this expression the asymptotic behaviour of the number of culminating
paths of length n. When a>b, we obtain the asymptotic behaviour by a simpler

culminating paths. Finally, we study the uniform random generation of
culminating paths via various methods. The rejection approach, coupled with a
symmetry argument, gives an algorithm that is linear when a>= b, with no
precomputation stage nor non-linear storage required. The choice of the best
algorithm is not as clear when a<b. An elementary recursive approach yields a
linear algorithm after a precomputation stage involving O(n^3) arithmetic
operations, but we also present some alternatives that may be more efficient in

incorporating effects due to strong fields in the vicinity of neutron star

the compact bodies as point particles with nonstandard, velocity dependent
interactions parametrized by dimensionless ""sensitivities"". Effective
post-Newtonian equations of motion for the bodies and the radiation damping

coupling constants cannot yet be stated. It is shown, however, that strong
field effects will be negligible given current observational uncertainties if
the dimensionless couplings are less than roughly 0.01 and two conditions that
match the PPN parameters to those of pure general relativity are imposed. In
this case, weak field results suffice and imply one further condition on the
couplings. Thus, there exists a one-parameter family of Einstein-aether

unextendible product bases. Here we take as entanglement measure the Schmidt
rank, and determine, for every pair of local dimensions dA and dB, and every r,
the largest dimension of a subspace consisting only of entangled states of
Schmidt rank r or larger. This exact answer is a significant improvement on the
best bounds that can be obtained using random subspace techniques. We also
determine the converse: the largest dimension of a subspace with an upper bound

point is the necessity to use in parallel the \lambda and \tau gauge frames,

prepotentials, valid at any radial distance from the horizon, which reproduces
all the attractors of the four dimensional N>2 theories. Far from the horizon,
however, for N-even our ansatz poses a constraint on one of the U-duality
invariants for the non-BPS solutions with Z \neq 0. We discuss a possible
extension of our considerations to the non extremal case.

evolution of their progenitor stars and the constitutive physics of the
remnants. Our motivation is a recent suggestion of Werner & Herwig (2006) that
previous evolution should be important in shaping the final post--AGB track and
the persisting discrepancy between asteroseismological and spectroscopical mass
determinations. This work is thus complementary to our previous work (Miller
Bertolami & Althaus 2006) and intends to shed some light on the uncertainty
behind the evolutionary tracks presented there. We compute full evolutionary
models for PG1159 stars taking into account different extramixing
(overshooting) efficiencies and lifetimes on the TP-AGB during the progenitor
evolution. We also assess the effect of possible differences in the opacities
and equation of state by artificially changing them before the PG1159 stage.
Also comparisons are made with the few H-deficient post--AGB tracks available
in the literature. Contrary to our expectations, we found that previous
evolution is not a main factor in shaping H--deficient post--AGB tracks.
Interestingly enough, we find that only an increase of $\sim50%$ in the
intershell opacities at high effective temperatures may affect the tracks as to
reconcile spectroscopic and asteroseismologic mass determinations. This forces
us to conclude that our previous tracks (Miller Bertolami & Althaus 2006) are
robust enough as to be used for spectroscopic mass determinations, unless
opacities in the intershell region are substantially different. Our results,
then, call for an analysis of possible systematics in the usually adopted
asteroseismological mass determination methods.

decaying as $\order(1/[n m])$. We develop and analyze the performance of
various decentralized protocols in comparison to this centralized
gold-standard. First, we describe a decentralized protocol based on $k =

a decentralized protocol based on only a single bit ($k=1$) of feedback. For
step sizes independent of $m$, it achieves an asymptotic MSE of order
$\order[1/(n \sqrt{m})]$, whereas for step sizes decaying as $1/\sqrt{m}$, it
achieves the same $\order(1/[n m])$ decay in MSE as the centralized optimum.

promising tracer of the underlying dark matter distribution, understanding the
distribution of LRGs within clusters is an important issue.
  Our main findings include:
  1. The halo occupation distribution of LRGs inside our cluster sample is
$N(M) = k\times (M/10^{14})^{a}$ where $a=0.620\pm 0.105 $ and $k=1.425\pm0.285
$ assuming a Poisson distribution for $N(M)$.
  2. The halo occupation distribution of LRGs ($N(M)$) and the satellite
distribution of LRGs ($N-1(M)$) are both consistent with being Poisson. To be
more quantitative, we find $Var(N)/<N>= 1.428\pm 0.351$ and $Var(N-1)/<N-1> =
1.823 \pm 0.496$

gives a concentration of $17.5^{+7.1}_{-4.3}$ ($6.0^{+3.2}_{-1.9}$) including
(excluding) BLRGs (Brightest LRGs).

on Lambda, k and c_R, either a first or second order phase transition can occur
in the cosmological scenario. In the first case, an instantonic Euclidean
solution exists and connects via tunneling the inflationary evolution to
another cosmological branch. The latter starts with a big bang and, in the case

than 0.1 AU around ~1% of solar-type stars; counting planets with $a$ as large

examination of the distribution of semi-major axes shows that there is a clear
excess of planets with orbital periods around 3 or 4 days, corresponding to
a~0.03$ AU, with a sharp cutoff at shorter periods (see Figure 1). It is
believed that Jupiter mass planets form at large distances from their parent
stars; some fraction then migrate in to produce the short period objects. We
argue that a significant fraction of the `hot Jupiters' (a<0.1 AU) may arise in
binary star systems in which the orbit of the binary is highly inclined to the
orbit of the planet. Mutual torques between the two orbits drive down the
minimum separation or periapse r_p between the planet and its host star (the
Kozai mechanism). This periapse collapse is halted when tidal friction on the
planet circularizes the orbit faster than Kozai torque can excite it. The same
friction then circularizes the planet orbit, producing hot Jupiters with the
peak of the semimajor axis distribution lying around 3 days. For the observed
distributions of binary separation, eccentricity and mass ratio, roughly 2.5%
of planets with initial semimajor axis a_p ~ 5au will migrate to within 0.1au

originating from small-scale reconnection events can drive micro-instabilities
that constitute a possible source for the excitation of ion-cyclotron waves. In
order to study ion beam-driven electromagnetic instabilities, the multi-fluid
model in the low-beta coronal plasma is used. While neglecting the electron
inertia this model allows one to take into account ion-cyclotron wave effects
that are absent from the one-fluid MHD model. Realistic models of density and
temperature as well as a 2-D analytical magnetic field model are used to define
the background plasma in the open-field funnel region of a polar coronal hole.
Considering the WKB approximation, a Fourier plane-wave linear mode analysis is
employed in order to derive the dispersion relation. Ray-tracing theory is used
to compute the ray path of the unstable wave as well as the evolution of the
growth rate of the wave while propagating in the coronal funnel. We demonstrate
that, in typical coronal holes conditions and assuming realistic values of the

assuming the phase space may be divided into time independent, locally ergodic

microstates are given by the standard Boltzmann weights. In contrast to
previous energy landscape treatments, that have been developed specifically for
the glass transition, we do not impose an a priori knowledge of the
inter-domain population distribution. Assuming that these domains are robust
with respect to small changes in thermodynamic state variables we derive a
variety of fluctuation formulae for these systems. We verify our theoretical
results using molecular dynamics simulations on a model glass forming system.
Non-equilibrium Transient Fluctuation Relations are derived for the
fluctuations resulting from a sudden finite change to the system's temperature
or pressure and these are shown to be consistent with the simulation results.
The necessary and sufficient conditions for these relations to be valid are
that the domains are internally populated by Boltzmann statistics and that the
domains are robust. The Transient Fluctuation Relations thus provide an
independent quantitative justification for the assumptions used in our
statistical mechanical treatment of these systems.

increasing the rate of radiative cooling. In star-forming environments,
enhanced cooling can potentially lead to fragmentation and the formation of
low-mass stars, where metal-free gas-clouds have been shown not to fragment.
Adding metal cooling to numerical simulations has traditionally required a
choice between speed and accuracy. We introduce a method that uses the
sophisticated chemical network of the photoionization software, Cloudy, to
include radiative cooling from a complete set of metals up to atomic number 30
(Zn) that can be used with large-scale three-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations. Our method is valid over an extremely large temperature range (10
K < T < 10^8 K), up to hydrogen number densities of 10^12 cm^-3. At this
density, a sphere of 1 Msun has a radius of roughly 40 AU. We implement our
method in the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) hydrodynamic/N-body code, Enzo.
Using cooling rates generated with this method, we study the physical
conditions that led to the transition from Population III to Population II star
formation. While C, O, Fe, and Si have been previously shown to make the
strongest contribution to the cooling in low-metallicity gas, we find that up
to 40% of the metal cooling comes from fine-structure emission by S, when solar
abundance patterns are present. At metallicities, Z > 10^-4 Zsun, regions of
density and temperature exist where gas is both thermally unstable and has a
cooling time less than its dynamical time. We identify these doubly unstable
regions as the most inducive to fragmentation. At high redshifts, the CMB
inhibits efficient cooling at low temperatures and, thus, reduces the size of
the doubly unstable regions, making fragmentation more difficult.

the low radiative output to a low mass accretion rate rather than a low
radiative efficiency. In this model, electrons are assumed to drain energy from
the ions as a result of collisionless plasma microinstabilities. Consequently,
the accreting gas collapses to form a geometrically thin disk at small radii
and is able to cool before reaching the black hole. The accretion disk is not a
standard disk, however, because the radial disk structure is modified by a
magnetic torque which drives a jet and which is primarily responsible for
angular momentum transport. We also include relativistic effects. We apply this
model to the well known LLAGN M87 and calculate the combined disk-jet
steady-state broadband spectrum. A comparison between predicted and observed
spectra indicates that M87 may be a maximally spinning black hole accreting at
a rate of 10^{-3} solar masses per year. This is about 6 orders of magnitude
below the Eddington rate for the same radiative efficiency. Furthermore, the
total jet power inferred by our model is in remarkably good agreement with the

amplifier [17], which has an on-chip capacitor shunting a junction, the

frequency and whose other RF characteristics like the quality factor are easily
controlled and optimized. Under proper microwave irradiation conditions, the
CBA has two metastable states. Which state is adopted by the CBA depends on the
state of a quantronium qubit coupled to the CBA's junction. Due to the MHz
repetition rate and large signal to noise ratio we can show directly that the
coherence is limited by 1/f gate charge noise when biased at the sweet spot - a
point insensitive to first order gate charge fluctuations. This architecture
lends itself to scalable quantum computing using a multi-resonator chip with

the nucleus into 2 sources, namely C12 and C13, for the first time. The
brighter source C12, with L(0.08-10keV)=(6.66\pm0.45)\times10^{38}ergs^-1, was
spatially extended (~82 pc x 127 pc). From the astrometric registration of the
X-ray image, C12 was at R.A.=03h:46m:48.43s, decl.=+68d05m47.45s, and was
closer to the nucleus than C13. Thus we concluded that source was not an ULX
and must instead be associated with the nucleus. The fainter source C13, with
L(0.08-10keV)=(5.1\pm1.4) x 10^{37}ergs^-1 was consistent with a point source
and located $6.51'' at P.A. 240 degree of C12.

the region where 3 optical star clusters and correspondingly our detected X-ray

that nuclear X-ray emission in IC342 was dominated by starburst. Furthermore,

occupied molecular orbital for both Si and Ge NCs and the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital for Si NCs display oscillations with respect to size among
the different irreducible representations of the $C_{3v}$ point group to which
these spherical NCs belong. Based on this electronic structure, first the
interband absorption is thoroughly studied which shows the importance of
surface polarization effects that significantly reduce the absorption when
included. This reduction is found to increase with decreasing NC size or with
increasing permittivity mismatch between the NC core and the host matrix.
Reasonable agreement is observed with the experimental absorption spectra where
available. The deformation of spherical NCs into prolate or oblate ellipsoids
are seen to introduce no pronounced effects for the absorption spectra. Next,
intraconduction and intravalence band absorption coefficients are obtained in
the wavelength range from far-infrared to visible region. These results can be
valuable for the infrared photodetection prospects of these NC arrays. Finally,

connection of the huge filament extending over 20 Mpc in the N-S direction, and
another filament extending from the main cluster to the East. Based on a simple
energy argument, we show that it is likely that most of the clumps are bound to
the main CL0016 cluster. This structure is surely one of the most prominent
confirmed structures ever identified in the distant Universe, which then serves
as an ideal laboratory to examine the environmental variation of galaxy
properties. We draw star formation histories of galaxies from the composite
spectra of red galaxies in field, group, and cluster environments. Combining
the results from our previous studies, we find that red galaxies in groups at
z~0.8 and red field galaxies at z~0.5 show strong Hd absorption lines for their
D4000 indices. These are the environments in which we observed the on-going
build-up of the colour-magnitude relation in our previous photometric analyses.
The strong Hd absorption lines imply that their star formation is truncated on
a relatively short time scale. We suggest that a galaxy-galaxy interaction is
the most likely physical driver of the truncation of star formation and thus
responsible for the build-up of the colour-magnitude relation since z~1.

overlap the typical kinematics of solar to M-type stars within the same spatial
volume. However, the mean Galactic (44.2 km/s) and tangential (36.5 km/s)
velocities of the L and T dwarfs appear to be smaller than those of G to M
stars. A significant fraction (~40%) of the L and T dwarfs lies near the Hyades
moving group (0.4-2 Gyr), which contrasts with the 10-12% found for
earlier-type stellar neighbors. Additionally, the distributions of all three
UVW components (sigma_{UVW} = 30.2, 16.5, 15.8 km/s) and the distributions of
the total Galactic (sigma_{v_tot} = 19.1 km/s) and tangential (sigma_{v_t} =
17.6 km/s) velocities derived for the L and T dwarf sample are narrower than
those measured for nearby G, K, and M-type stars, but similar to the

neighborhood, the L- and T-type ultracool dwarfs in our sample (including brown
dwarfs) is kinematically younger than solar-type to early M stars with likely
ages in the interval 0.5-4 Gyr.

reservoir of moderately cold ($\approx 300 \mu$K) metastable

focused 532 nm laser beam produces a strongly elongated optical potential for

at 430 nm, carefully superimposed upon the ODT beam, selectively pumps the

are confined by the ODT. The triplet-MOT perpetually refills the capture volume
with $^{3}$P$_{2}$-atoms thus providing a continuous stream of cold atoms into
the ODT at a rate of $10^7 $s$^{-1}$. Limited by evaporation loss, in 200 ms we
typically load $5 \times 10^5$ atoms with an initial radial temperature of 85

measurements. Indeed, stellar models including a detailed treatement of the
radiative diffusion predict the existence of a near-surface convection zone in
order to correctly reproduce the anomalies in surface abundances that are
observed in Am stars. The Am star HD 209625 was observed with the Harps
spectrograph mounted on the 3.6-m telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory
(Chile) during 9 nights in August 2005. This observing run allowed us to
collect 1243 radial velocity (RV) measurements, with a standard deviation of
1.35 m/s. The power spectrum associated with these RV measurements does not
present any excess. Therefore, either the structure of the external layers of
this star does not allow excitation of solar-like oscillations, or the
amplitudes of the oscillations remain below 20-30 cm/s (depending on their
frequency range).

(RLBGs) detected at 24 micron which are mainly Luminous IR Galaxies (LIRGs) and
blue LBGs (BLBGs) undetected at 24 microns down to 83 microJy. Two of the RLBGs
are also detected at 70 micron. The median SED of the RLBGs is similar (above
lambda~1 micron) to the dusty starburst HR10. However, unlike local (U)LIRGs,
RLBGs are UV bright objects. We suggest that these objects contain a large
amount of dust but that some bare stellar populations are also directly
visible. The median SED of the BLBGs is consistent with their containing the
same stellar population as the RLBGs but with a lower dust content. The
luminosity function of our LBG sample at z~1 is similar to the luminosity
function of NUV-selected galaxies at the same redshift. The integrated
luminosity densities of z~1 LBGs and NUV-selected galaxies are very consistent.
We show that star formation rates (SFRs) estimated from UV measurements and
corrected using the IRX-beta method provide average total SFR_TOT in agreement
with SFR_UV + SFR_dust. However, IRX-beta-based SFR_TOT shows a large
dispersion. Summing up the detected UV (1150A rest-frame) and IR-based star
formation rates of the detected objects, we find that only one third of the
total (i.e. UV + dust) LBG SFR resides in BLBGs and two thirds in RLBGs, even
though most LBGs at z~1 are BLBGs. On the other hand, the total SFR of LBGs
accounts for only 11% of the total SFR at z~1. Finally, we observe a regular
decrease of L_TIR / L_FUV from z=0 to z~2 for UV-selected samples.

the wave numbers $q_\|,q_\perp$ and $k_\|,k_\perp$ holds. As a consequence
energy from the eddy with wave numbers $k_\|$ and $k_\perp$ cascades due to
interactions with eddies located in the resonant manifold whose wavenumbers are
determined by: $q_\|\simeq \epsilon^{{1}/{3}}k_\perp^{2/3}/B$,
$q_\perp=k_\perp$ and energy will cascade along the lines $k_\|\sim
C+k_\perp^{2/3} \epsilon^{1/3}/B_0$. For a uniform energy injection rate in the
parallel direction the resulting energy spectrum is $E(k_\|,k_\perp)\simeq

suggests a non-universal behavior. The connections with previous models,

Previously we presented new PAH measurements and argued that most of the

present spectral energy distributions (SEDs) by supplementing our data with
optical, NIR and FIR observations. We define two sub-groups of ``weak FIR'' and
``strong FIR'' QSOs, and a third group of FIR non-detections. Assuming a
starburst origin for the FIR, we obtain ``intrinsic'' AGN SEDs by subtracting a
starburst template from the mean SEDs. The resulting SEDs are remarkably
similar for all groups. They show three distinct peaks corresponding to two
silicate emission features and a 3mic bump that we interpret as the signature
of the hottest AGN dust. They also display drops beyond 20mic that we interpret
as the signature of the minimum temperature (about 200K) dust. This component
must be optically thin to explain the silicate emission and the slope of the
long wavelength continuum. We discuss the merits of an alternative model where
most of the FIR emission is due to AGN heating. Such models are unlikely to
explain the properties of our QSOs but they cannot be ruled out for more
luminous objects. We also find correlations between the luminosity at 5100A and
two infrared starburst indicators: L(60mic) and L(PAH 7.7mic). The correlation
of L(5100A) with L(60mic) can be used to measure the relative growth rates and
lifetimes of the black hole and the new stars.

Studentized and self-normalized forms to begin with, they are a priori nearly,
or completely, data-based, and free of unknown parameters of the joint
distribution of the error and explanatory variables. Consequently, they lead to
a variety of readily available, or easily derivable, large-sample approximate
confidence intervals (CI's) for the slope and intercept. In contrast, in
related CLT's in the literature so far, the variances of the limiting normal
distributions, in general, are complicated and depend on various, typically
unknown, moments of the error and explanatory variables. Thus, the
corresponding CI's for the slope and intercept in the literature, unlike those
of the present paper, are available only under some additional model
assumptions.

open new possibilities for studying the properties of galaxy clusters and for
using them as powerful cosmological probes. For this reason it is necessary to
investigate in detail the characteristics of the polarization signals produced
by their highly ionized intra-cluster medium (ICM). This work is focussed on
the polarization effect induced by the ICM bulk motions, the so-called kpSZ
signal, which has an amplitude proportional to the optical depth and to the
square of the tangential velocity. In particular we study how this polarization
signal is affected by the internal dynamics of galaxy clusters and what is its
dependence on the physical modelling adopted to describe the baryonic
component. This is done by producing realistic kpSZ maps starting from the
outputs of two different sets of high-resolution hydrodynamical N-body
simulations. The first set (17 objects) follows only non-radiative
hydrodynamics, while for each of 9 objects of the second set we implement four
different kinds of physical processes. Our results shows that the kpSZ signal
turns out to be a very sensitive probe of the dynamical status of galaxy
clusters. We find that major merger events can amplify the signal up to one
order of magnitude with respect to relaxed clusters, reaching amplitude up to
about 100 nuK. This result implies that the internal ICM dynamics must be taken
into account when evaluating this signal because simplicistic models, based on
spherical rigid bodies, may provide wrong estimates. Finally we find that the
dependence on the physical modelling of the baryonic component is relevant only
in the very inner regions of clusters.

its spectrum obtained by both XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray satellites. These
absorption lines can be interpreted as a principal frequency centered at 0.7
keV and its harmonics at 1.4, 2.1 and possibly 2.8 keV. The principal line can
be formed by resonant proton cyclotron scattering leading to a magnetic field
which is two orders of magnitude larger than the perpendicular component of the
surface dipole magnetic field (B) found from the rotation period (P) and the
time rate of change in the rotation period (\.{P}) of 1E 1207.4-5209. Besides,
age of the supernova remnant (SNR) G296.5+10.0 which is physically connected to
1E 1207.4-5209 is two orders of magnitude smaller than the characteristic age
($\tau$=P/2\.{P}) of the neutron star. These huge differences between the
magnetic field values and the ages can be explained based on a B-decay model.
If the decay is assumed to be exponential, the characteristic decay time turns
out to be several thousand years which is three orders of magnitude smaller
than the characteristic decay time of radio pulsars represented in an earlier
work. The lack of detection of radio emission from DRQNSs and the lack of point
sources and pulsar wind nebulae in most of the observed SNRs can also be partly
explained by such a very rapid exponential decay. The large difference between
the characteristic decay times of DRQNSs and radio pulsars must be related to
the differences in the magnetic fields, equation of states and masses of these
isolated neutron stars.

comprehensive, thermodynamically consistent framework for the theoretical
investigation of correlated lattice bosons. The B-DMFT is applicable for
arbitrary values of the coupling parameters and temperature and becomes exact
in the limit of high spatial dimensions d or coordination number Z of the
lattice. In contrast to its fermionic counterpart the construction of the
B-DMFT requires different scalings of the hopping amplitudes with Z depending
on whether the bosons are in their normal state or in the Bose-Einstein
condensate. A detailed discussion of how this conceptual problem can be
overcome by performing the scaling in the action rather than in the Hamiltonian
itself is presented. The B-DMFT treats normal and condensed bosons on equal
footing and thus includes the effects caused by their dynamic coupling. It
reproduces all previously investigated limits in parameter space such as the
Beliaev-Popov and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximations and generalizes the
existing mean-field theories of interacting bosons. The self-consistency
equations of the B-DMFT are those of a bosonic single-impurity coupled to two
reservoirs corresponding to bosons in the condensate and in the normal state,
respectively. We employ the B-DMFT to solve a model of itinerant and localized,
interacting bosons analytically. The local correlations are found to enhance
the condensate density and the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) transition
temperature T_{BEC}. This effect may be used experimentally to increase T_{BEC}
of bosonic atoms in optical lattices.
