  Penguin Puzzle?","39 pages",,,"MIT-CTP 3828","hep-ph",,"  We compute standard model penguin amplitudes in nonleptonic B-decays to light
charmless mesons using tree amplitude data to fix hadronic parameters. The
leading calculation is carried out for the alphas(mb) penguin contributions
from charm quark, up quark, and magnetic penguin loops in the NDR and HV
renormalization schemes. Power suppressed penguins that are proportional to the
chiral condensate are also computed using a new factorization formula for these
terms, which is derived working to all orders in alphas(sqrt{mb\Lambda}). We
demonstrate using SCET1 that this formula exhibits only small perturbative
phases and does not have endpoint singularities. Due to our use of data to fix
hadronic parameters we obtain significantly more accurate predictions for the
short-distance standard model penguin amplitudes than have been found in the
past. Analyzing data in B-> pi pi, B->K pi, and B->rho rho for the penguin
amplitudes we find that standard model short-distance imaginary parts are an
order of magnitude smaller than current measurements, while real parts are up
to a factor of two smaller with the correct sign. This difference is most
likely a consequence of long-distance charm contributions or new physics.
Constraints on the type of new physics that could help explain the data are
derived, and used to show that current data favors sizeable long-distance
strong phases.

Annihilation of this 'spinless photon' proceeds predominantly through Higgs
boson exchange, and is largely independent of other Kaluza-Klein particles. The
measured relic abundance sets an upper limit on the spinless photon mass of 500
GeV, which decreases to almost 200 GeV if the Higgs boson is light. The
phenomenology of this dark matter candidate is strikingly different from
Kaluza-Klein dark matter in theories with one universal extra dimension.
Elastic scattering of the spinless photon with quarks is helicity suppressed,
making its direct detection challenging, although possible at upcoming

antimatter are similar to those of neutralinos. The rates predicted at neutrino
telescopes are below the sensitivity of next-generation experiments.

the disk of NGC 2403 during the past 10 Myr has been 1 solar masses per year
based on the number of bright main sequence stars. The radially-averaged number
density of red supergiants (RSGs) per unit r-band surface brightness is
constant throughout the disk, indicating that (1) RSGs follow the integrated
r-band light, and (2) the SFR per unit mass has been constant with radius when
averaged over time scales of a few tens of millions of years. The mean color of
RSGs varies with galactocentric distance, suggesting that there is a
metallicity gradient among recently formed stars. A comparison of the
radially-averaged number density of bright main sequence stars also indicates
that the SFR per unit stellar mass in NGC 2403 has been ~3 times higher than in
NGC 247 during recent epochs, and this is in rough agreement with what would be

field lines. We consider interaction of fast particles with the surface of the

atmosphere of the neutron star because the two-stream instability is stabilized
by the inhomogeneity of the atmosphere. Rather, the dominant dissipation
mechanism is collisional Landau levelexcitations followed by pair production
via the deexcitation gamma-rays ultimately leading to electrons with the energy
below the Landau energy. We show that, because of the effects of the
superstrong magnetic field, these electrons could emerge from the surface
carrying most of the original energy so that a hot corona arises with the
temperature of 1 - 2 MeV. This extended corona is better suited than a thin
atmosphere to convert most of the primary beam energy to non-thermal radiation
and, as we show, most of the coronal energy release is radiated away in the
hard X-ray and the soft gamma-ray bands by Comptonization and bremsstrahlung.
The radiation spectrum is a power-law with the photon index $1<\alpha<2$. The
model may account for the persistent hard X-ray emission discovered recently
from the soft gamma-ray repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars and predicts that
the radiation spectrum is extended into the MeV band.

non-commutative dipole field theory from the string/gauge correspondence. The
associated dual supergravity background is constructed from the near-horizon
geometry of near-extremal D-branes, after applying T-duality and smeared twist.
We investigate the string configuration therein and find that while the
temperature produces a maximum distance $L_{max}$ in the interquark distance
the dipole in there could produce a minimum distance $L_{min}$. The quark
boundary pair therefore could be found only if their distance is between
$L_{min}$ and $L_{max}$. We also show that, beyond a critical temperature the
quark pair becomes totally free due to screening by thermal bath. We next study
the spatial Wilson loop and find the confining nature in the zero temperature
3D and 4D non-supersymmetry dipole gauge theory. The string tension of the
linear confinement potential is obtained and found to be a decreasing function
of the dipole field. We also investigate the associated t'Hooft loop and
determine the corresponding monopole anti-monopole potential. The conventional
screening of magnetic charge which indicates the confinement of the electric
charge is replaced by a strong repulsive however. Finally, we show that the
dual string which is rotating along the dipole deformed $S^5$ will behave as a
static one without dipole field, which has no minimum distance and has larger
energy than a static one with dipole field. We discuss the phase transition

the study of FF UMa (2RE J0933+624), a recently discovered, X-ray/EUV selected,

find orbital solutions and define stellar parameters from precise radial
velocities and carry out an extensive study of the optical indicators of
chromospheric activity. We obtained high resolution echelle spectroscopic
observations during five observing runs from 1998 to 2004. We found radial
velocities by cross correlation with radial velocity standard stars to achieve
the best orbital solution. We also measured rotational velocity by
cross-correlation techniques and have studied the kinematic by galactic space-
velocity components (U, V, W) and Eggen criteria. Finally, we have determined
the chromospheric contribution in optical spectroscopic indicators, from Ca II
H & K to Ca II IRT lines, using the spectral subtraction technique. We have
found that this system presents an orbital period variation, higher than
previously detected in other RS CVn systems. We determined an improved orbital
solution, finding a circular orbit with a period of 3.274 days. We derived the
stellar parameters, confirming the subgiant nature of the primary component and
obtained rotational velocities (vsini), of 33.57 km/s and 32.38 km/s for the
primary and secondary components respectively. From our kinematic study, we can
deduce its membership to the Castor moving group. Finally, the activity study
has given us a better understanding of the possible mechanisms that produce the
orbital period variation.

with a continuum phase-field crystal (PFC) approach [K. R. Elder and M. Grant,
Phys. Rev. E 70, 051605 (2004)]. A multiscale analysis of the PFC model is
carried out which exploits the fact that the amplitudes of crystal density
waves decay slowly into the liquid in the physically relevant limit where the
freezing transition is weakly first order. This analysis yields a set of
coupled equations for these amplitudes that is similar to the set of equations
derived from Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory [K.-A. Wu et al., Phys. Rev. E 73,
094101 (2006)]. The two sets only differ in the details of higher order
nonlinear couplings between different density waves, which is determined by the
form of the nonlinearity assumed in the PFC model and by the ansatz that all
polygons with the same number of sides have equal weight in GL theory. Despite
these differences, for parameters (liquid structure factor and solid density
wave amplitude) of Fe determined from molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, the
PFC and GL amplitude equations yield very similar predictions for the overall
magnitude and anisotropy of the interfacial free-energy and density wave
profiles. These predictions are compared with MD simulations as well as
numerical solutions of the PFC model.

Khovanov's (n=2) link homology theory, determine its exact underlying algebraic

directly from this universal complex, and determine its relative strength as a
link invariant by specifying the amount of information held within the complex.
  We achieve these goals by finding a complex isomorphism which reduces the
complex into one in a simpler category. We introduce few tools and methods,
including surface classification modulo the 4TU/S/T relations and genus
generating operators, and use them to explore the relation between the
geometric complex and its underlying algebraic structure. We identify the
universal topological quantum field theory (TQFT) that can be used to create
link homology and find that it is ``smaller'' than what was previously reported
by Khovanov. We find new homology theories that hold a controlled amount of
information relative to the known ones.
  The universal complex is computable efficiently using our reduction theorem.
This allows us to explore the phenomenological aspects of link homology theory
through the eyes of the universal complex in order to explain and unify various
phenomena (such as torsion and thickness). The universal theory also enables us
to state results regarding specific link homology theories derived from it. The
methods developed in this thesis can be combined with other known techniques
(such as link homology spectral sequences) or used in the various extensions of
Khovanov link homology (such as sl_3 link homology).

refocusing their attention to detection of stellar variability through
systematic sky-scanning missions. This trend is aditionally powered by the
success of pioneering surveys such as ASAS, DENIS, OGLE, TASS, their space
counterpart Hipparcos and others. Such surveys produce massive amounts of data
and it is not at all clear how these data are to be reduced and analysed. This
is especially striking in the eclipsing binary (EB) field, where most
frequently used tools are optimized for object-by-object analysis. A clear need
for thorough, reliable and fully automated approaches to modeling and analysis
of EB data is thus obvious. This task is very difficult because of limited data
quality, non-uniform phase coverage and solution degeneracy. This paper reviews
recent advancements in putting together semi-automatic and fully automatic
pipelines for EB data processing. Automatic procedures have already been used

for longer chains, these general claims are no longer valid. Some particular

number of real Floquet multipliers greater than unity cannot be stabilized by
the time-delayed feedback control mechanism of Pyragus. A recent paper by
Fiedler et al uses the normal form of a subcritical Hopf bifurcation to give a
counterexample to this theorem. Using the Lorenz equations as an example, we
demonstrate that the stabilization mechanism identified by Fiedler et al for
the Hopf normal form can also apply to unstable periodic orbits created by
subcritical Hopf bifurcations in higher-dimensional dynamical systems. Our
analysis focuses on a particular codimension-two bifurcation that captures the
stabilization mechanism in the Hopf normal form example, and we show that the
same codimension-two bifurcation is present in the Lorenz equations with
appropriately chosen Pyragus-type time-delayed feedback. This example suggests
a possible strategy for choosing the feedback gain matrix in Pyragus control of
unstable periodic orbits that arise from a subcritical Hopf bifurcation of a
stable equilibrium. In particular, our choice of feedback gain matrix is
informed by the Fiedler et al example, and it works over a broad range of
parameters, despite the fact that a center-manifold reduction of the
higher-dimensional problem does not lead to their model problem.

action for the product space. To remove the above arbitrariness, we classify
the irreducibe geometries F consistent with imposing reality and chiral
conditions on spinors, to avoid the fermion doubling problem, which amounts to
have total dimension 10 (in the K-theoretic sense). It gives, almost uniquely,
the Standard Model with all its details, predicting the number of fermions per
generation to be 16, their representations and the Higgs breaking mechanism,
with very little input. The geometrical model is valid at the unification
scale, and has relations connecting the gauge couplings to each other and to
the Higgs coupling. This gives a prediction of the Higgs mass of around 170 GeV
and a mass relation connecting the sum of the square of the masses of the
fermions to the W mass square, which enables us to predict the top quark mass
compatible with the measured experimental value. We thus manage to have the
advantages of both SO(10) and Kaluza-Klein unification, without paying the
price of plethora of Higgs fields or the infinite tower of states.

will transit their parent star due to the geometric transit probability leads
to an estimate of the expected transit yields from radial velocity surveys. The
radial velocity information can be used to construct an effective photometric
follow-up strategy which will provide optimal detection of possible transits.
Since the planet-harbouring stars are already known in this case, one is only
limited by the photometric precision achieveable by the chosen
telescope/instrument. The radial velocity modelling code presented here
automatically produces a transit ephemeris for each planet dataset fitted by
the program. Since the transit duration is brief compared with the fitted
period, we calculate the maximum window for obtaining photometric transit
observations after the radial velocity data have been obtained, generalising
for eccentric orbits. We discuss a typically employed survey strategy which may
contribute to a possible radial velocity bias against detection of the very hot
Jupiters which have dominated the transit discoveries. Finally, we describe how
these methods can be applied to current and future radial velocity surveys.

All-wavelength Radiative Transfer with Adaptive Refinement Tree. ART^2
incorporates a radiative equilibrium algorithm for dust emission, an adaptive

warm ULIRG owing to heating and feedback from stars and AGN. Furthermore, the
AGN has significant implications for the interpretation of observation of the

is necessary to reproduce the observed dust properties of z~6 quasars,
supporting a merger-driven origin for luminous quasars at high redshifts and

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Rayleigh block fading channel is
considered when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per degree of freedom is low.
Two key problems are posed and solved to obtain the optimum discrete input. In
both problems, the average and peak power per space-time slot of the input
constellation are constrained. In the first one, the peak power to average
power ratio (PPAPR) of the input constellation is held fixed, while in the
second problem, the peak power is fixed independently of the average power. In
the first PPAPR-constrained problem, the mutual information, which grows as
O(SNR^2), is maximized up to second order in SNR. In the second
peak-constrained problem, where the mutual information behaves as O(SNR), the
structure of constellations that are optimal up to first order, or
equivalently, that minimize energy/bit, are explicitly characterized.
Furthermore, among constellations that are first-order optimal, those that
maximize the mutual information up to second order, or equivalently, the
wideband slope, are characterized. In both PPAPR-constrained and
peak-constrained problems, the optimal constellations are obtained in
closed-form as solutions to non-convex optimizations, and interestingly, they
are found to be identical. Due to its special structure, the common solution is
referred to as Space Time Orthogonal Rank one Modulation, or STORM. In both
problems, it is seen that STORM provides a sharp characterization of the
behavior of noncoherent MIMO capacity.

motivated by the measured steady rotation measure (RM) of $\approx -6 \times
10^5$ rad m$^{-2}$ from Sgr A*. In our numerical simulations, the quasi-steady
state structure of the accretion flow, and the RM it produces, depends on the
initial magnetic field. In spite of this dependence, we can draw several robust
conclusions about Faraday rotation produced by geometrically thick accretion
disks: i) the time averaged RM does not depend that sensitively on the viewing
angle, but the stability of the RM can. Equatorial viewing angles show
significant variability in RM (including sign reversals), while polar viewing
angles are relatively stable if there is a large scale magnetic field threading
the disk at large radii. ii) Most of the RM is produced at small radii for
polar viewing angles while all radii contribute significantly near the midplane
of the disk. Our simulations confirm previous analytic arguments that the
accretion rate onto Sgr A* must satisfy $\dot M_{\rm in} \ll \dot M_{\rm Bondi}
\sim 10^{-5} \mpy$ in order to not over-produce the measured RM. We argue that
the steady RM $\approx -6 \times 10^5$ rad m$^{-2}$ from Sgr A* has two
plausible explanations: 1) it is produced at $\sim 100$ Schwarzschild radii,
requires $\dot{M}_{\rm in} \approx 3 \times 10^{-8} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, and we
view the flow at an angle of $\sim 30^\circ$ relative to the rotation axis of
the disk; in our simulations, the variation in RM across a finite-sized source
is sufficient to depolarize the emission below $\approx$ 100 GHz, consistent
with observations. 2) Alternatively, the RM may be produced in the relatively
spherical inflowing plasma near the circularization radius at $\sim 10^3-10^4$
Schwarzschild radii.

disintegration with sea level rise out of humanity's control, has a bright

low that it will also avert other detrimental effects that had begun to seem
inevitable, e.g., ocean acidification, loss of most alpine glaciers and thus
the water supply for millions of people, and shifting of climatic zones with
consequent extermination of species. Here I outline from a scientific

shows how the two boundaries diverge in the presence of a mean-motion
resonance, while confirming that the Hill and Lagrange boundaries are similar
otherwise. In resonance the region of stability is larger than the domain
defined by the analytic formula for Hill stability. We find that nearly all
known resonant interactions currently lie in this extra stable region, i.e.
where the orbits would be unstable according to the non-resonant Hill stability
formula. This result bears on the dynamical packing of planetary systems,
showing how quantifying planetary systems' dynamical interactions (such as
proximity to the Hill-stability boundary) provides new constraints on planet
formation models.

additional binary predicate, not contained in the signature of the queried

  While it is straightforward that every CMSO formula can be translated into an
equivalent order-invariant MSO formula, the converse had not yet been settled.
Courcelle showed that for restricted classes of structures both order-invariant
MSO and CMSO are equally expressive, but conjectured that, in general,
order-invariant MSO is stronger than CMSO.
  We affirm this conjecture by presenting a class of structures that is
order-invariantly definable in MSO but not definable in CMSO.

favors polarizing spins along the field, precisely how the states for each

lattice-scale physics, arising either from interactions or disorder, resolves
this ambiguity to measurable consequence. Interestingly, such lattice-scale
physics favors microscopic symmetry-breaking order coexisting with the usual
liquid-like quantum Hall physics emerging on long length scales. The current

bursts (GRBs) is generally accepted to be due to long-lasting energy injection.
The outflows carrying the injecting energy, based on the component that is
dominative in energy, fall into two possible types: baryon-dominated and
lepton-dominated ones. The former type of outflow could be ejecta that is
ejected during the prompt phase of a GRB and consists of a series of baryonic
shells with a distribution of Lorentz factors, and the latter type could be an
electron-positron-pair wind that is driven by the post-burst central engine. We
here provide a unified description for the dynamics of fireballs based on these
two types of energy injection, and calculate the corresponding high-energy
photon emission by considering synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton
scattering (including synchrotron self-Compton and combined inverse-Compton) of
electrons. We find that, in the two energy-injection models, there is a plateau
(even a hump) in high-energy light curves during the X-ray shallow decay phase.
In particular, a considerable fraction of the injecting energy in the
lepton-dominated model can be shared by the long-lasting reverse shock since it
is relativistic. Furthermore, almost all of the energy of the reverse shock is
carried by leptons, and thus the inverse-Compton emission is enhanced
dramatically. Therefore, this model predicts more significant high-energy
afterglow emission than the baryon-dominated model. We argue that these
observational signatures would be used to discriminate between different
energy-injection models in the upcoming {\em Gamma-ray Large Area Space
Telescope} (GLAST) era.

samples at intermediate redshifts (z~0.3-5.5). Current models for the
reionization of intergalactic hydrogen predict that overdense regions will be
reionized early, thus delaying the build up of stellar mass in the progenitors
of massive lower-redshift galaxies. As a result, the stellar populations
observed in intermediate redshift galaxies are somewhat younger and hence
brighter in overdense regions of the Universe. Galaxy surveys would therefore
be sensitive to galaxies with a somewhat lower dark matter mass in overdense
regions. The corresponding increase in the observed number density of galaxies
can be parameterized as a galaxy bias due to reionization. We model this
process using merger trees combined with a stellar synthesis code. Our model
demonstrates that reionization has a significant effect on the clustering
properties of galaxy samples that are selected based on their star-formation
properties. The bias correction in Lyman-break galaxies (including those in
proposed baryonic oscillation surveys at z<1) is at the level of 10-20% for a
halo mass of 10^12 solar masses, leading to corrections factors of 1.5-2 in the
halo mass inferred from measurements of clustering length. The reionization of
helium could also lead to a sharp increase in the amplitude of the galaxy
correlation function at z~3. We find that the reionization bias is
approximately independent of scale and halo mass. However since the traditional
galaxy bias is mass dependent, the reionization bias becomes relatively more
important for lower mass systems. The correction to the bias due to
reionization is very small in surveys of luminous red galaxies at z<1.

correlations dominated superconducting mechanism (CSM). The correlations have
the spin correlation, the charge correlation and the spin-charge correlation,
and their strengths can be described by the related correlation lengths in
their correlation functions. Our evaluation from many superconductors is that
superconductivities occur if both the spin correlation and the charge
correlation are stronger, and the calculation of a Hubbard model showed that
the spin-charge correlation may govern superconductivities1. Afterwards, this
mechanism has led a model which includes various superconductivities and
magnetisms, and the relation between superconductivities and magnetisms can be
understood on this model2 (these results have been shown by calculations). This
mechanism is very practical, for example, to turn a material into a
superconductor or increase the Tc of a superconductor, what we will do is to
increase the spin-charge correlation. In this letter, we first describe the
relations between the spin-charge correlation, the spin correlation and the
charge correlation, take these relations as the basis of constructing a new
phase diagram, and then classify the known superconductors into various
sections in this phase diagram. This letter also gives a new explanation about
the pressure effect on Tc, the isotope effect on Tc and the pairing symmetry

investigate the one-loop mass shift to certain two-impurity string states in
light-cone string field theory on a plane wave background. We find that there
exist logarithmic divergences in the sums over intermediate mode numbers which
cancel between the cubic Hamiltonian and quartic ""contact term"". We argue that
generically, every order in intermediate state impurities contributes to the
mass shift at leading perturbative order. The same mass shift is also computed
using an improved 3-string vertex proposed by Dobashi and Yoneya. The result is
found to agree with gauge theory at leading order and is close but not quite in
agreement at subleading order. We extend the analysis to include discrete
light-cone quantization, considering states with up to three units of p+. We
study the (apparently) first-order phase transition in the weakly coupled
plane-wave matrix model at finite temperature. We analyze the effect of
interactions by computing the relevant parts of the effective potential for the
Polyakov loop operator to three loop order. We show that the phase transition
is indeed of first order. We also compute the 2-loop correction to the Hagedorn
temperature. Finally, correlation functions of 1/4 BPS Wilson loops with the
infinite family of 1/2 BPS chiral primary operators are computed in N=4 super
Yang-Mills theory by summing planar ladder diagrams. The correlation functions
are also computed in the strong-coupling limit using string theory; the result
is found to agree with the extrapolation of the planar ladders. The result is
related to similar correlators of 1/2 BPS loops by a simple re-scaling of the
coupling constant, discovered by Drukker for the case of the 1/4 BPS loop VEV.

channel is a general binary-input symmetric-output memoryless channel. The
proposed secure error-correcting code has a nested code structure. Two secure
nested coding schemes are studied for a type II Gaussian wiretap channel. The
nesting is based on cosets of a good code sequence for the first scheme and on
cosets of the dual of a good code sequence for the second scheme. In each case,
the corresponding achievable rate-equivocation pair is derived based on the
threshold behavior of good code sequences. The two secure coding schemes
together establish an achievable rate-equivocation region, which almost covers
the secrecy capacity-equivocation region in this case study. The proposed
secure coding scheme is extended to a type II binary symmetric wiretap channel.
A new achievable perfect secrecy rate, which improves upon the previously
reported result by Thangaraj et al., is derived for this channel.

remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost their
envelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf
population in our own Galaxy. This has major implications for understanding the
evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in general. In
particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as had been
postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly dependent on
the metallicity of the population.

bounce, the shock propagation, the evolution of nascent proto-neutron star and
the resulting re-collapse to black hole to reveal the influence of EOS. We also
explore the influence of EOS on the neutrino emission during the evolution
toward the black hole formation. We find that the speed of contraction of the
nascent proto-neutron star, whose mass increases fast due to the intense
accretion, is different depending on the EOS and the resulting profiles of
density and temperature differ significantly. The black hole formation occurs
at 0.6-1.3 sec after bounce when the proto-neutron star exceeds its maximum
mass, which is crucially determined by the EOS. We find that the average
energies of neutrinos increase after bounce because of rapid temperature
increase, but at different speeds depending on the EOS. The duration of
neutrino emission up to the black hole formation is found different according
to the different timing of re-collapse. These characteristics of neutrino
signatures are distinguishable from those for ordinary proto-neutron stars in
successful core-collapse supernovae. We discuss that a future detection of
neutrinos from black-hole-forming collapse will contribute to reveal the black
hole formation and to constrain the EOS at high density and temperature.

indicates the presence of an AGN in at least half of the 45 cross-matched radio
starbursts, of which 11 are type-II AGN including 7 at z>1.5. This distribution
overlaps closely with the X-ray detected radio sources which were also detected
by SCUBA. Stacked 1.4-GHz emission at the positions of radio-faint X-ray
sources is correlated with X-ray hardness. Most extended radio starbursts at
z>1.3 host X-ray selected obscured AGN. Radio emission from most of these
ultra-luminous objects is dominated by star formation but it contributes less
than 1/3 of their X-ray luminosity. Our results support the inferences from
SCUBA and IR data, that at z>1.5, star formation is an order of magnitude more
extended and more copious, it is closely linked to AGN activity and it is
triggered differently, compared with star formation at lower redshifts.

the origin of LMC's young and intermediate-age stars and star clusters with
distinctively low-metallicities with [Fe/H] < -0.6. We numerically investigate
whether gas initially in the outer part of the SMC's gas disk can be stripped
during the LMC-SMC-Galaxy interaction and consequently can pass through the
central region (R<7.5 kpc) of the LMC. We find that about 0.7 % and 18 % of the
SMC's gas can pass through the central region of the LMC about 1.3 Gyr ago and
0.2 Gyr ago, respectively. The possible mean metallicity of the replenished gas
from the SMC to LMC is about [Fe/H] = -0.9 to -1.0 for the two interacting
phases. These results imply that the LMC can temporarily replenish gas supplies
through the sporadic accretion and infall of metal-poor gas from the SMC. These
furthermore imply that if these gas from the SMC can collide with gas in the
LMC to form new stars in the LMC, the metallicities of the stars can be
significantly lower than those of stars formed from gas initially within the
LMC.

Eulerian multi-fluid models have already been rigorously derived from this

application of direct quadrature method of moments (DQMOM) introduced by
Marchisio and Fox (2005) to the Williams spray equation. Both the multi-fluid

complicated interaction terms representing coalescence. In order to validate
and compare these approaches, the chosen configuration is a self-similar 2D
axisymmetrical decelerating nozzle with sprays having various size
distributions, ranging from smooth ones up to Dirac delta functions. The second
key feature of the paper is a thorough comparison of the two approaches for
various test-cases to a reference solution obtained through a classical
stochastic Lagrangian solver. Both Eulerian models prove to describe adequately
spray coalescence and yield a very interesting alternative to the Lagrangian
solver.

H-colouring of the n-vertex path is a homomorphism from the n-vertex path to

Furthermore we show that for a slightly more restricted family of H (where any
two vertices are connected by a 2-edge path) systematic scan also mixes in
O(log n) scans for any scan order. Finally, for completeness, we show that a

neutrino mixing, vanishing U_{e3} and a non-maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing
angle theta_{23}. We show that these values emerge naturally by the hypothesis
of ""scaling"" in the Majorana neutrino mass matrix, which states that the ratios
of its elements are equal. It also predicts an inverted hierarchy for the
neutrino masses. We point out several advantages and distinguishing tests of
the scaling hypothesis compared to the L_e - L_mu - L_tau flavor symmetry,
which is usually assumed to provide an understanding of the inverted hierarchy.
Scenarios which have initially vanishing U_{e3} and maximal atmospheric
neutrino mixing are shown to be unlikely to lead to non-maximal theta_{23}
while keeping simultaneously U_{e3} zero. We find a peculiar ratio of the
branching ratios mu -> e gamma and tau -> e gamma in supersymmetric seesaw
frameworks, which only depends on atmospheric neutrino mixing and results in
tau -> e gamma being unobservable. The consequences of the scaling hypothesis
for high energy astrophysical neutrinos at neutrino telescopes are also
investigated. Then we analyze a seesaw model based on the discrete symmetry D_4
times Z_2 leading to scaling in the low energy mass matrix and being capable of
generating the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. The relevant
CP phase is identical to the low energy Majorana phase and successful
leptogenesis requires an effective mass for neutrinoless double beta decay

edges leading from the new node to randomly selected nodes already in the

entered the network within the latest window may receive new incoming edges.
The resulting directed network is acyclic at all times and allows some of the
ground nodes, then called sinks, to be reached from some of the non-ground
nodes. We regard such networks as representative of abstract systems of
partially ordered constituents, for example in some of the domains related to
technological evolution. Two properties of interest are the number of sinks
that can be reached from a randomly chosen non-ground node (its reach) and, for
a fixed sink, the number of nonoverlapping directed paths through which the
sink can be reached, at a given time, from some of the latest nodes to have
entered the network. We demonstrate, by means of simulations and also of
analytic characterizations, that reaches are distributed according to a power
law and that the desired directed paths are expected to occur in very small
numbers, perhaps indicating that recovering sinks late in the process of
network growth is strongly sensitive to accidental path disruptions.

increases with the transverse momentum of associated hadrons ($p^{assoc}_T$),
which is consistent with preliminary experimental trend, owing to different
interaction-lengths/numbers between wave partons and medium in strong parton
cascade. On the other hand, the splitting parameter $D$ as a function of
pseudorapidity of associated hadrons ($\eta^{assoc}$), keeps flat in
mid-pseudorapidity region and rapidly drops in high-pseudorapidity region,

boundaries in single-grid finite-difference schemes for elastodynamics, in a
time-domain velocity-stress framework. The basic idea is as follows: fictitious
values of the solution are built in vacuum, and injected into the numerical
integration scheme near boundaries. The most original feature of this method is
the way in which these fictitious values are calculated. They are based on
boundary conditions and compatibility conditions satisfied by the successive
spatial derivatives of the solution, up to a given order that depends on the
spatial accuracy of the integration scheme adopted. Since the work is mostly
done during the preprocessing step, the extra computational cost is negligible.
Stress-free conditions can be designed at any arbitrary order without any
numerical instability, as numerically checked. Using 10 grid nodes per minimal
S-wavelength with a propagation distance of 50 wavelengths yields highly
accurate results. With 5 grid nodes per minimal S-wavelength, the solution is
less accurate but still acceptable. A subcell resolution of the boundary inside
the Cartesian meshing is obtained, and the spurious diffractions induced by
staircase descriptions of boundaries are avoided. Contrary to what occurs with
the vacuum method, the quality of the numerical solution obtained with this
method is almost independent of the angle between the free boundary and the
Cartesian meshing.

formation of this structure. We performed submillimeter observations with JCMT
and the SMA interferometer. The continuum emission as well as the J=2-1 and 3-2
transitions of 12CO and 13CO are analysed at arcsecond resolution. The CO
emission indicates a mass of the torus of ~ 2Msun +/- 1Msun. The 12CO and 13CO
emission matches the dark lane seen in absorption in the Halpha image of the
object. The CO torus is expanding with a velocity of ~ 8 km/s, centred at
Vlsr=-31.5 km/s. The size and expansion velocity of the torus indicates that
the torus was ejected from ~ 7500 yr to 2900 yr ago, with a mass-loss rate of
5x10^{-4}Msun/yr. We also see a ballistic component in the CO images with a
velocity gradient of 140 km/s/pc.

Differently from the Slepian-Wolf approach to distributed source coding, in the
proposed scenario the sensing nodes do not perform any pre-compression of the
sensed data. Original data are instead independently encoded by means of
low-complexity convolutional codes. The decoder performs joint decoding with
the aim of exploiting the inherent correlation between the transmitted sources.
Complexity at the decoder is kept low thanks to the use of an iterative joint
decoding scheme, where the output of each decoder is fed to the other decoder's
input as a-priori information. For such scheme, we derive a novel analytical
framework for evaluating an upper bound of joint-detection packet error
probability and for deriving the optimum coding scheme. Experimental results
confirm the validity of the analytical framework, and show that recursive codes
allow a noticeable performance gain with respect to non-recursive coding
schemes. Moreover, the proposed recursive coding scheme allows to approach the
ideal Slepian-Wolf scheme performance in AWGN channel, and to clearly
outperform it over fading channels on account of diversity gain due to

parameters obtained from the solution of the radial velocity curves with those
obtained from the light curve analysis, reliable absolute parameters of the

S Equ and KO Aql has been measured and it is found that the gainers of both
systems rotate about 30 % faster than synchronously. This is likely due to mass
transfer across the Lagrangian L1 point from the cooler to the hotter
component. The lower luminosity of the mass-gaining components of these systems
compared to normal main-sequence stars of the same mass can be also an effect
of the mass transfer. The H-alpha profiles reveal clear evidence of mass
transfer and accretion structures. In both systems we clearly observed
extra-absorption lines. From the integrated absorption and the radial velocity
variations of these features, we found that the mass accretion is very dense
around the impact region of the hotter components. A double-peaked emission in
the spectra of S Equ was seen outside the eclipses. One of these peaks is
likely originated in a region between the center of mass and the cooler
component, which is occupied by the flowing matter. Furthermore, the H-alpha
difference spectra of S Equ and KO Aql display also emission features, which
should be arising from the magnetic activity of the cooler components.

connects mass, accretion rate and timing properties provides us with a further
physical diagnostic. Patterns of radio loudness (i.e. jet production) as a

the Eddington limit. The radio counterpart is highly variable, and was detected
in six of sixteen observations over the period 2006 January -- April. The
coupling of radio emission to X-ray state, despite limited sampling, appears to
be similar to that of other `Z' sources, in that there is no radio emission on
the flaring branch. The mean radio and X-ray luminosities are consistent with
the other Z sources for a distance of 5--15 kpc. The radio spectrum is
unusually flat, or even inverted, in contrast to the related sources, Sco X-1

wide-field observations indicate an extended structure three arcminutes to the
south which is aligned with the X-ray binary. This seems to represent a

30 micro-Jy in February 2005 to 320 micro-Jy and 280 micro-Jy in June 2006.
Optical line emission is also evolving, but the emission lines are fading. The
optical line emission and early radio flux are attributed to a fast shock (and
not photoionization as was reported earlier) which occurred around 1998. The
fading is due to post-shock cooling and recombination. The recent rapid
increase in radio flux is evidence for the onset of photoionization of carbon
starting around 2005. The current results indicate an increase in the stellar
temperature to 12 kK in 2006. The mass ejected in the VLTP eruption is M_ej >=
1e-4 Msol, but could be as high as 1e-2 Msol, depending mainly on the distance
and the clumping factor of the outflow. We derive a distance between 1.8 and 5

the model correctly reproduces these eras, we correlate three data sets that
constrain the interaction at three redshift epochs: $z\le 10^{4}$, $z=10^{3}$,

under consideration fulfills both requirements, it is heavily constrained by
observation. The prospects that the coincidence problem can be explained by the
coupling of dark matter to dark energy are not clearly favored by the data.
