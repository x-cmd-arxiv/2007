of spintronics was the use of such manganites as electrodes in magnetic tunnel
junctions, yielding tunnel magnetoresistance ratios one order of magnitude

then, the research on oxide spintronics has been intense with the latest

larger distances, however, significant discrepancies are observed. Several
mechanisms are investigated to account for these discrepancies including the
effect of interstellar reddening, the presence of metals in the photosphere,
and the existence of unresolved binary white dwarfs. The results of our
analysis reveal that wavelength-dependent extinction is the most natural
explanation for the observed temperature differences. We also attempt to
predict the differences in optical and UV temperatures expected from unresolved
degenerate binaries by performing an exhaustive simulation of composite model
spectra. In light of these simulations, we then discuss some known double

by fitting a circle to the limb brightness ring.
  Results. The weighted mean of the temporal series gives (967''.56 +/- 0''.04)

We find that the clump mass function $dN/d\log M$ is well fit with a power law
of the mass with exponent -0.6 (or equivalently $dN/dM \propto M^{-1.6}$). The
derived exponent is similar to those obtained from molecular line emission
surveys and is significantly different from that of the stellar initial mass
function. We investigated changes in the mass spectrum by changing the
assumptions on the temperature distribution of the clumps and on the
contribution of free-free emission to the 1.2 mm emission, and found little
changes on the exponent. The Cumulative Mass Distribution Function is also
analyzed giving consistent results in a mass range excluding the high-mass end
where a power-law fit is no longer valid. The masses and sizes of the clumps
observed in NGC 6334 indicate that they are not direct progenitors of stars and
that the process of fragmentation determines the distribution of masses later

Type Ibc supernova (SN Ibc). While all these events result from the death of
massive stars, the electromagnetic luminosities of GRBs and XRFs exceed those
of ordinary Type Ibc SNe by many orders of magnitude. The observed diversity of
stellar death corresponds to large variations in the energy, velocity, and
geometry of the explosion ejecta. Using multi-wavelength (radio, optical,
X-ray) observations of the nearest GRBs, XRFs, and SNe Ibc, I show that while
GRBs and XRFs couple at least 10^48 erg to relativistic material, SNe Ibc
typically couple less than 10^48 erg to their fastest (albeit non-relativistic)
outflows. Specifically, I find that less than 3% of local SNe Ibc show any
evidence for association with a GRB or XRF. Recently, a new class of GRBs and
XRFs has been revealed which are under-luminous in comparison with the
statistical sample of GRBs. Owing to their faint high-energy emission, these
sub-energetic bursts are only detectable nearby (z < 0.1) and are likely 10
times more common than cosmological GRBs. In comparison with local SNe Ibc and
typical GRBs/XRFs, these explosions are intermediate in terms of both
volumetric rate and energetics. Yet the essential physical process that causes
a dying star to produce a GRB, XRF, or sub-energetic burst, and not just a SN,
remains a crucial open question. Progress requires a detailed understanding of
ordinary SNe Ibc which will be facilitated with the launch of wide-field

estimate their effects on gate operations, when a molecular ensemble qubit is
transferred to a superconducting strip line cavity (circuit QED). In the case
rotational excitations coupled by dipole-dipole interactions we identify

former ~ Cs^(-6) whereas the latter ~ Cs^(6) such that an effective Weissenberg

Cs. A procedure has been developed to collapse the apparent shear viscosity
versus shear rate data obtained for various values of Cs into a single master
curve. The effect of Cs on the elastic modulus and mesh size of the
shear-induced gel phase for different surfactant concentrations is discussed.

show that the critical shear rate, relaxation time and the maximum viscosity
attained are geometry-independent. The elastic modulus of the gel phase
inferred indirectly by employing simplified hydrodynamic instability analysis
of a sheared gel-fluid interface is in qualitative agreement with that

stochastic approach incorporates not only the stochastic noise manifested from
electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations, but also dissipation backreaction on a
charge in the form of the retarded Lorentz forces. Since the imposition of the
boundary is expected to anisotropically modify the effects of the fields on the
evolution of the particle, we consider the motion of a charge undergoing
small-amplitude oscillations in the direction either parallel or normal to the
plane boundary. Under the dipole approximation for nonrelativistic motion,
velocity fluctuations of the charge are found to grow linearly with time in the
early stage of the evolution at the rather different rate, revealing strong
anisotropic behavior. They are then asymptotically saturated as a result of the
fluctuation-dissipation relation, and the same saturated value is found for the
motion in both directions. The observational consequences are discussed. plane

saturated as a result of the fluctuation-dissipation relation. For the
electron, the same saturated value is obtained for motion in both directions,
and is mainly determined by its oscillatory motion. Possible observational

ferromagnetic-state stability are highlighted with respect to both long- and

Finite-temperature electron spin dynamics is investigated directly in terms of
spectral-weight transfer across the Fermi energy due to electron-magnon
coupling. Relevant in the context of recent magnetization measurements on
ultrathin films, the role of strong thermal spin fluctuations in low dimensions

The galaxies lie at 0.01<z<0.07 where the fibre aperture covers only the
central 0.6-4.0kpc diameter of the galaxy. We find strong trends between black
hole growth, as measured by dust-attenuation-corrected OIII luminosity, and the
recent star formation history of the bulges. We conclude that our results
support the popular hypothesis for black hole growth occurring through gas
inflow into the central regions of galaxies, followed by a starburst and
triggering of the AGN. However, while this is a significant pathway for the
growth of black holes, it is not the dominant one in the present-day Universe.
More unspectacular processes are apparently responsible for the majority of
this growth.
  In order to arrive at these conclusions we have developed a set of new high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) optical spectral indicators, designed to allow a
detailed study of stellar populations which have undergone recent enhanced star
formation. Working in the rest-frame wavelength range 3750-4150AA, ideally
suited to many recent and ongoing spectroscopic surveys at low and high
redshift, the first two indices are equivalent to the previously well studied
4000AA break strength and Hdelta equivalent width. The primary advantage of
this new method is a greatly improved SNR for the latter index, allowing the
present study to use spectra with SNR-per-pixel as low as 8.

is shown that methanol maser sources are concentrated in the spiral arms. Most
of the methanol maser sources from the Perseus arm are associated with embedded
stellar clusters and a considerable portion is situated close to compact HII
regions. Almost 1/3 of the Perseus Arm sources lie at the edges of optically
identified HII regions which means that massive star formation in the Perseus
Arm is to a great extent triggered by local phenomena. A multiline analysis of
the methanol masers allows us to determine the physical parameters in the
regions of maser formation. Maser modelling shows that class II methanol masers
can be pumped by the radiation of the warm dust as well as by free-free
emission of a hypercompact region hcHII with a turnover frequency exceeding 100
GHz. Methanol masers of both classes can reside in the vicinity of hcHIIs.
Modelling shows that periodic changes of maser fluxes can be reproduced by
variations of the dust temperature by a few percent which may be caused by
variations in the brightness of the central young stellar object reflecting the
character of the accretion process. Sensitive observations have shown that the
masers with low flux densities can still have considerable amplification
factors. The analysis of class I maser surveys allows us to identify four
distinct regimes that differ by the series of their brightest lines.

control can be modeled by the Minority Game. We consider how their dynamics
depends on the agents' initial preferences of strategies, when the agents use
linear or quadratic payoff functions to evaluate their strategies. We find that
the fluctuations of the population making certain decisions (the volatility)
depends on the diversity of the distribution of the initial preferences of
strategies. When the diversity decreases, more agents tend to adapt their
strategies together. In systems with linear payoffs, this results in dynamical
transitions from vanishing volatility to a non-vanishing one. For low signal
dimensions, the dynamical transitions for the different signals do not take
place at the same critical diversity. Rather, a cascade of dynamical
transitions takes place when the diversity is reduced. In contrast, no phase
transitions are found in systems with the quadratic payoffs. Instead, a basin
boundary of attraction separates two groups of samples in the space of the
agents' decisions. Initial states inside this boundary converge to small
volatility, while those outside diverge to a large one. Furthermore, when the
preference distribution becomes more polarized, the dynamics becomes more
erratic. All the above results are supported by good agreement between
simulations and theory.

instrument onboard the GEOTAIL spacecraft. The observed peak profile revealed
four characteristic structures: initial steep rise, intermediate rise to the
peak, exponential decay and small hump in the decay phase. From this light
curve, we found that the isotropic peak luminosity was $2.3\times10^{46}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ and the total energy was $4.3 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($E\gtrsim$
50 keV), assuming that the distance to SGR 1900+14 is 15 kpc and that the
spectrum is optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung with $kT =$ 240 keV. These
are consistent with the previously reported lower limits derived from Ulysses
and Konus-Wind observations. A comparative study of the initial spikes of SGR
1900+14 giant flare in 1998 and SGR 1806-20 in 2004 is also presented. The
timescale of the initial steep rise shows the magnetospheric origin, while the
timescale of the intermediate rise to the peak indicates that it originates
from the crustal fracturing. Finally, we argue that the four structures and
their corresponding timescales provide a clue to identify extragalactic SGR
giant flares among short GRBs.

First, we build an extension of the bulk five-dimensional supergravity, by a

supersymmetry is spontaneously broken. Second, we discuss in details the super

analyzed through a comparison with the $\beta$-delayed deuteron spectrum of

simulations include a prescription for star formation allowing us to track the
fate of the stellar component as well. We investigate the effect of tidal
stripping on cluster galaxies hosted in these dark matter subhalos as a
function of cluster-centric radius. To quantify the extent of the dark matter
halos of cluster galaxies, we introduce the half mass radius r_half as a
diagnostic, and study its evolution with projected cluster-centric distance R
as a function of redshift. We find a well defined trend for (r_half,R): the
closer the galaxies are to the center of the cluster, the smaller the half mass
radius. Interestingly, this trend is inferred in all redshift frames examined
in this work ranging from z=0 to z=0.7. At z=0, galaxy halos in the central
regions of clusters are found to be highly truncated, with the most compact
half mass radius of 10 kpc. We also find that r_half depends on luminosity and
we present scaling relations of r_half with galaxy luminosity. The
corresponding total mass of the cluster galaxies is also found to increase with
projected cluster-centric distance and luminosity, but with more scatter than
the (r_half,R) trend. Comparing the distribution of stellar mass to total mass
for cluster galaxies, we find that the dark matter component is preferentially
stripped, whereas the stellar component remains protected by the halo and is
much less affected by tidal forces. We compare these results with galaxy-galaxy
lensing probes of r_half and find qualitative agreement. (Abridged)

\Gamma_{2}=\Gamma_{aa}\sin^2\tm$ where $\tm$ is the mixing angle in the medium

production is suppressed and the oscillation frequency \emph{vanishes} at an
MSW resonance, with a breakdown of adiabaticity. These are consequences of
quantum Zeno suppression. For active neutrinos with standard model interactions
the strong damping limit is \emph{only} available near an MSW resonance
\emph{if} $\sin\theta \lesssim \alpha_w$ with $\theta$ the vacuum mixing angle.
The full set of quantum kinetic equations for sterile production for arbitrary

and non-topological degrees of freedom; this generalizes a model for the
dynamics of DNA recently proposed and investigated by ourselves. In a certain
limit, the non-topological degrees of freedom are frozen, and the model reduces
to the sine-Gordon equations and thus supports well-known topological soliton
solutions. We consider a (singular) perturbative expansion around this limit
and study in particular how the non-topological field assume the role of an
auxiliary field. This provides a more general framework for the slaving of this
degree of freedom on the topological one, already observed elsewhere in the
context of the mentioned DNA model; in this framework one expects such
phenomenon to arise in a quite large class of field-theoretical models.

the highly-disturbed, active galaxy in the Virgo cluster, with the VLA and the
GMRT. High-resolution observations with the VLA at 4860 and 8460 MHz show the
presence of an inverted-spectrum radio nucleus located between the highly
asymmetric lobes of radio emission. This demonstrates that these lobes arise
due to an AGN rather than a compact nuclear starburst. The low-frequency radio
continuum observations made with the GMRT detect the extended emission on the
western side of the galaxy whose spectral index is flatter at higher
frequencies and suggests that it is a mixture of thermal and non-thermal
emission.
  The HI observations show an elongated structure which is displaced by ~4.1
kpc on the western side of NGC4438 and has a size of ~9.8 kpc and a mass of
1.8*10^8 M_sun. The velocity field suggests systematic rotation. We also detect
HI emission from the disk of the galaxy with a mass of 1.2*10^8 M_sun. We
detect a faint HI tail towards the north of NGC4438 close to a stellar tail
seen in deep optical observations. This HI tail has a total extent of ~50 kpc
and a mass of 1.4*10^8 M_sun if it is at the distance of NGC4438. The velocity
of the HI tail is ~-10 km/s similar to that of HI emission from IC 3355, but
the possibility that the tail could be foreground Galactic emission cannot be
ruled out. We discuss the different structures in the light of different
models.

family of nanostructures with quasi-one-dimensional electronic properties.
These surface reconstructions are stabilized by a variety of adsorbates ranging
from alkali and alkaline earth metals to noble and rare earth metals. Combining
the complementary strength of dynamical low-energy electron diffraction,
scanning tunneling microscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we
recently showed that besides monovalent and divalent adsorbates, trivalent
adsorbates are also able to stabilize silicon honeycomb chains. Consequently
silicon honeycomb chains emerge as a most stable, universal building block
shared by many atomic chain structures. We here present the systematics behind
the self-assembly mechanism of these chain systems and relate the valence state
of the adsorbate to the accessible symmetries of the chains.

edge-like receptive fields. One approach to understanding the emergence of this
response is to state that neural activity has to efficiently represent sensory
data with respect to the statistics of natural scenes. Furthermore, it is
believed that such an efficient coding is achieved using a competition across
neurons so as to generate a sparse representation, that is, where a relatively
small number of neurons are simultaneously active. Indeed, different models of
sparse coding, coupled with Hebbian learning and homeostasis, have been
proposed that successfully match the observed emergent response. However, the
specific role of homeostasis in learning such sparse representations is still
largely unknown. By quantitatively assessing the efficiency of the neural
representation during learning, we derive a cooperative homeostasis mechanism
that optimally tunes the competition between neurons within the sparse coding
algorithm. We apply this homeostasis while learning small patches taken from
natural images and compare its efficiency with state-of-the-art algorithms.
Results show that while different sparse coding algorithms give similar coding
results, the homeostasis provides an optimal balance for the representation of
natural images within the population of neurons. Competition in sparse coding
is optimized when it is fair. By contributing to optimizing statistical
competition across neurons, homeostasis is crucial in providing a more
efficient solution to the emergence of independent components.

rapidly rotating neutron stars. Supernova remnants containing magnetars do not
show the excess of kinetic energy expected for such a formation scenario, nor
is there any evidence for a relic pulsar wind nebula. However, it could be that
magnetars are formed with somewhat slower rotation periods, or that not all
excess rotational energy was used to boost the explosion energy, for example as
a result of gravitational radiation. Another observational tests for the rapid
initial period hypothesis is to look for statistical evidence that about 1% of
the observed supernovae have an additional 1E40-1E44 erg/s excess energy during
the first year, caused by the spin down luminosity of a magnetar. An
alternative scenario for the high magnetic fields of magnetars is the fossil
field hypothesis, in which the magnetic field is inherited from the progenitor
star. Direct observational tests for this hypothesis are harder to formulate,
unless the neutron star formed in the SN1987A explosion emerges as a slowly
rotating magnetar. Finally, I point out the possible connection between the
jets in Cas A and its X-ray point source: the jets in Cas A may indicate that
the explosion was accompanied by an X-ray flash, probably powered by a rapidly
rotating compact object. However, the point source in Cas A does not seem to be
a rapidly rotating neutron star, suggesting that the neutron star has slowed
down considerably in 330 yr, requiring a magnetar-like field.

typical features. (1) BMRs' emerging rates of the new cycles increase about 3
times faster than those of the old cycles decrease. (2) Two consecutive solar
cycles have an overlapping period of near 10 Carrington rotations. During this
very short overlapping time interval, BMRs of two cycles tend to concentrate in
the same longitudes. (3) About 53% BMRs distribute with a longitudinal distance
of 1/8 solar rotation. Such phenomenon suggests a longitudinal mode of m=8
