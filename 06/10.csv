four dimensions, we show that orientifold sources can be compatible with a
generalized SU(3) x SU(3)-structure that is neither strictly SU(3) nor static
SU(2). We illustrate this with explicit examples, obtained by suitably
T-dualizing known solutions on the six-torus. In addition we prove the
following integrability statements, valid under certain mild assumptions: (a)
for general type II supergravity backgrounds with orientifold and/or D-brane
generalized-calibrated sources, the source-corrected Einstein and dilaton
equations of motion follow automatically from the supersymmetry equations once
the likewise source-corrected form equations of motion and Bianchi identities
are imposed; (b) in the special case of supersymmetric compactifications to
four-dimensional Minkowski space, the equations of motion of all fields,
including the NSNS three-form, follow automatically once the supersymmetry and
the Bianchi identities of the forms are imposed. Both (a) and (b) are equally
valid whether the sources are smeared or localized. As a byproduct we obtain
the calibration form for a space-filling NS5-brane.

  Physical Origin for Pre-Swift High-Energy Correlations","25 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables, Accepted to ApJ",,"10.1086/522492",,"astro-ph",,"  We calculate durations and spectral paramaters for 218 Swift bursts detected
by the BAT instrument between and including GRBs 041220 and 070509, including
77 events with measured redshifts. Incorporating prior knowledge into the
spectral fits, we are able to measure the characteristic $\nu F_{\nu}$ spectral
peak energy $E_{\rm pk,obs}$ and the isotropic equivalent energy $E_{\rm iso}$
(1--$10^4$ keV) for all events. This complete and rather extensive catalog,
analyzed with a unified methodology, allows us to address the persistence and
origin of high-energy correlations suggested in pre-Swift observations. We find
that the $E_{\rm pk,obs}$-$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation is present in the Swift
sample; however, the best-fit powerlaw relation is inconsistent with the
best-fit pre-Swift relation at >5 sigma significance. Moreover, it has a factor
>~ 2 larger intrinsic scatter, after accounting for large errors on $E_{\rm
pk,obs}$. A large fraction of the Swift events are hard and subluminous
relative to (and inconsistent with) the pre-Swift relation, in agreement with
indications from BATSE GRBs without redshift. Moreover, we determine an
experimental threshold for the BAT detector and show how the $E_{\rm
pk,obs}$--$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation arises artificially due to partial
correlation with the threshold. We show that pre-Swift correlations found by
Amati et al.(2002), Yonetoku et al. (2004), Firmani et al.(2006) (and
independently by others) are likely unrelated to the physical properties of
GRBs and are likely useless for tests of cosmology. Also, an explanation of
these correlations in terms of a detector threshold provides a natural and
quantitative explanation for why short-duration GRBs and events at low redshift
tend to be outliers to the correlations.

at up TeV energies. The nature of the compact object and the origin of the
high-energy emission are unclear. One family of models invokes particle
acceleration in shocks from the collision between the B-star wind and a
relativistic pulsar wind, while another centers on a relativistic jet powered
by accretion. Recent high-resolution radio observations showing a putative
""cometary tail"" pointing away from the Be star near periastron have been cited
as support for the pulsar-wind model. We wish here to carry out a quantitative
assessment of these competing models for this extraordinary source. We apply a
3D SPH code for dynamical simulations of both the pulsar-wind-interaction and
accretion-jet models. The former yields a description of the shape of the
wind-wind interaction surface. The latter provides an estimation of the
accretion rate. The results allow critical evaluation of how the two distinct
models confront the data in various wavebands under a range of conditions. When
one accounts for the 3D dynamical wind interaction under realistic constraints
for the relative strength of the B-star and pulsar winds, the resulting form of
the interaction front does not match the putative ""cometary tail"" claimed from
radio observations. On the other hand, dynamical simulations of the
accretion-jet model indicate that the orbital phase variation of accretion
power includes a secondary broad peak well away from periastron, thus providing
a plausible way to explain the observed TeV gamma ray emission toward apastron.
We conclude that the colliding-wind model is not clearly established for LS I
+61 303, while the accretion-jet model can reproduce many key characteristics
of the observed TeV gamma-ray emission.

the density (structure) of the circumburst medium. We then compare our results

afterglow with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and the Giant Metrewave

of 268-1128 days after the burst. We modeled all the available radio data and
derived the physical parameters. The index of the electron energy distribution
is p=2.1, the circumburst medium is homogeneous, and the transition to the
non-relativistic phase happens at t_NR ~ 80 days. The energy of the blast wave
and density of the surrounding medium are comparable to previous findings. Our
findings indicate that the blast wave is roughly spherical at t_NR, and they
agree with the implications from the VLBI studies of image size evolution. It
is not clear from the presented dataset whether we have seen emission from the

where $\tau_\phi$ is (nearly) independent of temperature, a scaling
$\tau_\phi^{\rm max} \propto D^{-\alpha}$ is found, where $tau_\phi^{\rm max}$

star core-collapse progenitor. We combine the afterglow data reported here with
data taken from the literature and compare the host properties with survey

a broken power-law, with a break at ~0.03 days. We determine the redshift z =
0.858 +/- 0.001 from the detected emission lines in our spectrum. Using the
spectrum and photometry we derive global properties of the host, showing it to
have similar properties to long GRB hosts. We detect the [Ne III] emission line
in the spectrum, and compare the fluxes of this line of a sample of 15 long GRB
host galaxies with survey data, showing the long GRB hosts to be comparable to
local metal-poor emission line galaxies in their [Ne III] emission. We fit the
supernova bump accompanying this burst, and find that it is similar to other
long GRB supernova bumps, but fainter. All properties of GRB 040924 are

distribution. Using mock catalogues generated from cosmological N-body
simulations, we demonstrate that the selection criteria used to select isolated
galaxies and their satellites must be very strict in order to correctly
identify systems in which the primary galaxy dominates its environment. The
criteria used in many previous studies instead select predominantly group
members. We refine a set of selection criteria for which the group
contamination is estimated to be less than 7% and present a catalogue of the
resulting sample. The angular distribution of satellites about their host is
biased towards the major axes for spheroidal galaxies and probably also for red
disc galaxies, but is isotropic for blue disc galaxies, i.e. it is the colour
of the host that determines the distribution of its satellites rather than its
morphology. The similar anisotropy measured in this study as in studies that
were dominated by groups implies that group-specific processes are not
responsible for the angular distribution. Satellites that are most likely to
have been recently accreted show a tendancy to lie along the same axis as the
surrounding large scale structure. The orientations of isolated early and
intermediate-type galaxies also align with the surrounding large scale
structures. We discuss the origin of the anisotropic satellite distribution and
consider the implications of our results, critically assessing the respective
roles played by the orientation of the visible galaxy within its dark matter
halo; anisotropic accretion of satellites from the larger scale environment;
and the biased nature of satellites as tracers of the underlying dark matter
subhalo population. (Abridged)

possesses particular properties that cannot be found in other materials and
that are required for life-giving processes. These properties are brought about
by the hydrogen bonded environment particularly evident in liquid water. Each
liquid water molecule is involved in about four hydrogen bonds with strengths
considerably less than covalent bonds but considerably greater than the natural
thermal energy. These hydrogen bonds are roughly tetrahedrally arranged such
that when strongly formed the local clustering expands, decreasing the density.
Such low density structuring naturally occurs at low and supercooled
temperatures and gives rise to many physical and chemical properties that
evidence the particular uniqueness of liquid water. If aqueous hydrogen bonds
were actually somewhat stronger then water would behave similar to a glass,
whereas if they were weaker then water would be a gas and only exist as a
liquid at sub-zero temperatures. The overall conclusion of this investigation
is that water's hydrogen bond strength is poised centrally within a narrow
window of its suitability for life.
