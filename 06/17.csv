supersymmetry are counted by a Siegel modular form. The pole structure of the
modular form leads to a contour dependence in the counting formula obscuring
its duality invariance. We exhibit the relation between this ambiguity and the
(dis-)appearance of bound states of 1/2-BPS configurations. Using this insight
we propose a precise moduli-dependent contour prescription for the counting
formula. We then show that the degeneracies are duality-invariant and are
correctly adjusted at the walls of marginal stability to account for the
(dis-)appearance of the two-centered bound states. Especially, for large black
holes none of these bound states exists at the attractor point and none of
these ambiguous poles contributes to the counting formula. Using this fact we
also propose a second, moduli-independent contour which counts the ""immortal
dyons"" that are stable everywhere.

cosmological data sets: the WMAP cosmic microwave background (CMB) power

in the nonlinear evolution of f(R) models, the galaxy power spectrum
conservatively yields only weak constraints on the models despite the strong
predicted signature in the linear matter power spectrum. Currently the tightest
constraints involve the modification to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect from
growth of gravitational potentials during the acceleration epoch. This effect
is manifest for large Compton wavelengths in enhanced low multipole power in
the CMB and anti-correlation between the CMB and tracers of the potential. They
place a bound on the Compton wavelength of the field be less than of order the

algorithms with classical output (1D QDFT and 2D QDFT) are presented in this
paper. And quantum algorithm for convolution estimation is also presented in
this paper. Compared with FFT, QDFT has two advantages at least. One of
advantages is that 1D and 2D QDFT has time complexity O(sqrt(N)) and O(N)
respectively. The other advantage is that QDFT can process very long signal
sequence at a time. QDFT and quantum convolution demonstrate that quantum
signal processing with classical output is possible.

interrelation between possible types of magnetic and orbital order. We
elucidate the prominent role played by fluctuations of $yz$ and $xz$ orbitals
which generate ferromagnetic superexchange interactions even in the absence of
Hund's exchange. In this limit we find orbital valence bond state which is
replaced either by $C$-type antiferromagnetic order with weak $G$-type orbital
order at increasing Hund's exchange, or instead by $G$-type antiferromagnetic
order when the lattice distortions stabilize $C$-type orbital order. Both
phases are observed in YVO$_3$ and we argue that a dimerized $C$-type
antiferromagnetic phase with stronger and weaker FM bonds alternating along the
c axis may be stabilized by large spin-orbital entropy at finite temperature.

deep-inelastic diffractive scattering in an operator approach. The
representation refers to the observed large rapidity gap but does not require
reference to a pomeron picture. We discuss both the case of vanishing target
mass $M$ and momentum transfer $t$ as well as the effects at finite $t$ and
$M$, which lead to modifications at large $\beta$ and low values of $Q^2$.

  of Asynchronous 2D Minority",,,,,"cs.DM",,"  Cellular automata are often used to model systems in physics, social
sciences, biology that are inherently asynchronous. Over the past 20 years,
studies have demonstrated that the behavior of cellular automata drastically
changed under asynchronous updates. Still, the few mathematical analyses of
asynchronism focus on one-dimensional probabilistic cellular automata, either
on single examples or on specific classes. As for other classic dynamical
systems in physics, extending known methods from one- to two-dimensional
systems is a long lasting challenging problem.
  In this paper, we address the problem of analysing an apparently simple 2D
asynchronous cellular automaton: 2D Minority where each cell, when fired,
updates to the minority state of its neighborhood. Our experiments reveal that
in spite of its simplicity, the minority rule exhibits a quite complex response
to asynchronism. By focusing on the fully asynchronous regime, we are however
able to describe completely the asymptotic behavior of this dynamics as long as
the initial configuration satisfies some natural constraints. Besides these
technical results, we have strong reasons to believe that our techniques
relying on defining an energy function from the transition table of the
automaton may be extended to the wider class of threshold automata.

level (eigenvalue) spacing distributions and the degree of their randomness, or
alternatively - information/organization deficit.

rich and complicated behavior of the spin-Hall conductivity which is relevant
to both electron and hole states in quantum wells and can be detected in
experiments.

Schrodinger equation with phase vortices. The vortex line is aligned with the
propagation direction, and the wave packet carries a well-defined orbital
angular momentum (OAM) $\hbar l$ ($l$ is the vortex strength) along its main
linear momentum. The probability current coils around momentum in such OAM
states of electrons. In an electric field, these states evolve like massless
particles with spin $l$. The magnetic-monopole Berry curvature appears in
momentum space, which results in a spin-orbit-type interaction and a
Berry/Magnus transverse force acting on the wave packet. This brings about the
OAM Hall effect. In a magnetic field, there is a Zeeman interaction, which, can
lead to more complicated dynamics.
