of warped extra dimensions. Validity of an effective field theory on the
standard model (SM) brane requires that the position of the SM brane during
inflation be different from the position after inflation. The latter is
supposed to be near the tip of the SM throat but the former is not. After
inflation, when the Hubble expansion rate becomes sufficiently low, the SM
brane starts moving towards the tip and eventually oscillates. The SM fields
are excited by the brane motion and the universe is reheated. Since interaction
between the brane position modulus and the SM fields is suppressed only by the
local string scale, the modulus effectively decays into the SM fields.

outer layers of stellar atmospheres. However, due to instrumental limitations,
only large X-ray flares have been studied in detail until now.
  Aims: We used an XMM-Newton observation of the very active BY-Dra type binary
star CC Eri in order to investigate the properties of two flares that are
weaker than those typically studied in the literature.
  Methods: We performed time-resolved spectroscopy of the data taken with the
EPIC-PN CCD camera. A multi-temperature model was used to fit the spectra. We
inferred the size of the flaring loops using the density-temperature diagram.
The loop scaling laws were applied for deriving physical parameters of the
flaring plasma. We also estimated the number of loops involved in the observed
flares.
  Results: A large X-ray variability was found. Spectral analysis showed that
all the regions in the light curve, including the flare segments, are
well-described by a 3-T model with variable emission measures but,
surprisingly, with constant temperatures (values of 3, 10 and 22 MK). The
analysed flares lasted ~ 3.4 and 7.1 ks, with flux increases of factors
1.5-1.9. They occurred in arcades made of a few tens of similar coronal loops.
The size of the flaring loops is much smaller than the distance between the
stellar surfaces in the binary system, and even smaller than the radius of each
of the stars. The obtained results are consistent with the following ideas: (i)
the whole X-ray light curve of CC Eri could be the result of a superposition of
multiple low-energy flares, and (ii) stellar flares can be scaled-up versions
of solar flares.

providing a large set of (possible) new singularities of the $\chi^{(n)}$. We
discuss the singularity structure for these multiple integrals by solving the
Landau conditions. We find that the singularities of the associated ODEs
identify (up to $n= 6$) with the leading pinch Landau singularities. The second
remarkable obtained feature is that the singularities of the ODEs associated
with the multiple integrals reduce to the singularities of the ODEs associated
with a {\em finite number of one dimensional integrals}. Among the
singularities found, we underline the fact that the quadratic polynomial
condition $ 1+3 w +4 w^2 = 0$, that occurs in the linear differential equation
of $ \chi^{(3)}$, actually corresponds to a remarkable property of selected
elliptic curves, namely the occurrence of complex multiplication. The
interpretation of complex multiplication for elliptic curves as complex fixed
points of the selected generators of the renormalization group, namely
isogenies of elliptic curves, is sketched. Most of the other singularities
occurring in our multiple integrals are not related to complex multiplication
situations, suggesting an interpretation in terms of (motivic) mathematical
structures beyond the theory of elliptic curves.

which is of independent interest as it solves the inverse algebro-geometric
spectral problem for general (non-unitary) Ablowitz-Ladik Lax operators,
starting from a suitably chosen set of initial divisors of full measure.
Combined with an appropriate first-order system of differential equations with
respect to time (a substitute for the well-known Dubrovin-type equations), this
yields the construction of global algebro-geometric solutions of the
time-dependent Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy.
  The treatment of general (non-unitary) Lax operators associated with general

applies generally to (1+1)-dimensional completely integrable soliton equations

strings, hence requiring only the modest complexity C at least 203, and at most
a few thousand. We claim this provides a reasonable explanation for a

limit of the trace of the n-th power of the reduced density matrix. Taking
advantage of integrability, we use the expansion of this two-point function in
terms of form factors of the twist fields, in order to evaluate it at large
distances in the two-particle approximation. Although this is a well-known
technique, the new geometry of the problem implies a modification of the form
factor equations satisfied by standard local fields of integrable quantum field

Goldberger-Wise (GW) potential there is a supercooled transition from a
deconfined to a confined phase at temperatures orders of magnitude below the
typical Standard Model critical temperature. When the Higgs is localized at the
IR brane the electroweak phase transition is delayed and becomes a strong
first-order one where the Universe expands by a few e-folds. This generates the
possibility of having the out-of-equilibrium condition required by electroweak
baryogenesis in the electroweak phase transition. We have studied numerically
the region of the GW parameter space where the theory is consistent and the
latter possibility is realized. We have found that in most of the parameter
space the nucleation temperature is so low that sphalerons are totally inactive
inside the bubbles. The condition for sphalerons to be inactive after reheating
imposes an upper bound on the reheating temperature that is weaker for heavy
Higgs bosons so that the out-of-equilibrium condition seems to favor heavy over
light Higgses. The condition for sphalerons to be active outside the bubbles
puts an upper bound on the number of e-folds at the phase transition, roughly
consistent with the critical value required by low-scale inflation to solve the
cosmological horizon problem.

color and kinematics. Faint (g ~ 20.3) turnoff stars in S297+63-20.5 have
line-of-sight, Galactic standard of rest velocities V(GSR)= 130 +/- 10 km/s,
opposite in sign to infalling Sgr tail stars. The path of the Sgr leading tidal
tail is also inconsistent with the positions of some of the nearer stars with
which it has been associated, and whose velocities have favored models with
prolate Milky Way potentials. We additionally show that the number densities of
brighter (g ~ 19.8) F turnoff stars are not symmetric about the Galactic
center, and that this discrepancy is not primarily due to the S297+63-20.5
moving group. Either the spheroid is asymmetric about the Galactic center, or
there are additional substructures that conspire to be on the same side of the
Galaxy as S297+63-20.5. The S297+63-20.5 overdensity in Virgo is likely

average entanglement fidelity) recovery operation for a given channel,
encoding, and information source. This is solvable via a semidefinite program
(SDP). We present computational algorithms to generate near-optimal recovery
operations structured to begin with a projective syndrome measurement. These
structured operations are more computationally scalable than the SDP required
for computing the optimal; we can thus numerically analyze longer codes. Using
Lagrange duality, we bound the performance of the structured recovery
operations and show that they are nearly optimal in many relevant cases.

specifically designed for the amplitude damping channel. These have
significantly higher rates with shorter block lengths than corresponding

\citet{KLL03} that non-axisymmetric RWIs are likely to develop at local minima
of potential vorticity distribution that are generated by the interaction
between a planet and a inviscid barotropic disk. This second instability
appears to be very common and robust, regardless of the equation of state,
initial density distribution, and rotational law of the disk. The development
of RWIs results in non-axisymmetric density blobs, which exert stronger torques
onto the planet when they travel in the vicinity of the planet. As a result of
that, large amplitude oscillations are introduced to the time behavior of the
total torque acted on the planet by the disk. In our current simulations, RWIs
do not change the overall picture of inward orbital migration but bring in a
non-monotonic behavior to the migration speed. As a side effect, RWIs also
introduce interesting structures into the disk. These structures may help the

interaction between matter and an electromagnetic field confined within a
resonator structure, and is providing a useful platform for developing concepts
in quantum information processing. By using high-quality resonators, a strong
coupling regime can be reached experimentally in which atoms coherently
exchange a photon with a single light-field mode many times before dissipation
sets in. This has led to fundamental studies with both microwave and optical
resonators. To meet the challenges posed by quantum state engineering and
quantum information processing, recent experiments have focused on laser
cooling and trapping of atoms inside an optical cavity. However, the tremendous
degree of control over atomic gases achieved with Bose-Einstein condensation
has so far not been used for cavity QED. Here we achieve the strong coupling of
a Bose-Einstein condensate to the quantized field of an ultrahigh-finesse
optical cavity and present a measurement of its eigenenergy spectrum. This is a
conceptually new regime of cavity QED, in which all atoms occupy a single mode
of a matter-wave field and couple identically to the light field, sharing a
single excitation. This opens possibilities ranging from quantum communication
to a wealth of new phenomena that can be expected in the many-body physics of

been made during the last year. Two data taking runs, at the wavelength of 1064
nm, have been performed in the new configuration with magnetic field strengths
of 2.3 T and 5 T. The 2.3 T field value was chosen in order to avoid stray
fields. The new observations do not show the presence of a rotation signal down
to the levels of $1.2\cdot 10^{-8}$ rad at 5 T and $1.0\cdot 10^{-8}$ rad at
2.3 T (at 95% c.l.) with 45000 passes in the magnetic field zone. In the same
conditions no ellipticity signal was detected down to $1.4\cdot 10^{-8}$ at 2.3

of this ellipticity as due to an effect depending on $B^2$ can be excluded by
the measurement at 2.3 T. These new results completely exclude the previously

were instrumental artifacts. These new results therefore also exclude the

1H1905+000 in quiescence is described well with a black body of temperature of
0.2 keV. For the upper limit to the source distance of 10 kpc this yields a
0.5-10 keV luminosity limit of 2.4E30 / 1.7E30 erg/s for the abovementioned
power law or black body spectrum, respectively. This luminosity limit is lower
than the luminosity of A0620-00, the weakest black hole soft X-ray transient in

mass transfer and mass accretion rates we come to the conclusion that the claim
that there is evidence for the presence of a black hole event horizon on the
basis of a lower quiescent luminosity for black holes than for neutron stars is
unproven. We also briefly discuss the implications of the low quiescent

Magellan images of the field of 1H1905+000 obtained at excellent observing

$\triangle m_{15}$, we obtained rough estimates of the $^{56}$Ni mass for a
large sample of nearby SNe Ia with the aim of exploring the diversity in SN Ia.
We found that the derived $^{56}$Ni masses for different SNe Ia could vary by a
factor of ten (e.g., $M_{\rm Ni}=0.1 - 1.3$ $M_{\odot}$), which cannot be
explained in terms of the standard Chandrasekhar-mass model (with a $^{56}$Ni
mass production of 0.4 -- 0.8 $M_{\odot}$). Different explosion and/or
progenitor models are clearly required for various SNe Ia, in particular, for
those extremely nickel-poor and nickel-rich producers. The nickel-rich (with
$M_{\rm Ni}$ $>$ 0.8 $M_{\odot}$) SNe Ia are very luminous and may have massive
progenitors exceeding the Chandrasekhar-mass limit since extra progenitor fuel
is required to produce more $^{56}$Ni to power the light curve. This is also
consistent with the finding that the intrinsically bright SNe Ia prefer to
occur in stellar environments of young and massive stars. For example, 75% SNe
Ia in spirals have $\Delta m_{15} < 1.2$ while this ratio is only 18% in E/S0
galaxies. On the other hand, the nickel-poor SNe Ia (with $M_{\rm Ni}$ $<$ 0.2
$M_{\odot}$) may invoke the sub-Chandrasekhar model, as most of them were found
in early-type E/S0 galaxies dominated by the older and low-mass stellar
populations. This indicates that SNe Ia in spiral and E/S0 galaxies have
progenitors of different properties.

fluctuations about these one-dimensional boost-invariant backgrounds; they are
damped in ELNS hydrodynamics but can become sound waves in IS hydrodynamics.
The difference is obvious in power spectra due to clear signals of
wave-interference in IS hydrodynamics, which is completely absent in ELNS
dynamics.

Galactic center by HESS and other air Cerenkov telescopes. In recent work
(Ballantyne et al. 2007), we demonstrated that these gamma-rays can be
attributed to high-energy protons that (i) are accelerated close to the event
horizon of the central black hole, Sgr A*, (ii) diffuse out to ~pc scales, and
(iii) finally interact to produce gamma-rays. The same hadronic collision
processes will necessarily lead to the creation of electrons and positrons.
Here we calculate the synchrotron emissivity of these secondary leptons in the
same magnetic field configuration through which the initiating protons have
been propagated in our model. We compare this emission with the observed ~GHz
radio spectrum of the inner few pc region which we have assembled from archival
data and new measurements we have made with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array. We find that our model predicts secondary synchrotron emission with a
steep slope consistent with the observations but with an overall normalization
that is too large by a factor of ~ 2. If we further constrain our theoretical
gamma-ray curve to obey the implicit EGRET upper limit on emission from this
region we predict radio emission that is consistent with observations, i.e.,
the hadronic model of gamma ray emission can, simultaneously and without
fine-tuning, also explain essentially all the diffuse radio emission detected
from the inner few pc of the Galaxy.

employed for refining the relay selection process and for selecting an
appropriate transmission mode in a proposed adaptive modulation transmission
framework. An approximation of the throughput of the proposed adaptive
modulation strategy is presented, and the dependence of the throughput on
system parameters such as the relay contention probability and the adaptive
modulation switching point is illustrated via maximization of this

properties. Dynamic spectra were obtained from datasets of 90 min duration and
diffractive parameters derived from a two-dimensional auto-correlation
analysis. Secondary spectra were also computed but these showed no significant
evidence for arc structure. Cross correlations between variations in the
derived parameters were much lower than predicted by thin screen models and in
one case was of opposite sign to the prediction. Observed modulation indices
were larger than predicted by thin screen models with a Kolmogorov fluctuation

timescale and decorrelation bandwidth. These indicated a refractive timescale
of $8\pm 2$ h, much shorter than predicted by the thin screen model. The
measured structure-function slope of $0.4\pm 0.2$ is also inconsistent with
scattering by a single thin screen for which a slope of 2.0 is expected. All

spatial-dependent profile of external field. This phenomenon explicitly
demonstrates the exotic corpuscular property of polaritons with anisotropic
nature.

"0706.3459","Gabor Kun","Gabor Kun, Jaroslav Nesetril","NP by means of lifts and shadows","12 pages, conference (MFCS07) version of 0706.1704",,,,"cs.CC math.CO",,"  We show that every NP problem is polynomially equivalent to a simple
combinatorial problem: the membership problem for a special class of digraphs.
These classes are defined by means of shadows (projections) and by finitely
many forbidden colored (lifted) subgraphs. Our characterization is motivated by
the analysis of syntactical subclasses with the full computational power of NP,
which were first studied by Feder and Vardi.
  Our approach applies to many combinatorial problems and it induces the
characterization of coloring problems (CSP) defined by means of shadows. This
turns out to be related to homomorphism dualities. We prove that a class of
digraphs (relational structures) defined by finitely many forbidden colored
subgraphs (i.e. lifted substructures) is a CSP class if and only if all the the
forbidden structures are homomorphically equivalent to trees. We show a
surprising richness of coloring problems when restricted to most frequent graph
classes. Using results of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez for bounded
expansion classes (which include bounded degree and proper minor closed
classes) we prove that the restriction of every class defined as the shadow of
finitely many colored subgraphs equals to the restriction of a coloring (CSP)
class.
