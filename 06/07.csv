turbulence to study the physics of a highly compressible cascade. Our numerical
experiments describe non-magnetized driven turbulent flows with an isothermal
equation of state and an rms Mach number of 6. We find that the inertial range
velocity scaling deviates strongly from the incompressible Kolmogorov laws. We
propose an extension of Kolmogorov's K41 phenomenology that takes into account
compressibility by mixing the velocity and density statistics and preserves the
K41 scaling of the density-weighted velocity v=rho^{1/3}u. We show that
low-order statistics of 'v' are invariant with respect to changes in the Mach
number. For instance, at Mach 6 the slope of the power spectrum of 'v' is -1.69
and the third-order structure function of 'v' scales linearly with separation.
We directly measure the mass dimension of the ""fractal"" density distribution in
the inertial subrange, D_m=2.4, which is similar to the observed fractal
dimension of molecular clouds and agrees well with the cascade phenomenology.

and the shape of the density profile. We re-analyze simulations from Ricotti
(2003) in which such a correlation was proposed. We use a standard analysis of
the halo density profiles and compare the old simulations to new ones performed
with Gadget2, including higher resolution runs. We confirm Ricotti's result
that, at virialization, the central log slopes alpha, at 5%-10% of the virial
radius are correlated with the halo mass and that the halo concentration is a
universal constant. Our results do not contradict the majority of published
papers: when using a split power law to fit the density profiles, due to the
alpha-concentration degeneracy, the fits are consistent with halos having a
universal shape with alpha=1 or 1.5 and concentrations that depend on the mass,
in agreement with results published elsewhere.
  Recently, several groups have found no evidence for convergence of the inner
halo profile to a constant power law. The choice of a split power law
parameterization used in this letter is motivated by the need to compare our
results to previous ones and is formally valid because we are not able to
resolve regions where the slope of the fitting function reaches its asymptotic
constant value. Using a non-parameterized technique, we also show that the
density profiles of dwarf galaxies at z ~ 10 have a log slope shallower than
0.5 within 5% of the virial radius.

for the brane which includes an induced gravity term, and allow for an
asymmetric set-up. We study the linear stability of flat brane vacua and find
the regions of parameter space where the set-up is stable. The 4-dimensional
graviton is only quasi-localised in this set-up and as a result gravity is
modified at late times. One of the two regions is strongly coupled and the
scalar mode is eaten up by an extra symmetry that arises in this limit. Having
filtered the well-defined theories we then focus on their cosmology. When the
graviton is quasi-localised we find two main examples of acceleration. In each
case, we provide an illustrative model and compare it to LambdaCDM.

Universe, before the formation of the first stars and galaxies. The main
motivation is to derive the basic formulas that will be used in a companion
paper to calculate the accretion luminosity of primordial black holes and their
effect on the cosmic ionization history.
  The following cosmological effects are investigated: the coupling of the gas
to the CMB photon fluid (i.e., Compton drag), Hubble expansion, and the growth
of the dark matter halo seeded by the gravitational potential of the central
point mass. The gas equations of motion are solved assuming either a polytropic
or an isothermal equation of state. We consider the cases in which the
accreting object is a point mass or a spherical dark matter halo with power-law
density profile, as predicted by the theory of ""secondary infall''. Analytical
solutions for the sonic radius and fitting formulas for the accretion rate are
provided.
  Different accretion regimes exist depending on the mass of the accreting
object. If the black hole mass is smaller than 50-100 Msun, gas accretion is
unaffected by Compton drag. A point mass and an extended dark halo of equal
mass accrete at the same rate if M>5000 Msun, while smaller mass dark halos
accrete less efficiently than the equivalent point mass. For masses M>3 x 10^4
Msun, the viscous term due to the Hubble expansion becomes important and the
assumption of quasi-steady flow fails. Hence, the steady Bondi solutions
transition to the time-dependent self-similar solutions for ""cold cosmological
infall"".

outburst is characterised by strong irradiation of the front face of the
secondary star by the white dwarf, an overflowing stream which is seen strongly
in HeII and by a dip in the light curves, which extends from 0.1-0.6 in the
binary and spin phases. Strong irradiation of the accretion curtain and that of
the inner regions of the disc led to strong emission of HeII and to the
suppression of the Hg and Hb emission.
  Disc overflow was observed in quiescence in earlier studies, where the
overflow stream material was modulated at high velocities close to 1000 km/s.
In outburst, the overflowing material is modulated at even higher velocities
(~1500 km/s). These are streaming velocities down the field lines close to the
white dwarf. Evidence for material collecting near the outer edge of the disc
and corotating with the accretion curtain was observed. In decline, this
material and the accretion curtain obscured almost all the emission near binary
phase 0.4, causing a dip. The dip minimum nearly corresponds with spin pulse
minimum. This has provided additional evidence for an extended accretion
curtain, and for the corotation of material with the accretion curtain at the
outer edge of the disc. From these observations we suggest that a mechanism
similar to that of Spruit & Taam, where outbursts result due to the storage and
release of matter outside the magnetosphere, triggers the outbursts of EX Hya.
This is followed by the irradiation of the secondary star due to accretion
induced radiation.

possible 28% contamination by randomly distributed sources, we find r_0 = 4.61
+/- 0.6 Mpc/h. We compare these results with the expectations for the
clustering of dark matter halos at this redshift in a Cold Dark Matter model,
and find that the measured clustering strength can be reproduced if these
objects reside in halos with a minimum mass of 1-2 times 10^11 Solar masses/h.
Our estimated correlation length implies a bias of b ~ 3.7, similar to that of
Lyman-break galaxies (LBG) at z ~ 3.8-4.9. However, Lyman alpha emitters are a
factor of ~ 2-16 rarer than LBGs with a similar bias value and implied host
halo mass. Therefore, one plausible scenario seems to be that Lyman alpha
emitters occupy host halos of roughly the same mass as LBGs, but shine with a
relatively low duty cycle of 6-50%.

scattering rate of the ultraviolet photons, redshifting across the Lyman_alpha
resonance. Here we calculate the photon scattering rate profile for a single
ultraviolet source. After taking into account previously neglected natural
broadening of the resonance line, we find that photons approach the resonance
frequency and experience most scatterings at a significantly smaller distance
from the source than naively expected r=(dnu/nu_0)(c/H), where dnu=nu-nu_0 is
the initial frequency offset, and the discrepancy increases as the initial
frequency offset decreases. As a consequence, the scattering rate P(r) drops
much faster with increasing distance than the previously assumed 1/r^2 profile.
Near the source (r<1Mpc comoving), the scattering rate of photons that redshift
into the Ly_alpha resonance converges to P(r) \propto r^{-7/3}. The scattering
rate of Ly_alpha photons produced by splitting of photons that redshift into a
higher resonance (Ly_gamma, Ly_delta, etc.) is only weakly affected by the
radiative transfer, while the sum of scattering rates of Ly_alpha photons
produced from all higher resonances also converges to P(r) \propto r^{-7/3}
near the source. At 15<z<35, on scales of ~0.01-20Mpc/h (comoving), the total
scattering rate of Ly_alpha photons from all Lyman resonances is found to be
higher by a factor of ~1+0.3[(1+z)/20]^{2/3} than obtained without full
radiative transfer. Consequently, during the early stage of reionization, the
differential brightness of 21cm signal against the cosmic microwave background
is also boosted by a similar factor.

Dark Matter (CDM) models with observations on subgalactic scales. In this work
we provide a new and independent lower limit for the WDM particle mass (e.g.
sterile neutrino) through the analysis of image fluxes in gravitationally
lensed QSOs.
  Starting from a theoretical unperturbed cusp configuration we analyze the
effects of intergalactic haloes in modifying the fluxes of QSO multiple images,
giving rise to the so-called anomalous flux ratio. We found that the global
effect of such haloes strongly depends on their mass/abundance ratio and it is
maximized for haloes in the mass range $10^6-10^8 \Msun$.
  This result opens up a new possibility to constrain CDM predictions on small
scales and test different warm candidates, since free streaming of warm dark
matter particles can considerably dampen the matter power spectrum in this mass
range. As a consequence, while a ($\Lambda$)CDM model is able to produce flux
anomalies at a level similar to those observed, a WDM model, with an
insufficiently massive particle, fails to reproduce the observational
evidences.
  Our analysis suggests a lower limit of a few keV ($m_{\nu} \sim 10$) for the
mass of warm dark matter candidates in the form of a sterile neutrino. This
result makes sterile neutrino Warm Dark Matter less attractive as an
alternative to Cold Dark Matter, in good agreement with previous findings from
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and Cosmic Microwave Background analysis.

unusual dust extinction curve for one quasar and a high far-infrared luminosity
due to dust emission for another. The mean millimeter continuum flux for CFHQS
quasars is substantially lower than that for SDSS quasars at the same redshift,
likely due to a correlation with quasar UV luminosity. For two quasars with
sufficiently high signal-to-noise optical spectra, we use the spectra to
investigate the ionization state of hydrogen at z>5. For CFHQS J1509-1749 at

parameters for understanding the main magnetospheric processes including
geomagnetic storms and substorms. However, the pressure profiles obtained from
in-situ particle measurements by the high-altitude satellites do not allow
tracking the pressure variations related to the storms and substorms, because a
time interval needed to do this generally exceeds the characteristic times of
them. On contrary, fast movement of low-altitude satellites makes it possible
to retrieve quasi-instantaneous profiles of plasma pressure along the satellite
trajectory, using the fluxes of precipitating particles. For this study, we
used the Aureol-3 satellite data for plasma pressure estimation, and the IGRF,
Tsyganenko 2001 and Tsyganenko 2004 storm time geomagnetic field models for the
pressure mapping into the equatorial plane. It was found that during quiet
geomagnetic condition the radial pressure profiles obtained coincide with the
profiles, obtained previously from the high-altitude measurements. On the
contrary, it was found that during geomagnetic storm the plasma pressure
profiles became sharper; the position of the maximum of plasma pressure
corresponds to expected one for given Dst minimum; the maximum value of inner
magnetosphere static pressure correlates with the solar wind dynamic pressure.
Increase in the plasma pressure profiles indicates the possibility to consider
the interchange instability as one of important factors for the development of
the main phase of geomagnetic storm.

bremsstrahlung in the range 20 to 300 keV. I suggest that these bursts may
perhaps occur from collision of stars with primordial black holes (PBH). These
objects are relic of a hot matter in the early Universe. PBH in the vicinity of
stars may be found in consequence of incorporation processes during the
formation of stars from interstellar clouds. At present they can form the
gravitationally captured haloes around stars like the family of solar comets.
The comet paradigm has been used to understand various aspects of PBH. Comet
collisions with the Sun and planets are ordinary events in solar system
history. On the analogy, one can support the view that PBH collisions with the
parent star may be quite frequent events in its history, too. PBHs are the
engines driving gamma-ray bursts when collide with the stars. Entering a
stellar atmosphere, PBH is supposed to produce the gamma-ray burst due to
accretion with duration from a few tenths of second to a few seconds. It can
exhibit the main qualitative features of some GRBs. Their masses are estimated
in the range from thousandths to hundredths of the solar mass. I found that
these burst sources are isotropically distributed on the sky and are seen from
a distance up to 50 ps. In this context one may expect that some short GRBs are
observable signatures of primordial black holes in the Universe.

of the external magnetic field is increased to the critical field point at
which the spin-flop transition (a first-order quantum phase transition) happens

also been argued to be promising standard candles for cosmography. In this
paper, we present constraints on the cosmological parameters and dark energy by
combining a recent GRB sample including 69 events with the other cosmological
probes. First, we find that for the LambdaCDM cosmology this combination makes
the constraints stringent and the best fit is close to the flat universe.
Second, we fit the flat Cardassian expansion model and find that this model is
consistent with the LambdaCDM cosmology. Third, we present constraints on
several two-parameter dark energy models and find that these models are also
consistent with the LambdaCDM cosmology. Finally, we reconstruct the dark
energy equation-of-state parameter w(z) and the deceleration parameter q(z). We
see that the acceleration could have started at a redshift from
z_T=0.40_{-0.08}^{+0.14} to z_T=0.65_{-0.05}^{+0.10}. This difference in the
transition redshift is due to different dark energy models that we adopt. The
most stringent constraint on w(z) lies in the redshift range z\sim 0.3-0.6.

the sample was selected from the SiO maser sources found in our recent SiO
maser survey of cold dusty objects. The aim of the present research is to
investigate the causes of the correlation between infrared colors and SiO maser
intensity ratios among different transition lines. In particular, the
correlation between infrared colors and SiO maser intensity ratio among the
J=1-0 v=1, 2, and 3 lines are mainly concerned in this paper. We observed in
total 75 SiO maser sources with the Nobeyama 45m telescope quasi-simultaneously
in the SiO J=1-0 v=0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and J=2-1 v=1, 2 lines. We also observed the
sample in the 29SiO J=1-0 v=0 and J=2-1 v=0, and 30SiO J=1-0 v=0 lines, and the
H2O 6(1,6)-5(2,3) line. As reported in previous papers, we confirmed that the
intensity ratios of the SiO J=1-0 v=2 to v=1 lines clearly correlate with
infrared colors. In addition, we found possible correlation between infrared
colors and the intensity ratios of the SiO J=1-0 v=3 to v=1&2 lines. Two
overlap lines of H2O (i.e., 11(6,6) nu_2=1 -> 12(7,5) nu_2=0 and 5(0,5) nu_2=2
-> 6(3,4) nu_2=1) might explain these correlation if these overlap lines become
stronger with increase of infrared colors, although the phenomena also might be
explained by more fundamental ways if we take into account the variation of
opacity from object to object.

a generalized $\mu$-$\tau$ (called 23) symmetry in place of the discrete

Higgs induced flavour changing neutral currents (FCNC) vanish as in case of
NFC. 23 breaking introduces SPCV, a phase in $V$ and suppressed FCNC among

a hierarchy $|F_{12}^{d,u}|<|F_{13}^{d,u}|<|F_{23}^{d,u}|$ with the result that
the FCNC can have observable consequences in $B$ mixing without conflicting

many-level quantum dot driven by time-dependent signals applied at the contacts
to the leads. If the barriers oscillate out of phase the system operates like a
turnstile pump under a finite constant bias, as observed in the experiments of
Kouwenhoven {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 67}, 1626 (1991)]. The
time-dependent currents and their averages over succesive pumping periods are
computed from the Keldysh formalism for tight-binding models. The calculation
considers a sudden application of the pumping potentials at $t=0$ which leads
to transient features of the time-dependent and averaged currents during the
first pumping cycles which turn out to be important in the high-frequency
regime. We show that in the transient regime the efficiency of the system as a
pump is rather poor because it mainly absorbs charge from both leads in order
to fill the levels located below the bias window. Under a finite bias and a
low-frequency pumping signal the charge transferred across the system depends

However, its feasibility depends on whether the growing mode of Bardeen

curvature perturbation after phase transition. In this note, we phenomenally
regard this slow expansion as that driven by multi NEC violating scalar fields.
We calculate the curvature perturbation induced by the entropy perturbation

from simultaneous fits to 13 absorption lines indicate an orbital velocity

offset from the white dwarf ephemeris by +0.1. Our offset and velocity
amplitude are very similar to constraints derived from optical emission lines
from the quiescent accretion disk, despite the fact that we are probing
material much closer to the primary. If we associate the UV amplitude with K_1,
our dynamical constraints together with the K_2 estimates from Steeghs et al.
(2001) and the known binary inclination of i=77+/-2 imply 0.88<M_1<1.53 M_sun,
0.078 < M_2 < 0.13 M_sun and 0.075<q=M_2/M_1<0.101. If we interpret the mean
velocity of the UV lines (-16+/-4 km/s) as being due to the gravitational
red-shift caused in the high-g environment near the white dwarf, we find
v_grav=56+/-5 km/s which provides an independent estimate on the mass of the
primary of M_1=0.85+/-0.04 M_sun when coupled with a mass-radius relation. Our
primary mass estimates are in excellent agreement and are also self-consistent
with spectrophotometric fits to the UV fluxes despite the observed phase
offset. It is at this point unclear what causes the observed phase-offset in

using both slow rotation and Cowling approximation. The equilibrium stellar
models are relativistic polytropes where differential rotation is described by
the relativistic j-constant rotation law. The oscillation spectrum is studied
versus three main parameters: the stellar compactness $M/R$, the degree of
differential rotation $A$ and the number of maximun couplings $\ell_{\rm max}$.
It is shown that the rotational splitting of the non-axisymmetric modes is
strongly enhached by increasing the compactness of the star and the degree of
differential rotation. Finally, we investigate the relation between the
fundamental quadrupole mode and the corotation band of differentially rotating
stars.

In 1905 the perception of reality changed through the introduction of
relativism in three levels of the reference systems: the ego-other relation,
the world perceived by the senses, and the 'ideal' universe of the concepts. We
will try to identify how this change was expressed and developed in the cited

the mean force to obtain the potential of mean force and hence the chemical
potential. The scheme is valid at any coverage and temperature, so that in
principle it allows the calculation of the chemical potential as a function of
coverage and temperature. It avoids all statistical mechanical approximations,
except for the use of classical statistical mechanics for the nuclei, and
assumes nothing in advance about the adsorption sites. From the chemical
potential, the absolute desorption rate of the molecules can be computed,
provided the equilibration rate on the surface is faster than the desorption
rate. We apply the theory by {\em ab initio} m.d. simulation to the case of
H$_2$O on MgO (001) in the low-coverage limit, using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof

of magnitude greater than the value of $10^{13}$ s$^{-1}$ often assumed in the

energy may be too low, but the extension of the calculations to higher
coverages is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. The possibility of

and only if $p>h(S),$ where $h(S)$ denotes the so-called height of the surface
$S.$ For non-analytic finite type $S$ we obtain the same statement with the
exception of the exponent $p=h(S).$ Our notion of height $h(S)$ is closely
related to A. N. Varchenko's notion of height $h(\phi)$ for functions $\phi$
such that $S$ can be locally represented as the graph of $\phi$ after a
rotation of coordinates.

conjecture by E.M. Stein and its generalization by A. Iosevich and E. Sawyer on
the connection between the decay rate of the Fourier transform of the surface
measure on $S$ and the $L^p$-boundedness of the associated maximal operator
$\M$, and a conjecture by Iosevich and Sawyer which relates the
$L^p$-boundedness of $\M$ to an integrability condition on $S$ for the distance
function to tangential hyperplanes, in dimension three.

the uncertainties inherent in earlier DFT calculations of the melting curve of
Mo, by using the ``reference coexistence'' technique to determine the melting
curve. In this technique, an empirical reference model (here, the embedded-atom
model) is accurately fitted to DFT molecular dynamics data on the liquid and
the high-temperature solid, the melting curve of the reference model is
determined by simulations of coexisting solid and liquid, and the ab initio
melting curve is obtained by applying free-energy corrections. Our calculated
melting curve agrees well with experiment at ambient pressure and is consistent
with shock data at high pressure, but does not agree with the high pressure
melting curve deduced from static compression experiments. Calculated results
for the radial distribution function show that the short-range atomic order of
the liquid is very similar to that of the high-T solid, with a slight decrease
of coordination number on passing from solid to liquid. The electronic
densities of states in the two phases show only small differences. The results
do not support a recent theory according to which very low dTm/dP values are
expected for b.c.c. transition metals because of electron redistribution

whenever a normalizable zero mode exists, and the effects of zero energy
graviton resonant modes coming from the contributions of massive KK modes. We
first consider a compactified version of the GRS model and find that
quasi-localized gravity is characterized by a scale for which both the
resonance and the zero mode have significant contribution to 4D gravity. Above
this scale, gravity is primarily mediated by the zero mode, while the resonance
gives only minor corrections. Next, we consider an asymmetric version of the
standard non-compact GRS model, characterized by different cosmological
constants on each AdS side. We show that a resonance is present but the
asymmetry, through the form of the localizing potential, can weaken it,
resulting in a shorter lifetime and, thus, in a shorter distance scale for 4D
gravity. As a third model exhibiting quasi-localization, we consider a version

by developing a graph-theoretic classification of the set of all configurations
which extends the spanning tree formulation of close-packed dimers. With this
formalism, we can address the question of the possible motion of the vacancy
induced by dimer slidings. We find a probability 57/4-10Sqrt[2] for the vacancy
to be strictly jammed in an infinite system. More generally, the size
distribution of the domain accessible to the vacancy is characterized by a
power law decay with exponent 9/8. On a finite system, the probability that a
vacancy in the bulk can reach the boundary falls off as a power law of the
system size with exponent 1/4. The resultant weak localization of vacancies
still allows for unbounded diffusion, characterized by a diffusion exponent
that we relate to that of diffusion on spanning trees. We also implement
numerical simulations of the model with both free and periodic boundary
conditions.

to view the scheduler as an adversary: an entity trying to falsify the safety
property. We show that in the context of security protocols, and in particular
of anonymizing protocols, this gives the adversary too much power; for
instance, the contents of encrypted messages and internal computations by the
parties should be considered invisible to the adversary.
  We restrict the class of schedulers to a class of admissible schedulers which
better model adversarial behaviour. These admissible schedulers base their
decision solely on the past behaviour of the system that is visible to the
adversary.
  Using this, we propose a definition of anonymity: for all admissible
schedulers the identity of the users and the observations of the adversary are
independent stochastic variables. We also develop a proof technique for typical
cases that can be used to proof anonymity: a system is anonymous if it is
possible to `exchange' the behaviour of two users without the adversary
`noticing'.

gravitationally coupled to matter and evade gravitational tests thanks to two

enough to induce a short ranged fifth force. In other cases, non-linear effects
imply the existence of a thin shell effect shielding compact bodies from each
other and leading to an irrelevant fifth force. We also mention how a natural
extension of chameleon theories can play a role to solve the PVLAS versus CAST
discrepancy.

that they take precisely the form of wedge states. As a guideline we first
re-demonstrate this relation for the matter part. Then we turn to the ghosts.
On the way we face the problem of `diagonalizing' infinite rectangular

the eigenvalues we obtain satisfy the recursion relations of the wedge states.

  modified comments, minor changes",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Observational cosmology provides us with a large number of high precision
data which are used to derive models trying to reproduce ``on the mean'' our
observable patch of the Universe. Most of these attempts are achieved in the
framework of a Friedmann-Lema\^itre cosmology where large scale homogeneity is
assumed. However, we know, from the observation of structures at increasing
scales, that these models are only approximations of a smoothed or averaged
inhomogeneous underlying patern. Anyhow, when modelling the Universe, the usual
method is to use continuous functions representing the kinematical scalars of
the velocity field, implicitly assuming that they represent volume averages of
the corresponding fine-scale inhomogeneous quantities, then put them into the
Einstein equations which are solved to give the model and its dependance upon a
number of parameters arbitrarily defined. In General Relativity, such a method
is very much involved since the equations which determine the metric tensor and
the quantities calculated from it are highly nonlinear. The question raised by
the method consisting of determining the parameters of an a priori assumed FLRW
model from observational data is the ``fitting problem'' brought to general
attention by Ellis and Stoeger in the 80's. This problem has recently
experienced a reniewed attention due to the amount of available data and the
increase of the minimum scale at which homogeneity can be assumed. We propose a
discussion of this issue in the light of the latest developments of
observational and theoretical cosmology.
