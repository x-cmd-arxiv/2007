SVOAs exist only for half-integral central charges. It is described how
self-dual SVOAs can be constructed from self-dual VOAs of larger central
charge. The analogy with integral lattices and binary codes is emphasized.
  One main result is the construction of the shorter Moonshine module, a
self-dual SVOA of central charge 23.5 on which the Baby monster - the second
largest sporadic simple group - acts by automorphisms. The shorter Moonshine
module has the character q^(-47/48)*(1+ 4371q^(3/2)+ 96256q^2+ 1143745q^(5/2)

analog are the shorter Leech lattice and shorter Golay code. We conjecture that
the shorter Moonshine module is the unique SVOA with this character.
  The final chapter introduces the notion of extremal VOAs and SVOAs. These are
self-dual (S)VOAs with character having the same first few coefficients as the
vacuum representation of the Virasoro algebra of the same central charge. We
show that extremal VOAs exist at least for the central charges 8, 16, 24, 32,

inflation, incorporating the effects of moduli stabilization. We consider the
potential for D3-brane motion in a warped conifold background that includes
fluxes and holomorphically-embedded D7-branes involved in moduli stabilization.
Although the D7-branes significantly modify the inflaton potential, they do not
correct the quadratic term in the potential, and hence do not cause a uniform
change in the slow-roll parameter eta. Nevertheless, we present a simple
example based on the Kuperstein embedding of D7-branes, z_1=constant, in which
the potential can be fine-tuned to be sufficiently flat for inflation. To
derive this result, it is essential to incorporate the fact that the
compactification volume changes slightly as the D3-brane moves. We stress that
the compactification geometry dictates certain relationships among the
parameters in the inflaton Lagrangian, and these microscopic constraints impose
severe restrictions on the space of possible models. We note that the shape of
the final inflaton potential differs from projections given in earlier studies:
in configurations where inflation occurs, it does so near an inflection point.
Finally, we comment on the difficulty of making precise cosmological
predictions in this scenario. This is the companion paper to arXiv:0705.3837.

we provide a counterexample showing that our results are best possible, in a
certain sense. A novel result about the structure of the solution of the
utility-maximization problem where prices are modeled by continuous
semimartingales is established as an offshoot of the proof of our central
theorem.

determine the velocity moments through fourth degree in the simple shear flow
state. First, the rheological properties (which are related to the
second-degree velocity moments) are {\em exactly} evaluated in terms of the
coefficient of restitution $\alpha$ and the (reduced) shear rate $a^*$. For a
given value of $\alpha$, the above transport properties decrease with
increasing shear rate. Moreover, as expected, the third-degree and the
asymmetric fourth-degree moments vanish in the long time limit when they are
scaled with the thermal speed. On the other hand, as in the case of elastic
collisions, our results show that, for a given value of $\alpha$, the scaled
symmetric fourth-degree moments diverge in time for shear rates larger than a
certain critical value $a_c^*(\alpha)$ which decreases with increasing
dissipation. The explicit shear-rate dependence of the fourth-degree moments
below this critical value is also obtained.

comes from modified semi core-valence interaction. We examine this often used
approximation in great detail and find that although bandgap changes as large
as 0.63 eV for GaAs, 0.42 eV for GaP and 0.46 eV for GaN are obtained within
this approach for U= 20 eV on the Ga d states, only 0.1 eV, 0.1 eV and 0.15 eV

increased, the bandgap keeps improving. We trace this effect primarily to the
interaction of the Ga 4d states in the conduction band with the anion p states.

sub-structure within these clusters. This multitude of scales calls for

local group spiral galaxy M33, based on a new implementation of the Minimum
Spanning Tree (MST) method. Unlike previous studies which limited themselves to
a single spatial scale, we study star-forming structures from the effective
resolution limit (~20pc) to kpc scales. We find evidence for a continuum of
star-forming group sizes, from pc to kpc scales. We do not find a
characteristic scale for OB associations, unlike that found in previous
studies, and we suggest that the appearance of such a scale was caused by
spatial resolution and selection effects. The luminosity function of the groups
is found to be well represented by a power-law with an index, -2, similar to
that found for clusters and GMCs. Additionally, the groups follow a similar
mass-radius relation as GMCs. The size distribution of the groups is best
described by a log-normal distribution and we show that within a hierarchical
distribution, if a scale is selected to find structure, the resulting size
distribution will have a log-normal distribution. We find an abrupt drop of the
number of groups outside a galactic radius of ~4kpc, suggesting a change in the
structure of the star-forming ISM, possibly reflected in the lack of GMCs

CFHT images allowed us to pinpoint the location of the progenitor site on the
ground based observations. We find that a source visible in the B and R band
pre-explosion images close to the position of the SN is (1) not coincident with
the SN position within the uncertainties of our relative astrometry, and (2) is
still visible ~ 4.7 yrs post-explosion in late-time observations taken with the
William Herschel Telescope. We therefore conclude that it is not the progenitor
of SN 2002ap. Comparing our luminosity limits with stellar models of single
stars at appropriate metallicity (Z=0.008) we conclude that any single star
progenitor must have experienced at least twice the standard mass loss rates
during pre-Wolf-Rayet evolution, been initially > 30-40M(Sun) and exploded as a
Wolf-Rayet star of final mass 10-12M(Sun). Alternatively an initially less
massive progenitor may have evolved in an interacting binary system. We
constrain any possible binary companion to a main sequence star of < 20M(Sun),
a neutron star or a black hole. By combining the pre-explosion limits with the
ejecta mass estimates and constraints from X-ray and radio observations we
conclude that any binary interaction most likely occurred as Case B mass
transfer, either with or without a subsequent common envelope evolution phase.

  This paper initiates a systematic investigation of the situations where

proposes a typology of exchanged messages. A communication method, based on

illustrate the proposed framework system, an example is presented related to

also show emission lines of Cl, Fe, P, and atomic Hydrogen, and/or absorption
features from C_2H_2, HCN, and OH. We employ diagnostics based on the
fine-structure lines, as well as the EWs and luminosities of PAH features and
the strength of the 9.7um silicate absorption feature (S_sil), to explore the
power source behind the infrared emission in ULIRGs. We show that the IR
emission from the majority of ULIRGs is powered mostly by star formation, with
only ~20% of ULIRGs hosting an AGN with a comparable or greater IR luminosity
than the starburst. The detection of the 14.32um [NeV] line in just under half
the sample however implies that an AGN contributes significantly to the mid-IR
flux in ~42% of ULIRGs. The emission line ratios, luminosities and PAH EWs are
consistent with the starbursts and AGN in ULIRGs being more extincted, and for
the starbursts more compact, versions of those in lower luminosity systems. The
excitations and electron densities in the NLRs of ULIRGs appear comparable to
those of lower luminosity starbursts, though there is evidence that the NLR gas
in ULIRGs is more dense. We show that the combined luminosity of the 12.81um
[NeII] and 15.56um [NeIII] lines correlates with both IR luminosity and the
luminosity of the 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron PAH features in ULIRGs, and use
this to derive a calibration between PAH luminosity and star formation rate.
Finally, we show that ULIRGs with 0.8 < S_sil < 2.4 are likely to be powered
mainly by star formation, but that ULIRGs with S_sil < 0.8, and possibly those
with S_sil > 2.4, contain an IR-luminous AGN.

absorbers in the redshift range 0.3 < z < 2.5. We compare and supplement this
sample with 23 strong MgII absorbers at 0.4 < z < 1.4 observed previously with
HIRES/Keck. We find that neither equivalent width nor kinematic spread (the
optical depth weighted second moment of velocity) of MgII2796 evolve. However,
the kinematic spread is sensitive to the highest velocity component, and
therefore not as sensitive to additional weak components at intermediate
velocities relative to the profile center. The fraction of absorbing pixels
within the full velocity range of the system does show a trend of decreasing
with decreasing redshift. Most high redshift systems (14/20) exhibit absorption
over the entire system velocity range, which differs from the result for low
redshift systems (18/36) at the 95% level. This leads to a smaller number of
separate subsystems for high redshift systems because weak absorping components
tend to connect the stronger regions of absorption. We hypothesize that low
redshift MgII profiles are more likely to represent well formed galaxies, many
of which have kinematics consistent with a disk/halo structure. High redshift
MgII profiles are more likely to show evidence of complex protogalactic
structures, with multiple accretion or outflow events. Although these results
are derived from measurements of gas kinematics, they are consistent with
hierarchical galaxy formation evidenced by deep galaxy surveys.

magnitudes M_V < -4 are highly dark matter-dominated, with mass-to-light ratios
approaching 1000. The measured velocity dispersions are inversely correlated
with their luminosities, indicating that a minimum mass for luminous galactic
systems may not yet have been reached. We also measure the metallicities of the
observed stars and find that the 6 brightest of the ultra-faint dwarfs extend
the luminosity-metallicity relationship followed by brighter dwarfs by 2 orders
of magnitude in luminosity; several of these objects have mean metallicities as
low as [Fe/H] = -2.3 and therefore represent some of the most metal-poor known
stellar systems. We detect metallicity spreads of up to 0.5 dex in several
objects, suggesting multiple star formation epochs. Having established the
masses of the ultra-faint dwarfs, we re-examine the missing satellite problem.
After correcting for the sky coverage of the SDSS, we find that the ultra-faint
dwarfs substantially alleviate the discrepancy between the predicted and
observed numbers of satellites around the Milky Way, but there are still a
factor of ~4 too few dwarf galaxies over a significant range of masses. We show
that if galaxy formation in low-mass dark matter halos is strongly suppressed

the formation of large-scale structure. Unfortunately, it is difficult to study
merger properties and evolution directly because the identification of cluster
mergers in observations is problematic. We use large N-body simulations to
study the statistical properties of massive halo mergers, specifically
investigating the utility of close halo pairs as proxies for mergers. We
examine the relationship between pairs and mergers for a wide range of merger
timescales, halo masses, and redshifts (0<z<1). We also quantify the utility of
pairs in measuring merger bias. While pairs at very small separations will
reliably merge, these constitute a small fraction of the total merger
population. Thus, pairs do not provide a reliable direct proxy to the total
merger population. We do find an intriguing universality in the relation
between close pairs and mergers, which in principle could allow for an estimate
of the statistical merger rate from the pair fraction within a scaled
separation, but including the effects of redshift space distortions strongly
degrades this relation. We find similar behavior for galaxy-mass halos, making
our results applicable to field galaxy mergers at high redshift. We investigate
how the halo merger rate can be statistically described by the halo mass
function via the merger kernel (coagulation), finding an interesting
environmental dependence of merging: halos within the mass resolution of our
simulations merge less efficiently in overdense environments. Specifically,
halo pairs with separations less than a few Mpc/h are more likely to merge in
underdense environments; at larger separations, pairs are more likely to merge
in overdense environments.

evolution, we find that the host spheroids had smaller luminosity and stellar
velocity dispersion than today for a fixed M. The offsets correspond to Delta
log L_B,0=0.40+-0.11+-0.15 (Delta log M = 0.51+-0.14+-0.19) and Delta log sigma
= 0.13+-0.03+-0.05 (Delta log M = 0.54+-0.12+-0.21), respectively for the M-L

selection effects shows that they cannot account for the observed offset. The
data are inconsistent with pure luminosity evolution and the existence of
universal and tight scaling relations. To obey the three local scaling
relations by z=0 the distant spheroids have to grow their stellar mass by
approximately 60% (\Delta log M_sph=0.20+-0.14) in the next 4 billion years.
The measured evolution can be expressed as M/ M_sph ~ (1+z)^{1.5+-1.0}. Based

of LRGs in clusters unless these accreted LRGs merge or disrupt on relatively
short timescales (~2Gyr). These timescales are consistent with classical
dynamical friction arguments, and imply that 2-3 LRGs have merged or disrupted
within each halo more massive than 10^14Msun by z=0. The total amount of
stellar mass brought into these massive halos by z=0 is consistent with
observations once the intracluster light (ICL) is included. If disrupted LRGs

recent observations of the Virgo cluster. Finally, we point out that these

Spatially-resolved spectroscopy indicates a large foreground absorption
($N_{\rm H}$ $\sim$ 3.5 $\times$ 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$), which supports a
relatively distant location ($d$ $\sim$ 5 kpc) for the SNR. The blast wave is
encountering a highly inhomogeneous ambient medium with the densities ranging
over more than an order of magnitude ($n_0$ $\sim$ 0.1 $-$ 4 cm$^{-3}$).

a density gradient whose direction lies roughly along the line of sight. The
faint central region shows strong line emission from heavy elements of Si and
Fe, which is caused by the presence of the overabundant stellar ejecta there.

their associated statistics and distributions for the complex analytic field,

nonstationarity. A general solution of the Fokker--Planck equation is obtained

recovering sparse models from sparse data. This line of work shows that
$\ell_1$-regularized least squares regression can accurately estimate a sparse
linear model from $n$ noisy examples in $p$ dimensions, even if $p$ is much
larger than $n$. In this paper we study a variant of this problem where the
original $n$ input variables are compressed by a random linear transformation
to $m \ll n$ examples in $p$ dimensions, and establish conditions under which a
sparse linear model can be successfully recovered from the compressed data. A
primary motivation for this compression procedure is to anonymize the data and
preserve privacy by revealing little information about the original data. We
characterize the number of random projections that are required for
$\ell_1$-regularized compressed regression to identify the nonzero coefficients
in the true model with probability approaching one, a property called
``sparsistence.'' In addition, we show that $\ell_1$-regularized compressed
regression asymptotically predicts as well as an oracle linear model, a
property called ``persistence.'' Finally, we characterize the privacy
properties of the compression procedure in information-theoretic terms,
establishing upper bounds on the mutual information between the compressed and

of substructure, which we interpret as the result of differential extinction
across the projected face of the cluster. With this interpretation, we are able
to construct a spatially resolved extinction map across the cluster which is
used to derive the intrinsic flux distribution. Fitting cluster profiles (King
and EFF) to the intrinsic images we find that the cluster is 15-30% larger than
previous estimates, and that no strong evidence of mass segregation in this
cluster exists. Using the optical spectra, we find that the age of M82F is
60-80 Myr and from its velocity conclude that the cluster is not physically
associated with a large HII region that it is projected upon, both in agreement
with previous studies. The reconstructed integral field maps show that that
majority of the line emission comes from a nearby HII region. The spatial
dependence of the line widths (implying the presence of multiple
components)measured corresponds to the extinction map derived from photometry,
indicating that the gas/dust clouds responsible for the extinction are also
partially ionised. Even with the wealth of observations presented here, we do
not find a conclusive solution to the problem of the high light-to-mass ratio

substrates by applying the isomorphism between an alloy and the Ising model
(conserved order parameter). The annealing temperature $T$ of the mixture then
is a continuous parameter that characterizes the different sets of substrates,
shaping the deposition process. As the alloy undergoes an order-disorder phase
transition at the Onsager critical temperature ($T_{c}$), the jamming and
percolating properties of the dimers deposited over the substrate are subjected
to non-trivial changes. These are reflected in a density-temperature phase
diagram with three well-defined regions. We find that for $T < T^* = 1.22
T_{c}$ the occurrence of jamming prevents the onset of percolating clusters,
while percolation is possible for $T > T^{*}$. Particular attention is focused
close to $T^{*}$, where the interplay between jamming and percolation restricts
fluctuations, forcing exponents seemingly different from the standard
percolation universality class. By analogy with a thermal transition, we study
the onset of percolation by using the {\it temperature} (in this case, the
substrate annealing temperature) as a control parameter. By proposing thermal
scaling Ansatzes we analyze the behavior of the percolation threshold and its
thermally induced fluctuations. Also, the fractal dimension of the percolating
cluster is determined. Based on these measurements and the excellent data
collapsing, we conclude that the universality class of standard percolation is
preserved for all temperatures.

to Planet-forming Disks'' (c2d) is to determine the frequency of remnant
circumstellar disks around weak-line T Tauri stars (wTTs) and to study the
properties and evolutionary status of these disks. Here we present a census of
disks for a sample of over 230 spectroscopically identified wTTs located in the
c2d IRAC (3.6, 4.5, 4.8, and 8.0 um) and MIPS (24 um) maps of the Ophiuchus,
Lupus, and Perseus Molecular Clouds. We find that ~20% of the wTTs in a
magnitude limited subsample have noticeable IR-excesses at IRAC wavelengths
indicating the presence of a circumstellar disk. The disk frequencies we find
in these 3 regions are ~3-6 times larger than that recently found for a sample
of 83 relatively isolated wTTs located, for the most part, outside the highest
extinction regions covered by the c2d IRAC and MIPS maps. The disk fractions we
find are more consistent with those obtained in recent Spitzer studies of wTTs
in young clusters such as IC 348 and Tr 37. From their location in the H-R
diagram, we find that, in our sample, the wTTs with excesses are among the
younger part of the age distribution. Still, up to ~50% of the apparently
youngest stars in the sample show no evidence of IR excess, suggesting that the
circumstellar disks of a sizable fraction of pre-main-sequence stars dissipate
in a timescale of ~1 Myr. We also find that none of the stars in our sample
apparently older than ~10 Myrs have detectable circumstellar disks at
wavelengths < 24 um. Also, we find that the wTTs disks in our sample exhibit a
wide range of properties (SED morphology, inner radius, L_DISK/L*, etc) which
bridge the gaps observed between the cTTs and the debris disk regimes.

this indicator to full-sky temperature maps we found a statistically

number fields, behave like differential structures on a smooth manifold.
  As one does for differential manifolds, we will use pseudogroups of affine
transformations to define affine atlases on a ringed space. An atlas on a space
is said to be an affine structure if it is maximal. An affine structure is
admissible if there is a sheaf on the underlying space such that they are
coincide on all affine charts, which are in deed affine open sets of a scheme.
In a rigour manner, a scheme is defined to be a ringed space with a specified
affine structure if the affine structures are in action in some special cases
such as analytical spaces of algebraic schemes. Particularly, by the whole of
affine structures on a space, we will obtain respectively necessary and
sufficient conditions that two spaces are homeomorphic and that two schemes are
isomorphic, which are the two main theorems of the paper. It follows that the

the points where the condensate becomes unstable and ultimately forms a vortex
lattice. We highlight the key features of having a quantized vortex in the
initial condensate. In particular, we find that the presence of the vortex
causes the instabilities to shift to lower or higher rotation frequencies,
depending on the direction of the vortex relative to the trap rotation.

We construct a dual framework for analyzing the phases of the system. In this

footing, bridging the usual gap of connecting tachyon condensation to
modifications of geometry. This allows us to construct in a natural way a

universe that focus on gas at very high densities and very low metallicities.
We argue that the gas in the central regions of protogalactic halos will
fragment as long as it carries sufficient angular momentum. Rotation leads to
the build-up of massive disk-like structures which fragment to form protostars.
At metallicities Z ~ 10^-5 Zsun, dust cooling becomes effective and leads to a
sudden drop of temperature at densities above n = 10^12 cm^-3. This induces
vigorous fragmentation, leading to a very densely-packed cluster of low-mass
stars. This is the first stellar cluster. The mass function of stars peaks
below 1 Msun, similar to what is found in the solar neighborhood, and
comparable to the masses of the very-low metallicity subgiant stars recently
discovered in the halo of our Milky Way. We find that even purely primordial
gas can fragment at densities 10^14 cm^-3 < n < 10^16 cm^-3, although the
resulting mass function contains only a few objects (at least a factor of ten
less than the Z = 10^-5 Zsun mass function), and is biased towards higher
masses. A similar result is found for gas with Z = 10^-6 Zsun. Gas with Z <=
10^-6 Zsun behaves roughly isothermally at these densities (with polytropic
exponent gamma ~ 1.06) and the massive disk-like structures that form due to
angular momentum conservation will be marginally unstable. As fragmentation is
less efficient, we expect stars with Z <= 10^-6 Zsun to be massive, with masses
in excess of several tens of solar masses, consistent with the results from
previous studies.

phase diagram is studied as a function of the amplitude of the attraction for a
certain fixed amplitude of the long ranged repulsion. We find that the effect
of the repulsion is to substitute the liquid-vapor critical point and a portion
of the associated liquid-vapor transition line, by two first order transitions.
One of these transitions separates the vapor from a fluid of spherical
liquidlike clusters; the other separates the liquid from a fluid of spherical
voids. At low temperature, the two transition lines intersect one another and a
vapor-liquid transition line at a triple point. While most integral equation

to constrain a combination of the cosmological parameter Omega_m and the
luminosity bias of the 2MASS survey. For this constraint to be as tight as
possible, it is necessary to maximize the correlation between the two dipoles.
This can be achieved by optimizing the survey window through which the flux
dipole is measured. Here we explicitly construct such a window for the 2MASS
survey. The optimization in essence reduces to excluding from the calculation
of the flux dipole galaxies brighter than some limiting magnitude K_min of the
near-infrared K_s band. This exclusion mitigates nonlinear effects and shot
noise from small scales, which decorrelate the 2MASS dipole from the CMB
dipole. Under the assumption of negligible shot noise we find that the optimal
value of K_min is about five. Inclusion of shot noise shifts the optimal K_min
to larger values. We present an analytical formula for shot noise for the 2MASS
flux dipole, to be used in follow-up work with 2MASS data.
  The misalignment angle between the two dipoles is a sensitive measure of
their correlation: the higher the correlation, the smaller the expectation
value of the angle. A minimum of the misalignment is thus a sign of the optimal
gravity window. We model analytically the distribution function for the
misalignment angle and show that the misalignment estimated by Maller et al. is
consistent with the assumed underlying model (though it is greater than the
expectation value). We predict with about 90% confidence that the misalignment
will decrease if 2MASS galaxies brighter than K_min = 5 mag are excluded from
the calculation of the flux dipole. This prediction has been indirectly
confirmed by the results of Erdogdu et al. (ABRIDGED)

the indentation radius $r_0$, in contrast to a bulk supercondutor in the

importance in processes such as rumors or fads propagation, spread of product

tracking a specific information when it is transmitted by people, most
understanding of information spreading in social networks comes from models or
indirect measurements. Here we present an integrated experimental and
theoretical framework to understand and quantitatively predict how and when
information spreads over social networks. Using data collected in Viral
Marketing campaigns that reached over 31,000 individuals in eleven European
markets, we show the large degree of variability of the participants' actions,
despite them being confronted with the common task of receiving and forwarding
the same piece of information. This have a profound effect on information
diffusion: Firstly, most of the transmission takes place due to super-spreading
events which would be considered extraordinary in population-average models.
Secondly, due to the different way individuals schedule information
transmission we observe a slowing down of the spreading of information in
social networks that happens in logarithmic time. Quantitative description of
the experiments is possible through an stochastic branching process which
corroborates the importance of heterogeneity. Since high variability of both
the intensity and frequency of human responses are found in many other
activities, our findings are pertinent to many other human driven diffusion
processes like rumors, fads, innovations or news which has important
consequences for organizations management, communications, marketing or
electronic social communities.

mechanism is turned off. We discuss analytically the case of the invasion by a

of the cross-over length scale \ell in the possible explanation of the
dark-matter phenomenon in astrophysics and in cosmology. Observations of the 21
cm line from neutral hydrogen clouds in spiral galaxies reveal that the
rotational velocities remain nearly constant at a value v_c ~ 10^{-3}--10^{-4}
in the units of the speed of light in the region of the galactic halo. Using
the smallness of v_c, we develop a perturbative scheme for reconstructing the
metric in a galactic halo. In the leading order of expansion in v_c, at the
distances r \gtrsim v_c \ell, our result reproduces that obtained in the
Randall-Sundrum braneworld model. This inequality is satisfied in a real spiral
galaxy such as our Milky Way for distances r ~ 3 kpc, at which the rotational
velocity curve becomes flat, v_c ~ 7 \times 10^{-4}, if \ell \lesssim 2 Mpc.
The gravitational situation in this case can be approximately described by the
Einstein equations with the so-called Weyl fluid playing the role of dark
matter. In the region near the gravitating body, we derive a closed system of
equations for static spherically symmetric situation under the approximation of
zero anisotropic stress of the Weyl fluid. We find the Schwarzschild metric to
be an approximate vacuum solution of these equations at distances r \lesssim
(r_g \ell^2)^{1/3}. The value \ell \lesssim 2 Mpc complies well with the
solar-system tests. At the same time, in cosmology, a low-density braneworld
with \ell of this order of magnitude can mimic the expansion properties of the
high-density LCDM (lambda + cold dark matter) universe at late times. Combined
observations of galactic rotation curves and gravitational lensing can possibly
discriminate between the higher-dimensional effects and dark matter.

relaxed for the soft SUSY-breaking contributions to the Higgs masses. Assuming

gamma-ray burst afterglow that shows a break in the X-ray lightcurve, while the
optical counterpart decays as a single power-law. This burst has an optically
bright afterglow of 16.5 magnitude, detected throughout the 170-650nm spectral
range of the UVOT on-board Swift. Observations began with the XRT and UVOT
telescopes 286s after the initial trigger and continued for 1.2 x 10^6s. The
X-ray lightcurve consists of three power-law segments: a rise until 420s,
followed by a slow decay with alpha_2 = 0.63 +/- 0.03 until 5000s, after which,
the lightcurve decays faster with a slope of alpha_3 = 1.59 +/- 0.03. The
optical lightcurve decays as a single power-law with alpha_O = 0.82 +/- 0.03
throughout the observation. The X-ray data on their own are consistent with the
break at 5000s being due to the end of energy injection. Modelling the optical
to X-ray spectral energy distribution, we find that the optical afterglow can
not be produced by the same component as the X-ray emission at late times,
ruling out a single component afterglow. We therefore considered two-component
jet models and find that the X-ray and optical emission is best reproduced by a
model in which both components are energy injected for the duration of the
observed afterglow and the X-ray break at 5000s is due to a jet break in the
narrow component. This bright, well-observed burst is likely a guide for
interpreting the surprising finding of Swift that bursts seldom display
achromatic jet breaks.

investigate the mutual friction damping, providing results that demonstrate the
well-known fact that sound waves propagating along a vortex array are undamped.
We show that the same is not true for inertial waves, which are damped by the
mutual friction regardless of the propagation direction. We then include the
vortex tension, which arises due to local vortex curvature. Focussing on purely
transverse inertial waves, we derive the small correction that the tension
induces in the wave frequency. Finally, we allow for a relative linear flow in
the background (along the rotation axis). In this case we show how the mutual

the gradient expansion approach. We adopt the uniform Hubble slicing and derive
the general solution valid to $O(\epsilon^2)$, where $\epsilon$ is the
expansion parameter associated with a spatial derivative, which includes both
the scalar and tensor modes. In particular, the $O(\epsilon^2)$ correction
terms to the nonlinear curvature perturbation, which become important in models
with a non-slowroll stage during inflation, are explicitly obtained.

Recent experimental data shows that sizes of ion channels are compared to those
of ions and that only few ions may be simultaneously in any single channel.
Theoretical description of ion transport in such channels should therefore take
into account interactions between ions and between ions and channel proteins.
This is not satisfied by macroscopic continuum models based on
Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations. More realistic descriptions of ion transport
are offered by microscopic Brownian and molecular dynamics. One should also
take into account a dynamical character of the channel structure. This is not

  of general deployment distribution models and new results ragarding almost
  sure convergence and minimax convergence rates. Submitted to Transactions on
  Signal Processing",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  The reconstruction of a deterministic data field from binary-quantized noisy
observations of sensors which are randomly deployed over the field domain is
studied. The study focuses on the extremes of lack of deterministic control in
the sensor deployment, lack of knowledge of the noise distribution, and lack of
sensing precision and reliability. Such adverse conditions are motivated by
possible real-world scenarios where a large collection of low-cost, crudely
manufactured sensors are mass-deployed in an environment where little can be
assumed about the ambient noise. A simple estimator that reconstructs the
entire data field from these unreliable, binary-quantized, noisy observations
is proposed. Technical conditions for the almost sure and integrated mean
squared error (MSE) convergence of the estimate to the data field, as the
number of sensors tends to infinity, are derived and their implications are
discussed. For finite-dimensional, bounded-variation, and
Sobolev-differentiable function classes, specific integrated MSE decay rates
are derived. For the first and third function classes these rates are found to
be minimax order optimal with respect to infinite precision sensing and known
noise distribution.

build bulk structures at submicron lengthscales. Thus they have significant
potential for technological applications provided adequate methods of control
can be devised. Here we describe a simple, physically realizable
pattern-control based on the notion of driven precipitation, meaning that the
phase-separation is governed by a guiding field such as, for example, a
temperature or a pH field. The phase-separation is modeled through a
non-autonomous Cahn-Hilliard equation whose spinodal is determined by the
evolving guiding field. Control over the dynamics of the spinodal gives control
over the velocity of the instability front which separates the stable and
unstable regions of the system. Since the wavelength of the pattern is largely
determined by this velocity, the distance between successive precipitation
bands becomes controllable. We demonstrate the above ideas by numerical studies
of a 1D system with diffusive guiding field. We find that the results can be
accurately described by employing a linear stability analysis (pulled-front
theory) for determining the velocity -- local-wavelength relationship. From the
perspective of the Liesegang theory, our results indicate that the so-called
revert patterns may be naturally generated by diffusive guiding fields.

the estimation is established by constructing, through the classical invariant
