detected in the SDSS DR4 dataset, we investigate the gravitational lensing and
dust extinction effects they induce on background quasars. After carefully
quantifying several selection biases, we isolate the reddening effects as a
function of redshift and absorber rest equivalent width, W_0. We find the
amount of dust to increase with cosmic time as (1+z)^(-1.1 +/- 0.4), following
the evolution of cosmic star density or integrated star formation rate. We
measure the reddening effects over a factor 30 in E(B-V) and we find the dust
column density to be proportional to W_0^(1.9 +/- 0.2), which provides an
important scaling for theoretical modeling of metal absorbers. We also measure
the dust-to-metals ratio and find it similar to that of the Milky Way.
  In contrast to previous studies, we do not detect any gravitational
magnification by MgII systems. We measure the upper limit \mu<1.10 and discuss
the origin of the discrepancy. Finally, we estimate the fraction of absorbers
missed due to extinction effects and show that it rises from 1 to 50% in the
range 1<W_0<6 Angstrom. We parametrize this effect and provide a correction for
recovering the intrinsic distribution of absorber rest equivalent widths.

geomagnetic activity. The IHV-index for a geomagnetic element is mechanically
derived from hourly values as the sum of the unsigned differences between
adjacent hours over a seven-hour interval centered on local midnight. The index
is derived separately for stations in both hemispheres within six longitude
sectors using only local night hours. It is intended as a long-term index.
Available data allows derivation of the index back well into the 19th century.
On a time scale of a 27-day Bartels rotation, IHV averages for stations with
corrected geomagnetic latitude less than 55 degrees are strongly correlated
with midlatitude range indices. Assuming a constant calibration of the aa-index
we find that observed yearly values of aa before the year 1957 are 2.9 nT too
small compared to values calculated from IHV using the regression constants
based on 1980-2004. We interpret this discrepancy as an indication that the
calibration of the aa index is in error before 1957. There is no such problem
with the ap index. Rotation averages of IHV are also strongly correlated with
solar wind parameters (BV^2). On a time scale of a year combining the IHV-index
and the recently-developed Inter-Diurnal Variability (IDV) index (giving B)
allows determination of solar wind speed, V, from 1890-present. Over the
~120-year series, the yearly mean solar wind speed varied from a low of 303
km/s in 1902 to a high value of 545 km/s in 2003. The calculated yearly values
of the product BV using B and V separately derived from IDV and IHV agree
quantitatively with (completely independent) BV derived from the amplitude of
the diurnal variation of the H component in the polar caps since 1926 and

present physical wavelengths of fluctuations backwards in time. They become
smaller and smaller until crossing the Planck scale where conventional QFT is
challenged, so that unknown ultraviolet physics may be traced in the observable
cosmological fluctuations. Usually this issue is addressed in the inflationary
context, but trans-Planckian reasoning is much broader. We examine this logic
in a simple example of scalar quantum field theory in the expanding and
contracting Milne universes, where wavelengths of the eigenmodes are red- or
blue-shifted. Trans-Planckian modifications of QFT should result in a
UV-dependent VeV of the energy momentum tensor of a scalar field in the Milne
universe. On the other hand, the Milne universe is another coordinate systems
of flat Minkowski space-time, and the covariant energy momentum tensor should
be the same (but vacuum-dependent) in different coordinates of flat space time.
We explicitly demonstrate that in conventional QFT the energy momentum tensor,
choosing the adiabatic vacuum, is identical to zero in Minkowski coordinates,
and remains zero in the contracting Milne universe (due to non-trivial
cancellations of contributions from particles which appear in the accelerating
frame and from vacuum polarization there). In contrast to this, the
trans-Planckian modification of the energy momentum tensor is not motivated. We
provide a similar argument for the expanding Milne universe, where the energy
momentum tensor in the conformal vacuum is non-zero. Similar arguments are
applicable for other cosmological models where the curvature is much lower than
Planckian which leads to conflicts with trans-Planckian considerations.

infinite-dimensional compact space which is a kind of dual object to the
infinite symmetric group. The aim of the paper is to introduce stochastic
dynamics related to the z-measures. Namely, we construct a family of diffusion
processes in the Toma simplex indexed by the same parameter z. Our diffusions
are obtained from certain Markov chains on partitions of natural numbers n in a
scaling limit as n goes to infinity. These Markov chains arise in a natural
way, due to the approximation of the infinite symmetric group by the increasing
chain of the finite symmetric groups. Each z-measure P_z serves as a unique
invariant distribution for the corresponding diffusion process, and the process
is ergodic with respect to P_z. Moreover, P_z is a symmetrizing measure, so
that the process is reversible. We describe the spectrum of its generator and
compute the associated (pre)Dirichlet form.

We show that only then is the generating functional, and hence the spectrum, of
the mirror theory a smooth function of the gauge field background. This
explains how ideas to use additional non-gauge, high-scale mirror-sector
dynamics to decouple the mirror fermions without breaking the gauge
symmetry--for example, in symmetric phases at strong mirror Yukawa
coupling--are forced to respect the anomaly-free condition when combined with
the exact lattice chiral symmetry. Our results also explain a paradox posed by
a recent numerical study of the mirror-fermion spectrum in a toy
would-be-anomalous two-dimensional theory. In passing, we prove some general
properties of the partition functions of arbitrary chiral theories on the
lattice that should be of interest for further studies in this field.

terrestrial planet orbiting within the habitable zone of its star, and the
dominant challenge in doing so is to isolate the light of the planet from that
of the star. Dynamics-based methods separate these signals temporally, whereas
imaging techniques do so spatially. In light of the overwhelming dominance of
dynamics-based methods over the past decade, we challenge the notion that
spectra of terrestrial planets necessarily require extreme imaging methods. We
advocate that some resources be committed to refining the proven technologies
of radial-velocity measurements, transit photometry, and occultation
spectroscopy (i.e. emergent infrared spectra obtained at secondary eclipse). We
see a particularly attractive opportunity in M-dwarfs, for which the habitable
zone is close to the star, increasing the probability and frequency of
transits, and the amplitude of the induced radial-velocity variation. Such
planets could be discovered by a dedicated ground-based transit survey of the
10,000 nearest M-dwarfs. The favorable planet-star contrast ratio would make
these planets ideal targets for the study of their atmospheres with the
technique of occultation spectroscopy.

circumstellar wind-blown bubbles surrounding the star, bordered by a dense
shell. When the star ends its life in a supernova (SN) explosion, the resulting
shock wave will interact with this modified medium. In a previous paper we
discussed the basic parameters of this interaction. In this paper we go a step
further and study the evolution of SNe in the wind blown bubble formed by a 35
$\msun$ star that starts off as an O star, goes through a red supergiant phase,
and ends its life as a Wolf-Rayet star. We model the evolution of the CSM and
then the expansion of the SN shock wave within this medium. Our simulations
clearly reveal fluctuations in density and pressure within the surrounding
medium. The SN shock interacting with these fluctuations, and then with the
dense shell surrounding the wind-blown cavity, gives rise to a variety of
transmitted and reflected shocks in the wind bubble. The interactions between
these various shocks and discontinuities is examined, and its effects on the
X-ray emission is noted. Our simulations reveal the presence of several
hydrodynamic instabilities. They show that the turbulent interior, coupled with
the large fluctuations in density and pressure, gives rise to an extremely
corrugated SN shock wave. The shock shows considerable wrinkles as it impacts
the dense shell, and the impact occurs in a piecemeal fashion, with some parts
of the shock wave interacting with the shell before the others. Therefore
different parts of the shell will `light-up' at different times. The
non-spherical nature of the interaction means that it will occur over a
prolonged period of time, and the spherical symmetry of the initial shock wave
is destroyed.

Eddington limit to a lower mass limit of the black hole of ~ 4 X 10^3 Msun.

might reside either in the photoionization equilibrium assumption or in

observation shows that its X-ray spectrum is best described by an absorbed
power-law and blackbody model. A comparison of the X-ray flux observed from
this source between 1980 and 2006 reveals that its absorbed 0.5-10 keV X-ray
flux decreased from ~2x10^-12 ergs cm-2 s-1 to ~3x10^-13 ergs cm-2 during this

upper limit of 14% for the 0.5-10 keV peak-to-peak pulsed fraction. A
near-infrared observation of this field shows a source with magnitude Ks =
15.9+/-0.2 near the position of 1E 1547.0-5408, but the implied X-ray to
infrared flux ratio indicates the infrared emission is from an unrelated field
source, allowing us to limit the IR magnitude of 1E 1547.0-5408 to >17.5.
Archival radio observations reveal that 1E 1547.0-5408 sits at the center of a
faint, small (4' diameter) radio shell, G327.24-0.13, which is possibly a
previously unidentified supernova remnant. The X-ray properties of 1E
1547.0-5408 suggest that this source is a magnetar - a young neutron star whose
X-ray emission is powered by the decay of its extremely strong magnetic field.
The spatial coincidence between this source and G327.24-0.13 suggests that 1E
1547.0-5408 is associated with a young supernova remnant, supporting a neutron
star interpretation. Additional observations are needed to confirm the nature
of both 1E 1547.0-5408 and G327.24-0.13, and to determine if these sources are
associated. If so, this pair will be an important addition to the small number

complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the
distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events
-- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior
holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as
least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of

return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no
indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a

We propose that the in-plane magnetic field in the bilayer system modifies the
energetics of the domain formation, since it breaks the degeneracy of two
different nematic orientations. Thus the system reveals a pure nematic phase
with a resistivity anisotropy in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. In
addition to the nematic phase, the bilayer coupling opens a novel route to a
hidden nematic phase that preserves the x-y symmetry of the Fermi surfaces.

star-forming galaxies in the high redshift universe. However, although the
sample of known emitters is increasingly growing, their nature (e.g. stellar
masses, ages, metallicities, star-formation rates) is still poorly constrained.
  Aims: We aim to study the nature of Ly-alpha-emitters, to find the properties
of a typical Ly-alpha-emitting galaxy and to compare these properties with the
properties of other galaxies at similar redshift, in particular Lyman-break
galaxies.
  Methods: We have performed narrow-band imaging at the VLT, focused on
Ly-alpha at redshift z ~ 3.15, in the GOODS-S field. We have identified a
sample of Ly-alpha-emitting candidates, and we have studied their Spectral
Energy Distributions (SEDs).
  Results: We find that the emitters are best fit by an SED with low
metallicity (Z/Z_sun = 0.005), low dust extinction (A_V ~ 0.32) and medium
stellar masses of approximately 10^9 M_sun. The age is not very well
constrained. One object out of 24 appears to be a high redshift
Ly-alpha-emitting dusty starburst galaxy. We find filamentary structure as
traced by the Ly-alpha-emitters at the 4 sigma level. The rest-frame UV SED of
these galaxies is very similar to that of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and
comply with the selection criteria for U-band drop-outs, except they are
intrinsically fainter than the current limit for LBGs.
  Conclusion: Ly-alpha-emitters are excellent probes of galaxies in the distant
universe, and represent a class of star-forming, dust and AGN free, medium mass
objects.

  Matsubara (2000)","Phys.Rev.D76:103502,2007","10.1103/PhysRevD.76.103502",,"astro-ph",,"  It is well known gravitational lensing, mainly via magnification bias,
modifies the observed galaxy/quasar clustering. Such discussions have largely
focused on the 2D angular correlation. Here and in a companion paper (Paper II)
we explore how magnification bias distorts the 3D correlation function and
power spectrum, as first considered by Matsubara. The interesting point is: the
distortion is anisotropic. Magnification bias preferentially enhances the
observed correlation in the line-of-sight (LOS) orientation, especially on
large scales. For example at LOS separation of ~100 Mpc/h, where the intrinsic
galaxy-galaxy correlation is rather weak, the observed correlation can be
enhanced by lensing by a factor of a few, even at a modest redshift of z ~
0.35. The opportunity: this lensing anisotropy is distinctive, making it
possible to separately measure the galaxy-galaxy, galaxy-magnification and
magnification-magnification correlations, without measuring galaxy shapes. The
anisotropy is distinguishable from the well known distortion due to peculiar
motions, as will be discussed in Paper II. The challenge: the magnification
distortion of the galaxy correlation must be accounted for in interpreting data
as precision improves. For instance, the ~100 Mpc/h baryon acoustic oscillation
scale in the correlation function is shifted by up to ~3% in the LOS
orientation, and up to ~0.6% in the monopole, depending on the galaxy bias,
redshift and number count slope. The corresponding shifts in the inferred
Hubble parameter and angular diameter distance, if ignored, could significantly
bias measurements of the dark energy equation of state. Lastly, magnification
distortion offers a plausible explanation for the well known excess
correlations seen in pencil beam surveys.

dramatically, giving a complete solution to the index reduction problem in this

the velocity gradient is generated by standard random gain fluctuations with
Chandra and XMM is <0.1%. The regions of maximum velocity gradient are in CCD
zones that have the lowest temporal gain variations. It is unlikely that the
velocity gradient is due to Hubble distance differences between projected
clusters (probability<~0.01%). We mapped the distribution of elemental
abundance ratios across the cluster and detected a strong chemical
discontinuity using the abundance ratio of silicon to iron, equivalent to a
variation from 100% SN Ia iron mass fraction in the West-Northwest regions to
32% in the Eastern region. The ""center"" of the cluster is located at the
chemical discontinuity boundary, which is inconsistent with the radially
symmetric chemical gradient found in some regular clusters, but consistent with
a cluster merging scenario. We predict that the velocity gradient as measured
will produce a variation of the CMB temperature towards the East of the core of
the cluster that will be detectable by current and near-future bolometers. The
measured velocity gradient opens for the possibility that this cluster is
passing through a near line-of-sight merger stage where the cores have recently
crossed.

correction formulae derived in the first paper of this series. We find a
significant range in Se and Kr abundances, from near solar (no enrichment) to
enhanced by >1.0 dex relative to solar, which we interpret as self-enrichment
due to in situ s-process nucleosynthesis. Kr tends to be more strongly enriched
than Se; in 18 objects exhibiting both Se and Kr emission, we find that [Kr/Se]
= 0.5$\pm$0.2.
  Our survey has increased the number of PNe with n-capture element abundance
determinations by a factor of ten, enabling us for the first time to search for
correlations with other nebular properties. As expected, we find a positive
correlation between s-process enrichments and the C/O ratio. Type I and bipolar
PNe, which arise from intermediate-mass progenitors (>3-4 solar masses),
exhibit little to no s-process enrichments. Finally, PNe with H-deficient
Wolf-Rayet central stars do not exhibit systematically larger s-process
enrichments than objects with H-rich nuclei. Overall, 44% of the PNe in our
sample display significant s-process enrichments (>0.3 dex). Using an empirical
PN luminosity function to correct for incompleteness, we estimate that the true
fraction of s-process enriched Galactic PNe is at least 20%.

by the mutual interactions of a group of massive bodies orbiting a central star
in the presence of eccentricity dissipation. For parameters relevant to the
oligarchic stage of planet formation, dynamical friction keeps the typical
eccentricities small and prevents orbit crossing. Interactions at impact
parameters greater than several Hill radii cause the protoplanets to repel each
other; if the impact parameter is instead much less than the Hill radius, the
protoplanets shift slightly in semi-major axis but remain otherwise
unperturbed. If the orbits of two or more protoplanets are separated by less
than a Hill radius, they are each pushed towards an equilibrium spacing between
their neighbors and can exist as a stable co-orbital system. In the
shear-dominated oligarchic phase of planet formation we show that the feeding
zones contain several oligarchs instead of only one. Growth of the protoplanets
in the oligarchic phase drives the disk to an equilibrium configuration that
depends on the mass ratio of protoplanets to planetesimals, $\Sigma/\sigma$.
Early in the oligarchic phase, when $\Sigma/\sigma$ is low, the spacing between
rows of co-orbital oligarchs are about 5 Hill radii wide, rather than the 10
Hill radii cited in the literature. It is likely that at the end of oligarchy
the average number of co-orbital oligarchs is greater than unity. In the outer
solar system this raises the disk mass required to form the ice giants. In the
inner solar system this lowers the mass of the final oligarchs and requires
more giant impacts than previously estimated. This result provides additional
evidence that Mars is not an untouched leftover from the oligarchic phase, but
must be composed of several oligarchs assembled through giant impacts.

the diagram and show that that result, though mathematically sound, is not
physically correct, because it misses a fundamental physical constraint imposed
by the conservation of momentum, which should reduce by one the total number of
linearly independent (l.i.) functions $F_4$ in the overall solution. Taking
into account that the momenta flowing along the three legs of the diagram are
constrained by momentum conservation, the number of overall l.i. functions that
enter the most general solution must reduce accordingly.
  To determine the exact structure and content of the analytic solution for the
three-point function, I use the analogy that exists between Feynman diagrams
and electric circuit networks, in which the electric current flowing in the
network plays the role of the momentum flowing in the lines of a Feynman
diagram. This analogy is employed to define exactly which three out of the four
hypergeometric functions are relevant to the analytic solution for the Feynman
diagram. The analogy is built based on the equivalence between electric
resistance circuit networks of type ""Y"" and ""Delta"" in which flows a conserved
current. The equivalence is established via the theorem of minimum energy
dissipation within circuits having these structures.

galaxy NGC 4593. We discuss the X-ray spectral properties of this source as
well as its variations with time. The 0.5-10 keV spectrum shows significant
complexity beyond a simple power-law form, with clear evidence existing for a
""soft excess"" as well as absorption by highly ionized plasma (a warm absorber)
within the central engine of this active galactic nucleus. We show that the
soft excess is best described as originating from thermal Comptonization by
plasma that is appreciably cooler than the primary X-ray emitting plasma; we
find that the form of the soft excess cannot be reproduced adequately by
reflection from an ionized accretion disk. The only measurable deviation from
the power-law continuum in the hard spectrum comes from the presence of cold
and ionized fluorescent iron-K emission lines at 6.4 and 6.97 keV,
respectively. While constraints on the ionized iron line are weak, the cold
line is found to be narrow at CCD-resolution with a flux that does not track
the temporal changes in the underlying continuum, implying an origin in the
outer radii of the accretion disk or the putative molecular torus of Seyfert
unification schemes. The X-ray continuum itself varies on all accessible time
scales. We detect a ~230-second time-lag between soft and hard EPIC-pn bands
that, if interpreted as scattering timescales within a Comptonizing disk
corona, can be used to constrain the physical size of the primary X-ray source
to a characteristic length scale of ~2 gravitational radii. Taken together, the
small implied coronal size and the large implied iron line emitting region
indicate a departure from the current picture of a ""typical"" AGN geometry.

respect to a fixed compression scheme, in sublinear time. We study this

approximating compressibility with respect to both schemes. We also give

  Our investigation of LZ yields results whose interest goes beyond the initial

lemmas that relate the compressibility of a string with respect to Lempel-Ziv
to the number of distinct short substrings contained in it. In addition, we
show that approximating the compressibility with respect to LZ is related to
approximating the support size of a distribution.

viscoelastic flows with disordered microstructure. We study two cases. In the
first case, both phases are modeled as Kelvin-Voight viscoelastic materials. In
the second case, one phase is a Kelvin-Voight material, and the other is a
viscous Newtonian fluid. The microscale system contains the conservation of
mass and balance of momentum equations. The inertial terms in the momentum
equation incorporate the actual interface advected by the flow. In the
constitutive equations, a frozen interface is employed. The interface geometry
is arbitrary: we do not assume periodicity, statistical homogeneity or scale
separation. The problem is homogenized using G-convergence and oscillating test
functions. Since the microscale system is not parabolic, previously known
constructions of the test functions do not work here. The test functions
developed in the paper are non-local in time and satisfy divergence-free
constraint exactly. The latter feature enables us to avoid working with
pressure directly. We show that the effective medium is a single phase
viscoelastic material that is not necessarily of Kelvin-Voight type. The
effective constitutive equation contains a long memory viscoelastic term, as

migration have been proposed. These models suggest that the unique features of
Earth are closely connected with its unique U and Th migration models and
distribution patterns. In the Earth, U and Th can combine with oxidative
volatile components and water, migrate up to the asthenosphere position to form
an enrichment zone (EZ) of U and Th first, and then migrate up further to the
crusts through magmatism and metamorphism. We emphasize that the formation of
an EZ of U, Th and other heat-producing elements is a prerequisite for the
formation of a plate tectonic system. The heat-producing elements, currently
mainly U and Th, in the EZ are also the energy sources that drive the formation
and evolution of the crust of Earth and create special granitic continental
crusts. In other terrestrial planets, including Mercury, Venus, and Mars, an EZ
can not be formed because of a lack of oxidative volatile components and water.
For this reason, a plate tectonic system can not been developed in these
planets. We also emphasize the influence of U and Th in EZ on the development
and evolution of life on Earth. We propose that since the Earth and planets
were born in a united solar system, there should be some common mechanisms to
create the similarities and differences between them. We have tried to develop
an integrated view to explain some problems in the tectonics of Earth and
evolution, bio-evolution, and planetary dynamics through U and Th geochemistry.

evolution is a good way to build bridges between different disciplines of

integrated with an artificially thickened advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR)
flame front in order to provide an accurate but highly efficient representation
of the energy release and electron capture in and after the unresolvable flame.
We demonstrate that both our ADR and energy release methods do not generate
significant acoustic noise, as has been a problem with previous ADR-based
schemes. We proceed to model aspects of the deflagration, particularly the role
of buoyancy of the hot ash, and find that our methods are reasonably
well-behaved with respect to numerical resolution. We show that if a detonation
occurs in material swept up by the material ejected by the first rising bubble
but gravitationally confined to the white dwarf (WD) surface (the GCD
paradigm), the density structure of the WD at detonation is systematically
correlated with the distance of the deflagration ignition point from the center
of the star. Coupled to a suitably stochastic ignition process, this
correlation may provide a plausible explanation for the variety of nickel
masses seen in Type Ia Supernovae.

changes its structure from a triangular one to a set of parallel vortex rows in
a pinning free superconductor. This effect originates from the change of the
shape of the vortex core due to non-equilibrium effects (similar to the
mechanism of vortex motion instability in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov theory). The
moving vortex creates a deficit of quasiparticles in front of its motion and an
excess of quasiparticles behind the core of the moving vortex. This results in
the appearance of a wake (region with suppressed order parameter) behind the
vortex which attracts other vortices resulting in an effective
direction-dependent interaction between vortices. When the vortex velocity $v$
reaches the critical value $v_c$ quasi-phase slip lines (lines with fast vortex
motion) appear which may coexist with slowly moving vortices between such
lines. Our results are found within the framework of the time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau equations and are strictly valid when the coherence length
$\xi(T)$ is larger or comparable with the decay length $L_{in}$ of the
non-equilibrium quasiparticle distribution function. We qualitatively explain
experiments on the instability of vortex flow at low magnetic fields when the
distance between vortices $a \gg L_{in} \gg \xi (T)$. We speculate that a
similar instability of the vortex lattice should exist for $v>v_c$ even when
$a<L_{in}$.

Survey using the luminosity density distribution and Minkowski functional V3.
We compare the properties of grouped and isolated galaxies in regions of
different density in superclusters. We find that in high-density cores of rich
superclusters there is an excess of early type, passive galaxies, among
galaxies in groups and clusters, as well as among those which do not belong to

galaxies both in groups and among those galaxies which do not belong to groups.
This also shows that the galaxy content of groups depends on the environment

Minkowski functional V3 for different superclusters show that substructures in
superclusters as traced by different populations of galaxies are very
different. Our results show that both local (group/cluster) and global
(supercluster) environments are important in forming galaxy morphologies and
star formation activity. The presence of a high density core with X-ray
clusters and a relatively small fraction of star-forming galaxies in the

dilemmas and conflicting theories. As evaluation is differently perceived and

dilemmas, which reflects an epistemological weakness. Additionally, designing
and developing a computer-based learning scenario is not an easy task.
Advancing further, with end-users probing the system in realistic settings, is
even harder. Computer science research in evaluation faces an immense
challenge, having to cope with contributions from several conflicting and
controversial research fields. We believe that deep changes must be made in our
field if we are to advance beyond the CBT (computer-based training) learning
model and to build an adequate epistemology for this challenge. The first task
is to relocate our field by building upon recent results from philosophy,
psychology, social sciences, and engineering. In this article we locate
evaluation in respect to communication studies. Evaluation presupposes a
definition of goals to be reached, and we suggest that it is, by many means, a
silent communication between teacher and student, peers, and institutional
entities. If we accept that evaluation can be viewed as set of invisible rules
known by nobody, but somehow understood by everybody, we should add
anthropological inquiries to our research toolkit. The paper is organized
around some elements of the social communication and how they convey new
insights to evaluation research for computer and related scientists. We found
some technical limitations and offer discussions on how we relate to technology

requiring complex algorithms. Moreover, the usefulness of pure ad-hoc networks
is arguably limited. Hence, enthusiasm for mobile ad-hoc networks, which could
eliminate the need for any fixed infrastructure, has been damped. The goal is
to overcome the limitations of pure ad-hoc networks by augmenting them with
instant Internet access, e.g. via integration of UMTS respectively GSM links.
However, this raises multiple questions at the technical as well as the
organizational level. Motivated by characteristics of small-world networks that
describe an efficient network even without central or organized design, this
paper proposes to combine mobile ad-hoc networks and infrastructured networks
to form hybrid wireless networks. One main objective is to investigate how this
approach can reduce the costs of a permanent backbone link and providing in the

that they are not perfect counter-examples as are shown explicitly.

dynamical information, according to which it will have a close approach with
the Earth in the next century, the physical properties of this asteroid are
largely unknown. We performed visible and near--infrared photometry and
spectroscopy, as well as polarimetric observations. Polarimetric and
spectroscopic data allowed us to classify 2004 VD17 as an E-type asteroid. A
good agreement was also found with the spectrum of the aubrite meteorite Mayo
Belwa. On the basis of the polarimetric albedo (p_v=0.45) and of photometric
data, we estimated a diameter of about 320 m and a rotational period of about 2
hours. The analysis of the results obtained by our complete survey have shown
that (144898) 2004 VD17 is a peculiar NEO, since it is close to the breakup
limits for fast rotator asteroids, as defined by Pravec and Harris (2000).
These results suggest that a more robust structure must be expected, as a
fractured monolith or a rubble pile in a ""strength regime"" (Holsapple 2002).

a fixed network infrastructure provides an opportunity. Devices that operate as
intermediate nodes between the ad-hoc network and a reliable backbone network
are potential injection points. They allow disseminating received information
within the local neighborhood. The effectiveness of different devices to serve
as injection point differs substantially. For practical reasons the
determination of injection points should be done locally, within the ad-hoc
network partitions. We analyze different localized algorithms using at most
2-hop neighboring information. Results show that devices selected this way
spread information more efficiently through the ad-hoc network. Our results can

well understood, both the critical scaling as well as finite size scaling. This
article focuses on the block (finite size) scaling of the order parameter and
its fluctuations, considering (sub-)blocks of linear size l in systems of
linear size L. The scaling depends on the choice of the ensemble, as only the
conditional ensemble produces the block-scaling behaviour as established in
equilibrium critical phenomena. The dependence on the ensemble can be
understood by an additional symmetry present in the unconditional ensemble. The
unconventional scaling found in the unconditional ensemble is a reminder of the
possibility that scaling functions themselves have a power-law dependence on

been found in a variety of merging systems. So far only a few of them are known
in ULIRGs although they show clear signs of interactions. Whether external star
formation may take place in such objects is an open question. The aim of this
paper is to identify and characterise the physical and kinematic properties of
the external star forming regions in a sample of ULIRGs, including TDG
candidates, using optical IFS and high angular resolution HST imaging. We have
found that the presence of external star-forming regions is common with 12
objects being identified in 5 ULIRGs. These regions show a large range of
dynamical mass up to 1x10^{10} M_sun, with average sizes of ~750 pc. In
addition, the line ratios, metallicities and H\alpha equivalent widths are
typical of young bursts of star formation (age ~ 5-8 Myr), and similar to those
of other TDG candidates. Their extinction corrected H\alpha luminosities lead
to masses for the young stellar component of ~2x10^6 - 7x10^8 M_sun. The
likelihood of survival of these regions as TDGs is discussed based on their
structural and kinematic properties. Most of these systems follow the relation
between effective radius and velocity dispersion found for globular clusters
and Ellipticals, which suggests they are stable against internal motions. The
stability against forces from the parent galaxy have been studied and a
comparison of the data with the predictions of dynamical evolutionary models is
also performed. Five regions out of twelve show High-Medium or High likelihood
of survival. Our best candidate, which satisfy all the utilized criteria, is
located in the advanced merger IRAS15250+3609 and presents a velocity field
decoupled from the relatively distant parent galaxy.

10^{23.5-24} cm^{-2} that dominates above 10 keV, and an intense reflection
component with a solid angle >~ $2\pi$ from a cold, optically thick medium. We
find that these AGNs have an extremely small fraction of scattered light from

Three examples of catalysts are considered: (1) independent simple random

on the annealed Lyapunov exponents, i.e., the exponential growth rates of the
successive moments of the reactant. It turns out that these exponents exhibit
an interesting dependence on the dimension and on the diffusion constant.

of a half-space of {\it the relativistic $\alpha$-stable process} with
parameter $m$ on $\Rd$ space. This process has an infinitesimal generator of
the form $mI-(m^{2/\alpha}I-\Delta)^{\alpha/2},$ where $0<\alpha<2$, $m>0$, and
reduces to the isotropic $\alpha$-stable process for $m=0$. Its potential
theory for open bounded sets has been well developed throughout the recent
years however almost nothing was known about the behaviour of the process on
unbounded sets. The present paper is intended to fill this gap and we provide
two-sided sharp estimates for the Green function for a half-space. As a
byproduct we obtain some improvements of the estimates known for bounded sets
specially for balls. The advantage of these estimates is a clarification of the
relationship between the diameter of the ball and the parameter $m$ of the
process.
  The main result states that the Green function is comparable with the Green
function for the Brownian motion if the points are away from the boundary of a
half-space and their distance is greater than one. On the other hand for the
remaining points the Green function is somehow related the Green function for
the isotropic $\alpha$-stable process. For example, for $d\ge3$, it is
comparable with the Green function for the isotropic $\alpha$-stable process,
provided that the points are close enough.

motivation is to accompany forthcoming works devoted to the collision of two

energy. Surprisingly we find that this becomes repulsive for intermediate and
large mirror separations. The contribution of surface plasmons to the Casimir
energy plays a fundamental role not only at short but also at large distances.

dispersive wave generation mediated by solitons. Although all of the above

straightforward analogy with the inertial forces acting on an observer moving

  related ?","4 pages, talk given at the conference DIS 2007",,"10.3360/dis.2007.138",,"hep-ph",,"  The present knowledge on non-trivial relations between generalized parton
distributions on the one hand and transverse momentum dependent distributions
on the other is reviewed. While various relations can be found in the framework
of spectator models, so far no model-independent non-trivial relations have
been established.

central configurations. We prove that in the planar four-body problem, a convex
central configuration is symmetric with respect to one diagonal if and only if
the masses of the two particles on the other diagonal are equal. If these two
masses are unequal, then the less massive one is closer to the former diagonal.
Finally, we extend these results to the case of non-planar central
configurations of five particles.
