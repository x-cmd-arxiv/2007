A 76, 052315 (2007)","10.1103/PhysRevA.76.052315",,"quant-ph",,"  We introduce novel schemes for quantum computing based on local measurements
on entangled resource states. This work elaborates on the framework established
in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 220503 (2007), quant-ph/0609149]. Our method makes use
of tools from many-body physics - matrix product states, finitely correlated
states or projected entangled pairs states - to show how measurements on
entangled states can be viewed as processing quantum information. This work
hence constitutes an instance where a quantum information problem - how to
realize quantum computation - was approached using tools from many-body theory
and not vice versa. We give a more detailed description of the setting, and
present a large number of new examples. We find novel computational schemes,
which differ from the original one-way computer for example in the way the
randomness of measurement outcomes is handled. Also, schemes are presented
where the logical qubits are no longer strictly localized on the resource
state. Notably, we find a great flexibility in the properties of the universal
resource states: They may for example exhibit non-vanishing long-range
correlation functions or be locally arbitrarily close to a pure state. We
discuss variants of Kitaev's toric code states as universal resources, and
contrast this with situations where they can be efficiently classically
simulated. This framework opens up a way of thinking of tailoring resource
states to specific physical systems, such as cold atoms in optical lattices or
linear optical systems.

impact dissociation of H$_2^+$ used as an example. The physical mechanism
underlying coherently controlled stationary state scattering is exposed by
analyzing a control scenario that relies on previously established entanglement
requirements between the scattering partners. Specifically, initial state
entanglement assures that all collisions in the scattering volume yield the
desirable scattering configuration. Scattering is controlled by preparing the
particular internal state wave function that leads to the favored collisional
configuration in the collision volume. This insight allows coherent control to
be extended to the case of time-dependent scattering. Specifically, we identify
reactive scattering scenarios using incident wave packets of translational
motion where coherent control is operational and initial state entanglement is
unnecessary. Both the stationary and time-dependent scenarios incorporate
extended coherence features, making them physically distinct. From a
theoretical point of view, this work represents a large step forward in the
qualitative understanding of coherently controlled reactive scattering. From an
experimental viewpoint, it offers an alternative to entanglement-based control
schemes. However, both methods present significant challenges to existing
experimental technologies.

demonstrated experimentally [H. Niikura et al., Nature (London) 421, 826
(2003)] from a coherent control perspective. In this process, a strong laser
field incident on D2 ionizes an electron, accelerates the electron in the laser
field to eV energies, and then drives the electron to recollide with the parent
ion, causing D2+ dissociation. A number of results are demonstrated. First, a
full dimensional Strong Field Approximation (SFA) model is constructed and
shown to be in agreement with the original experiment. This is then used to
rigorously demonstrate that the experiment is an example of coherent pump-dump
control. Second, extensions to bichromatic coherent control are proposed by
considering dissociative recollision of molecules prepared in a coherent
superposition of vibrational states. Third, by comparing the results to similar
scenarios involving field-free attosecond scattering of independently prepared
D2+ and electron wave packets, recollision dissociation is shown to provide an
example of wave-packet coherent control of reactive scattering. Fourth, this
analysis makes clear that it is the temporal correlations between the continuum
electron and D2+ wave packet, and not entanglement, that are crucial for the
sub-femtosecond probing resolution demonstrated in the experiment. This result
clarifies some misconceptions regarding the importance of entanglement in the
recollision probing of D2+. Finally, signatures of entanglement between the

with uniform old stellar populations, we must probe higher redshifts to
discover their full origins. A recent consensus has developed that nearly all
M_* > 10^11 M_0 galaxies we see today were established by z~1, with at most a
factor of two growth in stellar mass and number densities at lower redshifts.
We review the evidence for this, and discuss how recent observations of star
formation rates, colors, and morphologies of massive galaxies at z < 1 with M_*
> 10^11 M_0 show that these systems are still experiencing some evolution.
Massive galaxies undergo on average a single major merger at z < 1.5, and
roughly half are experiencing star formation at the same redshifts. The highest
mass galaxies, with M_* > 10^11.5 M_0, appear in similar abundance at z < 2,
suggesting that extremely massive galaxies are mostly formed very early in the
universe. Observations at z > 1.5 demonstrate that major galaxy mergers are the
primary method for assembling these massive galaxies, with nearly all of this
merging occurring at z > 2, with on average 4 to 5 major mergers taking place
at z = 1.5 - 3.

\geq 1 TeV gamma ray emission from the shell type SNRs RX J1713.7-3946 and RX
J0852.0-4622 is dominated by inverse-Compton scattering of CMB photons (and
possibly infra-red ambient photons) by accelerated electrons. Pion decay (due
to proton-proton collisions) is shown to account for only a small fraction,
\lesssim10^-2, of the observed flux, as assuming a larger fractional
contribution would imply nonthermal radio and X-ray synchrotron emission and
thermal X-ray Bremsstrahlung emission that far exceed the observed radio and
X-ray fluxes. Models where pion decay dominates the \geq 1 TeV flux avoid the
implied excessive synchrotron emission (but not the implied excessive thermal
X-ray Bremsstrahlung emission) by assuming an extremely low efficiency of
electron acceleration, K_ep \lesssim 10^-4 (K_ep is the ratio of the number of
accelerated electrons and the number of accelerated protons at a given energy).
We argue that observations of SNRs in nearby galaxies imply a lower limit of
K_ep \gtrsim 10^-3, and thus rule out K_ep values \lesssim 10^-4 (assuming that
SNRs share a common typical value of K_ep). It is suggested that SNRs with
strong thermal X-ray emission, rather than strong non-thermal X-ray emission,
are more suitable candidates for searches of gamma rays and neutrinos resulting
from proton-proton collisions. In particular, it is shown that the neutrino
flux from the SNRs above is probably too low to be detected by current and
planned neutrino observatories (Abridged).

stars, we find that the resultant density parameter of the GW background peaks
at the amplitude of $\Omega_\mathrm{GW}\sim 10^{-10}$ in the frequency interval

it is now possible to study the infrared properties of star formation in nearby

to determine what fraction of large, infrared-selected star-forming regions in
normal galaxies are highly obscured and address how much of the star formation
we miss by relying solely on the optical portion of the spectrum. Employing a
new empirical method for deriving attenuations of infrared-selected
star-forming regions we investigate the statistics of obscured star formation
on 500pc scales in a sample of 38 nearby galaxies. We find that the median
attenuation is 1.4 magnitudes in H-alpha and that there is no evidence for a
substantial sub-population of uniformly highly-obscured star-forming regions.
The regions in the highly-obscured tail of the attenuation distribution
(A_H-alpha > 3) make up only ~4% of the sample of nearly 1800 regions, though
very embedded infrared sources on the much smaller scales and lower
luminosities of compact and ultracompact HII regions are almost certainly
present in greater numbers. The highly-obscured cases in our sample are
generally the bright, central regions of galaxies with high overall attenuation
but are not otherwise remarkable. We also find that a majority of the galaxies
show decreasing radial trends in H-alpha attenuation. The small fraction of
highly-obscured regions seen in this sample of normal, star-forming galaxies
suggests that on 500pc scales the timescale for significant dispersal or break
up of nearby, optically-thick dust clouds is short relative to the lifetime of
a typical star-forming region.

structure of the $K^\pi=3/2^-$ is analogous to the intruder ground state of
$^{12}$Be. In the predicted $K^\pi=1/2^+$ band, we found very exotic structure
with a proton intruder configuration. This proton intruder state has a larger
deformation than superdeformation. The band-head $1/2^+$ state is assigned to
the $1/2^+$(4.83 MeV), which was experimentally suggested to be the proton
intruder state because of the strong production via the proton-transfer to the
$^{12}$Be($0^+$) state in the $^4$He($^{12}$Be,$^{13}$B$\gamma$)$X$
experiments.

for exact quantum mechanical calculations that are based on Bohmian mechanics.
As part of this effort we have recently developed as alternative formulation of
Bohmian mechanics in which the quantum action, S, is taken to be complex [JCP
{125}, 231103 (2006)]. In the alternative formulation there is a significant
reduction in the magnitude of the quantum force as compared with the
conventional Bohmian formulation, at the price of propagating complex
trajectories. In this paper we show that Bohmian mechanics with complex action
is able to overcome the main computational limitation of conventional Bohmian
methods -- the propagation of wavefunctions once nodes set in. In the vicinity
of nodes, the quantum force in conventional Bohmian formulations exhibits rapid
oscillations that pose severe difficulties for existing numerical schemes. We
show that within complex Bohmian mechanics, multiple complex initial conditions
can lead to the same real final position, allowing for the description of nodes
as a sum of the contribution from two or more crossing trajectories. The idea
is illustrated on the reflection amplitude from a one-dimensional Eckart
barrier. We believe that trajectory crossing, although in contradiction to the
conventional Bohmian trajectory interpretation, provides an important new tool
for dealing with the nodal problem in Bohmian methods.

starting point for the derivative propagation method (DPM), Bohmian mechanics
with complex action (BOMCA) and the zero-velocity complex action method
(ZEVCA). The unified derivation begins with the ansatz
$\psi=e^{\frac{iS}{\hbar}}$ where the action, $S$, is taken to be complex and
the quantum force is obtained by writing a hierarchy of equations of motion for
the phase partial derivatives. We demonstrate how different choices of the
trajectory velocity field yield different formulations such as DPM, BOMCA and
ZEVCA. The new derivation is used for two purposes. First, it serves as a
common basis for comparing the role of the quantum force in the DPM and BOMCA
formulations. Second, we use the new derivation to show that superposing the
contributions of real, crossing trajectories yields a nodal pattern essentially
identical to that of the exact quantum wavefunction. The latter result suggests
a promising new approach to deal with the challenging problem of nodes in
Bohmian mechanics.

"0706.3510","Guowen Wang","Wang Guowen","Realistic solution to the tunneling time problem","9 pages, 6 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  There remains the old question of how long a quantum particle takes to tunnel
through a potential barrier higher than its incident kinetic energy. In this
article a solution of the question is proposed on the basis of a realistic
explanation of quantum mechanics. The explanation implies that the tunneling
particle has a certain chance to borrow enough energy from self-interference to
high-jump over the barrier. The root-mean-square velocity and the effective
tunneling time of an electron tunneling through a rectangular barrier are
numerically calculated. No superluminal effect (Hartman effect) is found for
the tunneling electron. Heisenberg's energy-time uncertainty relation for the
tunneling effect is verified by calculating an introduced coefficient
representing uncertainty. The present author argues that phase time, dwell time
and B\""{u}tticker-Landauer time are not appropriate expressions for the actual
transit time in a tunneling process. A quantum high-jumping model is presented
to resolve the paradox that kinetic energy of the tunneling particle is
negative and its momentum is imaginary.

differences observed between isotropic granular materials and those with
hexagonal anisotropy. Corrections to the classical Boussinesq result for the
stresses in an infinite half-space of a linear, isotropic material are
developed in a power series in inverse distance from the point of application
of the force. The breakdown of continuum theory on scales of order of the grain
size is modeled with phenomenological parameters characterizing the strengths
of induced multipoles near the point of application of the external force. We
find that the data of Geng et al. on isotropic and hexagonal packings of
photoelastic grains can be fit within this framework. Fitting the hexagonal
packings requires a choice of elastic coefficients with hexagonal anisotropy
stronger than that of a simple ball and spring model. For both the isotropic
and hexagonal cases, induced dipole and quadrupole terms produce propagation of
stresses away from the vertical direction over short distances. The scale over
which such propagation occurs is significantly enhanced by the nonlinearities
that generate hexagonal anisotropy.

string theory and 16 supercharge Yang-Mills quantum mechanics in the large N 't
Hooft limit. At low temperatures string theory describes black holes, whose
thermodynamics may hence be studied using the dual quantum mechanics. This
quantum mechanics is strongly coupled which motivates the use of lattice
techniques. We argue that, contrary to expectation, the theory when discretized
naively will nevertheless recover continuum supersymmetry as the lattice
spacing is sent to zero. We test these ideas by studying the 4 supercharge
version of this Yang-Mills quantum mechanics in the 't Hooft limit. We use both
a naive lattice action and a manifestly supersymmetric action. Using Monte
Carlo methods we simulate the Euclidean theories, and study the lattice
continuum limit, for both thermal and non-thermal periodic boundary conditions,
confirming continuum supersymmetry is recovered for the naive action when
appropriate. We obtain results for the thermal system with N up to 12. These
favor the existence of a single deconfined phase for all non-zero temperatures.
These results are an encouraging indication that the 16 supercharge theory is
within reach using similar methods and resources.

investigate the processes leading to the catastrophic eruption. We find that
the filament slowly ascended at a speed of 0.1km/s over two days before the
eruption. During slow ascending, many small flares were observed close to the
footpoints of the filament, where new magnetic elements were emerging. On the
basis of the observational facts we discuss the triggering mechanism leading to
the filament eruption. We suggest the process toward the eruption as follows:
First, a series of small flares played a role in changing the topology of the
loops overlying the filament. Second, the small flares gradually changed the
equilibrium state of the filament and caused the filament to ascend slowly over
two days. Finally, a C2.9 flare that occurred when the filament was close to
the critical point for loss of equilibrium directly led to the catastrophic
filament eruption right after itself.
