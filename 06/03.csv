binary inputs and outputs there exist equalities in local theories which are
violated by quantum theory. The amount of white noise tolerated by these
equalities are twice that of inequalities. In this paper we will first
introduce an inequality in bipartite qutrits systems which, if non-maximally
entangled state is used instead of maximally entangled state, is violated more
strongly by quantum theory. Hence reproducing the results obtained in the
literature. We will then prove that our equalities in this case are violated by
quantum theory too, and they tolerate much more white noise than inequalities.

Suzaku telescope. The source was detected at the edge of the XIS image during a
routine observation of the calibration source 1E 0102.2-7219, a supernova
remnant in the SMC. We constrained the source position using ray-tracing
simulations. No such transient source was found at the position in the other
Suzaku observations nor in all the available archived images of other X-ray
missions for the last ~28 years. The XIS spectrum can be explained by a single
blackbody with a temperature of ~72 eV, and an interstellar extinction of
~4.9x10^{20} H atoms cm^{-2} consistent with the value to the SMC. An
additional absorption edge at ~0.74 keV was also confirmed, which is presumably
due to the absorption by helium-like oxygen ions. Assuming that the source is
at the distance of the SMC, the X-ray luminosity in the 0.2-2.0 keV band is
~10^{37} erg s^{-1} and the radius of the source is ~10^{8} cm. The XIS light
curve shows about a two-fold decline in X-ray flux during the 24 ks
observation. Together with the archived data, the X-ray flux in the burst is at
least three orders of magnitude brighter than the undetected quiescent level.
All these properties are often seen among supersoft sources (SSSs). We conclude
that the transient source is another example of SSS in the SMC.

edge-on around a young brown dwarf in the Taurus star-forming region. Using
data obtained with SpeX at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, we find that
the slope of the 0.8-2.5 um spectrum of the brown dwarf 2MASS J04381486+2611399
cannot be reproduced with a photosphere reddened by normal extinction. Instead,
the slope is consistent with scattered light, indicating that circumstellar
material is occulting the brown dwarf. By combining the SpeX data with mid-IR
photometry and spectroscopy from the Spitzer Space Telescope and previously
published millimeter data from Scholz and coworkers, we construct the spectral
energy distribution for 2MASS J04381486+2611399 and model it in terms of a
young brown dwarf surrounded by an irradiated accretion disk. The presence of
both silicate absorption at 10 um and silicate emission at 11 um constrains the
inclination of the disk to be ~70 deg, i.e. ~20 deg from edge-on. Additional
evidence of the high inclination of this disk is provided by our detection of
asymmetric bipolar extended emission surrounding 2MASS J04381486+2611399 in
high-resolution optical images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope.
According to our modeling for the SED and images of this system, the disk
contains a large inner hole that is indicative of a transition disk (R_in~58
R_star~0.275 AU) and is somewhat larger than expected from embryo ejection
models (R_out=20-40 AU vs. R_out<10-20 AU).

Cosmology, effects of braneworld cosmological models, non-standard cosmological
models in metric-affine gravity, and models with spinning fluid. Kinematical
(or geometrical) tests based on null geodesics are insufficient to separate
individual matter components when they behave like perfect fluid and scale in
the same way. Still, it is possible to measure their overall effect. We use
recent measurements of the coordinate distances from the Fanaroff-Riley type
IIb (FRIIb) radio galaxy (RG) data, supernovae type Ia (SNIa) data, baryon
oscillation peak and cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) observations
to obtain stronger bounds for the contribution of the type considered. We
demonstrate that, while $\rho^2$ corrections are very small, they can be tested
by astronomical observations -- at least in principle. Bayesian criteria of
model selection (the Bayesian factor, AIC, and BIC) are used to check if
additional parameters are detectable in the present epoch. As it turns out, the
$\Lambda$CDM model is favoured over the bouncing model driven by loop quantum
effects. Or, in other words, the bounds obtained from cosmography are very
weak, and from the point of view of the present data this model is
indistinguishable from the $\Lambda$CDM one.

calculate the unparticle contribution to the neutrino-electron elastic

scaling dimension of the scalar unparticle should lie in the narrow range $1 <

sudden and adiabatic approaches has been proposed to understand the heavy ion
fusion phenomena at deep sub-barrier energies. It is shown that under certain
approximations, it amounts to tunneling through two barriers: one while
overcoming the normal Coulomb barrier (which is of sudden nature) along the
radial direction until the repulsive core is reached and thereafter through an
adiabatic barrier along the neck degree of freedom while making transition from
a di-nuclear to a mono-nuclear regime through shape relaxation. A general
feature of this hybrid model is a steep fall-off of the fusion cross section,
sharp increase of logarithmic derivative L(E) with decreasing energy and the
astrophysical S-factor showing a maxima at deep sub-barrier energies
particularly for near symmetric systems. The model can explain the experimental
fusion measurements for several systems ranging from near symmetric systems
like $^{58}Ni+^{64}Ni, ^{58}Ni+^{58}Ni$ and $ ^{58}Ni+^{69}Y$ to asymmetric one
like $^{16}O+^{208}Pb$ where the experimental findings are very surprising.
Since the second tunneling is along the neck co-ordinate, it is further
conjectured that deep sub-barrier fusion supression may not be observed for the
fusion of highly asymmetric projectile target combinations where adiabatic
transition occurs automatically without any hindrance. The recent deep
sub-barrier fusion cross section measurements of $^{6}Li+^{198}Pt$ system
supports this conjecture.

oscillations (QPOs) in pulsars, black holes and white dwarfs is presented.
Three circular tori are assumed to be present around the star: an inner torus
with charge $Q_i$, an outer torus with charge $Q_o$ and a torus with
electrically neutral mass $m_m$ in the middle, whereas the star bears a charge
$Q_s$ ($Q_o$ and $Q_s$ have the same sign, $Q_i$ the opposite one). The
frequency $\nu_m$ of the mass current is approximately given by the Kepler
frequency, whereas the frequencies of $Q_i$ and $Q_o$, $\nu_i$ and $\nu_o$,
respectively, are calculated from classical mechanics and Coulomb's law.
  For the explanation of the low frequency QPOs in pulsars and black holes a
special interpretation of the gravitomagnetic theory may be essential. From the
latter theory four new gravitomagnetic precession frequencies are deduced,
which may be identified with the observed low frequency QPOs.
  Predictions of the presented model are compared with observed high frequency
and low frequency QPOs of the pulsars SAX J1808.4--3658, XTE J1807--294, IGR
J00291+5934, SGR 1806--20 and the black hole XTE J1550--564. In addition,
charge flow near the pole of pulsars may explain frequency drift of burst
oscillations. Moreover, charge flow at the equator of SAX J1808.4--3658 may be
the cause of the enigmatic 410 kHz QPO. Furthermore, the Lense-Thirring
frequency is discussed and a modified formula is compared with data of the
pulsars.
  Contrary to pulsars and black holes, the low frequency QPOs of white dwarfs
might be attributed to electromagnetic precession frequencies, deduced in this
work. Predictions are compared with data of the dwarf nova VW Hyi.

completely explained by unparticle effects and the strange quark asymmetry,
even with or without the contributions from the isoscalarity violation etc. It
is remarkable that these parameter regions are consistent with the constraints
from $b\to s\gamma$

with the WENO algorithm, which is an effective solver of photon kinetics in the
phase space described by the radiative transfer equation. We show that the
volume growth rate, either of isolated ionized regions or of clustered regions
in merging, generally consists of three phases: fast or relativistic growth
phase at the early stage, slow growth phase at the later stage, and a
transition phase between the fast and slow phases. We also show that the volume
growth of ionized regions around clustered sources with intensity $\dot{E}_i$
($i=1, 2, ...$) would have the same behavior as a single source with intensity
$\dot{E}=\sum_i\dot{E}_i$, if all the distances between nearest neighbor
sources $i$ and $j$ are smaller than $c(t^i_c+t^j_c)$, $t^i_c$ being the time
scale $t_c$ of source $i$. Therefore, a tightly clustered UV photon sources
would lead to a slow growth of ionized volume. This effect would be important
for studying the redshift-dependence of 21cm signals from the reionization
epoch.

order at this very low, near-critical doping of $\sim$0.055, in contrast to
claims based on local probe techniques. We find that the neutron resonance seen
in optimally doped YBCO7 and underdoped YBCO6.5, has undergone large softening
and damping. It appears that the overdamped resonance, with a relaxation rate
of 2 meV, is coupled to a zero-energy central mode that grows with cooling and
eventually saturates with no change at or below T$_c$. Although a similar
qualitative behaviour is found for YBCO6.35, our study shows that the central
mode is stronger in YBCO6.334 than YBCO6.35. The system remains subcritical
with short-ranged three dimensional correlations.

investigated using the umbrella sampling method. The free energy cost of
forming a nucleating droplet is determined as a function of the quench depth,
and the saddle point nature of the droplets is verified using an intervention
technique. The structure and symmetry of the nucleating droplets is found for a
range of temperatures. We find that for deep quenches the nucleating droplets
become more anisotropic and diffuse with no well defined core or surface. The
environment of the nucleating droplets form randomly stacked hexagonal planes.
This behavior is consistent with a spinodal nucleation interpretation. We also
find that the free energy barrier for heterogeneous nucleation is a minimum
when the lattice spacing of the impurity equals the lattice spacing of the
equilibrium crystalline phase. If the lattice spacing of the impurity is
different, the crystal grows into the bulk instead of wetting the impurity.
