We discuss the different mechanisms that produce polarized emission and
conclude that the only viable interpretation is a synchrotron origin for the
optical nuclei. This idea is strengthened by the analogy with the polarization
properties of BL Lac objects, providing also further support to the FRI/BL Lac
unified model. This confirms previous suggestions that the dominant emission
mechanism in low luminosity radio-loud AGN is related to non-thermal radiation
produced by the base of their jets. In addition to the nuclear polarization
(and to the large scale optical jets), polarization is detected co-spatially
with the dusty circumnuclear disks, likely due to dichroic transmission; the
polarization vectors are tangential to the disks as expected when the magnetic
field responsible for the grains alignment is stretched by differential
rotation. We explored the possibility to detect the polarimetric signature of a
misaligned radiation beam in FR I, expected in our sources in the frame of the
FR I/ BL Lac unification. We did not find this effect in any of the galaxies,

in the optical continuum dominated by star formation. We detect the optical
counterpart of this bar in the 2D distribution of the old stellar population

transport has already been observed. It has also been suggested that graphene
might be a promising material for spintronics and related applications, such as
the realization of spin qubits, due to the low intrinsic spin orbit
interaction, as well as the low hyperfine interaction of the electron spins
with the carbon nuclei. As a first step in the direction of graphene
spintronics and spin qubits we report the observation of spin transport, as
well as Larmor spin precession over micrometer long distances using single

geometry was used, employing four terminal contact geometries with
ferromagnetic cobalt electrodes, which make contact to the graphene sheet
through a thin oxide layer. We observe clear bipolar (changing from positive to

electrodes, indicating that spin coherence extends underneath all 4 contacts.
No significant changes in the spin signals occur between 4.2K, 77K and room

relaxation length between 1.5 and 2 micron at room temperature, only weakly
dependent on charge density, which is varied from n~0 at the Dirac neutrality

of a non random Ising model. A graph can be infinite dimensional in a strict
sense, like the fully connected graph, or in a broad sense, as happens on a
Bethe lattice and in many random graphs. In this paper, we firstly introduce
our definition of dimensionality which is compared to the standard definition
and readily applied to test the infinite dimensionality of a large class of
graphs which, remarkably enough, includes even graphs where the tree-like
approximation (or, in other words, the Bethe-Peierls approach), in general, may

positive energy are intertwined. We examine in more detail a previously studied
quantum state of the massless minimally coupled scalar field, which we call a
``Helfer state''. This is a state in which the energy density can be made
arbitrarily negative over an arbitrarily large region of space, but only at one
instant in time. In the Helfer state, the negative energy density is
accompanied by rapidly time-varying energy fluxes. It is the latter feature
which allows the quantum inequalities, bounds which restrict the magnitude and
duration of negative energy, to hold for this class of states. An observer who
initially passes through the negative energy region will quickly encounter
fluxes of positive energy which subsequently enter the region. We examine in
detail the correlation between the energy density and flux in the Helfer state
in terms of their expectation values. We then study the correlation function
between energy density and flux in the Minkowski vacuum state, for a massless
minimally coupled scalar field in both two and four dimensions. In this latter
analysis we examine correlation functions rather than expectation values.
Remarkably, we see qualitatively similar behavior to that in the Helfer state.
More specifically, an initial negative energy vacuum fluctuation in some region
of space is correlated with a subsequent flux fluctuation of positive energy
into the region. We speculate that the mechanism which ensures that the quantum
inequalities hold in the Helfer state, as well as in other quantum states
associated with negative energy, is, at least in some sense, already
``encoded'' in the fluctuations of the vacuum.

V~20.5 mag, based on the astrometric reduction of 43 photographic plates,
spanning over 21 years of epoch difference. Proper motion errors are typically
1 mas/yr and field dependent systematics are below 0.2 mas/yr.
Cross-referencing with the 2MASS catalog yielded a sample of ~8,700 stars, from
which predominantly disk and bulge subsamples were selected photometrically
from the JH color-magnitude diagram. The two samples exhibited different
proper-motion distributions, with the disk displaying the expected reflex solar
motion as a function of magnitude. Galactic rotation was also detected for
stars between ~2 and ~3 kpc from us. The bulge sample, represented by red
giants, has an intrinsic proper motion dispersion of (sigma_l,sigma_b)=(3.39,
2.91)+/-(0.11,0.09) mas/yr, which is in good agreement with previous results,
and indicates a velocity anisotropy consistent with either rotational
broadening or tri-axiality. A mean distance of 6.37^{+0.87}_{-0.77} kpc has
been estimated for the bulge sample, based on the observed K magnitude of the
horizontal branch red clump. The metallicity [M/H] distribution was also
obtained for a subsample of 60 bulge giants stars, based on calibrated
photometric indices. The observed [M/H] shows a peak value at [M/H]~-0.1 with
an extended metal poor tail and around 30% of the stars with supersolar

explore different inclination angles and two different assumptions about the

therefore that Newtonian dynamics has severe problems while MOND does
exceedingly well in explaining the observed rotation curves of the 3 TDGs

equations of motion do not allow O(4) symmetric solutions joining the two

the sources (their masses, charges and separating distance). Very simple
analytical forms were found for the solution as well as for the equilibrium
condition which guarantees the absence of any struts on the symmetry axis. This
condition shows that the equilibrium is not possible for two black holes or for
two naked singularities. However, in the case when one of the sources is a
black hole and another one is a naked singularity, the equilibrium is possible
at some distance separating the sources. It is interesting that for
appropriately chosen parameters even a Schwarzschild black hole together with a
naked singularity can be ""suspended"" freely in the superposition of their

of the primordial power spectrum generated during inflation. We attempt to
identify more exotic power spectra that yield equally good fits to the data as
simple power-law spectra. In order to test a wide variety of spectral shapes,
we combine the flow formalism, which is a method of stochastic model
generation, with a numerical integration of the mode equations of quantum
fluctuations. This allows us to handle inflation models that yield spectra that
are not well described by the standard spectral parameterization. Using the
latest WMAP data-set, we find a high degree of variation in possible spectral
shapes. In particular, we find strongly running spectra arising from
fast-rolling inflaton fields providing equally good fits to the data as
power-law spectra arising from slowly-rolling fields. Current data poorly
constrains the spectrum on scales (k < 0.01 h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}), where the error
due to cosmic variance is large. Among the statistically degenerate models, we
identify spectra with strong running on these larger scales, but with reduced
running at smaller scales. These models predict values for the tensor-to-scalar
ratio, (r), that lie outside the 2-(\sigma) confidence interval obtained from
SDSS+WMAP data for spectra that are parametrized as power-laws or spectra with
constant running. By considering more generalized power spectra, we therefore
open up regions of parameter space excluded for simpler models.

retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) revealed that they may physically
interact with one another. Subsequently, an RB peptide corresponding to the
proposed RB binding site for insulin was found to recognize full-length insulin
in vitro. As part of efforts aimed at developing this RB peptide into an
anti-cancer drug, this molecule was chemically coupled to a cellular
internalization signal and termed ""MCR peptide"". Meanwhile, several such MCR
peptide variants have been demonstrated to restrain the proliferation of
different human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, one of the MCR
peptides coined MCR-10 was shown to be capable of interfering with the complex
formation between insulin and RB in HepG2 human hepatoma cells, as monitored by
immunofluorescence. This latter result indicating an in vivo association
between insulin and RB was confirmed by a follow-up study combining the methods
of co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Here, we provide evidence for the
existence of the insulin-RB complex in A549 human non-small cell lung cancer
cells. Specifically, we demonstrate this heterodimer by means of a magnetic
beads-based immunoprecipitation approach and equally show that this dimer can
be disrupted by MCR-4 or MCR-10 each of which is known to possess
antiproliferative properties, yet to a much lesser extent by a control peptide.
Thus, this investigation has yielded another important proof for the occurrence
of the insulin-RB dimer and, furthermore, its validity as a target for
antineoplastic MCR peptides.

superlattice with an applied bias voltage and a magnetic field that is tilted
relative to the superlattice axis.In previous work, we showed that although the
applied fields are stationary,they act like a THz plane wave, which strongly
couples the Bloch and cyclotron motion of electrons within the lowest miniband.
As a consequence,the electrons exhibit a unique type of Hamiltonian chaos,
which creates an intricate mesh of conduction channels (a stochastic web) in
phase space, leading to a large resonant increase in the current flow at
critical values of the applied voltage. This phase-space patterning provides a
sensitive mechanism for controlling electrical resistance. In this paper, we
investigate the effects of dissipation on the electron dynamics by modifying
the semiclassical equations of motion to include a linear damping term. We
demonstrate that even in the presence of dissipation,deterministic chaos plays
an important role in the electron transport process. We identify mechanisms for
the onset of chaos and explore the associated sequence of bifurcations in the
electron trajectories. When the Bloch and cyclotron frequencies are
commensurate, complex multistability phenomena occur in the system. In
particular, for fixed values of the control parameters several distinct stable
regimes can coexist, each corresponding to different initial conditions. We

dynamical properties of satellite/primary galaxy systems in a LCDM universe. We
find that, overall, the satellite population traces the dark matter rather
well: its spatial distribution and kinematics may be approximated by an NFW
profile with a mildly anisotropic velocity distribution. Their spatial
distribution is also mildly anisotropic, with a well-defined ``anti-Holmberg''
effect that reflects the misalignment between the major axis and angular
momentum of the host halo. The isolation criteria for our primaries picks not
only galaxies in sparse environments, but also a number of primaries at the
centre of ''fossil'' groups. We find that the abundance and luminosity function
of these unusual systems are in reasonable agreement with the few available
observational constraints. We recover the expected L_{host} \sigma_{sat}^3
relation for LCDM models for truly-isolated primaries. Less strict primary
selection, however, leads to substantial modification of the scaling relation.
Our analysis also highlights a number of difficulties afflicting studies that
rely on blind stacking of satellite systems to constrain the mean halo mass of
the primary galaxies.

abruptly changes into zero phase difference beyond 4-6 mHz. The phase
difference between the 171 and 195 A sequences exhibits a shallow dip below 3
mHz and then also turns to zero phase difference beyond this value. We
attribute the various similarities between the UV and EUV diagnostics that are
evident in the phase-difference diagrams to the contribution of the C IV

the lower frequencies indicates the presence of upward-traveling disturbances.
It points to correspondence between the lower chromosphere and the upper
transition region, perhaps by slow-mode magnetosonic disturbances, or by a
connection between chromospheric and coronal heating mechanisms. The transition
from this upward trend to zero phase difference at higher frequencies is due to
the intermittent obscuration by fibrils that occult the foot points of hot
loops, which are bright in the EUV and C IV lines, in oscillatory manner.

person and the infection time of his or her infector. Probability density
functions for generation intervals have been an important input for epidemic
models and epidemic data analysis. In this paper, we specify a general
stochastic SIR epidemic model and prove that the mean generation interval
decreases when susceptible persons are at risk of infectious contact from
multiple sources. The intuition behind this is that when a susceptible person
has multiple potential infectors, there is a ``race'' to infect him or her in
which only the first infectious contact leads to infection. In an epidemic, the
mean generation interval contracts as the prevalence of infection increases. We
call this global competition among potential infectors. When there is rapid
transmission within clusters of contacts, generation interval contraction can
be caused by a high local prevalence of infection even when the global
prevalence is low. We call this local competition among potential infectors.
Using simulations, we illustrate both types of competition.
  Finally, we show that hazards of infectious contact can be used instead of
generation intervals to estimate the time course of the effective reproductive
number in an epidemic. This approach leads naturally to partial likelihoods for
epidemic data that are very similar to those that arise in survival analysis,
opening a promising avenue of methodological research in infectious disease
epidemiology.

network requiring nearby neighbors to store and forward data utilizing mobility
and encounters over time. Using traditional approaches such as gateways or
firewalls for deterring worm propagation in encounter-based networks is
inappropriate. Because this type of network is highly dynamic and has no
specific boundary, a distributed counter-worm mechanism is needed. We propose
models for the worm interaction approach that relies upon automated beneficial
worm generation to alleviate problems of worm propagation in such networks. We
study and analyze the impact of key mobile node characteristics including node
cooperation, immunization, on-off behavior on the worm propagations and
interactions. We validate our proposed model using extensive simulations. We
also find that, in addition to immunization, cooperation can reduce the level
of worm infection. Furthermore, on-off behavior linearly impacts only timing
aspect but not the overall infection. Using realistic mobile network
measurements, we find that encounters are non-uniform, the trends are
consistent with the model but the magnitudes are drastically different.
Immunization seems to be the most effective in such scenarios. These findings
provide insight that we hope would aid to develop counter-worm protocols in
future encounter-based networks.

Nakagami-m non-ergodic block-fading channels with perfect transmitter and
receiver channel state information and discrete input signal constellations,
under both short- and long-term power constraints. Optimal power allocation
schemes are shown to be direct applications of previous results in the
literature. We show that the SNR exponent of the optimal short-term scheme is
given by m times the Singleton bound. We also illustrate the significant gains
available by employing long-term power constraints. In particular, we analyze
the optimal long-term solution, showing that zero outage can be achieved
provided that the corresponding short-term SNR exponent with the same system
parameters is strictly greater than one. Conversely, if the short-term SNR
exponent is smaller than one, we show that zero outage cannot be achieved. In
this case, we derive the corresponding long-term SNR exponent as a function of
the Singleton bound. Due to the nature of the expressions involved, the
complexity of optimal schemes may be prohibitive for system implementation. We
therefore propose simple sub-optimal power allocation schemes whose outage
probability performance is very close to the minimum outage probability
obtained by optimal schemes. We also show the applicability of these techniques
to practical systems employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing.

expanding Minkowski Space. These spaces appear to indicate that we can dispense
with gravitational singularities. The key mathematical ideas in the present
approach are to include a complex phase factor, such as, e^{i\phi} in the
Lorentz transformation and to use both the proper time and the proper mass as
parameters. To develop the most general case, a complex parameter \sigma=s+im,
is introduced, where s is the proper time, and m is the proper mass, and \sigma
and {\sigma}/{|\sigma|} are used to parameterize the position of a particle (or
reference frame) in space-time-matter phase space. A new reference variable,
u={m}/{r}, is needed (in addition to velocity), and assumed to be bounded by 0
and {c^{2}}/{G}=1, in geometrized units. Several results are derived: The
equation E=mc^2 apparently needs to be modified to
E^2={s^2c^{10}}/{G^2}+m^2c^4, but a simpler (invariant) parameter is the
""energy to length"" ratio, which is {c^4}/{G} for any spherical region of
space-time-matter. The generalized ""momentum vector"" becomes completely
""masslike"" for u\approx 0.79, which we think indicates the existence of a
maximal gravity field. Thus, gravitational singularities do not occur. Instead,
as u approaches 1 matter is apparently simply crushed into free space. In the
last section of this paper we attempt some further generalizations of the phase
space ideas developed in this paper.

Determining the onset of ML resonance in different magnetic fields and/or

striking divergence in the higher part of the peak effect regime.
Interestingly, this phenomenon is accompanied by a pronounced peak of dynamic
critical current. Mapping out field-temperature phase diagrams, we find that
divergent points follow well the thermodynamic melting curve of the ideal

provide a link between the dynamic and static melting phenomena which can be

available in studying networks without energy functions. Applying the SCSNA to

stochastic ones. The study of the TAP equation which is of particular interest
for the case without energy concept is very few, while it is closely related to

theories with large number of species of the quantum fields, imply an
inevitable hierarchy between the masses of the species and the Planck scale,
shedding a different light on the hierarchy problem. In particular, using the
black hole physics, we prove that any consistent theory that includes N number
of the Z_2-conserved species of the quantum fields of mass \Lambda, puts a
lower bound on the Planck mass, which in large N limit is given by N\Lambda^2.
An useful byproduct of this proof is that any exactly conserved quantum charge,
not associated with a long-range classical field, must be defined maximum
modulo N, bounded by the the ratio of the Planck to the unit charge masses
squared. For example, a continuous global U(1) `baryon number' symmetry, must
be explicitly broken by gravity, at least down to a Z_N subgroup, with N
bounded by the ratio of the Planck to baryon masses squared. The same
constraint applies to any discrete gauge symmetry, as well as to other
quantum-mechanically detectable black hole charges that are associated with the
massive quantum hair of the black hole. We show that the
gravitationally-coupled N-species sector that solves the gauge hirearchy
problem, should be probed by LHC.

In our new algorithm, the internal motion of the star cluster is calculated
accurately using the direct Hermite scheme with individual timesteps and all
other motions are calculated using the tree code with second-order leapfrog
integrator. The direct and tree schemes are combined using an extension of the
mixed variable symplectic (MVS) scheme. Thus, the Hamiltonian corresponding to

with the leapfrog, which is symplectic. Using this algorithm, we performed
fully self-consistent N-body simulations of star clusters in their parent

establish a lower bound on $\theta_{13}$, then neutrino telescopes might
establish an upper bound on $|\cos\delta|$ that is smaller than one, and by
that prove that CP is violated in neutrino oscillations. Such a measurement
requires several favorable ingredients to occur: (i) $\theta_{13}$ is not far
below the present upper bound; (ii) The uncertainties in $\theta_{12}$ and

work, we analyze those transition modes in terms of the theoretical framework
established by Yan and Kuang. It is interesting to notice that the intermediate
states between the two gluon-emissions are hybrids, therefore by fitting the
data, we are able to determine the mass spectra of hybrids. The ground hybrid
states are predicted as 4.23 GeV (for charmonium) and 10.79 GeV (for bottonium)
which do not correspond to any states measured in recent experiments, thus it
may imply that very possibly, hybrids mix with regular quarkonia to constitute
physical states. Comprehensive comparisons of the potentials for hybrids whose
parameters are obtained in this scenario with the lattice results are
presented.

hierarchy in the nearly-Friedmann-Robertson-Walker limit of homogeneous, but
anisotropic, universes classified via their Bianchi type. Compared with
previous calculations, this allows a more sophisticated treatment of
recombination, produces predictions for the polarization of the radiation, and
allows for reionization. Our derivation is independent of any assumptions about
the dynamical behaviour of the field equations, except that it requires
anisotropies to be small back to recombination; this is already demanded by
observations.
  We calculate the polarization signal in the Bianchi VIIh case, with the
parameters recently advocated to mimic the several large-angle anomalous
features observed in the CMB. We find that the peak polarization signal is ~
1.2 micro K for the best-fit model to the temperature anisotropies, and is
mostly confined to multipoles l<10. Remarkably, the predicted large-angle EE
and TE power spectra in the Bianchi model are consistent with WMAP observations
that are usually interpreted as evidence of early reionization. However, the
power in B-mode polarisation is predicted to be similar to the E-mode power and
parity-violating correlations are also predicted by the model; the WMAP
non-detection of either of these signals casts further strong doubts on the
veracity of attempts to explain the large-angle anomalies with global
anisotropy. On the other hand, given that there exist further dynamical degrees
of freedom in the VIIh universes that are yet to be compared with CMB
observations, we cannot at this time definitively reject the anisotropy
explanation.

analysis, involving stable and unstable manifolds in a weighted space. Within
this framework, a numerical dynamical systems method for the calculation of the
dispersion relation as an eigenvalue problem is defined and dispersion curves
for different values of the electron diffusion constant and of the electric

with analytical expressions for the dispersion relation in the limit of small

taking place in Asymptotic Giant Branch stars. At low metallicity, the
enhancement of C and/or N may be up to 1000 times larger than the original iron
content and significantly affects the stellar structure and its evolution. For
this reason, the interpretation of the already available and still growing
amount of data concerning C-rich metal-poor stars belonging to our Galaxy as
well as to dwarf spheroidal galaxies would require reliable AGB stellar models
for low and very low metallicities. In this paper we address the question of
calculation and use of appropriate opacity coefficients, which take into
account the C enhancement caused by the third dredge up. A possible N
enhancement, caused by the cool bottom process or by the engulfment of protons
into the convective zone generated by a thermal pulse and the subsequent huge
third dredge up, is also considered. Basing on up-to-date stellar models, we
illustrate the changes induced by the use of these opacity on the physical and
chemical properties expected for these stars.

evidence that mass segregation has already occured in the cluster. We took it

cluster mass distribution does not depend much on its exact age, and is well
represented by a single power-law, with an index alpha=0.69 +/- 0.15. Over the

log-normal function with m0=0.36 +/- 0.07Mo and sigma=0.58 +/- 0.06. Comparison

part sizes |V_i| >= (1+\epsilon)\Delta and the local degree of G is o(\Delta),
then G has an independent transversal for sufficiently large \Delta. This
extends several previous results and settles (in a stronger form) a conjecture
of Aharoni and Holzman. We then generalize this result to transversals that
induce no cliques of size s. (Note that independent transversals correspond to
s=2.) In that context, we prove that parts of size |V_i| >=

of such a transversal, and we provide a construction that shows this is
asymptotically tight.

giant planets detected around the star HD 73526 are in 2:1 resonance. However,
as our numerical integration shows, the derived orbital data for this system
result in chaotic behavior of the giant planets, which is uncommon among the
resonant extrasolar planetary systems.
  We intend to present regular (non-chaotic) orbital solutions for the giant
planets in the system HD 73526 and offer formation scenarios based on combining
planetary migration and sudden perturbative effects such as planet-planet
scattering or rapid dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. A comparison with the
already studied resonant system HD 128311, exhibiting similar behavior, is also
done.
  The new sets of orbital solutions have been derived by the Systemic Console
(www.oklo.org). The stability of these solutions has been investigated by the
Relative Lyapunov indicator, while the migration and scattering effects are
studied by gravitational N-body simulations applying non-conservative forces as
well. Additionally, hydrodynamic simulations of embedded planets in
protoplanetary disks are performed to follow the capture into resonance.
  For the system HD 73526 we demonstrate that the observational radial velocity
data are consistent with a coplanar planetary system engaged in a stable 2:1
resonance exhibiting apsidal corotation. We have shown that, similarly to the
system HD 128311, the present dynamical state of HD 73526 could be the result
of a mixed evolutionary process melting together planetary migration and a
perturbative event.

at about half that rate. This suggests weakening of net rotational braking at

is real. Furthermore, we found that magnetic flux in the B component is about
twice as strong as in component C at similar rotation rate. This indicates that
rotational braking is not proportional to magnetic field strength in fully

quantum-interference effects. Specifically, we investigate how the different
types of electron orbits, involving one or two centers, affect the interference
patterns in the spectra. We also briefly address the influence of the choice of
gauge, and of the initial and final electronic bound states on such patterns.
For the length-gauge SFA and undressed bound states, there exist additional
terms, which can be interpreted as potential energy shifts. If, on the one
hand, such shifts alter the potential barriers through which the electron
initially tunnels, and may lead to a questionable physical interpretation of
the features encountered, on the other hand they seem to be necessary in order
to reproduce the overall maxima and minima in the spectra. Indeed, for dressed
electronic bound states in the length gauge, or undressed bound states in the
velocity gauge, for which such shifts are absent, there is a breakdown of the
interference patterns. In order to avoid such a problem, we provide an
alternative pathway for the electron to reach the continuum, by means of an
additional attosecond-pulse train. A comparison of the purely monochromatic
case with the situation for which the attosecond pulses are present suggests
that the patterns are due to the interference between the electron orbits which
finish at different centers, regardless of whether one or two centers are
involved.

galaxy AM1934-563 obtained with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT)
during its performance-verification phase. The observations target the spectral
region of the Ha, [NII] and [SII] emission-lines, but show also deep NaI
stellar absorption lines that we interpret as produced by stars in the galaxy.
We derive rotation curves along the major axis of the galaxy that extend out to
about 8 kpc from the center for both the gaseous and the stellar components,
using the emission and absorption lines. We derive similar rotation curves
along the major axis of the polar ring and point out differences between these
and the ones of the main galaxy. We identify a small diffuse object visible
only in Ha emission and with a low velocity dispersion as a dwarf HII galaxy
and argue that it is probably metal-poor. Its velocity indicates that it is a
fourth member of the galaxy group in which AM1934-563 belongs. We discuss the
observations in the context of the proposal that the object is the result of a
major merger and point out some observational discrepancies from this
explanation. We argue that an alternative scenario that could better fit the
observations may be the slow accretion of cold intergalactic gas, focused by a
dense filament of galaxies in which this object is embedded (abridged).

  Kazanas","Simulations of the Poynting--Robertson Cosmic Battery in Resistive
  Accretion Disks","27 pages, 55 figures",,"10.1086/524699",,"astro-ph",,"  We describe the results of numerical ""2.5--dimensional"" MHD simulations of an
initially unmagnetized disk model orbiting a central point--mass and responding
to the continual generation of poloidal magnetic field due to a secular source
that emulates the Poynting--Robertson (PR) drag on electrons in the vicinity of
a luminous stellar or compact accreting object. The fluid in the disk and in
the surrounding hotter atmosphere has finite electrical conductivity and allows
for the magnetic field to diffuse freely out of the areas where it is
generated, while at the same time, the differential rotation of the disk twists
the poloidal field and quickly induces a substantial toroidal--field component.
The secular PR term has dual purpose in these simulations as the source of the
magnetic field and the trigger of a magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the
disk. The MRI is especially mild and does not destroy the disk because a small
amount of resistivity dampens the instability efficiently. In simulations with
moderate resistivities (diffusion timescales up to $\sim$16 local dynamical
times) and after $\sim$100 orbits, the MRI has managed to transfer outward
substantial amounts of angular momentum and the inner edge of the disk, along
with azimuthal magnetic flux, has flowed toward the central point--mass where a
new, magnetized, nuclear disk has formed. The toroidal field in this nuclear
disk is amplified by differential rotation and it cannot be contained; when it
approaches equipartition, it unwinds vertically and produces episodic jet--like
outflows. The poloidal field in the inner region cannot diffuse back out if the
characteristic diffusion time is of the order of or larger than the dynamical
time; it continues to grow linearly in time undisturbed and without saturation,
as the outer sections of many poloidal loops are being drawn radially outward.
