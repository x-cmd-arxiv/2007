configurations used for computing the interaction potential of heavy quarks
within the gauge/gravity correspondence, to cover a more general class of
gravity duals. We provide results, mostly based on analytic methods and
corroborated by numerical calculations, which apply to strings in a general
class of backgrounds that encompass boosted, spinning and marginally-deformed
D3-brane backgrounds. For the case of spinning branes we demonstrate in a few
examples that perturbative stability of strings requires strong conditions
complementing those following by thermodynamic stability of the dual field
theories. For marginally-deformed backgrounds, we find that even in the
conformal case stability may require an upper value for the imaginary part of
the deformation parameter, whereas in regions of the Coulomb branch where there
exists linear confinement we find that there exist stable string configurations
for certain ranges of values of this parameter. We finally discuss the case of
open strings with fixed endpoints propagating in Rindler space, which turns out
to have an exact classical-mechanical analog.

the Milky Way halo's virial radius. Calculating the maximum accessible volume,

for their detectability. We find that the number density of satellite galaxies
continues to rise towards low luminosities, but may flatten at $M_V \sim -5$;
within the uncertainties, the luminosity function can be described by a single
power law $dN/dM_{V}= 10 \times 10^{0.1 (M_V+5)}$, spanning luminosities from

treated as solely bremsstrahlung (f-f), recombination (f-b) being neglected.
This assumption is shown to be substantially in error, especially in hot
sources, mainly due to recombination onto Fe ions.
  Aims. We analyse the effects on HXR spectra and electron diagnostics by
including non-thermal recombination onto heavy elements in our model.
  Methods. Using Kramers hydrogenic cross sections with effective Z, we
calculate f-f and f-b spectra for power-law electron spectra, in both thin and
thick target limits, and for Maxwellians, with summation over all important
ions.
  Results. We find that non-thermal electron recombination, especially onto Fe,
must, in general, be included together with f-f, for reliable spectral
interpretation, when the HXR source is hot. f-b contribution is greatest when
the electron spectral index is large, and any low energy cut-off small. f-b
spectra recombination edges mean a cut-off in F(E) appears as a HXR feature at
Photon energy = Ec + Vz, offering an Ec diagnostic. Including f-b lowers,
greatly in some cases, the F(E) needed for prescribed HXR fluxes and, even when
small, seriously distorts F(E) as inferred by inversion or forward fitting
based on f-f alone.
  Conclusions. f-b recombination from non-thermal electrons can be an important
contributor to HXR spectra and should be included in spectral analyses,
especially for hot sources. Accurate results will require use of better cross
sections than ours and consideration of source ionisation structure.

The dip is a feature in the diffuse spectrum of ultra-high energy (UHE) protons

electron-positron pair production on the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
radiation. The dip scenario provides a simple physical description of the
transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays. Here we summarize the
signatures of the pair production dip model for the transition, most notably
the spectrum, the anisotropy and the chemical composition. The main focus of
our work is however on the description of the features that arise in the
elongation rate and in the distribution of the depths of shower maximum $X_{\rm

sharp increase with energy, which reflects a sharp transition from an iron
dominated flux at low energies to a proton dominated flux at $E\sim 10^{18}$
eV. We also discuss in detail the shape of the $X_{\max}$ distributions for
cosmic rays of given energy and demonstrate that this represents a powerful
tool to discriminate between the dip scenario and other possible models of the

thermal energy from its mechanical Brownian motion by Doppler effect. For a
normal mirror the efficiency of this Doppler cooling is very weak and masked by
laser shot-noise. We find that it can become very efficient using a Bragg
mirror at the long wavelength edge of its band stop. The opposite effect of
cooling opens new routes for optical pumping of mechanical systems: a laser
pointing at a Bragg mirror and tuned at its short wavelength edge induces
amplification of the vibrational excitation of the mirror leading eventually to
its self-oscillation. This new effects rely on the strong dependency of the
Bragg mirror reflectivity on the wavelength.

reflection of low-frequency Alfven waves propagating along the superradially
expanding solar magnetic field. Complete theoretical models are difficult to

density uncertainties, possibly with the same detector. This effectively makes
the configuration a single experiment, which we call ``neutrino factory

as a function of environment at z>1.5. Our study is motivated by the fact that
star-forming galaxies contained within a protocluster at z=2.3 in the HS1700+64
field have significantly older ages and larger stellar masses on average than
those at similar redshifts but more typical environmental densities. In the
analysis of HST/ACS images, we apply non-parametric statistics to characterize
the rest-frame UV morphologies of a sample of 85 UV-selected star-forming
galaxies at z=1.7-2.9, 22 of which are contained in the protocluster. The
remaining 63 control-sample galaxies are not in the protocluster but have a
similar mean redshift of <z>~2.3. We find no environmental dependence for the
distributions of morphological properties. Combining the measured morphologies
with the results of population synthesis modeling, we find only weak
correlations, if any, between morphological and stellar population properties
such as stellar mass, age, extinction and star-formation rate. Given the
incomplete census of the protocluster galaxy population, and the lack of
correlation between rest-frame UV morphology and star-formation history at z~2
within our sample, the absence of environmental trends in the distribution of
morphological properties is not surprising. Additionally, using a larger sample
of photometric candidates, we compare morphological distributions for 282
UV-selected and 43 near-IR-selected galaxies. While the difference in the
degree of nebulosity between the two samples appears to be a byproduct of the
fainter average rest-frame UV surface brightness of the near-IR-selected
galaxies, we find that, among the lowest surface brightness galaxies, the
near-IR-selected objects have significantly smaller angular sizes (abridged).

decomposed into lateral computation (LaC), longitudinal computation (LoC) and
vertical computation (VeC). It has been shown that various loop structures in
the cortical circuit play important roles in cortical computation as well as in
memory storage and retrieval, keeping in conformity with the molecular basis of
short and long term memory. A new learning scheme for the brain has also been

accreting and wind-driving CTTS. In comparison with other bright CTTS we study
possible signatures of accretion and winds in their X-ray emission. Results: We
find three levels of activity among the observations of RU Lup, clearly of
magnetic origin due to the corresponding high plasma temperatures. Density
analysis with the OVII triplet indicates high densities in the cool plasma,
suggesting accretion shocks to be a significant contributor to the soft X-ray
emission. No strong overall metal depletion is observed. Excess emission at 6.4
keV during the more active phase suggest the presence of iron fluorescence. In
accreting stars we find an excess of cool plasma as evidenced by lower
OVIII/OVII line ratios compared to main-sequence stars. High density plasma
appears to be only present in low-mass CTTS, while accreting stars with
intermediate masses (> 2 M_Sun) have lower densities. Conclusions: In all
investigated CTTS the characteristics of the cooler X-ray emitting plasma are
influenced by the accretion process. We suspect different accretion rates and
amount of funneling, possibly linked to stellar mass and radius, to be mainly
responsible for the different properties of their cool plasma component. The
exceptional strong X-ray absorption in RU Lup and other CTTS is probably
related to accretion flows and an optically transparent wind emanating from the
star or the disk.

nonthermal processes in the intracluster medium (ICM). The presence of
nonthermal pressure components in the ICM, as well as the shock acceleration of
particles and their escape, all affect shock jump conditions in distinct ways.
Therefore, these processes can be constrained using X-ray surface brightness
and temperature maps of merger shock fronts. Here we use these observations to
place constraints on particle acceleration efficiency in intermediate Mach
number (M ~ 2-3) shocks and explore the potential to constrain the contribution
of nonthermal components (e.g., cosmic rays, magnetic field, and turbulence) to
ICM pressure in cluster outskirts. We model the hydrodynamic jump conditions in
merger shocks discovered in the galaxy clusters A520 (M ~ 2) and 1E 0657-56 (M
~ 3) using a multifluid model comprised of a thermal plasma, a nonthermal
plasma, and a magnetic field. Based on the published X-ray spectroscopic data
alone, we find that the fractional contribution of cosmic rays accelerated in
these shocks is lower than about 10% of the shock downstream pressure. Current
observations do not constrain the fractional contribution of nonthermal
components to the pressure of the undisturbed shock upstream. Future X-ray
observations, however, have the potential to either detect particle
acceleration in these shocks through its effect on the shock dynamics, or to
place a lower limit on the nonthermal pressure contributions in the undisturbed
ICM. We briefly discuss implications for models of particle acceleration in
collisionless shocks and the estimates of galaxy cluster masses derived from
X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect observations.

in the extrapolated limits T -> 0 and H -> 0. The power coefficient of the
sublinear dependence is close to that determined in severely underdoped YBCO
thin films, indicating that the same relationship between Tc and the superfluid
density is maintained throughout the underdoped regime. The in-plane GL
coherence length (vortex core size) is found to increase with decreasing hole
doping concentration, and exhibit a field dependence that is explained by
proximity-induced superconductivity on the CuO chains. Both the magnetic
penetration depth and the vortex core size are enhanced near 1/8 hole doping,
supporting the belief by some that stripe correlations are a universal property
of high-Tc cuprates.

disturbed by the interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). A subset,
called magnetic clouds (MCs), is formed by twisted flux ropes that transport an
important amount of magnetic flux and helicity which is released in CMEs. At 1
AU from the Sun, the magnetic structure of MCs is generally modeled neglecting
their expansion during the spacecraft crossing. However, in some cases, MCs
present a significant expansion. We present here an analysis of the huge and
significantly expanding MC observed by the Wind spacecraft during 9 and 10
November, 2004. After determining an approximated orientation for the flux rope
using the minimum variance method, we precise the orientation of the cloud axis
relating its front and rear magnetic discontinuities using a direct method.
This method takes into account the conservation of the azimuthal magnetic flux
between the in- and out-bound branches, and is valid for a finite impact
parameter (i.e., not necessarily a small distance between the spacecraft
trajectory and the cloud axis). Moreover, using the direct method, we find that
the ICME is formed by a flux rope (MC) followed by an extended coherent
magnetic region. These observations are interpreted considering the existence
of a previous larger flux rope, which partially reconnected with its
environment in the front. These findings imply that the ejected flux rope is
progressively peeled by reconnection and transformed to the observed ICME (with
a remnant flux rope in the front part).

perform mesh refinement and study possibly singular solutions of time-dependent

used in statistical mechanics to evaluate the properties of a system near a
critical point. The first algorithm allows the accurate determination of the
time of occurrence of a possible singularity. The second algorithm is an
adaptive mesh refinement scheme which can be used to approach efficiently the
possible singularity. Finally, the third algorithm uses the second algorithm
until the available resolution is exhausted (as we approach the possible
singularity) and then switches to a dimensionally reduced model which, when
accurate, can follow faithfully the solution beyond the time of occurrence of
the purported singularity. An accurate dimensionally reduced model should
dissipate energy at the right rate. We construct two variants of each
algorithm. The first variant assumes that we have actual knowledge of the
reduced model. The second variant assumes that we know the form of the reduced
model, i.e. the terms appearing in the reduced model, but not necessarily their

speeds, we develop fast algorithms that take advantage of adiabatic invariants

  Our results are very relevant for high current Energy Recovery Linacs, where
ions are produced relatively quickly, and where clearing gaps in the electron
beam cannot easily be used for ion elimination. The examples in this paper
therefore use parameters of the Cornell Energy Recovery Linac project. For
simplicity we only consider the case of a circular electron beam of changing

south. The masers are distributed along arc-like structures 12-20 mas across
oriented perpendicular to the separation axis with an angular separation of
~110 mas on the sky. Our multi-epoch observations, show the two maser arcs to
be expanding away from each other along the axis of separation. The relative
proper motions of the two maser regions is 2.7 mas/yr (~105 km/s at the assumed

of simple regular symmetrical graphs, which have the same structural
parameters, such as average distance, degree distribution and node betweenness
centrality, but have very different synchronizabilities. This demonstrates the
complexity of the network synchronizability problem. For a given network with
identical node dynamics, it is further shown that two key factors influencing
the network synchronizability are the network inner linking matrix and the
eigenvalues of the network topological matrix. Several examples are then
provided to show that adding new edges to a network can either increase or
decrease the network synchronizability. In searching for conditions under which
the network synchronizability may be increased by adding edges, it is found
that for networks with disconnected complementary graphs, adding edges never
decreases their synchronizability. This implies that better understanding and
careful manipulation of the complementary graphs are important and useful for
enhancing the network synchronizability. Moreover, it is found that an
unbounded synchronized region is always easier to analyze than a bounded
synchronized region. Therefore, to effectively enhance the network
synchronizability, a design method is finally presented for the inner linking
matrix of rank 1 such that the resultant network has an unbounded synchronized
region, for the case where the synchronous state is an equilibrium point of the
network.

norm, of linearly coupled dynamical networks. An interesting outer-coupling
relationship is constructed, under which the $H_2$ norm of the newly
constructed network with column-input and row-output shaped matrices increases
exponentially fast with the node number $N$: it increases generally much faster
than $2^N$ when $N$ is large while the $H_2$ norm of each node is 1. However,
the $H_2$ norm of the network with a diffusive coupling is equal to $\gamma_2
N$, i.e., increasing linearly, when the network is stable, where $\gamma_2$ is
the $H_2$ norm of a single node. And the $H_2$ norm of the network with
antisymmetrical coupling also increases, but rather slowly, with the node
number $N$. Other networks with block-diagonal-input and block-diagonal-output
matrices behave similarly. It demonstrates that the changes of $H_2$ norms in
different networks are very complicated, despite the fact that the networks are
linear. Finally, the influence of the $H_2$ norm of the locally linearized
network on the output of a network with Lur'e nodes is discussed.

other is that of exterior and interior spacetimes of one black hole. The

apparent lack of any correlation with all the other observables. In order to
pursue these goals we present a new class of hydrodynamical simulations for the
formation of single elliptical galaxies in which we implement detailed
prescriptions for the chemical evolution of H, He, O and Fe. We find that all
the models which predict chemical properties (such as the central mass-weighted
abundance ratios, the colours as well as the [<Fe/H>] gradient) within the
observed ranges for a typical elliptical, also exhibit a variety of gradients
in the [<alpha/Fe>] ratio, in agreement with the observations (namely positive,
null or negative). All these models undergo an outside-in formation, in the
sense that star formation stops earlier in the outermost than in the innermost
regions, owing to the onset of a galactic wind. The typical [<Z/H>] gradients
predicted by our models have a slope of -0.3 dex per decade variation in
radius, consistent with the mean values of several observational samples. We
can safely conclude that the history of star formation is fundamental for the
creation of abundance gradients in ellipticals but that radial flows with
different velocity in conjunction with the duration and efficiency of star
formation in different galactic regions are responsible for the gradients in
the [<alpha/Fe>] ratios.

potential energy landscape is scale-free, and that this reflects a power-law
distribution for the areas of the basins of attraction surrounding the minima.
Here, we set out to understand more about the physical origins of these
puzzling properties by examining how the potential energy landscape of a
13-atom cluster evolves with the range of the potential. In particular, on
decreasing the range of the potential the number of stationary points increases
and thus the landscape becomes rougher and the network gets larger. Thus, we
are able to follow the evolution of the potential energy landscape from one
with just a single minimum to a complex landscape with many minima and a
scale-free pattern of connections. We find that during this growth process, new
edges in the network of connected minima preferentially attach to more
highly-connected minima, thus leading to the scale-free character. Furthermore,
minima that appear when the range of the potential is shorter and the network
is larger have smaller basins of attraction. As there are many of these smaller
basins because the network grows exponentially, the observed growth process
thus also gives rise to a power-law distribution for the hyperareas of the
basins.

reclassified from DB to DBA because of the presence of H lines. 55% of the DB

found before. The large incidence of DBA, and the derived total hydrogen masses
are compatible with the scenario that DBs ``reappear'' around 30000 K from the
DB gap by mixing and diluting a thin hydrogen layer of the order of E-15 Msun.
This hydrogen mass is then during the evolution continuously increased by
interstellar accretion. There are indications that the accretion rate increases
smoothly with age or decreasing temperature, a trend which continuous even
below the current low temperature limit (Dufour 2006). A remaining mystery is
the low accretion rate of H compared to that of Ca observed in the DBZA, but a

general considerations and discuss the implications of our theoretical
observation for two different phenomena: i) the search for medium induced
modifications of the nucleon radius of a bound nucleon through the measurement
of the electromagnetic nucleon form factors via the A(e,e'p)X process, and ii)

Although spin dynamics of the algebraic spin liquid is described by massless
Dirac fermions, this problem differs from the Pseudogap Kondo model, because
the bulk physics in the algebraic spin liquid is governed by an interacting
fixed point where well-defined quasiparticle excitations are not allowed.
Considering an effective bulk model characterized by an anomalous critical
exponent, we derive an effective impurity action in the slave-boson context.
Performing the large-$N_{\sigma}$ analysis with a spin index $N_{\sigma}$, we
find an impurity quantum phase transition from a decoupled local-moment state
to a Kondo-screened phase. We evaluate the impurity spin susceptibility and
specific heat coefficient at zero temperature, and find that such responses
follow power-law dependencies due to the anomalous exponent of the algebraic
spin liquid. Our main finding is that the Wilson's ratio for the magnetic
impurity depends strongly on the critical exponent in the zero temperature
limit. We propose that the Wilson's ratio for the magnetic impurity may be one
possible probe to reveal criticality of the bulk system.

  Methods: The data sample consists of more than 75,000 high-precision CCD time
series measurements in the V band obtained mainly at the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope, with additional data from S. Pedro Martir and Loiano observatories,
over a time span of ten nights. The field covers an area of 42x28 arcmin^2.
  Results: We have discovered 260 new variables and re-determined periods and
amplitudes of 70 known variable stars. By means of a photometric evaluation of
the membership in NGC 6791, and a preliminary membership based on the proper
motions, we give a full description of the variable content of the cluster and
surrounding field in the range 16<V<23.5. Accurate periods can be given for the
variables with P<4.0 d, while for ones with longer periods the limited
time-baseline hampered precise determinations. We categorized the entire sample
as follows: 6 pulsating, 3 irregular, 3 cataclysmic, 89 rotational variables
and 61 eclipsing systems; moreover, we detected 168 candidate variables for
which we cannot give a variability class since their periods are much longer

of the stars with respect to the center of the cluster, we inferred that 11 new
variable stars are likely members of the cluster, for 22 stars the membership
is doubtful and 137 are likely non-members. We also detected an outburst of
about 3 mag in the light curve of a very faint blue star belonging to the
cluster and we suggest that this star could be a new U Gem (dwarf nova)
cataclysmic variable.

interrupted by a Josephson nanoscale tunnel junction. The tunneling amplitude
between two macroscopically different states can be essentially increased, by
engineering of the qubit circuit, if tunnel junction is replaced by a ScS
contact. However, only Josephson tunnel junctions are particularly suitable for
large-scale integration circuits and quantum detectors with preset-day
technology. To overcome this difficulty we consider here the flux qubit with
high-level energy separation between ""ground"" and ""excited"" states, which
consists of a superconducting loop with two low-capacitance Josephson tunnel
junctions in series. We demonstrate that for real parameters of resonant
superposition between the two macroscopic states the tunneling amplitude can
reach values greater than 1K. Analytical results for the tunneling amplitude
obtained within semiclassical approximation by instanton technique show good
correlation with a numerical solution.

showing different states of relaxation. We recover the gas density, temperature

equilibrium hypothesis, radial profiles are also obtained from the deprojection
of the surface brightness, allowing to verify whether the hydrostatic
equilibrium is a tenable hypothesis by comparison with the spectral
measurements. We confirm that this is the case on scales larger than 100 kpc

inner regions. We show that the entropy profiles are remarkably similar outside
the core and can be described by simple power-laws with slope of 1.0-1.2. We
measure an entropy level at 0.1 R_{200} of 100-500 keV cm^2 and a central
plateau which spans a wide range of value (~ a few-200 keV cm^2) depending on
the state of relaxation of the source. To characterize the energetic of the

classes of models with a single (S) absorbing state and with infinitely many

arising from a considerable reduction of the number of absorbing states
(typically from the IM-type to the S-type DP models), by following two
different (excitatory or inhibitory) routes which make the auxiliary field
density abruptly jump at the crossover. Along the excitatory route, the system
becomes overly activated even for an infinitesimal perturbation and its
crossover becomes discontinuous. Along the inhibitory route, we find continuous
crossover with the universal crossover exponent $\phi\simeq 1.78(6)$, which is
argued to be equal to $\nu_\|$, the relaxation time exponent of the DP
universality class on a general footing. This conjecture is also confirmed in
the case of the directed Ising (parity-conserving) class. Finally, we discuss
the effect of diffusion to the IM-type models and suggest an argument why
diffusive models with some hybrid-type reactions should belong to the DP class.

is studied. First we show how the axion electrodynamics model can be embedded
into a premetric formalism of Maxwell electrodynamics. In this formalism, the
axion field is not an arbitrary added Chern-Simon term of the Lagrangian, but
emerges in a natural way as an irreducible part of a general constitutive
tensor.We show that in order to represent the axion contribution to the wave
propagation it is necessary to go beyond the geometric approximation, which is
usually used in the premetric formalism. We derive a covariant dispersion
relation for the axion modified electrodynamics. The wave propagation in this
model is studied for an axion field with timelike, spacelike and null
derivative covectors. The birefringence effect emerges in all these classes as
a signal of Lorentz violation. This effect is however completely different from
the ordinary birefringence appearing in classical optics and in premetric
electrodynamics. The axion field does not simple double the ordinary light cone
structure. In fact, it modifies the global topological structure of light cones
surfaces. In CFJ-electrodynamics, such a modification results in violation of
causality. In addition, the optical metrics in axion electrodynamics are not
pseudo-Riemannian. In fact, for all types of the axion field, they are even
non-Finslerian.

resolution (~18 arcsec) VLA radio observations of this cluster are combined
with higher resolution (~2 arcsec) data available in the VLA archive. We
discover the presence of a diffuse and extended (~500 kpc) radio source
centered on the cluster, unrelated to the radio emission of the central AGN.
The properties of the radio source, in particular a) its occurrence at the

re-acceleration triggered by the central cooling flow. However, we also note
that the morphology of the diffuse radio emission shows an elongation
coincident with the position of a hot subclump detected in X-rays, thus
suggesting that additional energy for the electron re-acceleration might be
provided by the submerger event.

in terms of scalar, vector and tensor components for the fermions. Other
prescriptions for how to discretize the theory follow automatically by
orbifolding and deconstruction. We find that Catterall's complexified model for

supersymmetries. We comment on consistent truncations to lattice theories
without this complexification and with the correct continuum limit. The
construction of lattice theories this way is general, and can be used to derive

  The final state is described by an optical model S-matrix so that both

modified, in the exit channel, by an additional phase.

factor (or odds) for the new parameters. A p-value of 0.05 ($1.96\sigma$)
corresponds to odds less than or equal to 5:2 which is below the `weak' support
at best threshold. A p-value of 0.0003 ($3.6\sigma$) corresponds to odds of
less than or equal to 150:1 which is the `strong' support at best threshold.
Applying this method we find that the odds on the scalar spectral index being
different from one are 49:1 at best. We also find that the odds that there is
primordial hemispherical asymmetry in the cosmic microwave background are 9:1
at best.

two-dimensional honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms with nearest neighbor hopping
only and the 2+1 dimensional Hamiltonian of quantum electrodynamics which
follows in the continuum limit. We pay particular attention to the symmetries
of the free Dirac fermions including spatial inversion, time reversal, charge
conjugation and chirality. We illustrate the power of such a mapping by
considering the effect of the possible symmetry breaking which corresponds to
the creation of a finite Dirac mass, on various optical properties. In
particular, we consider the diagonal AC conductivity with emphasis on how the
finite Dirac mass might manifest itself in experiment. The optical sum rules
for the diagonal and Hall conductivities are discussed.
