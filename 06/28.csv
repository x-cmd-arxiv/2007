scale invariant sector of an effective field theory with an IR fixed point,
manifest in terms of ``unparticles'' with peculiar properties. If unparticle
stuff exists it could couple to the stress tensor and mediate a new 'fifth'
force which we call 'ungravity' arising from the exchange of unparticles
between massive particles, which in turn could modify the inverse square law.
Under the assumption of strict conformal invariance in the hidden sector down
to low energies, we compute the lowest order ungravity correction to the
Newtonian gravitational potential and find scale invariant power law
corrections of type $(R_{G}/r)^{2d_{\cal U} -1}$ where $d_{\cal U}$ is an
anomalous unparticle dimension and $R_{G}$ is a characteristic length scale
where the ungravity interactions become significant. $d_{\cal U}$ is
constrained to lie the range $ d_{\cal U} > 3 (2)$ for a spin 2 (spin 0)
unparticle coupling to the stress tensor (and its trace) and leads to
modification of the inverse square law with $r$ dependence in the range between
$1/r^{4+2\delta} (\delta>0)$, while extra dimension models with warping modify
the force law with corrections beginning with terms O$(1/r^3)$ for small $r$
but exponentially suppressed for large $r$. Thus a discrimination between extra
dimension models and ungravity is possible in future improved submillimeter
tests of gravity.

all k-essence scenarios with Lagrangians p=L(X)/\phi^2, necessarily involve an

select the class of models that describe the late-time acceleration and avoid
the coincidence problem through the tracking mechanism. An analogous ""no-go

superluminal epoch. In the context of k-essence cosmology, the superluminal
epoch does not lead to causality violations. We discuss the implications of

requiring immediate neighbors to store and forward aggregated data for
information disseminations. Using traditional approaches such as gateways or
firewalls for deterring worm propagation in encounter-based networks is
inappropriate. We propose the worm interaction approach that relies upon
automated beneficial worm generation aiming to alleviate problems of worm
propagations in such networks. To understand the dynamic of worm interactions
and its performance, we mathematically model worm interactions based on major
worm interaction factors including worm interaction types, network
characteristics, and node characteristics using ordinary differential equations
and analyze their effects on our proposed metrics. We validate our proposed
model using extensive synthetic and trace-driven simulations. We find that, all
worm interaction factors significantly affect the pattern of worm propagations.
For example, immunization linearly decreases the infection of susceptible nodes
while on-off behavior only impacts the duration of infection. Using realistic
mobile network measurements, we find that encounters are bursty, multi-group
and non-uniform. The trends from the trace-driven simulations are consistent
with the model, in general. Immunization and timely deployment seem to be the
most effective to counter the worm attacks in such scenarios while cooperation
may help in a specific case. These findings provide insight that we hope would
aid to develop counter-worm protocols in future encounter-based networks.

more massive and thus more susceptible to gravitational instabilities (GIs)
than exposed disks. We present three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamics
simulations of protoplanetary disks with the presence of envelope irradiation.
For a disk with a radius of 40 AU and a mass of 0.07 Msun around a young star
of 0.5 Msun, envelope irradiation tends to weaken and even suppress GIs as the
irradiating flux is increased. The global mass transport induced by GIs is
dominated by lower-order modes, and irradiation preferentially suppresses
higher-order modes. As a result, gravitational torques and mass inflow rates
are actually increased by mild irradiation. None of the simulations produce
dense clumps or rapid cooling by convection, arguing against direct formation
of giant planets by disk instability, at least in irradiated disks. However,
dense gas rings and radial mass concentrations are produced, and these might be
conducive to accelerated planetary core formation. Preliminary results from a
simulation of a massive embedded disk with physical characteristics similar to
one of the disks in the embedded source L1551 IRS5 indicate a long radiative
cooling time and no fragmentation. The GIs in this disk are dominated by global
two and three-armed modes.

H = (p^2 + x^2)/2 - g(ix)^{2n+1}, which are crypto-Hermitian in a sense that,
in spite of apparent complexity of the potential, a quantum spectral problem
can be formulated such that the spectrum is real. We note first that the
corresponding classical Hamiltonian system can be treated as a gauge system,
with imaginary part of the Hamiltonian playing the role of the first class
constraint. We observe then that, on the basis of this classical problem,
several different nontrivial quantum problems can be formulated. We formulate
and solve some such problems. We find in particular that the spectrum of the
mixed Hamiltonian undergoes in certain cases rather amazing transformation when
the coupling g is sent to zero. There is an infinite set of phase transitions
in g when a couple of eigenstates of H coalesce and disappear from the
spectrum. When quantization is done in the most natural way such that gauge
constraints are imposed on quantum states, the spectrum should not be positive
definite, but must involve the negative energy states (ghosts). We speculate
that, in spite of the appearance of ghost states, unitarity might still be
preserved.

both symmetric as well as general, non-symmetric. In the general case we
restrict ourselves to Gaussian distributed matrix elements, but different
widths of the various matrix elements are admitted. The following results are
obtained: An explicit exact formula for $P(S)$ is derived and its behaviour
close to S=0 is studied analytically, showing that there is linear level
repulsion, unless there are additional constraints for the probability
distribution of the matrix elements. The constraint of having only positive or
only negative but otherwise arbitrary non-diagonal elements leads to quadratic
level repulsion with logarithmic corrections. These findings detail and extend
our previous results already published in a preceding paper. For the {\em
symmetric} real 2D matrices also other, non-Gaussian statistical distributions
are considered. In this case we show for arbitrary statistical distribution of
the diagonal and non-diagonal elements that the level repulsion exponent $\rho$
is always $\rho = 1$, provided the distribution function of the matrix elements
is regular at zero value. If the distribution function of the matrix elements
is a singular (but still integrable) power law near zero value of $S$, the
level spacing distribution $P(S)$ is a fractional exponent pawer law at small
$S$. The tail of $P(S)$ depends on further details of the matrix element
statistics. We explicitly work out four cases: the constant (box) distribution,
the Cauchy-Lorentz distribution, the exponential distribution and, as an
example for a singular distribution, the power law distribution for $P(S)$ near
zero value times an exponential tail.

theorem obtained in the current paper, Chernoff's theorem for evolution
families, deals with a family of time-dependent generators of semigroups $A_t$
on a Banach space, a two-parameter family of operators $Q_{t,t+\Delta t}$
satisfying the relation: $\frac{\partial}{\partial \Delta t}Q_{t,t+\Delta
t}|_{\Delta t = 0}=A_t$, whose products $Q_{t_i,t_{i+1}}... Q_{t_{k-1},t_k}$
are uniformly bounded for all subpartitions $s = t_0 < t_1 < >... < t_n = t$.
The theorem states that $Q_{t_0,t_1}... Q_{t_{n-1},t_n}$ converges to an
evolution family $U(s,t)$ solving a non-autonomous Cauchy problem. Furthermore,
the theorem is formulated for a particular case when the generators $A_t$ are
time dependent second order differential operators. Finally, an example of
application of this theorem to a construction of time-inhomogeneous diffusions

The active RS CVn-type binaries II Peg and IM Peg and the single M dwarf EV Lac
show significant optical depth. For these active coronae, the Lya/Lyb ratios
are significantly depleted as compared with theoretical predictions and with
the same ratios observed in similar active stars. Interpreting these decrements
in terms of resonance scattering of line photons out of the line-of-sight, we
are able to derive an estimate for the typical size of coronal structures, and
from these we also derive estimates of coronal filling factors. For all three
sources we find that the both the photon path length as a fraction of the
stellar radius, and the implied surface filling factors are very small and
amount to a few percent at most. The measured Lya/Lyb ratios are in good
agreement with APED theoretical predictions, thus indicating negligible optical
depth, for the other sources in our sample. We discuss the implications for
coronal structuring and heating flux requirements. For the stellar sample as a

kG-module M is an endo-trivial module if {\End_k(M)\cong k\oplus F} as
kG-modules, where F is a free module. The classification of endo-trivial
modules is the crucial step for understanding the more general class of
endo-permutation modules. The endo-permutation modules play an important role
in module theory, in particular as source modules, and in block theory where
they appear in the description of source algebras. Endo-trivial modules are
also important in the study of both derived equivalences and stable
equivalences of group algebras and block algebras.
  The collection of isomorphism classes of endo-trivial modules modulo
projectives is an abelian group under tensor product. The main result of this
paper is that this group is torsion free except in the case that G is cyclic,
quaternion or semi-dihedral. Hence for any p-group which is not cyclic,
quaternion or semi-dihedral and any finitely generated kG-module M, if M
\otimes_k M \otimes_k ... \otimes_k M \cong k \oplus P for some projective
module P and some finite number of tensor products, then M \cong k \oplus Q for
some projective module Q. The proof uses a reduction to the cases in which G is
an extraspecial or almost extraspecial p-group, proved in a previous paper of

perturbations. This model is tested against supernova type Ia and matter power
spectrum data. Different from other unified descriptions of dark matter and
dark energy, the matter power spectrum is well behaved, i.e., there are no
instabilities or oscillations on small perturbation scales. The model is
competitive in comparison with the currently most popular proposals for the
description of the cosmological dark sector.

measured [O II] nebular line luminosity, corrected using empirical calibrations
to match more robust SFR indicators. Echoing previous results, we find that in
the local Universe star formation depends on environment such that galaxies in
regions of higher overdensity, on average, have lower star-formation rates and
longer star-formation timescales than their counterparts in lower-density
regions. At z ~ 1, we show that the relationship between specific SFR and
environment mirrors that found locally. However, we discover that the
relationship between total SFR and overdensity at z ~ 1 is inverted relative to
the local relation. This observed evolution in the SFR-density relation is
driven, in part, by a population of bright, blue galaxies in dense environments
at z ~ 1. This population, which lacks a counterpart at z ~ 0, is thought to
evolve into members of the red sequence from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. Finally, we
conclude that environment does not play a dominant role in the cosmic
star-formation history at z < 1: the dependence of the mean galaxy SFR on local
galaxy density at constant redshift is small compared to the decline in the
global SFR space density over the last 7 Gyr.

optical colors, and contaminants. Taking into account the latter, we find no
evidence for an excess of UV-bright galaxies over what was inferred in early

z~2. Corrected for extinction, the UV luminosity density (LD) at z~2 is at
least as large as the value at z~3 and a factor of ~9 larger than the value at
z~6, primarily reflecting an increase in the number density of bright galaxies
between z~6 and z~2. Our analysis yields the first constraints anchored by
extensive spectroscopy on the IR and bolometric LFs for faint and moderately

underestimated the amplitude of the Lyman Break, and thus the relative escape

relative escape fraction, f_esc,rel < 1.0 with some limits as low as f_esc,rel
< 0.10 and a stacked limit of f_esc,rel < 0.08. This demonstrates, for the
first time, that most sub-L* galaxies at high redshift do not have large escape
fractions. When combined with a similar study of more luminous galaxies at the
same redshift we show that, if all star-forming galaxies at z~1 have similar
relative escape fractions, the value must be less than 0.14 (3 sigma). We also
show that less than 20% (3 sigma) of star-forming galaxies at z~1 have relative

fractions found at z~3 and suggest that the average escape fraction has
decreased between z~3 and z~1. (Abridged)

exceeding the total mass of all dense GCs in our Galaxy.
  We find that, in order to reproduce the empirically derived formation rate of
low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), we must assume that NSs can be formed via
electron-capture supernovae (ECS) with typical natal kicks smaller than in
core-collapse supernovae. Our results explain the observed dependence of the
number of LMXBs on ``collision number'' as well as the large scatter observed
between different GCs. We predict that the number of quiescent LMXBs in
different GCs should not have a strong metallicity dependence. In our cluster
model the following mass-gaining events create populations of MSPs that do not
match the observations: (i) accretion during a common envelope event with a NS
formed through ECS, and (ii) mass transfer (MT) from a WD donor. Some processes
lead only to a mild recycling. In addition, for MSPs, we distinguish
low-magnetic-field (long-lived) and high-magnetic-field (short-lived)
populations. With this distinction and by considering only those mass-gaining
events that appear to lead to NS recycling, we obtain good agreement of our
models with the numbers and characteristics of observed MSPs in 47 Tuc and
Terzan 5, as well as with the cumulative statistics for MSPs detected in GCs of
different dynamical properties. We find that significant production of merging
double NSs potentially detectable as short gamma-ray bursts occurs only in very
dense, most likely core-collapsed GCs. (abridged)

surface stability diagrams for AlSb and GaSb under different growth conditions.
For AlSb(001), the predictions are in excellent agreement with experimentally
observed reconstructions. For GaSb(001), we show that previously proposed model
accounts for the experimentally observed reconstructions under Ga-rich growth
conditions, but fails to explain the experimental observations under Sb-rich
conditions. We propose a new model that has a substantially lower surface
energy than all (nx5)-like reconstructions proposed previously and that, in
addition, leads to a simulated STM image in better agreement with experiment
than existing models. However, this new model has higher surface energy than
some of (4x3)-like reconstructions, models with periodicity that has not been
observed. Hence we conclude that the experimentally observed (1x5) and (2x5)
structures on GaSb(001) are kinetically limited rather than at the ground
state.

self-absorption and sub-sonic infall asymmetries are present in N2H+ (1-0) and
DCO+ (2-1) lines. The inward velocity profile in N2H+ (1-0) is extended over a
region of about 7,000 AU in radius around the dust continuum peak, which is the
most extended ``infalling'' region observed in a starless core with this
tracer. The kinetic temperature (~12 K) measured from C17O and C18O suggests
that their emission comes from a shell outside the colder interior traced by
the mm continuum dust. The C18O (2-1) excitation temperature drops from 12 K to
~10 K away from the center. This is consistent with a volume density drop of
the gas traced by the C18O lines, from ~4x10^4 cm^-3 towards the dust peak to
~6x10^3 cm^-3 at a projected distance from the dust peak of 80"" (or 11,000 AU).
The column density implied by the gas and dust show similar N2H+ and CO
depletion factors (f_D < 6). This can be explained with a simple scenario in
which: (i) the TMC-1C core is embedded in a relatively dense environment (H2
~10^4 cm^-3), where CO is mostly in the gas phase and the N2H+ abundance had
time to reach equilibrium values; (ii) the surrounding material (rich in CO and
N2H+) is accreting onto the dense core nucleus; (iii) TMC-1C is older than
3x10^5 yr, to account for the observed abundance of N2H+ across the core
(~10^-10 w.r.t. H2); and (iv) the core nucleus is either much younger (~10^4
yr) or ``undepleted'' material from the surrounding envelope has fallen towards
it in the past 10,000 yr.

infrared luminosity per unit mass of dense gas is high and comparable to that

helicity budgets of a three-dimensional linear force-free magnetic structure

general expression that gives results practically equivalent to those of the
magnetic Virial theorem. All magnetic energy and helicity budgets are
formulated in terms of surface integrals applied to the lower boundary, thus
avoiding computationally intensive three-dimensional magnetic field
extrapolations. We analytically and numerically connect our derivations with
classical expressions for the magnetic energy and helicity, thus presenting a
so-far lacking unified treatment of the energy/helicity budgets in the
constant-alpha approximation. Applying our derivations to photospheric vector
magnetograms of an eruptive and a noneruptive solar active regions, we find
that the most profound quantitative difference between these regions lies in
the estimated free magnetic energy and relative magnetic helicity budgets. If
this result is verified with a large number of active regions, it will advance
our understanding of solar eruptive phenomena. We also find that the
constant-alpha approximation gives rise to large uncertainties in the
calculation of the free magnetic energy and the relative magnetic helicity.
Therefore, care must be exercised when this approximation is applied to
photospheric magnetic field observations. Despite its shortcomings, the
constant-alpha approximation is adopted here because this study will form the
basis of a comprehensive nonlinear force-free description of the energetics and
helicity in the active-region solar corona, which is our ultimate objective.

optical, and {\em Chandra} X-ray data of a small sample consisting of eight FR
I sources. These sources are very dim, with X-ray luminosities $L_{\rm
X}/L_{\rm Edd} \sim 10^{-4}-10^{-8}$ ($L_{\rm X}$ is the X-ray luminosity
between 2-10 keV). We try to fit the multiwaveband spectrum using a coupled
accretion-jet model. In this model, the accretion flow is described by an
advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) while in the innermost region of ADAF
a fraction of accretion flow is transferred into the vertical direction and
forms a jet. We find that X-ray emission in the source with the highest $L_{\rm
X}$ ($\sim 1.8 \times 10^{-4}L_{\rm Edd}$) is from the ADAF. The results for
the four sources with moderate $L_{\rm X}$ ($\sim$ several $\times
10^{-6}L_{\rm Edd}$) are complicated. Two are mainly from the ADAFs, one from
the jet, and the other from the sum of the jet and ADAF. The X-ray emission in
the three least luminous sources ($L_{\rm X} \lesssim 1.0\times 10^{-6}L_{\rm
Edd}$) is dominated by the jet although for one source it can also be
interpreted by the ADAF since the quality of X-ray data is low. We conclude
that these results roughly support the predictions of Yuan & Cui (2005) where
they predict that when the X-ray luminosity of the system is below a critical
value, the X-radiation will not be dominated by the emission from the ADAF any
longer, but by the jet. We also investigate the fuel supply in these sources.
We find that the accretion rates in four sources among the five in which we can
have good constraints to their accretion rates must be higher than the Bondi
rates. This implies that other fuel supply, such as the gas released by the
stellar population inside the Bondi radius, should be important.

For low biases, a reduced current for the derived species is consistent with a
shift of HOMO to lower energy due to the electron withdrawal by Cl or NO2. At
higher biases, the LUMO becomes important, and the Cl and NO2 substituted
species carry more current than the parent because the LUMO is stabilized

(GIS, remote sensing, etc) have led to an increase in attempts to model the
spread and behvaiour of wildland fires across the landscape. This series of
review papers endeavours to critically and comprehensively review all types of
surface fire spread models developed since 1990. This paper reviews models of a
simulation or mathematical analogue nature. Most simulation models are
implementations of existing empirical or quasi-empirical models and their
primary function is to convert these generally one dimensional models to two
dimensions and then propagate a fire perimeter across a modelled landscape.
Mathematical analogue models are those that are based on some mathematical
conceit (rather than a physical representation of fire spread) that
coincidentally simulates the spread of fire. Other papers in the series review
models of an physical or quasi-physical nature and empirical or quasi-empirical
nature. Many models are extensions or refinements of models developed before
1990. Where this is the case, these models are also discussed but much less
comprehensively.

Arches cluster near the Galactic center from near-infrared adaptive optics (AO)
data taken with the recently commissioned laser-guide star (LGS) at the Keck
10-m telescope. The excellent astrometric accuracy achieved with LGS-AO
provides the basis for a detailed comparison with VLT/NAOS-CONICA data taken
4.3 years earlier. Over the 4.3 year baseline, a spatial displacement of the
Arches cluster with respect to the field population is measured to be 24.0 +/-
2.2 mas, corresponding to a proper motion of 5.6 +/- 0.5 mas/yr or 212 +/- 29
km/s at a distance of 8 kpc. In combination with the known line-of-sight
velocity of the cluster, we derive a 3D space motion of 232 +/- 30 km/s of the
Arches relative to the field. The large proper motion of the Arches cannot be
explained with any of the closed orbital families observed in gas clouds in the
bar potential of the inner Galaxy, but would be consistent with the Arches
being on a transitional trajectory from x1 to x2 orbits. We investigate a
cloud-cloud collision as the possible origin for the Arches cluster. The
integration of the cluster orbit in the potential of the inner Galaxy suggests
that the cluster passes within 10 pc of the supermassive black hole only if its
true GC distance is very close to its projected distance. A contribution of
young stars from the Arches cluster to the young stellar population in the
inner few parsecs of the GC thus appears increasingly unlikely. The measurement
of the 3D velocity and orbital analysis provides the first observational
evidence that Arches-like clusters do not spiral into the GC. This confirms
that no progenitor clusters to the nuclear cluster are observed at the present
epoch.

the cooperative interaction of the spin states. We develop a simple model of SC
with intra and intermolecular potentials which accounts for the elastic
interaction including the effect of the inhomogeneity of the spin states, and
apply constant temperature molecular dynamics based on the Nos\'e-Hoover

predict that a higher proportion of short GRBs should occur at moderate to high
redshift (e.g., $z>1$) than has presently been observed, in agreement with
recent observations which suggest a selection bias towards successful follow-up
of low-redshift short GRBs. Finally, if only a fraction of BH-NS mergers have
the right combination of masses and spins to make GRBs, then at best only a
small fraction of BH-NS models could be consistent with all {\em current}

spectrum extracted from the southeast of the remnant is well fitted with a
model consisting of three optically thin thermal non-equilibrium ionization
plasmas and a power-law component. Two of the thermal models are highly
overabundant in heavy elements and, hence, are likely due to ejecta. These
components have different ionization parameters: $n_et \sim 1.4\times 10^{10}$
cm$^{-3}$ s and $n_et \sim 7.7\times 10^8$ cm$^{-3}$ s and it is the later one
that produces the Fe-K emission. This suggests that Fe has been heated by the
reverse shock more recently than the other elements, consistent with a picture
where the ejecta are stratified by composition with Fe in the interior. On the
other hand, the third thermal component is assumed to be solar abundance, and
we associate it with emission from the interstellar medium (ISM). The electron
temperature and ionization parameter are $kT_e \sim $0.5 keV and $n_et \sim
5.8\times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ s. The electron temperature is lower than that
expected from the shock velocity which suggests a lack of collisionless
electron heating at the forward shock. The extremely low ionization parameter

in a variety of other experimental systems.

rapidly rotating star with sufficiently low metallicity can produce a rapidly
rotating, massive stellar core that could be a progenitor of long-soft
gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). Motivated by these studies, we follow the collapse of
a rapidly rotating massive stellar core to a 'collapsar' black hole (BH)
surrounded by a massive, hot accretion disk performing fully general
relativistic simulations. We focus on the general relativistic dynamics of the
collapse, and the relevant microphysics is treated in a qualitative manner. The
simulations are performed until the system consisting of the BH and the disk
has relaxed to a quasi-stationary state. A novel mechanism found in this study
is that strong shock waves are formed at the inner part of the disk after the
formation of the BH. These shock waves propagate mainly along the rotation
axis, heating the disk and sweeping materials around the rotational axis, and
thereby forming a low density region. The temperature of the disk is high
enough for copious neutrino emission. All these features indicate that the
direct formation of a rapidly rotating BH is a promising source of LGRBs even
in the absence of strong magnetic fields.

X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) RXS J170849.0-400910 and 1E 1841-045, respectively. These
observations, part of a larger RXTE AXP monitoring program, have allowed us to
study the long-term timing, pulsed flux, and pulse profile evolution of these
objects. We report on four new glitches, one from RXS J170849.0-400910 and
three from 1E 1841-045. With nearly all known persistent AXPs now seen to
glitch, such behavior is clearly generic to this source class. We show that in
terms of fractional frequency change, AXPs are among the most actively
glitching neutron stars. However, in terms of absolute glitch amplitude, AXP
glitches are unremarkable. We show that the largest AXP glitches observed thus
far have recoveries that are unusual among those of radio pulsar glitches, with
the combination of recovery time scale and fraction yielding changes in
spin-down rates following the glitch similar to, or larger than, the long-term
average. We also observed a large long-term fractional increase in the
magnitude of the spin-down rate of 1E 1841-045 following its largest glitch.
These observations are challenging to interpret in standard glitch models, as
is the frequent occurence of large glitches given AXPs' high measured
temperatures. We speculate that the stellar core may be involved in the largest
AXP glitches. Furthermore, we show that AXP glitches appear to fall in two
classes: radiatively loud and radiatively quiet. The latter, of which the
glitches of J170849.0-400910 and 1E 1841-045 are examples, show little evidence
for an accompanying radiative event. We also show, however, that pulse profile
and pulsed flux changes are common in these AXPs, but do not apprear closely
correlated with any timing behavior.

competition of logistic type, where the number of coexisting types may
fluctuate. Applying a limit of rare mutations to this population while keeping
the population size finite leads to a jump process, the so-called `trait
substitution sequence', where evolution proceeds by successive invasions and
fixations of mutant types. The probability of fixation of a mutant is
interpreted as a fitness landscape that depends on the current state of the
population. It was in adaptive dynamics that this kind of model was first
invented and studied, under the additional assumption of large population.
Assuming also small mutation steps, adaptive dynamics' theory provides a
deterministic ODE approximating the evolutionary dynamics of the dominant trait
of the population, called `canonical equation of adaptive dynamics'. In this
work, we want to include genetic drift in this models by keeping the population
finite. Rescaling mutation steps (weak selection) yields in this case a
diffusion on the trait space that we call `canonical diffusion of adaptive
dynamics', in which genetic drift (diffusive term) is combined with directional
selection (deterministic term) driven by the fitness gradient. Finally, in
order to compute the coefficients of this diffusion, we seek explicit
first-order formulae for the probability of fixation of a nearly neutral mutant
appearing in a resident population. These formulae are expressed in terms of
`invasibility coefficients' associated with fertility, defense, aggressiveness
and isolation, which measure the robustness (stability w.r.t. selective
strengths) of the resident type. Some numerical results on the canonical
diffusion are also given.

antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain as a channel for transmitting
entanglement. One member of a pair of maximally entangled spins is initially
appended to one end of a chain in its ground state and the dynamical
propagation of this entanglement to the other end is calculated. We show that
compared to the analogous scheme with a ferromagnetic chain in its ground
state, here the entanglement is transmitted faster, with less decay, with a
much higher purity and as a narrow pulse form rising non-analytically from
zero. Here non-zero temperatures and depolarizing environments are both found
to be less destructive in comparison to the ferromagnetic case. The
entanglement is found to propagate through the chain in a peculiar fashion
whereby it hops to skip alternate sites.

study the manifestations of the strongly--interacting and electroweak gauge
boson Kaluza--Klein excitations $\vkk$ at the LHC, with masses of the order of
a few TeV, which dominantly decays into top and bottom quark pairs. We first
analyze the two--body tree--level production processes $pp \to t\bar t$ and
$b\bar b$ in which the Kaluza--Klein (KK) excitations of gauge bosons are
exchanged. We find that the additional channels can lead to a significant
excess of events with respect to the Standard Model prediction; characteristic
top quark polarization and angular asymmetries are quantitatively studied and
turn out to probe the chiral structure of couplings to excited states. We then
analyze higher order production processes for the gauge boson excitations which
have too weak or no couplings to light quarks and, in particular, the loop
induced process $gg \to \vkk \to t\bar t$ and $b\bar b$ in which the anomalous
$gg \vkk $ four--dimensional vertex has to be regulated. The RS effects in this
process, as well as in the four--body reactions $pp \to t\bar t b\bar b$,
$t\bar t t\bar t$, $b\bar b b\bar b$ and in the related three--body reactions
$gb \to b t \bar t$, $b b\bar b$, in which the $\vkk$ excitations are mainly
radiated off the eavy quarks, are shown to be potentially difficult to test at

ensemble), and the recently advocated sedimentation equilibrium method, which
records the density profile in an external (e.g. gravitation-like) field and
infers, via a local density approximation, the equation of state from the
hydrostatic equilibrium condition. We confirm the conclusion that the latter
technique is far more efficient than the repulsive wall method, but we find
that the thermodynamic integration method is similarly efficient as the
sedimentation equilibrium method. For very stiff chains the onset of nematic
order enforces the formation of isotropic-nematic interface in the
sedimentation equilibrium method leading to strong rounding effects and
deviations from the true equation of state in the transition regime.

Lie algebras associated with each tree diagram. The solvable tree diagram Lie
algebras turn out to be complete Lie algebras of maximal rank analogous to the
Borel subalgebras of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. Their abelian
ideals are completely determined. Using a high-order Campbell-Hausdorff formula
and certain abelian ideals of the tree diagram Lie algebras, we solve the
initial value problem of first-order evolution partial differential equations
associated with nilpotent tree diagram Lie algebras and high-order evolution
partial differential equations, including heat conduction type equations
related to generalized Tricomi operators associated with trees.

results about the analysis of in-plane lattice spacing oscillations during
two-dimensional (2D) homo and hetero epitaxial growth. The physical origin of
these oscillations comes from the finite size of the strained islands. The 2D
islands may thus relax by their edges, leading to in-plane lattice spacing
oscillations during the birth and spread of these islands. On the one hand, we
formulate the problem of elastic relaxation of a coherent 2D epitaxial deposits
by using the concept of point forces and demonstrate that the mean deformation
in the islands exhibits an oscillatory behaviour. On the other hand, we
calculate the intensity diffracted by such coherently deposited 2D islands by
using a mean model of a pile-up of weakly deformed layers. The amplitude of
in-plane lattice spacing oscillations is found to depend linearly on the misfit
and roughly linearly on the nucleation density. We show that the nucleation
density may be approximated from the full-width at half maximum of the
diffracted rods at half coverages. The predicted dependence of the in-plane
lattice spacing oscillations amplitude with the nucleation density is thus
experimentally verified on V/Fe(001), Mn/Fe(001), Ni/Fe(001), Co/Cu(001) and
V/V(001).

imaged by the Infrared Space Observatory at 90 microns. With the Nancay Radio
Telescope we have studied the gaseous counterpart in the 21-cm HI emission
line. New data have been acquired and allow to improve the signal to noise
ratio on this line. The high spectral resolution line profiles obtained at the
position of the star and at several offset positions set strong constraints on
the gas temperature and kinematics within the detached shell; the bulk of the
material should be at ~ 100-200 K and in expansion at ~ 1-2 km/s. In addition,
the line profile at the central position shows a quasi-rectangular pedestal
that traces an 8 km/s outflow of ~ 1.0 10^-7 Msol/yr, stable for about 2 10^4
years, which corresponds to the central outflow already studied with CO
rotational lines. We present a model in which the detached shell results from
the slowing-down of the stellar wind by surrounding matter. The inner radius
corresponds to the location where the stellar outflow is abruptly slowed down
from ~ 8 km/s to 2 km/s (termination shock). The outer radius corresponds to
the location where external matter is compressed by the expanding shell (bow
shock). In this model the mass loss rate of Y CVn has been set constant, at the
same level of 1.0 10^-7 Msol/yr, for ~ 4.5 10^5 years. The gas temperature
varies from ~ 1800 K at the inner limit to 165 K at the interface between
circumstellar matter and external matter. Our modelling shows that the presence
of a detached shell around an AGB star may not mean that a drastic reduction of
the mass loss rate has occurred in the past. The inner radius of such a shell
might only be the effect of a termination shock rather than of an interruption
of the mass loss process.

zero magnetic field. The T$_1$ mode was excited when the electric field vector
${\bf E}$ of the light was polarized along the b axis (perpendicular to the
planes of chains and ladders) and T$_2$ was excited for ${\bf E}\parallel {\bf
a}$ (perpendicular to the chains and along the rungs). Up to the maximum
magnetic field of 18 T, applied along the chains, the electron $g$ factors of
these two modes were similar, $g_{1c}=2.049$ and $g_{2c}=2.044$. Full linewidth
at half maximum for both modes was 1 cm$^{-1}$ (0.12 meV) at 4K and increased
with $T$. The temperature dependence of mode energies and line intensities was
in agreement with the inelastic neutron scattering results from two groups

from the convection zone it must pass through the partially ionised layers of
the lower atmosphere: the photosphere and the chromosphere. In such regions the
ion-neutral collisions lead to an increased resistivity for currents flowing
across magnetic field lines. This Cowling resistivity can exceed the Spitzer
resistivity by orders of magnitude and in 2.5D simulations has been shown to be
sufficient to remove all cross field current from emerging flux. Here we extend
this modelling into 3D. Once again it is found that the Cowling resistivity
removes perpendicular current. However the presence of 3D structure prevents
the simple comparison possible in 2.5D simulations. With a fully ionised
atmosphere the flux emergence leads to an unphysically low temperature region
in the overlying corona, lifting of chromospheric material and the subsequent
onset of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Including neutrals removes the low
temperature region, lifts less chromospheric matter and shows no signs of the

include such a neutral layer in order to obtain the correct perpendicular

profile. In situations when the temperature is not important, i.e. when no

is demonstrated to adequately reproduce the results of fully consistent

Careful AFM observations have been carried out on each indent in order to take

observed between the two areas: tribofilm modulus and pressure sensitivity are
the same inside and outside the residual hemispherical print. This demonstrates
that Anvil effect is a reversible phenomenon in the studied pressure range.

coronagraph in the visible. This prototype, the achromatic hybrid phase knife
coronagraph, was derived from the four-quadrant phase mask principle. METHODS:
The instrumental setup implementing the coronagraph itself was designed to
record the pre- and post-coronagraphic images simultaneously so that an
efficient real-time image selection procedure can be performed. We describe the
coronagraph and the associated tools that enable robust and repeatable
observations. We present an algorithm of image selection that has been tested
against the real on-sky data of the binary star HD80081 (* 38 Lyn). RESULTS
Although the observing conditions were poor, the efficiency of the proposed
method is proven. From this experiment, we derive procedures that can apply to
future focal instruments associating adaptive optics and coronagraphy,
targeting high dynamic range imaging in astronomy, such as detecting
extra-solar planets.

stochastic dissipation of the accretion disk kinetic energy, mainly via shock
waves. In this scheme, termed thermally-launched jet model, the kinetic energy
of the accreted mass is transferred to internal energy, e.g., heat or magnetic
energy. The internal energy accelerates a small fraction of the accreted mass
to high speeds and form jets. For example, thermal energy forms a pressure
gradient that accelerates the gas. A second acceleration stage is possible
wherein the primary outflow stretches magnetic field lines. The field lines
then reconnect and accelerate small amount of mass to very high speeds. This
double-stage acceleration process might form highly relativistic jets from
black holes and neutron stars. The model predicts that detail analysis of
accreting brown dwarfs that launch jets will show the mass accretion rate to be
larger than 10^{-9}-10^{-8} Mo/year, which is higher than present claims in the
literature.

comprising 1% dust by mass in the presence of an embedded planet for two
different disk configurations: a small, minimum mass solar nebular (MMSN) disk
and a larger, more massive Classical T Tauri star (CTTS) disk. We then vary the
grain size and planetary mass to see how they effect the resulting disk
structure. We find that gap formation is much more rapid and striking in the
dust layer than in the gaseous disk and that a system with a given stellar,
disk and planetary mass will have a different appearance depending on the grain
size and that such differences will be detectable in the millimetre domain with
ALMA. For low mass planets in our MMSN models, a gap can open in the dust disk
while not in the gas disk. We also note that dust accumulates at the external
edge of the planetary gap and speculate that the presence of a planet in the

energy-independent procedure of the quark-model NN interaction with the
continuous prescription for intermediate spectra, by assuming an appropriate
Fermi momentum k_F=1.2 fm^-1. The n alpha RGM interaction kernels are evaluated
with explicit treatments of the nonlocality and momentum dependence of
partial-wave G-matrix components. The momentum dependence of the G-matrix
components is different for each of the nucleon-exchange and interaction types.
Without introducing any artificial parameters except for k_F, the central and
spin-orbit components of the n alpha Born kernel are found to have reasonable
strengths under the assumption of a rigid translationally invariant shell-model
wave function of the alpha-cluster. The characteristic behaviors of three
different exchange terms, corresponding to knockout, heavy-particle pickup and
nucleon-rearrangement processes, are essentially the same between the case of
previous local effective NN forces and the case of nonlocal G-matrix NN

functionals for models of correlated electron systems coupled to external

calculate its exact Kubo-conductance, which is available within DMRG, and
compare to the single-particle conductance obtained from Kohn-Sham energies and

that the position of transport resonances is reproduced essentially exactly,
while deviations in the level broadening can be less than 1% and do not exceed
10%. Our findings lend strong support to a recently held point of view, namely
that approximations in the ground state functionals used in DFT based transport

exchange correlation contributions to the induced effective potential tend to
be less significant.

discontinuity of the X-ray surface brightness in the opposite (NE) side of the
galaxy. The density, temperature and pressure jump at the NE discontinuity
suggest a Mach number ~1, corresponding to a galaxy velocity of ~500 km s-1,
relative to the surrounding hot gas. Spectral analysis of these data shows that
the Iron abundance of the hot gaseous medium is much higher (1-2 solar) near
the center of NGC 7619 and in the tail extending from the core than in the
surrounding regions (< 1/2 solar), indicating that the gas in the tail is
originated from the galaxy. The possible origin of the head-tail structure is
either on-going ram-pressure stripping or sloshing. The morphology of the
structure is more in line with a ram pressure stripping phenomenon, while the
position of NGC 7619 at the center of the Pegasus I group, and its dominance,
would prefer sloshing.

place in the symmetric band below a critical experimentally-accessible Coulomb
interaction strength in the nanotube. Furthermore, due to interactions in the
nanotube, the appearance of a BCS gap in this band stabilizes superconductivity
in the other band at lower temperatures. We also discuss the scenario of highly
asymmetric tunneling and show that this case too supports double-gap
superconductivity.

phase of the disorder operator along a closed loop measures the particle
density accommodating inside this loop. Thus, identifying this (doped) particle
density with the dual counterpart of the magnetic induction in 2D SC, we can
naturally introduce the disorder operator as the dual order parameter of 2D
insulators. The disorder operator has a branch cut emitting from this
``vortex'' to the single infinitely far point. To test this conjecture against
an arbitrary 2D lattice models, we have chosen this branch cut to be compatible
with the periodic boundary condition and obtain a general form of its
expectation value for non-interacting metal/insulator wavefunction, including
gapped mean-field order wavefunction. Based on this expression, we observed
analytically that it indeed vanishes for a wide class of band metals in the
thermodynamic limit. In insulating states, on the other hand, it is quantified
by the localization length or the real-valued gauge invariant 2-from dubbed as
the quantum metric tensor.
