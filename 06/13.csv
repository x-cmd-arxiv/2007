\cite{gP} by proposing a novel technique based on a similar idea. This
technique systematically eliminates from the iteratively obtained solution a
mode that is ""responsible"" either for the divergence or the slow convergence of
the iterations. We demonstrate, theoretically and with examples, that this mode
elimination technique can be used both to obtain some nonfundamental solitary
waves and to considerably accelerate convergence of various iteration methods.
As a collateral result, we compare the linearized iteration operators for the
generalized Petviashvili method and the well-known imaginary-time evolution
method and explain how their different structures account for the differences
in the convergence rates of these two methods.

With consistently derived outflow properties from a large homogeneous dataset
within one molecular cloud we can investigate further the mass dependence and
time evolution of protostellar mass loss. Of the 51 cores, 37 show broad
linewings indicative of molecular outflows. In 13 cases, the linewings could be
due to confusion with neighbouring flows but 9 of those sources also have
near-infrared detections confirming their protostellar nature. The total
fraction of protostars in our sample is 65%. All but four outflow detections
are confirmed as protostellar by Spitzer IR detections and only one Spitzer
source has no outflow, showing that outflow maps at this sensitivity are
equally good at identifying protostars as Spitzer. Outflow momentum flux
correlates both with source luminosity and with core mass but there is
considerable scatter even within this one cloud despite the homogeneous
dataset. We fail to confirm the result of Bontemps et al. (1996) that Class I
sources show lower momentum fluxes on average than Class 0 sources, with a KS
test showing a significant probability that the momentum fluxes for both Class
0s and Class Is are drawn from the same distribution. We find that outflow
power may not show a simple decline between the Class 0 to Class I stages. Our
sample includes low momentum flux, low-luminosity Class 0 sources, possibly at
a very early evolutionary stage. If the only mass loss from the core were due
to outflows, cores would last for 10^5-10^8 years, longer than current
estimates of 1.5-4 x 10^5 years for the mean lifetime for the embedded phase.
Additional mechanisms for removing mass from protostellar cores may be
necessary.

Quasiperturbative connected triple excitations, (T), converge more rapidly than

set), while higher-order connected triples, $T_3-(T)$, converge more slowly --
empirically, $\propto L^{-5/2}$. Quasiperturbative connected quadruple
excitations, (Q), converge smoothly as $\propto L^{-3}$ starting with the
cc-pVTZ basis set, while the cc-pVDZ basis set causes overshooting of the
contribution in highly polar systems. Higher-order connected quadruples display
only weak, but somewhat erratic, basis set dependence. Connected quintuple
excitations converge very rapidly with the basis set, to the point where even
an unpolarized double-zeta basis set yields useful numbers. In cases where
fully iterative CCSDTQ5 (coupled cluster up to connected quintuples)
calculations are not an option, CCSDTQ(5) (i.e., coupled cluster up to
connected quadruples plus a quasiperturbative connected quintuples correction)
cannot be relied upon in the presence of significant nondynamical correlation,

quadruples corrections to the core-valence contribution are thermochemically
significant in some systems. [...] We conclude that ``$3\sigma\leq 1$ kJ/mol''

We demonstrate that the off-diagonal hopping responsible for transitions
between $x^2-y^2$ and $3z^2-r^2$ orbitals, and the absence of SU(2) invariance
in orbital space, have important implications. One finds that superexchange
contributes in all orbital ordered states, the Nagaoka theorem does not apply,
and the kinetic energy is much enhanced as compared with the spin case.
Therefore, orbital ordered states are harder to stabilize in the Hartree-Fock
approximation (HFA), and the onset of a uniform ferro-orbital polarization and
antiferro-orbital instability are similar to each other, unlike in spin case.
Next we formulate a cubic (gauge) invariant slave boson approach using the
orbitals with complex coefficients. In the mean-field approximation it leads to
the renormalization of the kinetic energy, and provides a reliable estimate for
the ground state energy of the disordered state. Using this approach one finds
that the HFA fails qualitatively in the regime of large Coulomb repulsion
$U\to\infty$ -- the orbital order is unstable, and instead a strongly
correlated orbital liquid with disordered orbitals is realized at any electron
filling.

different spatial locations are usually interpreted as indicators of the
connectivity between locations. In neurophysiology, time series of electric
neuronal activity are essential for studying brain interconnectivity. Such
signals can either be invasively measured from depth electrodes, or computed
from very high time resolution, non-invasive, extracranial recordings of scalp
electric potential differences (EEG: electroencephalogram) and magnetic fields
(MEG: magnetoencephalogram) by means of a tomography such as sLORETA
(standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography). There are two
problems in this case. First, in the usual situation of unknown cortical
geometry, the estimated signal at each brain location is a vector with three
components (i.e. a current density vector), which means that coherence and
phase synchronization must be generalized to pairs of multivariate time series.
Second, the inherent low spatial resolution of the EEG/MEG tomography
introduces artificially high zero-lag coherence and phase synchronization. In
this report, solutions to both problems are presented. Two additional
generalizations are briefly mentioned: (1) conditional coherence and phase
synchronization; and (2) non-stationary time-frequency analysis. Finally, a
non-parametric randomization method for connectivity significance testing is
outlined. The new connectivity measures proposed here can be applied to pairs
of univariate EEG/MEG signals, as is traditional in the published literature.
However, these calculations cannot be interpreted as connectivity, since it is
in general incorrect to associate an extracranial electrode or sensor to the
underlying cortex.

luminosity function of a given population is sampled in a flux-limited survey
like the CDF-N. Overall, we find excellent agreement between our simulations
and the observed distribution of F_x/F_opt ratios for absorbed AGNs in the
CDF-N. Our analysis has thus failed to reveal any physical differences between
the local population of Seyfert 2s and CDF-N sources with similar X-ray
properties. These results support the hypothesis that the nuclear emission
lines of many distant hard X-ray galaxies are hidden in ground-based spectra
due to a combination of observational effects: signal-to-noise ratio,
wavelength coverage, and dilution by host-galaxy light.

filters with a typical cycle time of ~3 min during 4 observing runs

spite of the large range of dereddened flux densities for Sgr A* (2-30 mJy),
all of our near-IR measurements are consistent with a constant spectral index
of alpha = -0.6+-0.2. Furthermore, this value is consistent with the spectral
indices observed at X-ray wavelengths during nearly all outbursts; which is
consistent with the synchrotron self-Compton model for the production of the
X-ray emission. During the coordinated observations, one IR outburst occurs <36
min after a possibly associated X-ray outburst, while several similar IR
outbursts show no elevated X-ray emission. A variable X-ray to IR ratio and
constant infrared spectral index challenge the notion that the IR and X-ray
emission are connected to the same electrons. We, therefore, posit that the
population of electrons responsible for both the IR and X-ray emission are
generated by an acceleration mechanism that leaves the bulk of the electron
energy distribution responsible for the IR emission unchanged, but has a
variable high-energy cutoff. Occasionally a tail of electrons >1 GeV is
generated, and it is this high-energy tail that gives rise to the X-ray
outbursts. One possible explanation for this type of variation is from the
turbulence induced by a magnetorotational instability, in which the outer scale
length of the turbulence varies and changes the high-energy cutoff.

and 9-17 for Z=0, 1/50, and 1 Z_sun, respectively, where epsilon is the 'duty
cycle' of Ly-alpha emitters, and gamma ~ 2 is a local slope of the cumulative
luminosity function. Only weak lower limits are obtained for z=8.8. Therefore,
Ly-alpha emitters are consistent with either starburst galaxies M_h/L_bol ~
0.1-1 with a smaller Ly-alpha survival fraction, alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma}
~0.01-0.05, or normal populations (M_h/L_bol ~ 10) if a good fraction of
Ly-alpha photons survived, alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma} ~ 0.5-1. We find no
evidence for the end of reionization in the luminosity functions of Ly-alpha
emitters discovered in the current Ly-alpha surveys, including recent discovery
of one Ly-alpha emitter at z=7. The data are consistent with no evolution of
intrinsic properties of Ly-alpha emitters or neutral fraction in the
intergalactic medium up to z=7. No detection of sources at z=8.8 does not yield
a significant constraint yet. We also show that the lack of detection at z=8.8
does not rule out the high-z galaxies being the origin of the excess NIRB.

compare source counts in the three regions with two other data sets and
predicted star counts from the Wainscoat model. This comparison shows the

magnitude diagrams using the 2MASS and MIPS data. From these results, we can
identify background galaxies and distinguish them from probable young stellar
objects. The sources in our catalogs are classified based on their spectral
energy distribution (SED) from 2MASS and Spitzer wavelengths to create a sample
of young stellar object candidates. From 2MASS data, we create extinction maps

frequency $\kappa$ in the galactic disk, using the large database on open
clusters completed by our group. The observed velocity vector (amplitude and
direction) of the clusters in the galactic plane is derived from the catalog
data. In the epicycle approximation, this velocity is the sum of the circular
velocity, described by the galactic rotation curve, and of a residual velocity,
which has a direction that rotates with the frequency $\kappa$. If for some
reason the clusters are formed with non-random initial perturbation velocity
direction (measured for instance with respect to the direction of circular
rotation), then a plot of the orientation angle of the residual velocity as a
function of age reveals the epicycle frequency. The data analysis confirms that
this is the case; due to the non-random initial velocities, it is possible to
measure $\kappa$ for different galactic radii. Our analysis considers that the
effect of the arms on the stellar orbits is small (the Galactic potential is
mainly axis-symmetric); in this sense our results do not depend on any specific
model of the spiral structure, like the existence of a given number of spiral
arms, or on a particular choice of the radius of corotation. The values of
$\kappa$ provide constraints on the rotation velocity of the disk and on its
minimum beyond the solar radius; in particular, $V_0$ is found to be 226 $\pm$
15 kms$^{-1}$ even if the short scale (R$_0$ = 7.5 kpc) of the galaxy is
adopted. The mesured $\kappa$ at the solar radius is 42$\pm$4

macroscopic turbulence excited by the interaction of the shock with a clumpy

formalism for localized perturbations to an ultra-relativistic shock, we derive
constraints on the lengthscale, amplitude, and volume filling factor of density
clumps required to produce a given magnetic energy fraction within the
expansion time of the shock, assuming that the energy in the field achieves
equipartion with the turbulence. Stronger and smaller-scale inhomogeneities are
required for larger shock Lorentz factors. Hence it is likely that the magnetic
energy fraction evolves as the shock slows. This could be detected by
monitoring the synchrotron cooling frequency if the radial density profile
ahead of the shock, smoothed over clumps, is known.

technologies to the study and possible forecast of strong earthquakes. In this
study we use ASTER/TERRA multispectral satellite images for detection and
analysis of changes in the system of lineaments previous to a strong
earthquake. A lineament is a straight or a somewhat curved feature in an image,
which it is possible to detect by a special processing of images based on
directional filtering and or Hough transform. ""The Lineament Extraction and

(1992, 1997). We assume that the lineaments allow to detect, at least
partially, the presence ruptures in the Earths crust, and therefore enable one
to follow the changes in the system of faults and fractures associated with
strong earthquakes. We analysed 6 earthquakes occurred in the Pacific coast of
the South America and XXX with the Richter scale magnitude >4.5. They were
located in the regions with small seasonal variations and limited vegetation to
facilitate the tracking of features associated with the seismic activity only.
It was found that the number and orientation of lineaments changed
significantly about one month before an earthquake approximately, and a few
months later the system returns to its initial state. This effect increases
with the earthquake magnitude, and it is much more easily detectable in case of
convergent plate boundaries (for example, Nasca and South American plates). The
results obtained open a possibility to develop a methodology able to evaluate
the seismic risk in the regions with similar geological conditions.

pointings, each ~29 ks in length, on 2004 October 22, November 6, and December
3, respectively. The spectrum of the first observation is best fit by a thermal
model with a temperature of kT=1.3 keV and a line-of-sight absorption of
N_H=1.0 x 10^{22} cm^{-2}. The inferred unabsorbed luminosity (0.4-8 keV) is
~4x10^{38} erg/s, adopting a distance of 5.5 Mpc. A comparison between hard and
soft counts on the first and third epochs indicates a softening over this time,
although there is an insufficient number of photons to constrain the variation
of temperature and absorption by spectral fitting. We model the emission as
arising from the reverse shock region in the interaction between the supernova
ejecta and the progenitor wind. For a Type IIP supernova with an extended
progenitor, the cool shell formed at the time of shock wave breakout from the
star can affect the initial evolution of the interaction shell and the
absorption of radiation from the reverse shock. The observed spectral softening
might be due to decreasing shell absorption. We find a pre-supernova mass loss
rate of (2-2.5)x 10^{-6} M_{\odot} /yr for a wind velocity of 10 kms, which is
in line with expectations for a Type IIP supernova.

of metrics under consideration is such that the spacelike section is a warped
product of the real line with a nontrivial base manifold. It is shown that for
generic values of the coupling constants the base manifold must be necessarily
of constant curvature, and the solution reduces to the topological extension of
the Boulware-Deser metric. It is also shown that the base manifold admits a
wider class of geometries for the special case when the Gauss-Bonnet coupling
is properly tuned in terms of the cosmological and Newton constants. This
freedom in the metric at the boundary, which determines the base manifold,
allows the existence of three main branches of geometries in the bulk. For
negative cosmological constant, if the boundary metric is such that the base
manifold is arbitrary, but fixed, the solution describes black holes whose
horizon geometry inherits the metric of the base manifold. If the base manifold
possesses a negative constant Ricci scalar, two different kinds of wormholes in
vacuum are obtained. For base manifolds with vanishing Ricci scalar, a
different class of solutions appears resembling ""spacetime horns"". There is
also a special case for which, if the base manifold is of constant curvature,
due to certain class of degeneration of the field equations, the metric admits
an arbitrary redshift function. For wormholes and spacetime horns, there are
regions for which the gravitational and centrifugal forces point towards the
same direction. All these solutions have finite Euclidean action, which reduces
to the free energy in the case of black holes, and vanishes in the other cases.
Their mass is also obtained from a surface integral.

chain across its quantum critical point. The model investigated is an Ising
chain in a transverse field with disorder present both in the exchange coupling
and in the transverse field. The transverse field term is proportional to a
function $\Gamma(t)$ which, as in the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, is linearly
reduced to zero in time with a rate $\tau^{-1}$, $\Gamma(t)=-t/\tau$, starting
at $t=-\infty$ from the quantum disordered phase ($\Gamma=\infty$) and ending
at $t=0$ in the classical ferromagnetic phase ($\Gamma=0$). We first analyze
the distribution of the gaps -- occurring at the critical point $\Gamma_c=1$ --
which are relevant for breaking the adiabaticity of the dynamics. We then
present extensive numerical simulations for the residual energy $E_{\rm res}$
and density of defects $\rho_k$ at the end of the annealing, as a function of
the annealing inverse rate $\tau$. %for different lenghts of the chain. Both
the average $E_{\rm res}(\tau)$ and $\rho_k(\tau)$ are found to behave
logarithmically for large $\tau$, but with different exponents, $[E_{\rm
res}(\tau)/L]_{\rm av}\sim 1/\ln^{\zeta}(\tau)$ with $\zeta\approx 3.4$, and
$[\rho_k(\tau)]_{\rm av}\sim 1/\ln^{2}(\tau)$. We propose a mechanism for
$1/\ln^2{\tau}$-behavior of $[\rho_k]_{\rm av}$ based on the Landau-Zener
tunneling theory and on a Fisher's type real-space renormalization group
analysis of the relevant gaps. The model proposed shows therefore a
paradigmatic example of how an adiabatic quantum computation can become very
slow when disorder is at play, even in absence of any source of frustration.

be concentrated to the south-east of Tr 16, along the `V' shaped dust lane,
where the next generation of stars seems to be forming. In addition, we find
indications of ongoing star formation near the three MSX point sources,
G287.51-0.49, G287.47-0.54, and G287.63-0.72. A handful of red NIR sources are
seen to populate around each of these MSX sources. Apart from this, we
identified two hard Chandra X-ray sources near G287.47-0.54, one of which does
not have an NIR counterpart and may be associated with a Class I/Class 0
object. The majority of the Class II candidates, on the other hand, are seen to
be distributed in the directions of the clusters, demarcating different
evolutionary stages in this massive star-forming region. A comparison of the
color-magnitude diagrams of the clusters with pre-main sequence model tracks
shows that the stellar population of these clusters is very young (< 3 Myr).
The K_s band luminosity function (KLF) of Tr 14 shows structure at the faint
end, including a sharp peak due to the onset of deuterium burning, implying an
age of 1-2 Myr for the cluster. The KLF of Tr 16, in contrast, is found to rise
smoothly until it turns over. The slopes of the mass functions derived for the
clusters are found to be in agreement with the canonical value of the field
star initial mass function derived by Salpeter.

search for a realistic mechanism for generating long memory has led to the
development of other nonlinear long memory models. In this chapter, we will

investigating a scenario where extra SU(2)-singlet down-type quarks are within

decay rates, minimal flavor violation (MFV) can in principle be excluded.
Conversely, these measurements can probe the way in which MFV applies to the
new degrees of freedom. Many of our conclusions are valid in a much more

from a series of high-resolution N-Body/SPH simulations. The presence of a
gaseous component is essential for the rapid formation of an eccentric
(Keplerian) BH binary, that resides at the center of a massive (~10^9 Msun)
turbulent nuclear disc. Using physically and/or numerically motivated recipes,
we follow the accretion history of the BHs during the merger. The mass of the
BHs increases as large central inflows of gas occur inside each galaxy, and
their mass ratio varies with time. Given the encountered strong degeneracy
between numerical resolution and physical assumptions, we suggest here three
possible paths followed by the galaxies and the BHs during a merger in order to
fulfill the M-sigma relation : Adjustment, Symbiosis, and BH Dominance. In an
extremely high resolution run, we resolved the turbulent gas pattern down to
parsec scales, and found that BH feedback is expected to be effective near the
end of the merger. We then trace the BH binary orbit down to a scale of 0.1 pc
modeling the nuclear disc as an equilibrium Mestel disc composed either of gas,
gas and stars, or just stars. Under the action of dynamical friction against
the rotating gaseous and/or stellar background the orbit circularizes. When
this occurs, each BH is endowed with its own small-size (~0.01 pc) accretion
disc comprising a few percent of the BH mass. Double AGN activity is expected
to occur on an estimated timescale of ~10 Myrs, comparable to the inspiral
time. The double nuclear point--like sources that may appear have typical
separations of ~10 pc, and are likely to be embedded in the still ongoing
starburst.

make the switch sharper (higher Hill coefficient), either by cooperative
binding between molecules of the same species when they bind, or by competition
between the two species if there is sufficient steric hindrance.

Whittington, for a mathematical model describing a copolymer in an emulsion.
The copolymer consists of hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers, concatenated
randomly with equal density. The emulsion consists of large blocks of oil and
water, arranged in a percolation-type fashion. To make the model mathematically
tractable, the copolymer is allowed to enter and exit a neighboring pair of
blocks only at diagonally opposite corners. The energy of the copolymer in the
emulsion is minus $\alpha$ times the number of hydrophobic monomers in oil
minus $\beta$ times the number of hydrophilic monomers in water. Without loss
of generality we may assume that the interaction parameters are restricted to
the cone $\{(\alpha,\beta)\in \mathbb{R}^2\colon |\beta|\leq\alpha\}$.
  We show that the phase diagram has two regimes: (1) in the supercritical
regime where the oil blocks percolate, there is a single critical curve in the
cone separating a localized and a delocalized phase; (2) in the subcritical
regime where the oil blocks do not percolate, there are three critical curves
in the cone separating two localized phases and two delocalized phases, and
meeting at two tricritical points. The different phases are characterized by
different behavior of the copolymer inside the four neighboring pairs of

potential and dispersive narrow band, is examined within the saddle-point
approximation to the Kotliar-Ruckenstein slave boson theory. We first set the
hybridization potential to zero and find that the phase diagram depends
strongly upon the orbital structure: for degenerate orbitals, a
correlated-insulating state is found at sufficiently strong interaction
strengths, whereas a finite orbital energy difference can lead to discontinuous
valence transitions. The obtained phase diagram is very sensitive to the
presence of a finite hybridization potential. As in Hartree-Fock theory, we
find an enhancement of the hybridization by the inter-orbital Coulomb
repulsion. The more precise treatment of correlation effects, however, leads to
large deviations from the Hartree-Fock results. In the limit of vanishing
hybridization an excitonic insulator state is only found when the orbitals are
degenerate, which restricts this phase to a much smaller parameter space than
in other available mean-field theories.

in particular a UV-line driven wind. Despite providing a good fit to the data,
current spectral models of the X-ray spectrum of AGN observed through an
accretion disk wind are ad-hoc in their treatment of the properties of the wind
material. In order to address these limitations we adopt a numerical
computation method that links a series of radiative transfer calculations,
incorporating the effect of a global velocity field in a self-consistent manner
(XSCORT). We present a series of example spectra from the XSCORT code that
allow us to examine the shape of AGN X-ray spectra seen through a wind, for a
range of velocity and density distributions, total column densities and initial
ionization parameters. These detailed spectral models clearly show considerable
complexity and structure that is strongly affected by all these factors. The
presence of sharp features in the XSCORT spectra contrasts strongly with both
the previous models and with the smooth nature of the observed X-ray spectra of
AGN with soft X-ray excesses, demonstrating that accretion disk winds are
unlikely to be the origin of this mysterious spectral feature. The most
significant parameter affecting the presence of the sharp features in the
models is the terminal velocity of the wind. Increasing the terminal velocity
of the absorbing material to ~c, and hence dramatically increasing the velocity
dispersion across the wind, could potentially remove these features resulting
in a spectrum similar to the previous models. Such a fast moving outflow cannot
be associated with a radiatively driven accretion disk wind, however the
presence of a highly relativistic jet may provide an origin for such material.

  Approximate Analytic Approach","5 pages, 4 figures, accepted by A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20077282",,"astro-ph",,"  We look for a simple analytic model to distinguish between stellar clusters
undergoing a bimodal hydrodynamic solution from those able to drive only a
stationary wind. Clusters in the bimodal regime undergo strong radiative
cooling within their densest inner regions, which results in the accumulation
of the matter injected by supernovae and stellar winds and eventually in the
formation of further stellar generations, while their outer regions sustain a
stationary wind. The analytic formulae are derived from the basic hydrodynamic
equations. Our main assumption, that the density at the star cluster surface
scales almost linearly with that at the stagnation radius, is based on results
from semi-analytic and full numerical calculations. The analytic formulation
allows for the determination of the threshold mechanical luminosity that
separates clusters evolving in either of the two solutions. It is possible to
fix the stagnation radius by simple analytic expressions and thus to determine
the fractions of the deposited matter that clusters evolving in the bimodal
regime blow out as a wind or recycle into further stellar generations.

two-time dynamics to external control parameters (such as temperature or
density), as well as their connection to the more standard four-point dynamic
susceptibility associated with dynamical heterogeneities. We then demonstrate
that these functions can be experimentally determined with a good precision. We
gather available data to obtain the temperature dependence of N_corr for a
large number of supercooled liquids over a wide range of relaxation timescales
from the glass transition up to the onset of slow dynamics. We find that N_corr
systematically grows when approaching the glass transition. It does so in a
modest manner close to the glass transition, which is consistent with an
activation-based picture of the dynamics in glassforming materials. For higher
temperatures, there appears to be a regime where N_corr behaves as a power-law
of the relaxation time. Finally, we find that the dynamic response to density,
while being smaller than the dynamic response to temperature, behaves
similarly, in agreement with theoretical expectations.

different data sets including solar wind mass flux coming from the SWAN/SOHO
instrument, electron density values from LASCO-C2 and interplanetary solar wind
velocities derived from ground-based Interplanetary Scintillation Observations
(IPS).
  In a first step, we combine the LASCO electron densities at 6 solar radii and
the IPS velocities, and compare the product to the SWAN mass fluxes. It is
found that this product represents the actual mass flux at 6 solar radii for
the fast wind, but not for the slow wind. In regions dominated by the slow
wind, the fluxes derived from SWAN are systematically smaller. This is
interpreted as a proof that the fast solar wind has reached its terminal
velocity at about 6 solar radii and expands with constant velocity beyond this
distance. On the contrary, the slow solar wind has reached only half of its
terminal value and is thus accelerated further out.
  In a second step, we combine the LASCO-C2 density profiles and the SWAN flux
data to derive velocity profiles in the corona between 2.5 and 6 solar radii.
Such profiles can be used to test models of the acceleration mechanism of the
fast solar wind.

the possibility of a phase transition from the original Hermitian and $PT$
symmetric phase to a non-Hermitian and $PT$ symmetric one. This kind of phase
transition, if verified experimentally, will lead to the first proof that
non-Hermitian and $PT$ symmetric models are not just a mathematical research
framework but are a nature desire. To do the investigation, we calculated the
effective potential up to second order in the couplings and found a Hermitian
to Non-Hermitian phase transition. This leads us to introduce, for the first
time, hermiticity as a symmetry which can be broken due to quantum corrections,
\textit{i.e.}, when starting with a model which is Hermitian in the classical
level, quantum corrections can break hermiticity while the theory stays
physically acceptable. In fact, ignoring this phase will lead to violation of
universality when comparing this model predictions with other models in the
same class of universality. For instance, in a previous work we obtained a
second order phase transition for the $PT$ symmetric and non-Hermitian
$(-g\phi^{4})$ and according to universality, this phase should exist in the
phase structure of the ($g\phi^{4}+h\phi^{6}$) model for negative $g$. Finally,
among the novelties in this letter, in our calculation for the effective
potential, we introduced a new renormalization group equation which describes
the invariance of the bare vacuum energy under the change of the scale. We
showed that without this invariance, the original theory and the effective one

calculation entails a post-Newtonian expansion within the framework of second
order perturbation theory, wherein we consider the effects of subhorizon
density perturbations in a flat, dust dominated universe. Within this
formalism, we calculate luminosity distances and redshifts along the past light
cone of an observer. The resulting luminosity distance-redshift relation is fit
to that of a homogeneous model in order to deduce the best-fit cosmological
constant density Omega_Lambda. We find that the luminosity distance-redshift
relation is indeed modified, by a small fraction of order 10^{-5}. When fitting
this perturbed relation to that of a homogeneous universe, we find that the
inferred cosmological constant can be surprisingly large, depending on the
range of redshifts sampled. For a sample of supernovae extending from z=0.02
out to z=0.15, we find that Omega_Lambda=0.004. The value of Omega_Lambda has a
large variance, and its magnitude tends to get larger for smaller redshifts,
implying that precision measurements from nearby supernova data will require
taking this effect into account. However, we find that this effect is likely
too small to explain the observed value of Omega_Lambda=0.7. There have been
previous claims of much larger backreaction effects. By contrast to those
calculations, our work is directly related to how observers deduce cosmological
parameters from astronomical data.

  vol 665, no 2","Astrophys.J.664:915-927,2007","10.1086/519453",,"astro-ph",,"  The cosmic abundance of the 3-He isotope has important implications for many
fields of astrophysics. We are using the 8.665 GHz hyperfine transition of
3-He+ to determine the 3-He/H abundance in Milky Way HII regions and planetary
nebulae. This is one in a series of papers in which we discuss issues involved
in deriving accurate 3-He/H abundance ratios from the available measurements.
Here we describe the ionization correction we use to convert the 3-He+/H+
abundance, y3+, to the 3-He/H abundance, y3. In principle the nebular
ionization structure can significantly influence the y3 derived for individual
sources. We find that in general there is insufficient information available to
make a detailed ionization correction. Here we make a simple correction and
assess its validity. The correction is based on radio recombination line
measurements of H+ and 4-He+, together with simple core-halo source models. We
use these models to establish criteria that allow us to identify sources that
can be accurately corrected for ionization and those that cannot. We argue that
this effect cannot be very large for most of the sources in our observational
sample. For a wide range of models of nebular ionization structure we find that
the ionization correction factor varies from 1 to 1.8. Although large
corrections are possible, there would have to be a conspiracy between the
density and ionization structure for us to underestimate the ionization
correction by a substantial amount.
