Symmetric Objects (CSOs), J0000+4054 and J1826+1831, and a polarized CSO

rotation, we obtained rotation measures (RMs) of -180 \pm 10 rad m^-2 and 1540
\pm 7 rad m^-2 for the latter two sources. These are lower than what is
expected of CSOs (several 1000 rad m^-2) and, depending on the path length of
the Faraday screens, require magnetic fields from 0.03 to 6 \mu G. These CSOs
may be more heavily affected by Doppler boosting than their unpolarized
counterparts, suggesting that a jet-axis orientation more inclined towards the
line of sight is necessary to detect any polarization. This allows for low RMs
if the polarized components are oriented away from the depolarizing
circumnuclear torus. These observations also add a fourth epoch to the proper
motion studies of J0000+4054 and J1826+1831, constraining their kinematic age
estimates to >610 yrs and 2600 \pm 490 yrs, respectively. The morphology,

classification as a CSO candidate, and its angle to the line of sight (~50\deg)

truncations and warped HI-layers in the outer parts. Warps appear to start
preferentially near the optical boundaries of the disks. Here we make a
comparative study of warps and truncations in edge-on galaxies. The
Garc\'{\i}a-Ruiz et al. (2002) sample with extensive HI-mapping is complemented
with luminosity distributions from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The method to
identify truncations has been tested using the sample of edge-on galaxies of
van der Kruit & Searle. Results are: (i.) The majority (17 out of 23) of the
galaxies show evidence for truncations. (ii.) When an HI-warp is present it
starts at 1.1 truncation radii. (iii.) This supplements the rules for warps
formulated by Briggs (1990), if the Holmberg radius is replaced for edge-on
systems with the truncation radius. (iv.) The truncation radius and the onset
of the warps coincide radially with features in the rotation curve and the HI
surface density. The latter is also true for less inclined systems. (v.) Inner
disks are very flat and the onset of the warp just beyond the truncation radius
is abrupt and discontinuous. These findings suggest that the inner flat disk
and the outer warped disk are distinct components with quite different
formation histories, probably involving quite different epochs. The inner disk
forms initially and the warped outer disk forms as a result of much later
infall of gas with a higher angular momentum in a different orientation. In an
appendix the Holmberg radius is discussed. Contrary to what is often assumed
Holmberg radii are not corrected for inclination.

effectively surveyed.
  We obtain, from the CFHT archives, a series of i' and g' MegaCam images of IC
1613 in order to determine the stellar surface density of the field and
determine the shape of its spheroid. From the colour magnitude diagram we
select some 36,000 stars, in the first three magnitudes of the red giant
branch. The spatial distribution of these stars is used to establish the
structure of the spheroid.
  The position angle of the major axis of the stellar spheroid is found to be
$\approx 90^\circ$, some 30$^\circ$ from the major axis of the HI cloud
surrounding IC 1613. The surface density profile of the spheroid is not
exponential over all the length of the major axis. A King profile, with a core
radius of 4.5' and a tidal radius of 24' fits the data. The tidal truncation of
the spheroid suggests that IC 1613 is indeed a satellite of M31.

oscillations in uniformly rotating solar-type stars. For tidal frequencies
smaller than twice the spin frequency, inertial waves are excited in the
convective envelope and are dissipated by turbulent viscosity. Enhanced
dissipation occurs over the entire frequency range rather than in a series of
very narrow resonant peaks, and is relatively insensitive to the effective
viscosity. Hough waves are excited at the base of the convective zone and
propagate into the radiative interior. We calculate the associated dissipation
rate under the assumption that they do not reflect coherently from the center
of the star. Tidal dissipation in a model based on the present Sun is
significantly enhanced through the inclusion of the Coriolis force but may
still fall short of that required to explain the circularization of close
binary stars. However, the dependence of the results on the spin frequency,
tidal frequency, and stellar model indicate that a more detailed evolutionary
study including inertial and Hough waves is required. We also discuss the case
of higher tidal frequencies appropriate to stars with very close planetary
companions. The survival of even the closest hot Jupiters can be plausibly
explained provided that the Hough waves they generate are not damped at the
center of the star. We argue that this is the case because the tide excited by
a hot Jupiter in the present Sun would marginally fail to achieve nonlinearity.
As conditions at the center of the star evolve, nonlinearity may set in at a
critical age, resulting in a relatively rapid inspiral of the hot Jupiter.

to the early-type galaxies observed in the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey. We have
obtained estimates for a Gaussian representation of the GC luminosity function
(GCLF) for 89 galaxies. We have also fit the GCLFs with an ""evolved Schechter
function"", which is meant to reflect the preferential depletion of low-mass
GCs, primarily by evaporation due to two-body relaxation, from an initial
Schechter mass function similar to that of young massive clusters. We find a
significant trend of the GCLF dispersion with galaxy luminosity, in the sense
that smaller galaxies have narrower GCLFs. We show that this narrowing of the
GCLF in a Gaussian description is driven by a steepening of the GC mass
function above the turnover mass, as one moves to smaller host galaxies. We
argue that this behavior at the high-mass end of the GC mass function is most
likely a consequence of systematic variations of the initial cluster mass
function. The GCLF turnover mass M_TO is roughly constant, at ~ 2.2 x 10^5
M_sun in bright galaxies, but it decreases slightly in dwarfs with M_B >~ -18.
We show that part of the variation could arise from the shorter dynamical
friction timescales in smaller galaxies. We probe the variation of the GCLF to
projected galactocentric radii of 20-35 kpc in the Virgo giants M49 and M87,
finding that M_TO is essentially constant over these spatial scales. Our fits
of evolved Schechter functions imply average dynamical mass losses (Delta) over
a Hubble time that fall in the range 2 x 10^5 <~ (Delta/M_sun) < 10^6 per GC.
We agree with previous suggestions that if the full GCLF is to be understood in
more detail GCLF models will have to include self-consistent treatments of
dynamical evolution inside time-dependent galaxy potentials. (Abridged)

cross-correlated, and this leads to a wave packet signal. Accurately measuring
the travel times of these wave packets is crucial for inferring the sub-surface
properties in the Sun. The observed signal is quite noisy, and to improve the
signal-to-noise ratio and make the cross-correlation more robust, the temporal
oscillation signal is phase-speed filtered at the two points in order to select
waves that travel a fixed horizontal distance. Hence a new formula to estimate
the travel times is derived, in the presence of a phase speed filter, and it
includes both the radial and horizontal component of the oscillation
displacement signal. It generalizes the previously used Gabor wavelet that was
derived without a phase speed filter and included only the radial component of
the displacement. This is important since it will be consistent with the
observed cross-correlation that is computed using a phase speed filter, and
also it accounts for both the components of the displacement. The new formula
depends on the location of the two points on the solar surface that are being

kinematically cold the second peak of the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal (UMi

compact objects as a function of their assumed mass. The mass of the dark
matter constituents cannot be larger than 1000 solar masses at a halo density
in UMi's core of 0.35 solar masses/pc^3. This constraint rules out a scenario
in which dark halo cores are formed by two-body relaxation processes. Our
bounds on the fraction of dark matter in compact objects with masses >3000
solar masses improve those based on dynamical arguments in the Galactic halo.
In particular, objects with masses $\sim 10^{5}$ solar masses can comprise no
more than a halo mass fraction $\sim 0.01$. Better determinations of the
velocity dispersion of old overdense regions in dSphs may result in more
stringent constraints on the mass of halo objects. For illustration, if the

compact objects with masses above $\sim 100$ solar masses could be excluded

narrower than that determined from the radio-submm spectral index, as more
photometric bands contribute to a higher redshift accuracy. The redshift
distribution of sources derived from at least two photometric bands peaks at z

the contaminations by miscellaneous sources such as foreground stars and
early-type dwarfs in the Magellanic Bridge, we estimate that about 80 (about
40%) of the candidates are likely to be Herbig Ae/Be stars. We also found one
concentration of the candidates at the young star cluster NGC 796, strongly
suggesting the existence of pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in the Magellanic

Bridge, and if they are genuine PMS stars, this could be direct evidence of
recent star formation. However, the estimate of the number of Herbig Ae/Be
stars depends on the fraction of classical Be stars, and thus a more precise
determination of the Be star fraction or observations to differentiate between
the Herbig Ae/Be stars and classical Be stars are required.

properties of the Crab nebula. The distribution function of the plasma and the
energy density of the magnetic field are prescribed as function of the distance
from the pulsar by using the model by Kennel and Coroniti (1984) with $\sigma =
0.003$, where $\sigma$ is the ratio of Poynting flux to the kinetic energy flux
in the bulk motion just before the termination shock. Unlike previous models,
we introduce disordered magnetic field, which is parameterized by the
fractional energy density of the disordered component. Flow dynamics is not
solved. The mean field is toroidal. Averaged polarization degree over the disc
is obtained as a function of inclination angle and fractional energy density of
the disordered magnetic field. It is found for the Crab that the disordered
component has about 60 percent of the magnetic field energy. This value is also
supported by the facts that the disc appears not `lip-shape' but as `rings' in
the intensity map as was observed, and that the highest polarization degree of
$\sim 40$ percent is reproduced for rings, being consistent with the
observation. We suggest that because the disordered field contributes rather
pressure than tension, the pinch force may be over-estimated in previous
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Disruption of the toroidal
magnetic field with alternating direction, which is proposed by Lyubarski
(2003), may actually takes place. The relativistic flow speed, which is
indicated by the front-back contrast, can be detected in asymmetry in
distributions of the position angle and depolarization.

  SUNRISE is used on eight different Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
simulations of isolated spiral galaxies. These galaxies vary mainly in mass and
hence luminosity, spanning a range in luminosities from -16 to -22 magnitudes
in the B band. We focus on the attenuation in different wavelength bands as a
function of the disk inclination and the luminosity of the models, and compare
this to observations.
  Observations suggest different metallicity gradients for galaxies of
different luminosities. These metallicity gradients were explored in our
different models, finding that the resulting dust attenuation matches
observations for edge-on galaxies, but do not show a linear behaviour in log
axis ratio as some observations have suggested. A quadratic law describing the
dependence of attenuation on inclination, as proposed by more recent
observations, reconciles the attenuation of the simulations at intermediate
inclinations with observations. We also compare the total

the SINGS sample and find general agreement. Finally we compare our results
with those from simpler models that do not take into account structure such as
spiral arms, finding that the inclusion of sub-structure on the size scale of
spiral arms does not change conclusions about the attenuation dependence on
inclination or wavelength.

September 29 and 30, October 3, 6 and 9 and November 1, 2005. The wavelength
range covered by the spectra is from 3565 A to 8365 A. The spectra are of high
S/N allowing the study of the evolution of the equivalent widths of the Balmer
lines, as well as the identification of non-Balmer lines. The nova displays a
typical early decline spectrum that is characterized by many weak FeII
multiplet emissions. It is classified as a P$_{fe}$ nova. From the nova light
curve, we have also derived its speed class, t=14+-2.5 days. As the nova
evolved the Balmer lines became stronger and narrower. The early decline of the
expansion velocity of the nova follows a power law in time with an exponent of
\~-0.2.

singleton is a star which formed as a single star, has never experienced any
close encounters with other stars or binaries, or undergone an exchange
encounter with a binary. We find that, of the stars which formed as single
stars, a significant fraction are not singletons once the clusters have
dispersed. If some of these stars had planetary systems, with properties
similar to those of the solar system, the planets orbits may have been
perturbed by the effects of close encounters with other stars or the effects of
a companion star within a binary. Such perturbations can lead to strong
planet-planet interactions which eject several planets, leaving the remaining
planets on eccentric orbits. Some of the single stars exchange into binaries.
Most of these binaries are broken up via subsequent interactions within the
cluster, but some remain intact beyond the lifetime of the cluster. The
properties of these binaries are similar to those of the observed binary
systems containing extra-solar planets. Thus, dynamical processes in young
stellar clusters will alter significantly any population of solar-system-like
planetary systems. In addition, beginning with a population of planetary
systems exactly resembling the solar system around single stars, dynamical
encounters in young stellar clusters may produce at least some of the
extra-solar planetary systems observed in the solar neighbourhood.

binary systems due to tidal captures of single stars and exchange interactions

important aspect of the circumstances under which life formed on Earth. The
quantity that is received depends on two main variables: the emission of
radiation by the young Sun and its extinction through absorption and scattering
by the Earth's early atmosphere. The spectrum emitted by the Sun when life
formed, between 4 and 3.5 Ga, was modeled here, including the effects of flares
and activity cycles, using a solar-like star that has the same age now as the
Sun had 4-3.5 Ga. Atmospheric extinction was calculated using the Beer-Lambert
law, assuming several density profiles for the atmosphere of the Archean Earth.
We found that almost all radiation with a wavelength shorter than 200 nm is
attenuated effectively, even by very tenuous atmospheres. Longer-wavelength
radiation is progressively less well attenuated, and its extinction is more
sensitive to atmospheric composition. Minor atmospheric components, such as
methane, ozone, water vapor, etc., have only negligible effects, but changes in
CO2 concentration can cause large differences in surface flux. Differences due
to variability in solar emission are small compared to this. In all cases
surface radiation levels on the Archean Earth were several orders of magnitude
higher in the 200-300 nm wavelength range than current levels in this range.
That means that any form of life that might have been present at Earth's
surface 4-3.5 Ga must have been exposed to much higher quantities of damaging
radiation than at present.

a Haldane gap in the excitation spectrum. We generalize some of our models to

a Haldane gap if the spins transform under a representation corresponding to a

anomalous} diffusive behavior even in the {\em presence} of an external force.
The anomalous dynamics of the translocation process is governed by the same
universal exponent $\alpha = 2/(2\nu +2 - \gamma_1)$, where $\nu$ is the Flory
exponent and $\gamma_1$ - the surface exponent, which was established recently
for the case of non-driven polymer chain threading through a nanopore. A closed

follows from the relevant {\em fractional} Fokker - Planck equation, is derived
in terms of the polymer chain length $N$ and the applied drag force $f$. It is
found that the average translocation time scales as $\tau \propto
f^{-1}N^{\frac{2}{\alpha} -1}$. Also the corresponding time dependent
statistical moments, $< s(t) > \propto t^{\alpha}$ and $< s(t)^2 > \propto
t^{2\alpha}$ reveal unambiguously the anomalous nature of the translocation

demonstrated through several representative case studies. Second, when the

  We investigate how the performance of this heuristic changes when it is
distributively implemented in a network. Even if network edges are allow to
fail over time, we show that the nearest neighbor strategy never runs for more
than O(n^2) iterations. We also show that any strategy can be forced to take at
least n(n-1)/2 steps before all nodes are visited, if the edges of the network
are deleted in an adversarial way.

for a source with memory. Close relationships between guessing functions and

for sources with memory. The performance metrics are exponents of guessing
moments and probability of large deviations. The metrics are then characterized
for unifilar sources. Universal asymptotically optimal encryption and attack
strategies are also identified for unifilar sources. Guessing in the increasing
order of Lempel-Ziv coding lengths is proposed for finite-state sources, and
shown to be asymptotically optimal. Finally, competitive optimality properties
of guessing in the increasing order of description lengths and Lempel-Ziv

incorporating inference rules for definitions that allow fixed points to be
explored. As a result, proof search in such a sequent calculus can capture
simple model checking problems as well as may and must behavior in operational

supported using term-level $\lambda$-binders and the $\nabla$ quantifier. These

the orbital frequency and radial velocities to minimize the orbital

the prediction of Peters (1964). The gravitational waveforms, which contain

a pre big bang Ekpyrotic phase. By combining this with a ghost condensate, the
theory explicitly violates the null energy condition without developing any
ghost-like instabilities. Thus the contracting universe goes through a
non-singular bounce and evolves smoothly into the expanding post big bang
phase. The curvature perturbation acquires a scale-invariant spectrum well
before the bounce in this scenario. It is sourced by the scale-invariant
entropy perturbation engendered by two ekpyrotic scalar fields, a mechanism
recently proposed by Lehners et al. Since the background geometry is
non-singular at all times, the curvature perturbation remains nearly constant
on super horizon scales. It emerges from the bounce unscathed and imprints a
scale-invariant spectrum of density fluctuations in the matter-radiation fluid
at the onset of the hot big bang phase. The ekpyrotic potential can be chosen
so that the spectrum has a ``red'' tilt, in accordance with the recent data
from WMAP. As in the original Ekpyrotic scenario, the model predicts a
negligible gravity wave signal on all observable scales. As such ``New
Ekpyrotic Cosmology"" provides a consistent and distinguishable alternative to
inflation to account for the origin of the seeds of large scale structure.

square-wave frequency modulation. We observe a degradation of the stability
whose dependence with the modulation frequency reproduces the theoretical
predictions for the intermodulation effect. In particular no observable
degradation occurs when this frequency equals the Ramsey linewidth.

oscillating electric and magnetic fields from a moving electric dipole source.
The results show that both the magnetic field and electric fields generated
propagate faster than the speed of light in the nearfield and reduce to the
speed of light as they propagate into the farfield of the source. In addition,
the results show that the speed of the fields are dependant on the velocity of
the source in the nearfield and only become independent in the farfield. These
effects are shown to be the same whether the source or observation point is
moving. Because these effects conflict with the assumptions on which Einstein's
theory of special relativity theory is based, relativity theory is reanalyzed.
The analysis shows that the relativistic gamma factor is dependant on whether
the analysis is performed using nearfield or farfield propagating EM fields. In
the nearfield, gamma is approximately one indicating that the coordinate
transforms are Galilean in the nearfield. In the farfield the gamma factor
reduces to the standard known relativistic formula indicating that they are
approximately valid in the farfield. Because time dilation and space
contraction depend on whether nearfield or farfield propagating fields are used
in their analysis, it is proposed that Einstein relativistic effects are an
illusion created by the propagating EM fields used in their measurement.
Instead space and time are proposed to not be flexible as indicated by Galilean
relativity.

housefly with free range of a square cage. The trajectory of the fly was
recorded and transformed into a time series, which was fully analyzed using an
autoregressive model, which describes a stationary time series by a linear
regression of prior state values with the white noise. The main discovery was
that the fly switched styles of motion from a low dimensional regular pattern
to a higher dimensional disordered pattern. This discovered exploratory
behavior is, irrespective of the presence of food, characterized by anomalous
diffusion.

"q-bio/0702039","Atul Narang","Atul Narang","Effect of DNA looping on the induction kinetics of the lac operon","37 pages, J. Theoret. Biol",,,,"q-bio.MN q-bio.CB",,"  The induction of the lac operon follows cooperative kinetics.The first
mechanistic model of these kinetics is the de facto standard in the modeling
literature (Yagil & Yagil, Biophys J, 11, 11-27, 1971). Yet, subsequent studies
have shown that the model is based on incorrect assumptions. Specifically, the
repressor is a tetramerwith four (not two) inducer-binding sites, and the
operon contains two auxiliary operators (in addition to the main operator).
Furthermore, these structural features are crucial for the formation of DNA
loops, the key determinants of lac repression and induction. Indeed, the
repression is determined almost entirely (>95%) by the looped complexes (Oehler
et al, EMBO J, 13, 3348, 1990), and the pronounced cooperativity of the
induction curve hinges upon the existence of the looped complexes (Oehler et
al, Nucleic Acids Res, 34, 606, 2006). Here, we formulate a model of lac
induction taking due account of the tetrameric structure of the repressor and
the existence of looped complexes. We show that: (1) The kinetics are
significantly more cooperative than those predicted by the Yagil & Yagil model.
(2) The model provides good fits to the repression data for cells containing
tetrameric (or mutant dimeric) repressor, as well as the induction curves for 6
different strains of E. coli. It also implies that the ratios of certain looped
and non-looped complexes are independent of inducer and repressor levels, a
conclusion that can be rigorously tested by gel electrophoresis. (3) Repressor
overexpression dramatically increases the cooperativity of the induction curve.
This suggests that repressor overexpression can induce bistability in systems,
such as growth of E. coli on lactose, that are otherwise monostable.

prove is identical to standard classical privacy amplification. Underlying this

formulation by the uncertainty principle, which gives a more physical

interesting questions on the validity of Complementarity in cases where
measurements techniques that avoid Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and

classical concepts of waves and particles as embodied in Complementarity leads
to a logical inconsistency in the interpretation of this experiment.

arbitrary amount of white noise before they admit a description within a local
hidden variable model. This is in sharp contrast with the bipartite case, where
all violations are bounded by Grothendieck's constant. We will discuss the
possibility of determining the Hilbert space dimension from the obtained
violation and comment on implications for communication complexity theory.
Moreover, we show that the violation obtained from generalized GHZ states is
always bounded so that, in contrast to many other contexts, GHZ states do in
this case not lead to extremal quantum correlations. The results are based on
tools from the theories of operator spaces and tensor norms which we exploit to
prove the existence of bounded but not completely bounded trilinear forms from
commutative C*-algebras.

quantum nonlinear dynamics is quantified by the mismatch of the quasi-flow
carried by different observables. It is shown that the failure of classical
realism can give rise to a dynamical violation of Bell's inequalities.

trapped in an optical lattice. Scattering from different atomic quantum states
creates different quantum states of the scattered light, which can be
distinguished by measurements of the spatial intensity distribution, quadrature
variances, photon statistics, or spectral measurements. In particular,
angle-resolved intensity measurements reflect global statistics of atoms (total
number of radiating atoms) as well as local statistical quantities (single-site
statistics even without an optical access to a single site) and pair
correlations between different sites. As a striking example we consider
scattering from transversally illuminated atoms into an optical cavity mode.
For the Mott insulator state, similar to classical diffraction, the number of
photons scattered into a cavity is zero due to destructive interference, while
for the superfluid state it is nonzero and proportional to the number of atoms.
Moreover, we demonstrate that light scattering into a standing-wave cavity has
a nontrivial angle dependence, including the appearance of narrow features at
angles, where classical diffraction predicts zero. The measurement procedure
corresponds to the quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement of various atomic
variables by observing light.
