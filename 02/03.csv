incompressible, inviscid hydrodynamical fluids, with the ultimate goal of
understanding the dynamics of accretion disks. To linear order, vorticity waves
are swung around by the background shear, and their velocities are amplified
transiently before decaying. It has been speculated that sufficiently amplified
modes might couple nonlinearly, leading to turbulence. Here we show how
nonlinear coupling occurs in two dimensions. This coupling is remarkably simple
because it only lasts for a short time interval, when one of the coupled modes
is in mid-swing. We focus on the interaction between a swinging and an
axisymmetric mode. There is instability provided that k_{y,swing}/k_{x,axi} <
omega/q, i.e., that the ratio of wavenumbers is less than the ratio of the
axisymmetric mode's vorticity to the background vorticity. If this is the case,
then when the swinging mode is in mid-swing it couples with the axisymmetric
mode to produce a new leading swinging mode that has larger vorticity than
itself; this new mode in turn produces an even larger leading mode, etc.
Therefore all axisymmetric modes, regardless of how small in amplitude, are
unstable to perturbations with sufficiently large azimuthal wavelength. We show
that this shear instability occurs whenever the momentum transported by a
perturbation has the sign required for it to diminish the background shear;
only when this occurs can energy be extracted from the mean flow and hence
added to the perturbation. For an accretion disk, this means that the
instability transports angular momentum outwards while it operates.

context of studying the neutral intergalactic medium during cosmic reionization
using the HI 21cm line of neutral hydrogen. The epoch of reionization is the
next frontier in observational cosmology, and HI 21cm studies are recognized as
the most direct probe of this key epoch in cosmic structure formation. Current
constraints on reionization indicate that the redshifted HI 21cm signals will
likely be in the range of 100 MHz to 180 MHz, with the pre-reionization signal
going to as low as 10 MHz. The primary observational challenges to these
studies are: (1) ionospheric phase fluctuations, (ii) terrestrial radio
frequency interference, and (iii) Galactic and extragalactic foreground
radiation. Going to the far side of the moon removes the first two of these
challenges. Moreover, a low frequency telescope will be relatively easy to
deploy and maintain on the moon, at least compared to other, higher frequency
telescopes. We discuss the potential 21cm signals from reionization, and
beyond, and the telescope specifications needed to measure these signals. The
near-term ground-based projects will act as path-finders for a potential future
low frequency radio telescope on the moon. If it is found that the terrestrial
interference environment, or ionospheric phase fluctuations, preclude
ground-based studies of reionization, then it becomes imperative to locate
future telescopes on the far side of the moon. Besides pursuing these
path-finder reionization telescopes, we recommend a number of near-term studies
that could help pave the way for low frequency astronomy on the moon.

local interstellar medium is currently uncertain, making it difficult to infer
the recent chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood. To account for the
observed quasi-constancy of He-3 abundance from the Big Bang to our days, the
stellar production of that nuclide must be negligible; however, the scarce
observations of its abundance in planetary nebulae seem to contradict this
idea. The observed Be and B evolution as primaries suggests that the source
composition of cosmic rays has remained quasi-constant since the early days of
the Galaxy, a suggestion with far reaching implications for the origin of
cosmic rays; however, the main idea proposed to account for that constancy,
namely that superbubbles are at the source of cosmic rays, encounters some
serious difficulties. The best explanation for the mismatch between primordial
Li and the observed ""Spite-plateau"" in halo stars appears to be depletion of Li
in stellar envelopes, by some yet poorly understood mechanism. But this

fields are expected to be generated by a coherent alpha-Omega dynamo in the
early seconds after the Neutron Star formation, if its spin period is of a few
milliseconds at most. A substantial deformation of the NS is caused by such
fields and a newborn millisecond-spinning magnetar would thus radiate for a few
days a strong gravitational wave signal. Such a signal may be detected with
Advanced LIGO-class detectors up to the distance of the Virgo cluster, where ~
1 magnetar per year are expected to form. Recent X-ray observations reveal that
SNRs around magnetar candidates do not show evidence for a larger energy
content than standard SNRs (Vink & Kuiper 2006). This is at variance with what
would be expected if the spin energy of the young, millisecond NS were radiated
away as electromagnetic radiation andd/or relativistic particle winds and,
thus, transferred quickly to the expanding gas shell. We show here that these
recent findings can be reconciled with the idea of magnetars being formed with
fast spins, if most of their initial spin energy is radiated thorugh GWs. In
particular, we find that this occurs for essentially the same parameter range

sunspots) acoustic waves travel faster than in quiet sun, leading to shortened
travel times and higher p-mode frequencies. While it is clear that the ultimate
cause of any difference between quiet sun and plage is the presence of magnetic
fields of order 100 G in the latter, the mechanism by which the magnetic field
exerts its influence has not yet been conclusively identified. One possible
such mechanism is suggested by the observation that granular motions in plage
areas tend to be slightly ``abnormal'', dampened compared to quiet sun.
  In this paper we consider the effect that abnormal granulation observed in
active regions should have on the propagation of acoustic waves. Any such
effect is found to be limited to a shallow surface layer where sound waves
propagate nearly vertically. The magnetically suppressed turbulence implies
higher sound speeds, leading to shorter travel times. This time shift Dt is
independent of the travel distance, while it shows a characteristic dependence
on the assumed plage field strength. As a consequence of the variation of the
acoustic cutoff with height, Dt is expected to be significantly higher for
higher frequency waves within the observed regime of 3-5 mHz. The lower group
velocity near the upper reflection point further leads to an increased envelope
time shift, as compared to the phase shift. $p$-mode frequencies in plage areas
are increased by a corresponding amount, Dnu/nu = nu*Dt. These characteristics
of the time and frequency shifts are in accordance with observations. The
calculated overall amplitude of the time and frequency shifts are comparable
to, but still significantly (factor of 2 to 5) less than suggested by
measurements.

image processing techniques, as well as numerical simulations that provide a
more realistic view of the chromosphere, a comprehensive understanding of
chromospheric jets such as spicules, mottles and fibrils is now within reach.
In this paper, we briefly summarize results from a recent analysis of dynamic
fibrils, short-lived jet-like features that dominate the chromosphere (as
imaged in H-alpha) above and about active region plage. Using extremely
high-resolution observations obtained at the SST, and advanced numerical 2D
radiative MHD simulations, we show that fibrils are most likely formed by
chromospheric shock waves that occur when convective flows and global
oscillations leak into the chromosphere along the field lines of magnetic flux
concentrations. In addition, we present some preliminary observations of quiet
Sun jets or mottles. We find that the mechanism that produces fibrils in active
regions is most likely also at work in quiet Sun regions, although it is
modified by the weaker magnetic field and the presence of more mixed-polarity.
A comparison with numerical simulations suggests that the weaker magnetic field
in quiet Sun allows for significantly stronger (than in active regions)
transverse motions that are superposed on the field-aligned, shock-driven
motions. This leads to a more dynamic, and much more complex environment than
in active region plage. In addition, our observations of the mixed polarity
environment in quiet Sun regions suggest that other mechanisms, such as
reconnection, may well play a significant role in the formation of some quiet
Sun jets.

We examine this relationship by means of Monte Carlo simulations and conclude
that a constant spectral index independent of optical luminosity is still
consistent with this high-z sample. We further find that that contributions of
large dispersions and narrow range of optical luminosity are most important for
the apparent, yet artificial, $\alpha_{OX} - l_o$ correlation reported. We also
examine another, but more complete low-z optical selected AGN sub-sample from
Steffen et al. (2006), and our analysis shows that a constant spectral index
independent of optical luminosity is also consistent with the data. By
comparing X-ray and optical luminosity functions, we find that a luminosity
independent spectral index is in fact more preferred than the luminosity
dependent spectral index model. We also discuss the selection effects caused by
flux limits, which might systematically bias the $l_x - l_o$ relation and cause
discrepancy in optically selected and X-ray selected AGN samples. To correctly
establish a dependence of spectral index of AGNs on their luminosity, a larger

86 GHz SiO Mopra observations of a subset of the sample are also presented. Of

stars and most of these show typical, regular H_2O maser profiles. In contrast,
nearly all the detections of more evolved stars exhibited high-velocity H_2O
maser emission. Of the five sources seen, v223 (W43A, IRAS 18450-0148) is a
well known `water-fountain' source which belongs to a small group of post-AGB
stars with highly collimated, high-velocity H_2O maser emission. A second
source in our sample, v270 (IRAS 18596+0315), is also known to have
high-velocity emission. We report the discovery of similar emission from a
further three sources, d46 (IRAS 15445-5449), d62 (IRAS 15544-5332) and b292
(IRAS 18043-2116). The source d46 is an evolved post-AGB star with highly
unusual maser properties. The H_2O maser emission from d62 is probably
associated with a massive star. The source b292 is a young post-AGB star that
is highly likely to be a water-fountain source, with masers detected over a
velocity range of 210 km s^{-1}.

found that the observed color-magnitude relation of luminous MPCs (i.e., ``blue

dwarf galaxies, which have nuclei masses that correlate with their total mass
at z=z_trun. The simulated blue tilts are found to be seen more clearly in more
massive galaxies, which reflects the fact that more massive galaxies at z=0 are
formed from a larger number of dwarfs with stellar nuclei formed at z>z_trun.
The half-number radii (R_e) of GCSs, velocity dispersions of GCSs (sigma), and
their host galaxy masses (M_h) are found to be correlated with one another such

impossible to produce since the ruthenium would precipitate out as RuO2. The

UPS spectra show a shift of weight from the coherent peak to the incoherent

level XPS spectra of the ruthenium 3d lines show a strong screened part in the

called transits between valleys. The theory proposes a Hamiltonian for the
vibrational motion, to be corrected to take transits into account; this
Hamiltonian is used to calculate the autocorrelation functions, giving what we
call their vibrational contributions. We discuss the multimode expansions of
the autocorrelation functions, which provide a physically helpful picture of
the decay of fluctuations in terms of n-mode scattering processes; we also note
that the calculation and Fourier transform of the multimode series are
numerically problematic, as successive terms require larger sums and carry
higher powers of the temperature, which is a concern for the liquid whose

avoided by directly computing the autocorrelation functions, for which we

considerations, we examine the problem of estimating the rate-distortion
function of an unknown (not necessarily discrete-valued) source from empirical

simply the rate-distortion function of the empirical distribution of the
observed data. Sufficient conditions are given for its consistency, and
examples are provided to demonstrate that in certain cases it fails to converge
to the true rate-distortion function. The analysis of its performance is
complicated by the fact that the rate-distortion function is not continuous in
the source distribution; the underlying mathematical problem is closely related
to the classical problem of establishing the consistency of maximum likelihood
estimators. General consistency results are given for the plug-in estimator
applied to a broad class of sources, including all stationary and ergodic ones.
A more general class of estimation problems is also considered, arising in the
context of lossy data compression when the allowed class of coding
distributions is restricted; analogous results are developed for the plug-in
estimator in that case. Finally, consistency theorems are formulated for
modified (e.g., penalized) versions of the plug-in, and for estimating the
optimal reproduction distribution.

has begun to measure the significant kicks found when both unequal masses and

these effects in the context of a simple test problem. We study recoils from
collisions of binaries with initially head-on trajectories, starting with the
simplest case of equal masses with no spin and then adding spin and varying the
mass ratio, both separately and jointly. We find spin-induced recoils to be
significant relative to unequal-mass recoils even in head-on configurations.
Additionally, it appears that the scaling of transverse kicks with spins is
consistent with post-Newtonian theory, even though the kick is generated in the
nonlinear merger interaction, where post-Newtonian theory should not apply.
This suggests that a simple heuristic description might be effective in the
estimation of spin-kicks.

that every blink induces a space and any space is induced by some blink

regularized solution, when a regularization parameter $\alpha$ tends to zero,
for the solution of the original SQG equations to develop a singularity in
finite time. As opposed to the commonly used viscous regularization, the
inviscid equations derived here conserve a modified energy. Therefore, the new
regularization provides an attractive numerical procedure for finite time blow
up testing. In particular, we prove that, if the initial condition is smooth,
then the regularized solution remains as smooth as the initial data for all
times. Moreover, much like the original problem, the inviscid regularization
admits a maximum principle.

algorithm, before and after the size reduction, showing the improvement
obtained. We speculate that the proposed analytical size reduction could be
extended to an exact coarse graining of the network in the scope of real-space
renormalization.

equilibrium of the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system that describes a
collisionless plasma. For an equilibrium whose distribution function decreases
monotonically with the particle energy, we obtained a linear stability
criterion in our previous paper. Here we prove that this criterion is sharp;
that is, there would otherwise be an exponentially growing solution to the
linearized system. Therefore for the class of symmetric Vlasov-Maxwell
equilibria, we establish an energy principle for linear stability. We also
treat the considerably simpler periodic 1.5D case. The new formulation
introduced here is applicable as well to the nonrelativistic case, to other
symmetries, and to general equilibria.

  Sizes","38 pages including 7 tables and 3 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph q-fin.PR",,"  In the standard equilibrium and/or arbitrage pricing framework, the value of
any asset is uniquely specified from the belief that only the systematic risks
need to be remunerated by the market. Here, we show that, even for arbitrary
large economies when the distribution of the capitalization of firms is
sufficiently heavy-tailed as is the case of real economies, there may exist a
new source of significant systematic risk, which has been totally neglected up
to now but must be priced by the market. This new source of risk can readily
explain several asset pricing anomalies on the sole basis of the
internal-consistency of the market model. For this, we derive a theoretical
two-factor model for asset pricing which has empirically a similar explanatory
power as the Fama-French three-factor model. In addition to the usual market
risk, our model accounts for a diversification risk, proxied by the
equally-weighted portfolio, and which results from an ``internal consistency
factor'' appearing for arbitrary large economies, as a consequence of the
concentration of the market portfolio when the distribution of the
capitalization of firms is sufficiently heavy-tailed as in real economies. Our
model rationalizes the superior performance of the Fama and French three-factor
model in explaining the cross section of stock returns: the size factor
constitutes an alternative proxy of the diversification factor while the
book-to-market effect is related to the increasing sensitivity of value stocks
to this factor.
