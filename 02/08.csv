calibrate the stellar models of 12 Boo A and B by fitting the available

overshooting layer between 0.06 and 0.23 the pressure scale height. Solutions
with both components on the main sequence can be found only by assuming an
overshoot larger in the primary than in the secondary, or a more efficient
central mixing for 12 Boo A than for 12 Boo B. We show that the detection of
solar-like oscillations expected in these stars would allow to distinguish
between different scenarios and provide therefore an estimation of the

globular clusters, which evolve by two-body relaxation. In particular, it
accelerates their dynamical evolution through the gravogyro instability. We
have validated the occurence of the gravogyro instability with direct $N$-body

segregation takes place, which competes with the rotation in the acceleration
of the core collapse. The ""accelerating"" effect of rotation has not been
detected in our isolated two-mass $N$-body models. Last, but not least, we have
looked at rotating $N$-body models in a tidal field within the tidal

that the rate of decline in cosmic SFR with redshift is nearly the same for

analysis confirms one version of what has been referred to as `downsizing',
namely that the epoch of major mass build-up in massive galaxies is
substantially earlier than the epoch of mass build-up in low-mass galaxies. Yet
it shows that star formation activity is NOT becoming increasingly limited to

fraction of the lost mass from the system forms a circumbinary disk, which
extracts the orbital angular momentum from the system through tidal torques.
Our calculations indicate that the existence of circumbinary disk can enhance
the mass transfer rate and cause secular orbital shrinkage. The white dwarf can
grow in mass efficiently to trigger type Ia supernovae even with relatively

070110 and its remarkable afterglow. The early X-ray light curve, interpreted
as the tail of the prompt emission, displays a spectral evolution already seen
in other gamma-ray bursts. The optical afterglow shows a shallow decay up to ~2
d after the burst, which is not consistent with standard afterglow models. The
most intriguing feature is a very steep decay in the X-ray flux at ~20 ks after
the burst, ending an apparent plateau. The abrupt drop of the X-ray light curve
rules out an external shock as the origin of the plateau in this burst and
implies long-lasting activity of the central engine. The temporal and spectral
properties of the plateau phase point towards a continuous central engine
emission rather than the episodic emission of X-ray flares. We suggest that the
observed X-ray plateau is powered by a spinning down central engine, possibly a
millisecond pulsar, which dissipates energy at an internal radius before
depositing energy into the external shock.

  processes involving hydrogen atoms","Accepted for A&A; 12 pages, 11 figures",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20066686",,"astro-ph",,"  (*** abridged ***) Context: The wings of Balmer lines are often used as
effective temperature diagnostics for late-type stars under the assumption they
form in local thermodynamic equilibrium.
  Aims: Our goal is to investigate the non-LTE formation of Balmer lines in
late-type stellar atmospheres, to establish if the assumption of LTE is
justified. Furthermore, we aim to determine which collision processes are
important for the problem; in particular, the role of collision processes with
hydrogen atoms is investigated.
  Method: A model hydrogen atom for non-LTE calculations has been constructed
accounting for various collision processes using the best available data from
the literature. The processes included are inelastic collisions with electrons
and hydrogen atoms, mutual neutralisation and Penning ionisation. Non-LTE
calculations are performed, and the relative importance of the collision
processes is investigated.
  Results: Our calculations show electron collisions alone are not sufficient
to establish LTE for the formation of Balmer line wings. The role of inelastic
collisions with neutral hydrogen is unclear. The available data for these
processes is of questionable quality, and different prescriptions for the rate
coefficents give significantly different results for the Balmer line wings.
  Conclusions: Improved calculations or experimental data are needed for
excitation and, particularly, ionisation of hydrogen atoms in low-lying states
by hydrogen atom impact at near threshold energies. Until such data are
available, the assumption of LTE for the formation of Balmer line wings in
late-type stars is questionable.

configurations (UT2-UT4, UT1-UT4, and UT2-UT3) with projected baseline lengths
of 42-124 m. The wavelength dependence of the uniform-disk diameters obtained
at all epochs is characterized by a roughly constant region between 8 and 10
micron with a slight dip centered at ~9.5 micron and a gradual increase
longward of 10 micron. These N-band angular sizes are significantly larger than
the estimated photospheric size of V Oph. The angular sizes observed at
different epochs reveal that the object appears smaller at phase 0.49 (minimum
light) with uniform-disk diameters of ~5-12 mas than at phases 0.18 (~12-20
mas) and 0.65 (~9-15 mas). We interpret these results with a model consisting
of optically thick C2H2 layers and an optically thin dust shell. Our modeling
suggests that the C2H2 layers around V Oph are more extended (~1.7-1.8 Rstar)
at phases 0.18 and 0.65 than at phase 0.49 (~1.4 Rstar) and that the C2H2
column densities appear to be the smallest at phase 0.49. We also find that the

Rstar, and the total optical depths at phases 0.18 and 0.65 are higher than
that at phase 0.49. Our MIDI observations and modeling indicate that

Sequence (PMS) stars and young Brown Dwarfs (BDs) in the Chamaeleon II (Cha II)

  Using the Wide-Field Imager (WFI) at the ESO 2.2m telescope, we surveyed a
sky area of about 1.75 square degrees in Cha II. The region was observed in the
Rc, Ic and z broad-bands, in H-alpha and in two medium-band filters centered at
856 and 914 nm. We select PMS star and young BD candidates using
colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and theoretical isochrones reproduced ad-hoc
for the WFI at the ESO2.2m telescope system. The selection criteria are also
reinforced by using the previously known PMS stars in Cha II to define the PMS
locus on the CMDs and by investigating the infrared (IR) colours of the
candidates. By exploiting the WFI intermediate-band photometry we also estimate
the effective temperature and the level of H-alpha emission of the candidates.
  Our survey, which is one of the largest and deepest optical surveys conducted
so far in Cha II, recovered the majority of the PMS stars and 10 member
candidates of the cloud from previous IR surveys. In addition, the survey
revealed 10 new potential members. From our photometric characterisation, we
estimate that some 50% of the 20 candidates will result in true Cha II members.

find that the position and momentum variances for momentum coupling are
respectively identical to momentum and position variances for spatial friction.
This implies that momentum coupling leads to an increase in the fluctuations in
position as the temperature is lowered, exactly the opposite of the classical
like localization of the oscillator, found with spatial friction. For a
parabolic barrier, momentum coupling causes an {\it increase} in the unstable
normal mode barrier frequency, as compared to the lowering of the barrier
frequency in the presence of purely spatial coupling. This increase in the
frequency leads to an enhancement of the thermal tunneling flux, which below

drift in semiconductors is discussed. A continuum theory is developed on the
basis of hydrodynamical equations for the conduction electrons, the equations
for the elastic vibrations of the crystal, and the Poisson equation. It is
shown that if the plasma frequency is much lower than the reciprocal value of
the electron relaxation time for the scattering on phonons and impurities, the
results are in agreement with available calculations based on the electrical
conductivity - diffusion equation. However, in the opposite case the
amplification factor is orders of magnitude larger compared to the value
predicted by those calculations, while the optimum drift velocity is much
smaller.

performance to be quantified for fading or non-fading environments. The
transmission capacity is given for interference-limited uniformly random
networks on the entire plane with path loss exponent $\alpha>2$ in which nodes
use: (1) static beamforming through $M$ sectorized antennas, for which the
increase in transmission capacity is shown to be $\Theta(M^2)$ if the antennas
are without sidelobes, but less in the event of a nonzero sidelobe level; (2)
dynamic eigen-beamforming (maximal ratio transmission/combining), in which the
increase is shown to be $\Theta(M^{\frac{2}{\alpha}})$; (3) various transmit
antenna selection and receive antenna selection combining schemes, which give
appreciable but rapidly diminishing gains; and (4) orthogonal space-time block
coding, for which there is only a small gain due to channel hardening,
equivalent to Nakagami-$m$ fading for increasing $m$. It is concluded that in

combining performs well but with rapidly diminishing returns with added

volume can be seen in a finite box by studying, for instance, the dependence of
the chiral condensate from the volume and the quark mass. We perform a
feasibility study of this program by computing the quark condensate on the
lattice in the quenched approximation of QCD at small quark masses. We carry
out simulations in various topological sectors of the theory at several
volumes, quark masses and lattice spacings by employing fermions with an exact
chiral symmetry, and we focus on observables which are infrared stable and free
from mass-dependent ultraviolet divergences. The numerical calculation is
carried out with an exact variance-reduction technique, which is designed to be
particularly efficient when spontaneous symmetry breaking is at work in
generating a few very small low-lying eigenvalues of the Dirac operator. The
finite-size scaling behaviour of the condensate in the topological sectors
considered agrees, within our statistical accuracy, with the expectations of
the chiral effective theory. Close to the chiral limit we observe a detailed
agreement with the first Leutwyler-Smilga sum rule. By comparing the mass, the
volume and the topology dependence of our results with the predictions of the
chiral effective theory, we extract the corresponding low-energy constant.

around this value of \tau, as well as the suppression for small Q^2 due to
finite quark masses and confinement. In this paper we use a dipole cascade

function constructed in d=4; the exponent 2S in the square of the wave
functional plays the role of a d=3 Euclidean action. We start from a
gauge-invariant conjecture for the infrared-dominant part of S, based on
dynamical generation of a gluon mass M in d=4. We argue that the exact leading
term, of O(M), in an expansion of S in inverse powers of M is a d=3
gauge-invariant mass term (gauged non-linear sigma model); the next leading
term, of O(1/M), is a conventional Yang-Mills action. The d=3 action that is
the sum of these two terms has center vortices as classical solutions. The d=3
gluon mass, which we constrain to be the same as M, and d=3 coupling are
related through the conjecture to the d=4 coupling strength, but at the same
time the dimensionless ratio in d=3 of mass to coupling squared can be
estimated from d=3 dynamics. This allows us to estimate the QCD coupling
$\alpha_s(M^2)$ in terms of this strictly d=3 ratio; we find a value of about
0.4, in good agreement with an earlier theoretical value but a little low
compared to QCD phenomenology. The wave functional for d=2+1 QCD has an
exponent that is a d=2 infrared-effective action having both the
gauge-invariant mass term and the field strength squared term, and so differs
from the conventional QCD action in two dimensions, which has no mass term.
This conventional d=2 QCD would lead in d=3 to confinement of all color-group
representations. But with the mass term (again leading to center vortices),
N-ality = 0 mod N representations are not confined.

and present exact supersymmetric solutions in the case when the O6-charge is
smoothly distributed: the geometry is Calabi-Yau and the dilaton is constant.
In the localized case, the solution is a half-flat, non-Calabi-Yau metric but
still with constant dilaton. Finally, using the ten dimensional description we
show how all moduli are stabilized and reproduce precisely the results of de

by the use of a formal multiple scales expansion in the scale parameter. The

both in space and time is often a relevant problem when dealing with phenomena
occurring in high Reynolds number flows, especially in astrophysical and space
fluids. In this paper, a dynamical model is proposed to describe the
spatio-temporal intermittency of energy dissipation rate in a turbulent system.
This is done by using a shell model to simulate the turbulent cascade and
introducing some heuristic rules, partly inspired by the well known $p$-model,
to construct a spatial structure of the energy dissipation rate. In order to
validate the model and to study its spatially intermittency properties, a
series of numerical simulations have been performed. These show that the level
of spatial intermittency of the system can be simply tuned by varying a single
parameter of the model and that scaling laws in agreement with those obtained
from experiments on fully turbulent hydrodynamic flows can be recovered. It is
finally suggested that the model could represent a useful tool to simulate the
spatio-temporal intermittency of turbulent energy dissipation in those high
Reynolds number astrophysical fluids where impulsive energy release processes
can be associated to the dynamics of the turbulent cascade.

present a new method for the analysis of the magnetic braking using a magnet
fixed to the glider of an air track. The forces acting on the glider, a result
of the eddy currents, can be easily observed and measured. As a consequence of
the air track inclination, the glider accelerates at the beginning, although it
asymptotically tends towards a uniform rectilinear movement characterized by a
terminal speed. This speed depends on the interaction between the magnetic
field and the conductivity properties of the air track. Compared with previous
related approaches, in our experimental setup the magnet fixed to the glider
produces a magnetic braking force which acts continuously, rather than over a
short period of time. The experimental results satisfactorily concur with the

  correction of an earlier paper submitted to JFM (Ardhuin & Jenkins 2004)",,"10.1016/j.ocemod.2007.07.001",,"physics.ao-ph",,"  The generalized Langrangian mean theory provides exact equations for general
wave-turbulence-mean flow interactions in three dimensions. For practical
applications, these equations must be closed by specifying the wave forcing
terms. Here an approximate closure is obtained under the hypotheses of small
surface slope, weak horizontal gradients of the water depth and mean current,
and weak curvature of the mean current profile. These assumptions yield
analytical expressions for the mean momentum and pressure forcing terms that
can be expressed in terms of the wave spectrum. A vertical change of coordinate
is then applied to obtain glm2z-RANS equations (55) and (57) with non-divergent
mass transport in cartesian coordinates. To lowest order, agreement is found
with Eulerian-mean theories, and the present approximation provides an explicit
extension of known wave-averaged equations to short-scale variations of the
wave field, and vertically varying currents only limited to weak or localized
profile curvatures. Further, the underlying exact equations provide a natural
framework for extensions to finite wave amplitudes and any realistic situation.
The accuracy of the approximations is discussed using comparisons with exact
numerical solutions for linear waves over arbitrary bottom slopes, for which
the equations are still exact when properly accounting for partial standing
waves. For finite amplitude waves it is found that the approximate solutions
are probably accurate for ocean mixed layer modelling and shoaling waves,
provided that an adequate turbulent closure is designed. However, for surf zone
applications the approximations are expected to give only qualitative results

microtubule by alternated binding of two motor domains on the tubulin binding
sites. Since the processivity of kinesin is much higher than other motor
proteins, it has been speculated that there exists a mechanism for allosteric
regulation between the two monomers. Recent experiments suggest that ATP
binding to the leading head domain in kinesin is regulated by the rearward
strain built on the neck-linker. We test this hypothesis by explicitly modeling
a $C_{\alpha}$-based kinesin structure whose both motor domains are bound on
the tubulin binding sites. The equilibrium structures of kinesin on the
microtubule show disordered and ordered neck-linker configurations for the
leading and the trailing head, respectively. The comparison of the structures
between the two heads shows that several native contacts present at the
nucleotide binding site in the leading head are less intact than those in the
binding site of the rear head. The network of native contacts obtained from
this comparison provides the internal tension propagation pathway, which leads
to the disruption of the nucleotide binding site in the leading head. Also,
using an argument based on polymer theory, we estimate the internal tension
built on the neck-linker to be f~(12-15) pN. Both of these conclusions support
the experimental hypothesis.

investigated in the context of classical uncertainty. However, in some domains
(most notably, in computational physics and quantum computing) the nature of
the relevant uncertainty is non-classical, and the laws of classical
probability theory are superseded by those of quantum mechanics. In this paper
we introduce Markovian Entanglement Networks (MEN), a novel class of graphical
representations of quantum-mechanical dependencies in the context of such
non-classical systems. MEN are the quantum-mechanical analogue of Markovian
Networks, a family of undirected graphical representations which, in the
classical domain, exploit a notion of conditional independence among
subsystems.
  After defining a notion of conditional independence appropriate to our domain
(conditional separability), we prove that the conditional separabilities
induced by a quantum-mechanical wave function are effectively reflected in the
graphical structure of MEN. Specifically, we show that for any wave function
there exists a MEN which is a perfect map of its conditional separabilities.
Next, we show how the graphical structure of MEN can be used to effectively
classify the pure states of three-qubit systems. We also demonstrate that, in
large systems, exploiting conditional independencies may dramatically reduce
the computational burden of various inference tasks. In principle, the
graph-theoretic representation of conditional independencies afforded by MEN
may not only facilitate the classical simulation of quantum systems, but also
provide a guide to the efficient design and complexity analysis of quantum
algorithms and circuits.
