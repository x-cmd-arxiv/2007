small apparent radius measured from its X-ray thermal spectrum. However, its
optical emission requires a much larger radius and thus most of the stellar
surface must be cold and undetectable in X-rays. In the case the star is a
neutron star such a surface temperature distribution can be explained by the
presence of a strong toroidal field in the crust (Perez-Azorin et al. 2006,
Geppert et al. 2006). We consider a similar scenario for a strange star with a
thin baryonic crust to determine if such a magnetic field induced effect is
still possible.

in a quantum regime (Casimir effect), Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model in
a semi-classical approximation of loop quantum gravity, FRW model in the
Randall Sundrum scenario with dark radiation or cosmological model with global
rotation. In this paper we mainly concentrate on Casimir effect arising from
quantum effects of the scalar field. This contribution can describe decaying
part of cosmological constant. We discuss the back reaction of gravity on
Casimir-type force which is a manifestation of the vacuum fluctuations of the
quantum scalar field at low temperature. It is shown that while the Casimir
energy gives rise to accelerating Universe, the cosmological constant term is
still required. We argue that a small negative contribution of a radiation-like

We take this as an indication that dark energy does indeed interact with
another fluid (we consider fermion fields) and we determine the interaction
through the cosmological data and extrapolate it into the future. We study the
conditions under which a dark energy can dilute faster or decay into the
fermion fields. We show that it is possible to live now in an accelerating

that Whiting 1 originated in a dwarf galaxy that has since been disrupted by

place limits on its possible metallicity. The measurements of distance and
radial velocity are used to test the cluster's membership in the stellar
streams from the Sgr dSph. From our CMD of Whiting 1, we derive new estimates

August in Prague. More than 150 scientists took actively part in this Joint
Discussion. Fourteen invited review talks were presented to view the present
and future of pulsar astronomy. Fifty three poster contributions displayed new
and exciting results. In this summary we give an overview of the invited review
talks and contributed posters. The review talks are subject of review articles
which will be published elsewhere. More information on this will be available

rapidly rotating stars that are more and more precise. We describe the basic
structure and the hydrodynamics of a fully radiative star as a preliminary step
towards more realistic models of rotating stars. We consider a solar mass of
perfect gas enclosed in a spherical container. The gas is self-gravitating and
rotating, and is the seat of nuclear heating, and heat diffusion is due to
radiative diffusion with Kramers type opacities. Equations are solved
numerically with spectral methods in two dimensions with a radial Gauss-Lobatto
grid and spherical harmonics. We computed the centrifugally flattened structure
of such a star: the von Zeipel model, which says that the energy flux is
proportional to the local effective gravity is tested. We show that it
overestimates the ratio of the polar to the equatorial energy flux by almost a
factor 2. We also determine the Brunt-Vaisala frequency distribution and show
that outer equatorial regions in a radiative zone are convectively unstable
when the rotation is fast enough. We compute the differential rotation and
meridional circulation stemming from the baroclinicity of the star and show
that, in such radiative zones, equatorial regions rotate faster than polar
ones. The surface differential rotation is also shown to reach a universal
profile when rotation is slow enough (less than 36% of the breakup one), as
long as viscosity and Prandlt number remain small.

function has accumulated over recent years. We show that an approximately
Gaussian mass function is naturally generated from a power-law mass
distribution of protoglobular clouds by expulsion from the protocluster of star
forming gas due to supernova activity, provided that the power-law mass
distribution shows a lower-mass limit. As a result of gas loss, the
gravitational potential of the protocluster gets weaker and only a fraction of
the newly formed stars is retained. The mass fraction of bound stars ranges
from zero to unity, depending on the local star formation efficiency
$\epsilon$. Assuming that $\epsilon$ is independent of the protoglobular cloud
mass, we investigate how such variations affect the mapping of a protoglobular
cloud mass function to the resulting globular cluster initial mass function. A
truncated power-law cloud mass spectrum generates bell-shaped cluster initial
mass functions, with a turnover location mostly sensitive to the lower limit of
the cloud mass range. We also show that a Gaussian mass function for the
protoglobular clouds with a mean ${\rm log}m_G \simeq 6.1-6.2$ and a standard
deviation $\sigma \lesssim 0.4$ provides results very similar to those
resulting from a truncated power-law cloud mass spectrum, that is, the
distribution function of masses of protoglobular clouds influences only weakly
the shape of the resulting globular star cluster initial mass function. The gas
removal process and the protoglobular cloud mass-scale dominate the relevant
physics. Moreover, gas removal during star formation in massive clouds is
likely the prime cause of the predominance of field stars in the Galactic halo.

$v$ we mean to complement the subgraph induced by the neighbors of $v$. This
operator can be generalized as follows. Assume that, each edge of $G$ has a
label in the finite field $\mathbf{F}_q$. Let $(g_{ij})$ be set of labels
($g_{ij}$ is the label of edge $ij$). We define two types of operators. For the
first one, let $v$ be a vertex of $G$ and $a\in \mathbf{F}_q$, and obtain the
graph with labels $g'_{ij}=g_{ij}+ag_{vi}g_{vj}$. For the second, if $0\neq
b\in \mathbf{F}_q$ the resulted graph is a graph with labels $g''_{vi}=bg_{vi}$
and $g''_{ij}=g_{ij}$, for $i,j$ unequal to $v$. It is clear that if the field
is binary, the operators are just local complementations that we described.
  The problem of whether two graphs are equivalent under local complementations
has been studied, \cite{bouchalg}. Here we consider the general case and
assuming that $q$ is odd, present the first known efficient algorithm to verify
whether two graphs are locally equivalent or not.

modifications and find that they give consistent results for R_dAu(pT) for

suppression of the parton distributions in the Au nucleus does not strongly
influence the R_dAu for pi0 in the pT region where the suppression is observed.
Using the HKN parameterization, we evaluate systematic errors in the
theoretical R_dAu(pT) resulting from uncertainties in the nuclear PDFs. The
measured nuclear modification factor is inconsistent with the pQCD model result
for pT > 10 GeV/c even when the systematic uncertainties in the nuclear PDFs
are accounted for. The inclusion of a small final-state energy loss can reduce
the discrepancy with the data, but we cannot perfectly reproduce the pT

gravitational interactions due to the covariant coupling of fermions in the
presence of a torsion-fermion contact interaction. The condensate gap gives a
negative contribution to the bare cosmological constant. In this letter, we
show that the cosmological constant problem can be solved without fine tuning
of the bare cosmological constant. We demonstrate how a universe with a large
initial cosmological constant undergoes inflation, during which time the energy
gap grows as the volume of the universe. Eventually the gap becomes large
enough to cancel out the bare cosmological term, inflation ends and we end up
in a universe with an almost vanishing cosmological term. We provide a detailed
numerical analysis of the system of equations governing the self regulating
relaxation of the cosmological constant.

The existence of a stable vacuum at the end point of the condensation process
depends on a modulus representation under the gauge group. For a modulus in the
fundamental representation, the global vacuum of the theory is a state both
with the rotational symmetry and the electromagnetic U(1) being spontaneously
broken. In other words, the system describes an anisotropic superconducting
medium. We further explore the landscape of vacua of this theory and identify
metastable vacua with an abnormal number of Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The SO(2)
symmetry of these vacua corresponds to locking gauge, flavor, and spin degrees
of freedom. There are also metastable SO(3) rotationally invariant vacua. For a
modulus in the adjoint representation, we show that the theory does not have
stable vacua with homogeneous anisotropic non-abelian field strength
condensates, although there are metastable vacua. The reason of that is
connected with a larger number of the physical components of the modulus in the
case of the adjoint representation as compared to the fundamental one.

moduli space of twisted stacky vector bundles. By studying the structure of
these spaces we prove new results on the standard period-index conjecture. The
first yields new bounds on the period-index relation for classes on curves over
higher local fields, while the second can be used to relate the Hasse principle

general oscillatory sequence, and then applies this series acceleration
algorithm to the polylogarithm and the Hurwitz zeta function. As such, it may
be taken as an extension of the techniques given by Borwein's ""An efficient
algorithm for computing the Riemann zeta function"", to more general series. The
algorithm provides a rapid means of evaluating Li_s(z) for general values of
complex s and the region of complex z values given by |z^2/(z-1)|<4.
  Alternatively, the Hurwitz zeta can be very rapidly evaluated by means of an
Euler-Maclaurin series. The polylogarithm and the Hurwitz zeta are related, in
that two evaluations of the one can be used to obtain a value of the other;
thus, either algorithm can be used to evaluate either function. The
Euler-Maclaurin series is a clear performance winner for the Hurwitz zeta,
while the Borwein algorithm is superior for evaluating the polylogarithm in the
kidney-shaped region. Both algorithms are superior to the simple Taylor's
series or direct summation.
  The primary, concrete result of this paper is an algorithm allows the
exploration of the Hurwitz zeta in the critical strip, where fast algorithms
are otherwise unavailable. A discussion of the monodromy group of the
polylogarithm is included.

hidden Markov model (HMM) stepping matrices is subrectangular, and the
underlying chain is aperiodic, the corresponding $\alpha$-chain has a unique

$\{\alpha_n\}=\{(\alpha_{ni})\}$ is given by \[\alpha_{ni}=P(X_n=i|
Y_n,Y_{n-1},...),\] where $\{(X_n,Y_n)\}$ is a finite state HMM with unobserved
Markov chain component $\{X_n\}$ and observed output component $\{Y_n\}$. This
defines $\{\alpha_n\}$ as a stochastic process taking values in the probability
simplex. It is not hard to see that $\{\alpha_n\}$ is itself a Markov chain.
The stepping matrices $M(y)=(M(y)_{ij})$ give the probability that
$(X_n,Y_n)=(j,y)$, conditional on $X_{n-1}=i$. A matrix is said to be
subrectangular if the locations of its nonzero entries forms a cartesian
product of a set of row indices and a set of column indices. Kaijser's result
is based on an application of the Furstenberg--Kesten theory to the random
matrix products $M(Y_1)M(Y_2)... M(Y_n)$. In this paper we prove a slightly
stronger form of Kaijser's theorem with a simpler argument, exploiting the
theory of e chains.

There is a distinct submodule P of Z coming from the polynomial relations of f

syzygies of f. We say that f is polarizable if equality P=Z holds. This paper
is concerned with the situation where f are monomials of degree 2, in which
case one can naturally associate to them a graph G(f) with loops and translate
the problem into a combinatorial one. A main result is a complete combinatorial
characterization of polarizability in terms of special configurations in this

subalgebra k[f] of R and that the converse holds provided the graph G(f) is
free of certain degenerate configurations. One main combinatorial class of
polarizability is the class of polymatroidal sets. We also prove that if the
edge graph of G(f) has diameter at most 2 then f is polarizable. We establish a

$g'_{ij}=g_{ij}+ag_{vi}g_{vj}$. For the second type of operators, let $0\neq
b\in \mathbf{F}_q$ and the resulted graph is a graph with labels
$g''_{vi}=bg_{vi}$ and $g''_{ij}=g_{ij}$, for $i,j$ unequal to $v$.
  The local complementation operator (binary case) has appeared in
combinatorial theory, and its properties have studied in the literature.
Recently, a profound relation between local operators on graphs and quantum
stabilizer codes has been found, and it has become a natural question to
recognize equivalency classes under these operators. In the present article, we
show that the number of graphs locally equivalent to a given graph is at most
$q^{2n+1}$, and consequently, the number of classes of local equivalency is
$q^{\frac{n^2}{2}-o(n)}$.

obtained from the recent lattice simulations of QCD, whereas at low

different interpolations between those two results are employed. They are
characterized by different values of the local maximum (at T = 0.4 T_c) and
local minimum (at T=T_c). The extreme values are chosen in such a way that at
high temperature all considered sound-velocity functions yield the entropy
density consistent with the lattice simulations of QCD. We find that the
presence of a distinct minimum of the sound velocity leads to a very long (~ 20
fm/c) evolution time of the system. Since such long evolution times are not
compatible with the recent estimates based on the HBT interferometry, we
conclude that the hydrodynamic description becomes adequate if the QCD

applications. Here we study the partitioning of positive ions of increasing
size into the pore interior using extensive molecular dynamics simulations.
Despite the simplicity of the simulation system, the results provide new and
useful insights on both the pore hydration and ion partitioning. For low
negative charge densities on the pore, the driving force for partitioning of
positive ions into the pore is weak, and no partitioning is observed.
Increasing the pore charge gradually leads to partitioning of positive ions
into the pore. Interestingly, over a range of intermediate negative charge
densities, nanopores display both thermodynamic as well as kinetic selectivity
toward partitioning of the larger K+ and Cs+ ions into their interior over the
smaller Na+ ions. The variation of thermodynamic driving force and the average
partitioning time with the pore charge density together suggest the presence of
free energy barriers in the partitioning process. We discuss the role of ion
hydration in the bulk and in the pore interior as well as of the pore hydration
in determining the barrier heights for ion partitioning and the observed

anomalous scaling in turbulence. Our focus is on an ideal situation: high
Reynolds number isotropic turbulence driven by steady large scale forcing.
Moreover, the fluid is incompressible and no confining boundaries are present.
We start from a good set of basis functions for the velocity field. These are
real and divergence-free. To each wave-vector k in Fourier space there is one
pair of basis functions with respectively left and right-handed polarity.
Isotropy makes all k on the shell of constant |k| statistically equivalent.
Consequently, the coefficients, X+ and X-, to the basis functions in that shell
become two random variables whose joint pdf describes the statistics at scale L
=2*pi/|k|. Moreover, (X+)**2+(X-)**2 becomes a random variable for the energy.
Switching to polar coordinates, the joint pdf expands in azimuthal modes. We
focus on the axisymmetric mode which is itself a pdf and characterized by it
radial profile P(r;L). Observations from both shell model and DNS data indicate
that (1) the moments of P(r;L) scale as power laws in L, and (2) the profile
obeys an affine symmetry P(r;L)=C(L)*f((lnr-mu(L))/sigma(L)). We raise the
question: What statistics agree with both observation? The answer is pleasing.
We find the functions f, mu, sigma C analytically in terms of a few constants.
Moreover, we obtain closed form expressions for both scaling exponents and
coefficients in the power laws. A virtual origin also emerges as an intrinsic
length scale L0 for the inertial range.

simultaneous occurrence of spindle oscillations over widespread territories of
the thalamus is due to the corticothalamic projections, as the synchrony is

the underlying control mechanism, leading to a control method which is
applicable in wide range of stochastic driven excitable units.

individuals' abilities to create strong social relationships with other group
members. The existence of those groups requires to identify individuals and to
assign to each of them a social status. Individual recognition can be achieved
through vocalizations but also through faces. In humans, an efficient system
for the processing of own species faces exists. This specialization is achieved
through experience with faces of conspecifics during development and leads to
the loss of ability to process faces from other primate species. We hypothesize
that a similar mechanism exists in social primates. We investigated face
processing in one Old World species (genus Macaca) and in one New World species
(genus Cebus). Our results show the same advantage for own species face
recognition for all tested subjects. This work suggests in all species tested
the existence of a common trait inherited from the primate ancestor: an
efficient system to identify individual faces of own species only.

  between individual and collective behaviours",,"Behaviour 143 (2006) 1511-1527",,,"q-bio.PE",,"  In primate groups, collective movements are typically described as processes
dependent on leadership mechanisms. However, in some species, decision-making
includes negotiations and distributed leadership. These facts suggest that
simple underlying processes may explain certain decision mechanisms during
collective movements. To study such processes, we have designed experiments on
white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus) during which we provoked
collective movements involving a binary choice. These experiments enabled us to
analyse the spatial decisions of individuals in the group.We found that the
underlying process includes anonymous mimetism, which means that each
individual may influence all members of the group. To support this result, we
created a mathematical model issued from our experimental data. A totally
anonymous model does not fit perfectly with our experimental distribution. A
more individualised model, which takes into account the specific behaviour of
social peripheral individuals, revealed the validity of the mimetism
hypothesis. Even though white-faced capuchins have complex cognitive abilities,
a coexistence of anonymous and social mechanisms appears to influence their
choice of direction during collective movements. The present approach may offer
vital insights into the relationships between individual behaviours and their
emergent collective acts.

light forces acting on an atom. It has profound consequences in the

trapped inside the cavity, we investigate the atom-cavity system by scanning
the frequency of a probe laser for various atom-cavity detunings. The avoided
crossing between atom and cavity resonance is visible in the transmission of
the cavity. It is also visible in the loss rate of the atom from the
intracavity dipole trap. On the normal-mode resonances, the dominant
contribution to the loss rate originates from dipole-force fluctuations which
are dramatically enhanced in the cavity. This conclusion is supported by
Monte-Carlo simulations.
