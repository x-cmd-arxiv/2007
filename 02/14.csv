reflect their formation process since the binary orbit may have changed in the

after the planets completed their growth around the primary star.
Alternatively, in a dense stellar environment even a single stellar encounter
between the star pair and a singleton may singificantly alter the binary orbit.
In both cases the planets we observe at present would have formed when the
dynamical environment was different from the presently observed one.
  We have numerically integrated the trajectories of the stars (binary plus
singleton) and of test planets to investigate the abovementioned mechanisms.
  Our simulations show that the circumstellar environment during planetary
formation around the primary was gravitationally less perturbed when the binary
was part of a hierarchical triple because the binary was necessarely wider and,
possibly, less eccentric. This circumstance has consequences for the planetary
system in terms of orbital spacing, eccentricity, and mass of the individual
planets. Even in the case of a single stellar encounter the present appearance
of a planetary system in a binary may significantly differ from what it had
while planet formation was ongoing. However, while in the case of instability
of a triple the trend is always towards a tighter and more eccentric binary

distribution of the main products of nuclear burning, we constrain theoretical

iron-group elements. Outside this core, nickel-56 dominates the supernova
ejecta. The outer extent of the iron-group material depends on the amount of
nickel-56 and coincides with the inner extent of silicon, the principal product
of incomplete burning. The outer extent of the bulk of silicon is similar in
all SNe, having an expansion velocity of ~11000 km/s and corresponding to a
mass of slightly over one solar mass. This indicates that all the supernovae
considered here burned similar masses, and suggests that their progenitors had
the same mass. Synthetic light curve parameters and three-dimensional explosion
simulations support this interpretation. A single explosion scenario, possibly
a delayed detonation, may thus explain most type Ia supernovae.

the X-ray flux may be produced by a mechanism different from the external
shocks between the fireball and the circumburst medium, which are responsible
for the optical afterglow. We show that the presence of an underlying SN event
in XRF 050416A requires a break to occur in the afterglow optical light curve
at around the expected jet break time. The possible presence of a jet break in
the optical light curve of GRB 050401 is also discussed. We point out that, for
measuring the jet break, it is mandatory that the optical light curve extends
after the epoch where the jet break is expected. The interpretation of the
early optical breaks in GRB 050922C and GRB 060206 as jet breaks is
controversial because they might instead correspond to the flat-to-steep decay
transition common in the early X-ray light curves. All the 16 bursts coming

producing tidal tails from dwarf satellites using N-body simulations. We
identify two important dynamical co-conspirators: 1) the points where the
attractive force of the host halo and satellite are balanced do not occur at
equal distances from the satellite centre or at the same equipotential value
for massive satellites, breaking the morphological symmetry of the leading and
trailing tails; and 2) the escaped ejecta in the leading (trailing) tail
continues to be decelerated (accelerated) by the satellite's gravity leading to
large offsets of the ejecta orbits from the satellite orbit. The effect of the
satellite's self gravity decreases only weakly with a decreasing ratio of
satellite mass to host halo mass, demonstrating the importance of these effects
over a wide range of subhalo masses. Not only will the morphology of the
leading and trailing tails for massive satellites be different, but the
observed radial velocities of the tails will be displaced from that of the
satellite orbit; both the displacement and the peak radial velocity is
proportional to satellite mass. If the tails are assumed to follow the
progenitor satellite orbits, the tails from satellites with masses greater than
0.0001 of the host halo virial mass in a spherical halo will appear to indicate
a flattened halo. Therefore, a constraint on the Milky Way halo shape using
tidal streams requires mass-dependent modelling. Similarly, we compute the the
distribution of tail orbits both in E_{r}-r^{-2} space and in E-L_{z} space,
advocated for identifying satellite stream relics. The acceleration of ejecta
by a massive satellite during escape spreads the velocity distribution and
obscures the signature of a well-defined ``moving group'' in phase space.

presents further evidence for a connection of galaxy interaction and AGN
activity for half of the sample, this is not clear for the other half: These
are often undistorted disk dominated host galaxies, and interaction on a
smaller level might be detected in deeper high-resolution images or deeper

fraction of star-formation activity that takes place in very luminous dusty

fraction of stars and cool gas, which account for only about 10%. Here we
address the question whether the remaining $22\pm10%$ can be accounted for by
thermal evaporation of gas from clusters. We have found that evaporation can
occur only from the cluster ``surface'', $r\sim r_{\rm vir}$, and not from it's
interior. We evaluated particle diffusion through the magnetized ICM for
several scenarios of ISM turbulence and found that diffusivity is suppressed by
at least a factor of 100 or more, compared to the Spitzer value. Thus, only
particles from radii $r\ga0.9r_{\rm vir}$ can evaporate. Diffusion of particles
from inside the cluster, $r\la0.9r_{\rm vir}$, takes longer than the Hubble
time. This lowers the cluster-averaged fraction of the evaporated hot gas to
few percent or less. However, if the missing hot component {\it is indeed} due
to evaporation, this strongly constrains the magnetic field structure in the
cluster envelope, namely either (i) the gas is completely unmagnetized

spectra showed an intrinsic absorption. We found that for most quasars a simple
extrapolation of the far-UV powerlaw into the X-ray domain generally lies below
the X-ray data and that the big blue bump and the soft X-ray excess do not
share a common physical origin. We explore the issue of whether the observed
SED might be dust absorbed in the far and near-UV. We fit the UV break,
assuming a powerlaw that is absorbed by cubic nanodiamond dust grains. We then
explore the possibility of a universal SED (with a unique spectral index) by
including further absorption from SMC-like extinction. Using this approach,
satisfactory fits to the spectra can be obtained. The hydrogen column densities
required by either nanodiamonds or amorphous dust models are all consistent,
except for one object, with the columns deduced by our X-ray analysis, provided
that the C depletion is ~0.6. Because dust absorption implies a flux recovery
in the extreme UV (<700A), our modeling opens the possibility that the
intrinsic quasar SED is much harder and more luminous in the extreme UV than
inferred from the near-UV data, as required by photoionization models of the
broad emission line region. We conclude that the intrinsic UV SED must undergo
a sharp turn-over before the X-ray domain.

shapes of galaxies have been measured and corrected for the distortion induced
by the time varying ACS Point Spread Function and for Charge Transfer

susceptibility factors that are necessary in order to transform shape
measurements into unbiased shear estimators. Finally, for each galaxy, we
derive a shape measurement error and utilize this quantity to extract the

that the intrinsic shape noise varies little with either size, magnitude or
redshift. Representing a number density of 66 galaxies per arcmin^2, the final

nearly 80-95% polarized, often with a low but significant degree of circular

deviating significantly from an S-like swing as often seen in radio pulsars

while showing significant secular variations. On average the interpulse is less
linearly polarized but shows a higher degree of circular polarization. Some
epochs reveal the existence of non-orthogonal emission modes in the main pulse
and systematic wiggles in the PA swing, while the interpulse shows a large

spectral resolution ESI-Keck spectra (R~4300, SNR > 25) of 45 high-redshift

increases the statistics compared to previous studies. The redshift evolution
of the mean photo-ionization rate and the median optical depth of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) are derived statistically from the observed
transmitted flux and the pixel optical depth probability distribution function
respectively. This is used to study the so-called proximity effect, that is,
the observed decrease of the median optical depth of the IGM in the vicinity of
the quasar caused by enhanced photo-ionization rate due to photons emitted by
the quasar. We show that the proximity effect is correlated with the luminosity
of the quasars, as expected. By comparing the observed decrease of the median
optical depth with the theoretical expectation we find that the optical depth
does not decrease as rapidly as expected when approaching the quasar if the gas
in its vicinity is part of the standard IGM. We interpret this effect as
revealing gaseous overdensities on scales as large as ~15 Mpc/h. The mean
overdensity is of the order of two and five within, respectively, 10 and 3
Mpc/h. If true, this would indicate that high redshift quasars are located in
the center of overdense regions that could evolve with time into massive
clusters of galaxies. The overdensity is correlated with luminosity: brighter

properties of flares in GRBs observed by Swift/XRT. We consider a large sample
drawn from all GRBs detected by Swift, INTEGRAL and HETE-2 prior to 2006 Jan
31, which had an XRT follow-up and which showed significant flaring. Our sample
of 33 GRBs includes long and short, at low and high redshift, and a total of 69
flares. The strongest flares occur in the early phases, with a clear
anti-correlation between the flare peak intensity and the flare time of
occurrence. Fitting each X-ray flare with a Gaussian model, we find that the
mean ratio of the width and peak time is <Delta t / t > = 0.13+/-0.10, albeit
with a large scatter. Late flares at times > 2000 seconds have long durations,
Delta t>300 s, and can be very energetic compared to the underlying continuum.
We further investigated if there is a clear link between the number of pulses
detected in the prompt phase by BAT and the number of X-ray flares detected by
XRT, finding no correlation. However, we find that the distribution of
intensity ratios between successive BAT prompt pulses and that between
successive XRT flares is the same, an indication of a common origin for
gamma-ray pulses and X-ray flares. All evidence indicates that flares are
indeed related to the workings of the central engine and, within the standard
fireball scenario, originate from internal shocks rather than external shocks.
While all flares can be explained by long-lasting engine activity, 29/69 flares
may also be explained by refreshed shocks. However, 10 can only be explained by
prolonged activity of the central engine.

basic properties of this exotic high-mass system has subjected it to intense
study as an archetype for its class. In combination with the latest
radial-velocity results, our orbital solution produces a distance of
336^{+8}_{-7} pc, significantly more distant than the Hipparcos estimation
(Schaerer et al. 1997; van der Hucht 1997). The ability to fully specify the
orbital parameters has enabled us to significantly reduce uncertainties and our
result is consistent with the VLTI observational point (Millour et al. 2006),
but not with their derived distance. Our new distance, which is an order of
magnitude more precise than prior work, demands critical reassessment of all
distance-dependent fundamental parameters of this important system. In
particular, membership of the Vela OB2 association has been reestablished, and
the age and distance are also in good accord with the population of young stars

not understood. In this paper we have attempted to address this question by
examining the nuclear fuelling characteristics in a sample of restarting radio
galaxies. We have examined the detection rate for molecular gas in a
representative sample of nine restarting radio galaxies, for seven of which we
present new upper limits to the molecular gas mass derived from CO line
observations we made with the IRAM 30-m telescope. We derive a low CO detection
rate for the relatively young restarted radio galaxies suggesting that the
cessation of the nuclear activity and its subsequent restarting may be a result
of instabilities in the fuelling process rather than a case of depletion of
fuel followed by a recent fuel acquisition. It appears that abundant molecular
gas content at the level of few 10^8 to 10^9 solar masses does not necessarily
accompany the nuclear restarting phenomenon. For comparison we also discuss the
molecular gas properties of five normal giant radio galaxies, three of which we
observed using SEST. Despite obvious signs of interactions and nuclear dust
disks none of them has been found to host significant quantities of molecular
gas.

depression found in the Subaru Deep Field. The NB921-depressed i-dropout
selection method is expected to select galaxies with large equivalent width Ly
alpha emission over a wide redshift range, 6.0<z<6.5. Two of four observed
targets show a strong emission line with a clear asymmetric profile, identified
as Ly alpha emitters at z=6.11 and 6.00. Their rest-frame equivalent widths are
153A and 114A, which are lower limits on the intrinsic equivalent widths.
Through our spectroscopic observations (including previous ones) of
NB921-depressed i-dropout galaxies, we identified 5 galaxies in total with a
rest-frame equivalent width larger than 100A at 6.0<z<6.5 out of 8 photometric
candidates, which suggests that the NB921-depressed i-dropout selection method
is possibly an efficient way to search for Ly alpha emitters with a large Ly
alpha equivalent width, in a wider redshift range than usual narrow-band excess
techniques. By combining these findings with our previous observational
results, we infer that the fraction of broad-band selected galaxies having a
rest-frame equivalent width larger than 100A is significantly higher at z~6
(the cosmic age of ~1 Gyr) than that at z~3 (~2 Gyr), being consistent with the
idea that the typical stellar population of galaxies is significantly younger
at z~6 than that at z~3. The NB921-depressed i-dropout galaxies may be
interesting candidates for hosts of massive, zero-metallicity Population III

dwarf irregular galaxies of the M81 group from the SINGS and THINGS surveys.
The Spitzer observations provide a first glimpse of the nature of the
non-atomic ISM in these metal-poor (Z~0.1 Z_sun), quiescent (SFR~0.001-0.1
M_sun/yr) dwarf galaxies. Dust emission is detected in five out of the seven
targets. Most detected dust emission is restricted to HI column densities
>1x10^21 cm^-2. Spitzer spectroscopy of two regions in the brightest galaxies
(IC 2574 and Holmberg II) show distinctly different spectral shapes. The
spectrum of IC 2574 shows aromatic features that are less luminous (relative to
the FIR luminosity) compared to an average SINGS spiral galaxy by a factor of
\~7 . The aromatic features in Holmberg~II (which has only a slightly lower
gas-phase metallicity) are fainter than in IC 2574 by an order of magnitude.
This result emphazises that the strength of the aromatic features is not a
simple linear function of metallicity. We estimate dust masses of ~10^4-10^6
M_sun for the M81 dwarf galaxies, resulting in an average dust--to--gas ratio
(M_dust/M_HI) of ~3x10^-4 (1.5x10^-3 if only the HI that is associated with
dust emission is considered); this is an order of magnitude lower than the
typical value derived for the SINGS spirals. The dwarf galaxies are
underluminous per unit star formation rate at 70um as compared to the more
massive galaxies in SINGS by a factor of ~2. However, the average 70um/160um
ratio in the sample dwarf galaxies is higher than what is found in the other
galaxies of the SINGS sample. This can be explained by a combination of a lower
dust content in conjunction with a higher dust temperature in the dwarfs.

$v_{\alpha p}$, and consequently on the angular momentum transport in the solar
wind, is explored. It is found that the force introduced by the azimuthal
components plays an important role in the force balance in interplanetary
space, bringing the radial flow speeds of the species considered closer to each
other. For the fast solar wind, the model cannot account for the decrease of
$v_{\alpha p}$ observed by Helios between 0.3 and 1 AU. However, it can
reproduce the profile of $v_{\alpha p}$ measured by Ulysses beyond 2 AU, if the
right value for $v_{\alpha p}$ is imposed at that distance. In the slow solar
wind, the effect of solar rotation is more pronounced if one starts with the
value measured by Helios at 0.3 AU. In this case, solar rotation introduces a
relative change of 10-16% in the radial flow speed of the alpha particles
between 1 and 4 AU. The model calculations also show that, although alpha
particles consume only a small fraction of the energy and linear momentum
fluxes of protons, they cannot be neglected when considering the proton angular
momentum flux ${\cal L}_p$. In most examples, it is found that ${\cal L}_p$ is
determined by $v_{\alpha p}$ for both the fast and the slow wind. In the slow
solar wind, it is also found that the proton and alpha angular momentum fluxes
${\cal L}_p$ and ${\cal L}_\alpha$ can be several times larger in magnitude
than the flux carried by the magnetic stresses ${\cal L}_M$. While the sum of
the angular momentum fluxes ${\cal L}_P={\cal L}_p+{\cal L}_\alpha$ of both

fast and slow wind alike, this result is at variance with the Helios

negligible but the correlations of large scale perturbations and distortions of
their Gaussianity are possible. Such models are also compatible with existence
of a homogeneous magnetic field and matter rotation which contribute to the low
$\ell$ anisotropy and can be considered as ``hidden parameters'' of the model.
Their influence can be observed as, for example, special correlations of small
scale fluctuations and the Faraday rotation of the CMB and radiation of the
farthest quasars. However, both the magnetic field and matter rotation require
also modifications of the simple models of isotropic inflation and they change
the evolutionary history of the early Universe.

perturbations of a stationary and axisymmetric, infinitely conducting perfect

develop a Lagrangian perturbation framework which enables us to formulate a
strict stability criterion based on the notion of a canonical energy (a
functional of the fluid displacement $\xi $ and its first time derivative). For
any given choice of $\{\xi,\partial_t \xi \} $, the sign of the canonical
energy determines whether the configuration is stable or not at the linear
level. Our analysis provides the first complete description of the stability
problem for a magnetic star, allowing for both rotation and the presence of a
magnetic field in the exterior vacuum region. A key feature of the Lagrangian
formulation is the existence of so-called `trivial' fluid displacements, which
do not represent true physical perturbations. In order for the stability
criterion to make rigorous sense one has to isolate these trivials and consider
only the physical `canonical' displacements. We discuss this problem and
formulate a condition which must be satisfied by all canonical displacements.
Having obtained a well-defined stability criterion we provide examples which
indicate that the magnetic field has a stabilising effect on radiation driven
instabilities.

are derived from standard multi-fluid 5-moment equations. The Alfv\'enic point,
where the combined poloidal Alfv\'en Mach number $M_T=1$, is found to be a
singular point for the wave equation, which is then numerically solved for
three representative angular frequencies $\omega=10^{-3}$, $10^{-4}$ and
$10^{-5}$ rad s$^{-1}$ with a fixed wave amplitude of 10 km s$^{-1}$ imposed at
the coronal base (1 $R_\odot$). Between 1 $R_\odot$ and 1 AU, the numerical
solutions show substantial deviation from the WKB expectations. Even for the
relatively high frequency $\omega=10^{-3}$ rad s$^{-1}$, a WKB-like behavior
can be seen only in regions $r\gtrsim 10$ $R_\odot$. In the low-frequency case
$\omega=10^{-5}$ rad s$^{-1}$, the computed profiles of wave-related parameters
show a spatial dependence distinct from the WKB one, the deviation being
particularly pronounced in interplanetary space. In the inner corona $r\lesssim
4$ $R_\odot$, the computed ion velocity fluctuations are considerably smaller
than the WKB expectations in all cases, as is the computed wave-induced
acceleration exerted on protons or alpha particles. With the chosen base wave
amplitude, the wave acceleration has negligible effect on the ion force balance
in the corona. Hence processes other than the non-WKB wave acceleration are
needed to accelerate the ions out of the gravitational potential well of the
Sun. However, at large distances beyond the Alfv\'enic point, the low-frequency
waves can play an important role in the ion dynamics, with the net effect being
to equalize the speeds of the two ion species considered.

neural systems require that these perturbations be processed through a minimal
number of channels by simple adaptation mechanisms. We found that the most
suitable mathematical framework to meet this requirement is that of weakly
attracting sets. This framework provides us with a normative and unifying
solution to the pattern recognition problem. We analyze the consequences of its
explicit implementation in neural systems. Several properties inherent to the
systems designed in accordance with our normative mathematical argument
coincide with known empirical facts. This is illustrated in mental rotation,

was found first by Moore (1993) and re-discovered with its existence proof by

Therefore, it is unclear whether general relativistic effects admit a
choreographic solution such as the figure eight. We carefully examine general
relativistic corrections to initial conditions so that an orbit for a

choreographic. This illustration suggests that the general relativistic N-body

$N_F$ (or Chern-Simons number $N_{CS}$, what is the same because of the chiral
anomaly) and are stable for sufficiently large $N_F$. In this paper we study
the properties of these anomalous solitons. We find that their
energy-versus-fermion-number ratio is given by $E\sim N_{CS}^{3/4}$ or $E\sim
N_{CS}^{2/3}$ depending on the structure of the scalar potential. For the
former case we demonstrate that there is a lower bound on the soliton energy,
which reads $E\geq c N_{CS}^{3/4}$, where $c$ is some parameter expressed
through the masses and coupling constants of the theory. We construct the
anomalous solitons numerically accounting both for Higgs and gauge dynamics and
show that they are not spherically symmetric. The thin wall approximation valid
for macroscopic solutions with $N_{CS} \gg 1$ is discussed as well.

string theory, where the model dependent axions are responsible for driving
inflation. This model can be considered as a certain extrapolation of
$m^{2}\phi^{2}$-inflation, and is an attempt to explicitly realize the so
called N-flation proposal in string theory. The instanton generated potential
for the axions essentially has two parameters; a natural mass scale $M$ and the
string coupling $g_{s}$. For isotropic compactifications leading to of order
$\mathcal{O} (10^4)$ axions in the four dimensional spectrum we find that with
$(M, g_{s})\simeq(M_{GUT}, 0.5)$ the observed temperature fluctuations in the
CMB are correctly reproduced. We assume an initially random distribution for
the vevs of the axions. The spectral index, $n_{s}$, is generically more red
than for $m^{2}\phi^{2}$-inflation. The greater the vevs, the more red the
spectral index becomes. Allowing for a wide range of vevs 55 $e$-foldings from
the end of inflation, we find $0.946\lesssim n_{s} \lesssim 0.962$. The
tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, is more sensitive to the vevs, but typically
smaller than in $m^{2}\phi^{2}$-inflation. Furthermore, in the regime where the
leading order theory is valid, $r$ is bounded by $r < 0.10$. The spectral index
and the tensor-to-scalar ratio are correlated. For example, $n_{s}\simeq 0.951$
corresponds to $r\simeq 0.036$.

analysis of medium-range and asymptotic properties of the internal one-body

and velocity loss due to air resistance for a given ballistic coefficient that
produce impact velocities corresponding to typical pistol velocities. With

connected subgraphs in arbitrary networks. As with the algorithm in [N. Kashtan
et al., Bioinformatics 20, 1746 (2004)], it provides a weighted sample, but the
computation of the weights is much faster (linear in the size of subgraphs,
instead of super-exponential). This allows subgraphs with up to ten or more
nodes to be sampled with very high statistics, from arbitrarily large networks.
Using this together with a heuristic algorithm for rapidly classifying
isomorphic graphs, we present results for two protein interaction networks
obtained using the TAP high throughput method: one of Escherichia coli with 230
nodes and 695 links, and one for yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) with roughly
ten times more nodes and links. We find in both cases that most connected
subgraphs are strong motifs (Z-scores >10) or anti-motifs (Z-scores <-10) when
the null model is the ensemble of networks with fixed degree sequence. Strong
differences appear between the two networks, with dominant motifs in E. coli
being (nearly) bipartite graphs and having many pairs of nodes which connect to
the same neighbors, while dominant motifs in yeast tend towards completeness or
contain large cliques. We also explore a number of methods that do not rely on
measurements of Z-scores or comparisons with null models. For instance, we
discuss the influence of specific complexes like the 26S proteasome in yeast,
where a small number of complexes dominate the $k$-cores with large k and have
a decisive effect on the strongest motifs with 6 to 8 nodes. We also present
Zipf plots of counts versus rank. They show broad distributions that are not

cooperative gating and we propose experiments to measure these effects.

debate by suggesting that bacteria generate mutations oriented by the

demonstrated that mutations overcoming specific defects arised as a consequence
of cultivation on specific media (3-7). Two diametrically opposed
interpretations were proposed to explain these observations : either induction
of mutations instructed by the environment (e.g. by a process involving a
putative reverse transcription) or selection of variants among a large set of

  Particles","12 pages, in Portuguese","Rev.Bras.Ens.Fis.29:203-208,2007",,,"quant-ph",,"  The one-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation is investigated with the most
general Lorentz structure for the external potentials. The analysis of the
scattering of particles in a step potential with an arbitrary mixing of vector
and scalar couplings reveals that the scalar coupling contributes for
increasing the threshold energy for the particle-antiparticle pair production.
Furthermore, it is shown that the pair production is only feasible whether the
vector coupling exceeds the scalar one. An apparent paradox concerning the
localization of a particle in an arbitrarily small region of space, due to the
presence of the scalar coupling, is solved by introducing the concept of
effective Compton wavelength.
