bursts (GRBs) suggests an inner-engine origin, at radii inside the forward
shock. There must be inverse Compton (IC) emission arising from such flare
photons scattered by forward shock afterglow electrons when they are passing
through the forward shock. We find that this IC emission produces high energy
gamma-ray flares, which may be detected by AGILE, GLAST and ground-based TeV
telescopes. The anisotropic IC scattering between flare photons and forward
shock electrons does not affect the total IC component intensity, but cause a
time delay of the IC component peak relative to the flare peak. The anisotropic
scattering effect may also weaken, to some extent, the suppression effect of
the afterglow intensity induced by the enhanced electron cooling due to flare
photons. We speculate that this IC component may already have been detected by
EGRET from a very strong burst--GRB940217. Future observations by GLAST may
help to distinguish whether X-ray flares originate from late central engine
activity or from external shocks.

followed by a single power-law decay whose slope is much too shallow to be

extend out to ~10 days without any further breaks, until they become too faint
for the XRT to detect. In some extreme cases, light curves extend out to more
than two months without evidence for jet breaks. This raises concerns about our
understanding of afterglow and jet dynamics, and of GRB energetics.

  at Very Slow Rotation","accepted by A&A, 11 pages [abstract abridged]",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20066991",,"astro-ph",,"  The rotation-activity connection explains stellar activity in terms of
rotation and convective overturn time. It is well established in stars of
spectral types F--K and in M-type stars of young clusters. It is not
established in field M-dwarfs, because they rotate very slowly, and detecting
rotation periods or rotational line broadening is a challenge. In field
M-dwarfs, saturation sets in below v_rot = 5 km/s, hence they are expected to
populate the non-saturated part of the rotation-activity connection. This work
for the first time shows intrinsically resolved spectral lines of slowly
rotating M-dwarfs and makes a first comparison to estimates of convective
velocities. By measuring rotation velocities in a sample of mostly inactive
M-dwarfs, the unsaturated part of the rotation-activity connection is followed
into the regime of very low activity. Spectra of ten M-dwarfs are taken at a
resolving power of R = 200 000 in the molecular FeH absorption band. The
intrinsically narrow lines are compared to model calculations and rotational
broadening is measured. In one star, an upper limit of vsini = 1 km/s was
found, significant rotation was detected in the other nine objects. All
inactive stars show rotation below or equal to 2 km/s. In the two active stars
AD Leo and YZ CMi, rotation velocities are found to be 40-50% below the results
from earlier studies. The rotation activity connection holds in field early-M
stars, too. Activity and rotation velocities of the sample stars are well in
agreement with the relation found in earlier and younger stars. The intrinsic
absorption profiles of molecular FeH lines are consistent with calculations
from atomic Fe lines. Investigation of FeH line profiles is a very promising
tool to measure convection patterns at the surfaces of M-stars.

the satellite distance, d, is estimated at ~630-850 kpc from the tip of the red

distinguishes itself from other Local Group galaxies by its extreme dynamics:
Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy reveals it to have a large heliocentric radial

reduced M31 virial masses need revision upward. If not bound to M31, then
AndXIV is just now falling into the Local Group for the first time and
represents a dwarf galaxy that formed and spent almost its entire life in

The allowance for radiation cooling is shown to result in strong damping of all
acoustic modes and to have insignificant effect on unstable surface
Kelvin--Helmholtz modes. In the case of waveguide--resonance internal gravity
modes radiative cooling suppresses completely the instability of waves
propagating away from the ejection source and, vice versa, reduces
substantially the growth time scale of unstable sourceward propagating modes.
The results obtained can be used to study ionization cones in Seyfert galaxies
with radio jets. In particular, our analysis shows that surface
Kelvin--Helmholtz modes and volume harmonics are capable of producing regular
features observed in optical emission-line images of such galaxies.

  astro-ph/0612564 v1, Accepted to ApJ",,"10.1086/521072",,"astro-ph",,"  The early, highly time-variable X-ray emission immediately following GRBs
exhibits strong spectral variations that are unlike the temporally smoother
emission which dominates after $t\sim 10^3$ s. The ratio of hard channel
(1.3-10.0 keV) to soft channel (0.3-1.3 keV) counts in the Swift X-ray
telescope provides a new measure delineating the end time of this emission. We
define $T_{H}$ as the time at which this transition takes place and measure for
59 events a range of transition times that span $10^2$ s to $10^{4}$ s, on
average 5 times longer than the prompt $T_{90}$ duration observed in the
Gamma-ray band. It is very likely that the mysterious light curve plateau phase
and the later powerlaw temporal evolution, both of which typically occur at
times greater than $T_{H}$ and hence exhibit very little hardness ratio
evolution, are both produced by external shocking of the surrounding medium and
not by the internal shocks thought responsible for the earlier emission. We use
the apparent lack of spectral evolution to discriminate against proposed models
for the plateau phase emission. We favor energy injection scenarios with a
roughly linearly increasing input energy versus time for six well sampled
events with nearly flat light curves at $t\approx 10^3-10^4$s. Also, using the
transition time $T_{H}$ as the delineation between the GRB and afterglow
emission, we calculate that the kinetic energy in the afterglow shock is
typically a factor of 10 lower than that released in the GRB. Lack of hardness
variations in these three events may be due to a very highly relatavistic
outflow or due to a very dense circumburst medium. There are a handful of rare
cases of very late time $t>10^4$s hardness evolution, which may point to
residual central engine activity at very late time.

Within these confidence limits, we find close agreement with previously

clusters, of which 87 have absolute magnitudes -10.0 > Mv > -15.4. Five
clusters with available spectra have ages in the range 0.1-1.0 Gyr, photometric
masses between 2x10^6 and 2x10^7 Msun, and are gravitationally bound young
globulars. (2) The blue central disk appears to be young. It is exponential,
can be traced to >10 kpc radius, and has a smooth structure and colors suggest-
ing a dominant, ~400 Myr old poststarburst population. And (3), the center of
NGC 34 drives a strong outflow of cool, neutral gas, as revealed by broad
blueshifted Na I D lines. The mean outflow velocity of this gas is -620 km/s,
while the maximum velocity reaches -1050 km/s. We suggest that NGC 34 stems
from two recently merged gas-rich disk galaxies with an estimated mass ratio

starburst that then shrank to its current central and obscured state. The
strong gaseous outflow came last. (Abridged)

lack of star formation prior to ~8 Gyr ago was due to early loss or exhaustion

cold-front clusters. In the binary clusters, the projected mass, optical light,

substructures. On-going and cold-front merging clusters, on the other hand,
reveal highly irregular mass distributions. Overall the mass distribution
appears to be similar to the galaxy luminosity distribution, whereas their
distributions are quite different from the ICM distribution in a various ways.
We also measured for individual targets the global cluster parameters such as
the cluster mass,the mass-to-light ratio, and the ICM temperature. A comparison
of the ICM and virial temperatures of merging clusters from X-ray and

Ia resulting from the old stellar population (deflagration of a white dwarf in

are suggestions that the SNe II are connected to early B stars, and SNe Ib/c to
isolated O or Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars. However, little or no effort was made to
further separate SNe Ib from Ic. We have used assumed SN rates for different SN
types in spiral galaxies in an attempt to perform this task. If isolated
progenitor hypothesis is correct, our analysis indicates that SNe Ib result
from stars of main-sequence mass $23 \mathcal{M}_{\odot} \lesssim \mathcal{M}
\lesssim 30 \mathcal{M}_{\odot}$, while the progenitors of SNe Ic are more
massive stars with $\mathcal{M} \gtrsim 30 \mathcal{M}_{\odot}$.
  Alternatively, if the majority of SNe Ib/c appear in close binary systems
(CBs) then they would result from the same progenitor population as most of the
SNe II, i.e. early B stars with initial masses of order $\mathcal{M} \sim 10
\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$. Future observations of SNe at high-redshift ($z$) and
their rate will provide us with unique information on SN progenitors and
star-formation history of galaxies. At higher-$z$ (deeper in the cosmic past)
we expect to see the lack of type Ia events, i.e. the dominance of
core-collapse SNe. Better understanding of the stripped-envelope SNe (Ib/c),
and their potential use as distance indicators at high-$z$, would therefore be
of great practical importance.

water. We observe a strong slowing down of the dynamical properties when the
liquid is confined, although the liquid structure is found to remain unchanged

modifications of the cooperative motions when the liquid is confined. We
observe that dynamical heterogeneities and the associated correlation lengths
are strongly increased as well as string-like motions in the confined liquid.
This result, which is in opposition with the expected limitation of the
correlation length by the confinement procedure, may explain (or be explained
by) the slowing down of the dynamics. However the comparison of the dynamical
heterogeneities at constant diffusion coefficient shows that the slowing down
of the dynamics is not sufficient to explain the increase of the correlation

Depending on the coverage of the functional groups, we predict two distinct

distribution of departure times. As the coverage is increased the system enters
a diffusive regime resulting from the interplay of particle desorption and
diffusion. This interplay leads to much longer bound state lifetimes, a
phenomenon qualitatively similar to aging in glassy systems. The diffusion
behavior is analogous to dispersive transport in disordered semiconductors:
depending on the interaction parameters it may range from a finite
renormalization of the diffusion coefficient to anomalous, subdiffusive
behavior. We make connections to recent experiments and discuss the

ordinary case, the mean value of the momentum is not zero and it depends on $q$

representation $U^c_h$ associated to an admissible pair $(c,h)$ of the central
charge and lowest energy, to the subgroup $G_n$? The question, and a part of
the answer originate in chiral conformal QFT.
  The value of $c$ can be easily ``recovered'' from such a restriction; the
hard question concerns the value of $h$. If $c\leq 1$, then there is no loss of
information, and accordingly, all of these restrictions are irreducible. In
this work it is shown that $U^c_{h}|_{G_n}$ is always irreducible for $n=1$,
and if $h=0$, it is irreducible at least up to $n\leq 3$. Moreover, an example
is given for certain values $c>1$ and $h,\tilde{h}>0$ such that
$U^c_{h}|_{G_1}\simeq U^c_{\tilde{h}}|_{G_1}$. It follows that for these values
$U^c_{h}|_{G_n}$ cannot be irreducible for $n\geq 2$. For further values of
$c,h$ and $n$, the question is left open. Nevertheless, the example already
shows, that in general, local and global intertwiners in a QFT model may not be
equivalent.

geometries such as hyperbolic (real, complex, quaternionic), elliptic
(spherical, Fubini-Study), and lorentzian (de Sitter, anti de Sitter) ones.
These geometries carry a certain simple structure that is in some sense
stronger than the riemannian structure. Their basic geometrical objects have
linear nature and provide natural compactifications of classic spaces. The
usual riemannian concepts are easily derivable from the strong structure and
thus gain their coordinate-free form. Many examples illustrate fruitful
features of the approach. The framework introduced here has already been shown
to be adequate for solving problems concerning particular classic spaces.

then the front wrinkles and its overall passage rate (turbulent burning
velocity) increases. The calculation of this speedup is subtle because it
involves the minimum-time propagation trajectory. Here we show mathematically
that for a medium with weak isotropic random fluctuations, under mild
conditions on its spatial structure, the speedup scales with the 4/3 power of
the fluctuation amplitude. This result, which verifies a previous conjecture
while clarifying its scope, is obtained by reducing the propagation problem to
the inviscid Burgers equation with white-in-time forcing. Consequently,
field-theoretic analyses of the Burgers equation have significant implications

near-fields and the far- fields of the antenna. A theory is developed to
explain the mechanism behind the IDM using the multipole expansion method. The
IDM obtained from single frequency solutions is extrapolated over a frequency
range around the design frequency. The method is demonstrated by analyzing
conductingand dielectric- type antennas. A calibration procedure is proposed to
systematically implement infinitesimal dipoles within existing MOM codes. The
interaction of the IDM with passive and active objects is studied through
several examples. The IDM proved to predict the interaction efficiently. A
closed-form expression for the mutual admittance between similar or dissimilar
antennas, with arbitrary orientations and/or locations, is derived using the
reaction theorem.

  OCTOBER 2006",,,"physics.comp-ph",,"  A new particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique for electromagnetic
applications is proposed. The method is based on quantum mechanics rather than
the Newtonian rules assumed in all previous versions of PSO, which we refer to
as classical PSO. A general procedure is suggested to derive many different
versions of the quantum PSO algorithm (QPSO). The QPSO is applied first to
linear array antenna synthesis, which is one of the standard problems used by
antenna engineers. The performance of the QPSO is compared against an improved
version of the classical PSO. The new algorithm outperforms the classical one
most of the time in convergence speed and achieves better levels for the cost
function. As another application, the algorithm is used to find a set of
infinitesimal dipoles that produces the same near and far fields of a circular
dielectric resonator antenna (DRA). In addition, the QPSO method is employed to
find an equivalent circuit model for the DRA that can be used to predict some
interesting parameters like the Q-factor. The QPSO contains only one control
parameter that can be tuned easily by trial and error or by suggested simple
linear variation. Based on our understanding of the physical background of the
method, various explanations of the theoretical aspects of the algorithm are
presented.

microarray experiments is at the center of numerous efforts to identify the

problem based on the cyclohedron test, which is a rank test inspired by recent
advances in algebraic combinatorics. The test has the advantage of being robust
to measurement errors, and can be used to ascertain the significance of
top-ranked genes. We apply the test to recently published measurements of gene
expression during mouse somitogenesis and find 32 genes that collectively are
significant. Among these are previously identified periodic genes involved in
the Notch/FGF and Wnt signaling pathways, as well as novel candidate genes that
may play a role in regulating the segmentation clock. These results confirm
that there are an abundance of exceptionally periodic genes expressed during
somitogenesis. The emphasis of this paper is on the statistics and
combinatorics that underlie the cyclohedron test and its implementation within
a multiple testing framework.

evolution is a two-class model in which an unknown proportion of sites are not

Markov process on a tree. For statistical use it is important to know if the
model is identifiable; can both the tree topology and the numerical parameters
be determined from a joint distribution describing sequences only at the leaves
of the tree? We establish that for generic parameters both the tree and all
numerical parameter values can be recovered, up to clearly understood issues of
`label swapping.' The method of analysis is algebraic, using phylogenetic
invariants to study the variety defined by the model. Simple rational formulas,
expressed in terms of determinantal ratios, are found for recovering numerical

The model and its solution are extended in several respects: a) an analytical
solution is given for the cascade equilibria, exploiting a parameter-based
symmetry of the rate equations; b) we discuss the cooperativity (Hill
coefficients) of the cascade and show that a feedforward loop within the
cascade increases its cooperativity. The relevance of this result for the
notion of modularity is discussed; c) the feedback model for cascade
bistability by Angeli et al. is reconsidered. We argue that care must be taken
in modeling the interactions and a biologically realistic phenomenological
model cannot be too reductionist. The inclusion of a time-dependent degradation
rate is needed to account for a switching of the cascade.
