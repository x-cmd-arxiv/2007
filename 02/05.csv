flux-limited sample of 5 fossil groups, supplemented by additional systems from
the literature, we provide the first detailed study of the scaling properties
of fossils compared to normal groups and clusters. In general, all the fossils
we study show regular and symmetric X-ray emission, indicating an absence of
recent major group mergers. We confirm that, for a given optical luminosity of
the group, fossils are more X-ray luminous than non-fossil groups. Fossils,
however, fall comfortably on the conventional L_X-T_X relation of galaxy groups
and clusters, suggesting that their X-ray luminosity and their gas temperature
are both boosted, arguably, as a result of their early formation. This is
supported by other scaling relations including the L_X-sigma and T_X-sigma
relations in which fossils show higher X-ray luminosity and temperature for a
given group velocity dispersion. We find that mass concentration in fossils is
higher than in non-fossil groups and clusters. In addition, the M_X-T_X
relation suggests that fossils are hotter, for a given total gravitational
mass, both consistent with an early formation epoch for fossils. We show that
the mass-to-light ratio in fossils is rather high but not exceptional, compared
to galaxy groups and clusters. The entropy of the gas in low mass fossils
appears to be systematically lower than that in normal groups, which may
explain why the properties of fossils are more consistent with an extension of
cluster properties. We conclude that the cuspy potential raises the luminosity
and temperature of the IGM in fossils. However, this works in conjunction with
lower gas entropy, which may arise from less effective preheating of the gas.

they random walk in a stochastic magnetic field. The spectrum of the radiation
produced by particles in such fields differs substantially from those of
standard synchrotron emission because the corresponding particle trajectories
deviate significantly from gyration in a regular field. The Larmor radius,
therefore, is no longer a good measure of the particle trajectory. In this
paper we analyze a special DSR regime which arises as highly relativistic
electrons move through magnetic fields which have only random structure on a
wide range of spatial scales. Such stochastic fields arise in turbulent
processes, and are likely present in pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). We show that
DSR generated by a single population of electrons can reproduce the observed
broad-band spectra of PWNe from the radio to the X-ray, in particular producing
relatively flat spectrum radio emission as is usually observed in PWNe. DSR can
explain the existence of several break frequencies in the broad-band emission
spectrum without recourse to breaks in the energy spectrum of the relativistic
particles. The shape of the radiation spectrum depends on the spatial spectrum
of the stochastic magnetic field. The implications of the presented DSR regime
for PWN physics are discussed.

very accurate data are expected from space observations obtained for example

derive an analytical relation between the large frequency separation and the
stellar luminosity and effective temperature and to develop a tool to compare

the proposed method are verified through the application to two test stars. As
a second step, we apply the procedure to two true observations from multisite

the mass, in spite of the small number of frequencies. We expect that with a
significantly higher number of frequencies both the stellar mass and age could
be constrained and, at the same time, the physics of the models could be

the physical processes taking place in slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars,
chemically peculiar Bp stars, and non-pulsating normal B stars co-existing in
the same part of the H-R diagram.
  Methods. We carry out a comparative study between samples of confirmed and
well-studied SPB stars and a sample of well-studied Bp stars with known periods
and magnetic field strengths. We determine their evolutionary state using
accurate HIPPARCOS parallaxes and Geneva photometry. We discuss the occurrence
and strengths of magnetic fields as well as the occurrence of stellar pulsation
among both groups. Further, we make a comparison of Geneva photometric
variability for both kinds of stars.
  Results. The group of Bp stars is significantly younger than the group of SPB
stars. Longitudinal magnetic fields in SPB stars are weaker than those of Bp
stars, suggesting that the magnetic field strength is an important factor for B
type stars to become chemically peculiar. The strongest magnetic fields appear
in young Bp stars, indicating a magnetic field decay in stars at advanced ages.
Rotation periods of Bp and pulsation periods of SPB stars are of the same order
and the behaviour of Geneva photometric variability of some Bp stars cannot be
distinguished from the variability of SPB stars, illustrating the difficulty to
interpret the observed variability of the order of days for B-type stars. We
consider the possibility that pulsation could be responsible for the
variability among chemically peculiar stars. In particular, we show that a
non-linear pulsation model is not excluded by photometry for the Bp star

owing to the strong positive dependence of the photoevaporation rate on disc
radius. Instead, the scarcity of large discs reflects the relative scarcity of
initially massive discs (with mass $> 0.1 M_\odot$). The ubiquity of discs on a
small scale, on the other hand, mainly constrains the timespan over which the
discs have been exposed to the ultraviolet field ($< 2 $Myr). We argue that the
discs that are resolved by HST represent a population of discs in which
self-gravity was important at the time that the dominant central OB star
switched on, but that, according to our models, self-gravity is unlikely to be
important in these discs at the present time. We discuss the implications of
our results for the so-called proplyd lifetime problem.

intermittent than velocity fluctuations in both fast and slow wind. This
behaviour has been interpreted in terms of the anomalous scaling observed in
passive scalars in fully developed hydrodynamic turbulence. In this paper, the
strong intermittent nature of the interplanetary magnetic field is briefly
discussed comparing results performed during different phases of the solar
cycle. The scaling properties of the interplanetary magnetic field magnitude
show solar cycle variation that can be distinguished in the scaling exponents
revealed by structure functions. The scaling exponents observed around solar
maximum coincide, within the errors, to those measured for passive scalars in
hydrodynamic turbulence. However, it is also found that the values are not
universal in the sense that the solar cycle variation may be reflected in
dependence on the structure of the velocity field.

supernovae (SNe 2003hv and 2005df). The detection of Ni emission in SN 2005df
135 days after the explosion provides direct observational evidence of
high-density nuclear burning forming a significant amount of stable Ni in a
Type Ia supernova. The observed emission line profiles in the SN 2005df
spectrum indicate a chemically stratified ejecta structure. The SN 2005df Ar
lines also exhibit a two-pronged emission profile implying that the Ar emission
deviates significantly from spherical symmetry. The spectrum of SN 2003hv also
shows signs of asymmetry, exhibiting blueshifted [Co III] which matches the
blueshift of [Fe II] lines in nearly coeval NIR spectra. Finally, local
thermodynamic equilibrium abundance estimates for the yield of radioactive 56Ni
give ~0.5 Msun, for SN 2003hv, but only ~0.13-0.22 Msun for the apparently
subluminous SN 2005df, supporting the notion that the luminosity of SNe Ia is
primarily a function of the radioactive 56Ni yield.
  The chemically stratified ejecta structure observed in SN 2005df matches the
predictions of delayed-detonation (DD) models, but is entirely incompatible
with current three-dimensional deflagration models. Furthermore the degree that
this layering persists to the innermost regions of the supernova is difficult
to explain even in a DD scenario, where the innermost ejecta are still the
product of deflagration burning. Thus, while these results are roughly
consistent with a delayed detonation, it is clear that a key piece of physics
is still missing from our understanding of the earliest phases of SN Ia
explosions.

the scale length and height of a stellar population increases with age, with
the oldest detected stellar populations identified at a large galactocentric

bridged wormlike micelles, whose structure has been characterized recently
[Ramos and Ligoure, (2007)]. This composite material is obtained by adding
telechelic copolymers (water-soluble chains with hydrophobic stickers at each
extremity) to a solution of entangled wormlike micelles (WM). For comparison,
naked WM and WM decorated by amphiphilic copolymers are also investigated.
While these latter systems exhibit almost a same single ideal Maxwell behavior,
solutions of bridged WM can be described as two Maxwell fluids components
blends, characterized by two markedly different characteristic times, t_fast
and t_slow, and two elastic moduli, G_fast and G_slow, with G_fast >> G_slow.
We show that the slow mode is related to the viscoelasticity of the transient
network of entangled WM, and the fast mode to the network of telechelic active
chains (i.e. chains that do not form loops but bridge two micelles). The
dependence of the viscoelasticity with the surfactant concentration, phi, and
the sticker-to-surfactant molar ratio, beta, is discussed. In particular, we
show that G_fast is proportional to the number of active chains in the
material, phi beta. Simple theoretical expectations allow then to evaluate the

efficient approximate answers to aggregate queries over selected subsets.
Mathematically, we are dealing with a set of weighted items and want to support
queries to arbitrary subset sums. With unit weights, we can compute subset
sizes which together with the previous sums provide the subset averages. The
question addressed here is which sampling scheme we should use to get the most
accurate subset sum estimates.
  We present a simple theorem on the variance of subset sum estimation and use
it to prove variance optimality and near-optimality of subset sum estimation
with different known sampling schemes. This variance is measured as the average
over all subsets of any given size. By optimal we mean there is no set of input
weights for which any sampling scheme can have a better average variance. Such
powerful results can never be established experimentally. The results of this
paper are derived mathematically. For example, we show that appropriately
weighted systematic sampling is simultaneously optimal for all subset sizes.
More standard schemes such as uniform sampling and
probability-proportional-to-size sampling with replacement can be arbitrarily
bad.

deciding which sampling scheme to apply in a given context.

scattering the calculation in a three amplitude rescattering eikonal model,
predicts the survival probability to be an order of magnitude smaller than for
the two amplitude case. The survival probabilities calculation for photo and
DIS $J/\Psi$ production is made in a dedicated model. In this process we show
that, even though its survival probability is considerably larger than in p-p

generalized orbifold equivalence. The reduction to zero volume (or Eguchi-Kawai
reduction) is a special case of this equivalence. So is temperature
independence in confining phases. In pure Yang-Mills theory, the failure of
volume independence for sufficiently small volumes (at weak coupling) due to
spontaneous breaking of center symmetry, together with its validity above a
critical size, nicely illustrate the symmetry realization conditions which are
both necessary and sufficient for large $\Nc$ orbifold equivalence. The
existence of a minimal size below which volume independence fails also applies
to Yang-Mills theory with antisymmetric representation fermions [QCD(AS)].
However, in Yang-Mills theory with adjoint representation fermions [QCD(Adj)],
endowed with periodic boundary conditions, volume independence remains valid
down to arbitrarily small size. In sufficiently large volumes, QCD(Adj) and
QCD(AS) have a large $\Nc$ ``orientifold'' equivalence, provided charge
conjugation symmetry is unbroken in the latter theory. Therefore, via a
combined orbifold-orientifold mapping, a well-defined large $\Nc$ equivalence
exists between QCD(AS) in large, or infinite, volume and QCD(Adj) in
arbitrarily small volume. Since asymptotically free gauge theories, such as
QCD(Adj), are much easier to study (analytically or numerically) in small
volume, this equivalence should allow greater understanding of large $\Nc$ QCD
in infinite volume.

$$\lim_{N\to+\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\alpha^{n}=E ,$$ pointwise in

onto the $C^{*}$--subalgebra $$\bigg(\bigoplus_{z\in\sigma_{\mathop{\rm

mixing with $\Omega\in H$ the unique up to a phase, invariant vector under $U$
and $\omega=<\cdot \Omega,\Omega>$, we have the following recurrence result. If
$A\in K(H)$ fulfils $\omega(A)>0$, and $0<m_{1}<m_{2}<...<m_{l}$ are natural
numbers kept fixed, then there exists an $N_{0}$ such that

therefore argue that the system produced at most Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS)

for the specific example of the ${}^{76}$Ge-${}^{76}$Se system that may undergo
double beta-decay, we demonstrate that the proportionality is a relative good
assumption for reactions changing a neutron into a proton, i.e.
${}^{76}$Ge$(p,n){}^{76}$As. In this channel, the main contribution to the GT
strengths comes from the removal of a neutron from an occupied single-particle
(SP) state and putting a proton into an unoccupied SP state having either the
same state quantum numbers or those of the spin-orbit partner. In contrast to
this, in the second leg of the double beta decay a single proton must be taken
from an occupied SP state and a neutron placed in an unoccupied one. This
second process often is Pauli forbidden in medium-heavy nuclei and only can be
effected if the Fermi surface is smeared out. Such is the case for
${}^{76}$Se$(n,p){}^{76}$As. Our results suggest that one may not always assume
a proportionality between the forward-angle cross sections of the
charge-exchange reactions and the GT strength in any such medium-heavy nuclei.
The discrepancy originates from a pronounced effect of the radial dependence of
the nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) interaction in connection with the Pauli principle
on the cross sections in the $(n,p)$ reaction channel. Such a radial dependence
is completely absent in the GT transition operator.

large-amplitude external fields, focusing on the resonance properties in the
case of driving around the region of avoided level crossing. In particular, we
consider three main questions that characterize resonance dynamics: (1) the
resonance condition, (2) the frequency of the resulting oscillations on
resonance and (3) the width of the resonance. We identify the regions of
validity of different approximations. In a large region of the parameter space,
we use a geometric picture in order to obtain both a simple understanding of
the dynamics and quantitative results. The geometric approach is obtained by
dividing the evolution into discrete time steps, with each time step described
by either a phase shift on the basis states or a coherent mixing process
corresponding to a Landau-Zener crossing. We compare the results of the
geometric picture with those of a rotating-wave approximation. We also comment
briefly on the prospects of employing strong driving as a useful tool to
manipulate two-level systems.

  Axel Kuhn and Gerhard Rempe","A Single-Photon Server with Just One Atom","4 pages, 3 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Neutral atoms are ideal objects for the deterministic processing of quantum
information. Entanglement operations have been performed by photon exchange or
controlled collisions. Atom-photon interfaces were realized with single atoms
in free space or strongly coupled to an optical cavity. A long standing
challenge with neutral atoms, however, is to overcome the limited observation
time. Without exception, quantum effects appeared only after ensemble
averaging. Here we report on a single-photon source with one-and-only-one atom
quasi permanently coupled to a high-finesse cavity. Quasi permanent refers to
our ability to keep the atom long enough to, first, quantify the
photon-emission statistics and, second, guarantee the subsequent performance as
a single-photon server delivering up to 300,000 photons for up to 30 seconds.
This is achieved by a unique combination of single-photon generation and atom
cooling. Our scheme brings truly deterministic protocols of quantum information
science with light and matter within reach.

A 75, 052338 (2007)","10.1103/PhysRevA.75.052338",,"quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  The time evolution of spin states of two electrons interacting with a nuclear
spin bath in a quantum dot system is studied. The hyperfine interaction between
the electrons and the nuclear spins is modeled by an isotropic Heisenberg
interaction, and the interaction between the electron spins by Heisenberg
exchange. Depending on the extent of the overlap between the spatial wave
functions of the electrons, there are two physically different cases, namely
the two qubits either interact with the same set of nuclear spins or they see
different nuclear spin environment. In the two cases, the decoherence of the
two-qubit state is studied analytically. We have identified a class of
two-qubit states which have a rich dynamics when the exchange interaction
between the qubits becomes large in comparison to the hyperfine interaction
strengths. The decoherence time scale is determined as a function of the
bath-spin distribution and the polarizations of the initial two-qubit state.
States with large decoherence times are identified by performing a minimization
over all the two-qubit pure states.

particles on a periodic chain and study in detail the entanglement properties
of such a state. In particular we calculate exactly the entanglement of one
site with the rest of the chain, and the entanglement of two distant sites with
each other and show that the derivative of both these properties diverge when
the parameter $g$ of the states passes through a critical point. Such a point
can be called a point of quantum phase transition, since at this point, the
character of the matrix product state which is the ground state of a
Hamiltonian, changes discontinuously. We also study the finite size effects and
show how the entanglement depends on the size of the chain. This later part is
relevant to the field of quantum computation where the problem of initial state
preparation in finite arrays of qubits or qutrits is important. It is also
shown that entanglement of two sites have scaling behavior near the critical
point.

effectuated by scattering. This is tantamount to a shortfall of scattering
intensity. The possible connection with striking experimental results of
neutron and electron Compton scattering from protons in condensed matter is
mentioned.
