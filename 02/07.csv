in their spectral shapes. We specifically investigate the X-ray spectral
evolution of Mrk 421 over a time span of about nine years. We aim at
statistically describing and physically understanding the large spectral
changes in X rays observed in Mrk 421 over this time span. We perform a
homogeneous spectral analysis of a wide data set including archived
observations with ASCA, BeppoSax, RXTE, as well as published and unpublished
XMM-Newton data. The presence of uncertainties is taken into account in our
correlation analysis. The significance of the correlations found and possible
spurious effects are studied with Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the
Mrk421 spectral energy distribution (SED) has a lower peak at energies that
vary in the range, 0.1-10 keV while its X-ray spectrum is definitely curved.
Parameterizing the X-ray spectra with a log-parabolic model, we find a positive
correlation between the position and the height of the SED peak. In addition,
we find a negative trend of the spectral curvature parameter vs. the SED peak
energy. We show that these relations between the spectral parameters are
consistent with statistical or stochastic acceleration of the emitting
particles, and provide insight into the physical processes occurring in BL Lac
nuclei.

  proceedings ed. L. C. Ho and J.-M. Wang (San Francisco: ASP)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Genuine spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the central few parsec of the
nearest and brightest active galaxies in the Southern Hemisphere are presented.
They are compiled from very high spatial resolution observations in the radio
(VLBA), the infrared (using adaptive optics and interferometry) and the optical
(HST). The SEDs are characterized by two main emission bumps peaking in the
X-rays and in the infrared respectively, as it is known from optically obscured
galactic nuclei. Yet, the SED shape of the IR largely departs from the one
derived from large aperture data. It reveals two new features: (1) a very sharp
decay at wavelengths shortward of 2 $\mu$m, plausibly a consequence of the
heavy extinction towards the core region and (2) a flattening in the 10-20
$\mu$m range as well as a downturn toward longer wavelengths. Accordingly, the
true bolometric luminosity of these core regions turns out to be about an order
of magnitude lower than previously estimated on the basis of IRAS/ISO data.
These findings indicate that large aperture IR data are largely dominated by
the contribution of the host galaxy. They warn against over-interpretations of
IR/X-ray and IR/optical correlations based on large aperture IR data which are
used to differentiate AGN from normal galaxy populations.
  The new derived IR bolometric luminosities still exceed the output energy
measured in the high energies by factors from 3 to 60. With the expectation
that both luminosities should be comparable within an order of magnitude, the
reduced factors between both suggests that the derived IR luminosities are
getting closer to the genuine power output of the core.

radio observations of interactions in ice at the horizon in Antarctica is a
related attempt. Radio galaxy hot spots are prime candidates to produce the
highest energy cosmic rays, and the corresponding shock waves in relativistic
jets emanating from nearly all black holes observed. We will review the
arguments and the way to verify the ensuing predictions. This involves the
definition of reliable samples of active sources, such as black holes, and
galaxies active in star formation. The AUGER array will probably decide within

adapted and applied to the case of spherical symmetric spatial data. The
results are compared with 1000 Monte Carlo simulations based on Gaussian
fluctuations with a best fit $\Lambda$CDM power spectrum and WMAP-like beam and
noise properties. Statistical quantities based on the scaling indices, namely
the moments of the distribution and probability-based measures are determined.
We find for most of the test statistics significant deviations from the
Gaussian hypothesis. We find pronounced asymmetries, which can be interpreted
as a global lack of structure in the northern hemisphere, which is consistent
with previous findings. Furthermore, we detect a localized anomaly in the
southern hemisphere, which gives rise to highly significant signature for
non-Gaussianity in the spectrum of scaling indices. We identify this signature
as the cold spot, which was also already detected in the first year WMAP data.
Our results provide further evidence for both the presence of non-Gaussianities
and asymmetries in the WMAP three-year data. More detailed bandand year-wise
analyses are needed to elucidate the origin of the detected anomalies. In
either case the scaling indices provide powerful nonlinear statistics to
analyse CMB maps.

line current flow, idealizing the near-potential coronal field within which a
highly localized twisted current structure is embedded. It is found that this
field has a significant axial component off the helical magnetic axis where
there is no current flow, such that the flux winds around the axis. The helical
line current field, in including the effects of flux rope writhe, is therefore
more topologically complex than straight line and ring current fields sometimes
used in solar flux rope models. The axial flux in magnetic fields around
confined current structures may be affected by the writhe of these current
structures such that the field twists preferentially with the same handedness
as the writhe. This property of fields around confined current structures with
writhe may be relevant to classes of coronal magnetic flux rope, including
structures observed to have sigmoidal forms in soft X-rays and prominence
magnetic fields. For example, ``bald patches'' and the associated heating by
Parker current sheet dissipation seem likely. Thus some measurements of flux
rope magnetic helicities may derive from external, near-potential fields. The
predicted hemispheric preference for positive and negative magnetic helicities
is consistent with observational results for prominences and sigmoids and past
theoretical results for flux rope internal fields.

neighborhood (SN) implies that clusters are destroyed on a timescale of less
than a Gyr. This is much shorter than the predicted dissolution time of
clusters due to stellar evolution and two-body relaxation in the tidal field of
the Galaxy. So, other (external) effects must play a dominant role in the
destruction of star clusters in the solar neighborhood. We recalculated the
survival time of initially bound star clusters in the solar neighborhood taking
into account: (1) stellar evolution, (2) tidal stripping, (3) perturbations by
spiral arms and (4) encounters with giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We find that
encounters with GMCs are the most damaging to clusters. The resulting predicted
dissolution time of these combined effects, t_dis=1.7 (Mi/10^4 M_sun)^0.67 Gyr
for clusters in the mass range of 10^2 < M < 10^5 M_sun, is very similar to the
disruption time of t_dis=1.3+/-0.5 (M/10^4 M_sun)^0.62 Gyr that was derived
empirically from a mass limited sample of clusters in the solar neighborhood
within 600 pc. The predicted shape of the age distribution of clusters agrees
very well with the observed one. The comparison between observations and theory
implies a surface star formation rate (SFR) near the sun of 3.5x10^-10 M_sun
yr^-1 pc^-2 for stars in bound clusters with an initial mass in the range of
10^2 to 3x10^4 M_sun. This can be compared to a total SFR of 7-10x10^-10 M_sun
yr^-1 pc^-2 derived from embedded clusters or 3-7x10^-9 M_sun yr^-1 pc^-2

driven magnetically from accretion disks, existing observations of field
strengths in the bow shocks of these flows imply that magnetic fields play only
a minor role in the dynamics at these locations. To investigate this apparent
discrepancy we performed numerical simulations of expanding magnetized jets
with stochastically variable input velocities with the AstroBEAR MHD code.
Because the magnetic field B is proportional to the density n within
compression and rarefaction regions, the magnetic signal speed drops in
rarefactions and increases in the compressed areas of velocity-variable flows.
In contrast, B ~ n^0.5 for a steady-state conical flow with a toroidal field,
so the Alfven speed in that case is constant along the entire jet. The
simulations show that the combined effects of shocks, rarefactions, and
divergent flow cause magnetic fields to scale with density as an intermediate
power 1 > p > 0.5. Because p > 0.5, the Alfven speed in rarefactions decreases
on average as the jet propagates away from the star. This behavior is extremely
important to the flow dynamics because it means that a typical Alfven velocity
in the jet close to the star is significantly larger than it is in the
rarefactions ahead of bow shocks at larger distances, the one place where the
field is a measurable quantity. We find that the observed values of weak fields
at large distances are consistent with strong fields required to drive the
observed mass loss close to the star. For a typical stellar jet the crossover
point inside which velocity perturbations of 30 - 40 km/s no longer produce
shocks is ~ 300 AU from the source.

  (lack of) small-scale structure","Accepted by A&A, 22 pages",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20065301",,"astro-ph",,"  We present results of the first survey of high-redshift (<z> ~ 2.3) OVI
absorption systems along parallel lines of sight toward two lensed QSOs. After
a careful and well-defined search, we find ten intervening OVI systems. Within
the errors, all OVI systems appear at the same redshift and have similar line
strengths in front of both QSO images, whereas in most cases CIV or SiIV show
more differences across the lines of sight, either in radial velocity or line
strength. We conclude that (1) the coherence length of OVI must be much larger
than ~ 1 kpc, and (2) an important fraction of the CIV absorbers may not reside
in the same volume as OVI. Since Doppler parameters are consistent with
photoionization, we propose a model in which CIV occurs in two different
photoionized phases, one large, with characteristic sizes of a few hundred kpc
and bearing OVI, and another one a factor of ten smaller and containing CIII.
This model is able to explain the various transverse differences observed in
column density and kinematics. We apply the model successfully to 2 kinds of
absorbers, with low and high metallicity. In the low-metallicity regime, [C/H]
\~ -2, we find that [C/O] ~ -0.7 is required to explain the observations, which
hints at late (z < 6) rather than early metal enrichment. In the
high-metallicity regime, the observed dissociation between OVI and CIV gas
might be produced by galactic outflows. Altogether, the relative abundances,
inhomogeneous CIV and featureless OVI are consistent with gas that has been
processed recently before the absorption occurred (thus close to star-forming
regions). Finally, we discuss briefly three associated systems (z_abs ~ z_em)
that also show OVI. (abridged)

turbulent decorrelation. The refraction localizes turbulence to the filament
periphery, hence it avoids mixing by the turbulence. As the turbulence decays
these long-lived filaments create a non Gaussian tail. A condition related to
the shear of the filament field determines which fluctuations become coherent

spatial envelope maps into a probability distribution that decays as density to
the power -3. The spatial envelope of density yields a Levy distribution in the

cloud core is studied using three-dimensional resistive MHD nested grid
simulations. Starting with a Bonnor-Ebert isothermal cloud rotating in a
uniform magnetic field, we calculate the cloud evolution from the molecular
cloud core (n=10^4 cm^-3) to the stellar core (n \simeq 10^22 cm^-3). The
magnetic field strengths at the center of the clouds converge to a certain
value as the clouds collapse, when the clouds have the same angular momenta but
different strengths of the magnetic fields at the initial state. For 10^12
cm^-3 < n < 10^16 cm^-3, Ohmic dissipation considerably removes the magnetic
field from the collapsing cloud core, and the magnetic field lines, which are
strongly twisted for n <10^12 cm^-3, is de-collimated. The magnetic field lines
are twisted and amplified again for nc > 10^16 cm^-3, because the magnetic
field is recoupled with the warm gas. Finally, protostars at their formation
epoch have 0.1-1kG of the magnetic fields, which are comparable to
observations. The magnetic field strength of protostar slightly depends on the
angular momentum of the host cloud. The protostar formed from the slowly
rotating cloud core has a stronger magnetic field. The evolution of the angular
momentum is closely related to the evolution of the magnetic field. The angular
momentum in the collapsing cloud is removed by the magnetic effect. The formed
protostars have 0.1-2 days of the rotation period at their formation epoch,
which are slightly shorter than the observation. This indicates that the
further removal mechanism of the angular momentum such as interaction between
the protostar and disk, wind gas or jet is important in further evolution of
the protostar.

nucleon fraction, and the electron degeneracy, with given density and
temperature of the disk matter. We construct a bridging formula for the
electron fraction that works for various neutrino optical depths, and give
exact definitions for the free proton fraction and free neutron fraction. We
show that the electron degeneracy has important effects in the sense that it
enlarges the absorption optical depth for neutrinos, and it along with the
neutronization processes favored by high temperature cause the electron
fraction to drop to be below 0.1 in the inner region of the disk. The resulting
neutrino annihilation luminosity is considerably reduced comparing with that
obtained in previous works where the electron degeneracy was not considered and

particularly surprising for NGC6334I(N) since it lacks bright infrared emission
and is considered a massive cold core at an early evolutionary stage. High
optical depth and multiply-peaked line profiles complicate rotation temperature
estimates, and we can only conclude that gas components with temperatures >100K

in the Galactic disc towards Carina. It orbits very close to its host star (a =
0.03 AU) and has an equilibrium temperature of nearly 2000 K. Using
rapid-cadence transit photometry from the FORS2 camera on the VLT and SUSI2 on
the NTT, and high-resolution spectroscopy with UVES on the VLT, we refine the
shape of the transit light curve and the parameters of the system. In
particular, we improve the planetary radius estimate, R=1.18 +- 0.07 R_J and
provide very precise ephemeris, T_tr=2453142.59123 +- 0.0003 BJD and P=1.689868
+- 0.000003 days. The obtained planetary mass is 1.14 +- 0.12 M_J. Our results
give a slightly smaller and lighter star, and bigger planet, than previous
values. As the VLT/FORS2 light curve obtained in this analysis with the
deconvolution photometry algorithm DECPHOT shows a transit depth in
disagreement with the one obtained by a previous study using the same data, we
analyze them with two other reduction methods (aperture and image subtraction).
The light curves obtained with the three methods are in good agreement, though
deconvolution-based photometry is significantly more precise. It appears from
these results that the smaller transit depth obtained in the previous study was
due to a normalisation problem inherent to the reduction procedure used.

fitted to the observed spectra. This method, which was previously applied to 9
comets, is now extended to 30 further comets. This allows us to study the
evolution of their water molecule outflow velocity over a large range of
heliocentric distances and gas production rates. Our analysis confirms and
extends previous analyses. The retrieved expansion velocities increases with
increasing gas production rates and decreasing heliocentric distances.
Heuristic laws are proposed, which could be used for the interpretation of
observations of cometary molecules and as a touchstone for hydrodynamical
models. The expansion velocities retrieved from 18 cm line shapes are larger
than those obtained from millimetric observations of parent molecules with
smaller fields of view, which demonstrates the acceleration of the gas with
cometocentric distance. Our results are in reasonable quantitative agreement
with current hydrodynamical models of cometary atmospheres.

Methods. Deep optical, partly wide-field, images were used to reveal the

spectroscopy enabled us to uncover their nature. Results. The two nebulosities
obviously are physically linked, but are of different type; the Criss-Cross
Nebula is, as was shown also in an earlier paper, excited via a slow shock from
the expanding Orion-Eridanus Bubble, but the broad arc is definitely
photo-ionized. The source for ionizing photons appears to be hot gas in this

clouds available from the literature bear a striking resemblance to our
nebulae, which appear to represent an example - unrivalled in closeness and

over-run by a highly evolved SNR. Thereby the Criss-Cross Nebula is, when seen
from the SNR, the rear disrupted part of the original small cloud, whereas the

of mergers on the masses of black holes in massive clusters of galaxies. We use
the extended Press-Schechter formalism to generate Monte Carlo merger histories
of halos with a mass 10^{15} h^{-1} Msun. We assume that the black hole mass
function at z=2 is similar to that inferred from observations at z=0 (since
quasar activity declines markedly at z<2), and we assign black holes to the
progenitor halos assuming a monotonic relation between halo mass and black hole
mass. We follow the dynamical evolution of subhalos within larger halos,
allowing for tidal stripping, the loss of orbital energy by dynamical friction,
and random orbital perturbations in gravitational encounters with subhalos, and
we assume that mergers of subhalos are followed by mergers of their central
black holes. Our analytic model reproduces numerical estimates of the subhalo
mass function. We find that the most massive black holes in massive clusters
typically grow by a factor ~ 2 by mergers after gas accretion has stopped. In
our ten realizations of 10^{15} h^{-1} Msun clusters, the highest initial (z=2)
black hole masses are 5-7 x 10^9 Msun, but four of the clusters contain black
holes in the range 1-1.5 x 10^{10} Msun at z=0. Satellite galaxies may host
black holes whose mass is comparable to, or even greater than, that of the
central galaxy. Thus, black hole mergers can significantly extend the very high

liquid `holon metal' phase with fractionalized excitations. The holon metal
phase is flanked on both sides by Fermi liquid states with Fermi surfaces
enclosing the usual Luttinger area. However the electronic quasiparticles carry
distinct quantum numbers in the two Fermi liquid phases, and consequently the
limit of the ratio A_F/delta, as delta tends to zero (where A_F is the area of
a hole pocket) has a factor of 2 discontinuity across the quantum critical
point of the insulator. We demonstrate that the electronic spectrum at this

can be applied to bio-networks, we develop a scaling theory of transport in

allows us to determine the influence of the modular structure on transport. We
also generalize our theory by presenting and verifying scaling arguments for
the dependence of transport on microscopic features, such as the degree of the

one-dimensional (1D) nonpolynomial Schr\""{o}dinger equation (NPSE), and direct
numerical solutions of the underlying 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), we
show that the ground state of the condensate is a soliton belonging to the
semi-infinite bandgap of the periodic potential. The soliton may be confined to
a single cell of the lattice, or extend to several cells, depending on the
effective self-attraction strength, $g$ (which is proportional to the number of
atoms bound in the soliton), and depth of the potential, $V_{0}$, the increase
of $V_{0}$ leading to strong compression of the soliton. We demonstrate that
the OL is an effective tool to control the soliton's shape. It is found that,
due to the 3D character of the underlying setting, the ground-state soliton
collapses at a critical value of the strength, $g=g_{c}$, which gradually
decreases with the increase of the depth of the periodic potential, $V_{0}$;
under typical experimental conditions, the corresponding maximum number of
$^{7}$Li atoms in the soliton, $N_{\max}$, ranges between $8,000$ and $4,000$.
Examples of stable multi-peaked solitons are also found in the first finite
bandgap of the lattice spectrum. The respective critical value $g_{c}$ again
slowly decreases with the increase of $V_{0}$, corresponding to $N_{\max

metastable parent phase during a first order phase transition has been a
subject of outstanding interest in natural science. The problem becomes even
more challenging as the spinodal is approached. In this work, we have
undertaken extensive computer simulation studies to probe the molecular
mechanism for the onset of instability. We have constructed the free energy
surfaces of nucleation as a function of multiple reaction coordinates, both for
supercooled Lennard-Jones fluid and for 2- and 3-dimensional Ising models.
While the classical Becker-Doring (BD) picture of homogenous nucleation, that
assumes the growth of a single nucleus by single particle addition, holds good
at low to moderate supersaturation, the formation of the new stable phase
becomes more collective and spread over the whole system at large
supersaturation. As the spinodal curve is approached from the coexistence line,
the free energy, as a function of the size of the largest liquid-like cluster,
develops a minimum at a sub-critical cluster size. This minimum at intermediate
size is responsible for the barrier towards further growth of the nucleus at
large supersaturation. As the spinodal is approached closely, this minimum
gradually disappears and so does the free energy barrier for the cluster
growth. We find the emergence of an alternative free energy pathway (with a
barrier less than that in the BD picture) that involves participation of many
sub-critical liquid-like clusters and the growth of the stable phase is
promoted by a coalescence mechanism. Very close to the spinodal the free energy
surface becomes quite flat, the significance of a critical nucleus is lost and
the classical Becker-Doring picture of nucleation breaks down.

non-equilibrium phase transitions into absorbing states with long-range
interactions. It focuses on two possible types of long-range interactions. The
first one is to replace nearest-neighbor couplings by unrestricted Levy flights
with a power-law distribution P(r) ~ r^(-d-sigma) controlled by an exponent
sigma. Similarly, the temporal evolution can be modified by introducing waiting
times Dt between subsequent moves which are distributed algebraically as P(Dt)~
(Dt)^(-1-kappa). It turns out that such systems with Levy-distributed
long-range interactions still exhibit a continuous phase transition with
critical exponents varying continuously with sigma and/or kappa in certain
ranges of the parameter space. In a field-theoretical framework such
algebraically distributed long-range interactions can be accounted for by
replacing the differential operators nabla^2 and d/dt with fractional
derivatives nabla^sigma and (d/dt)^kappa. As another possibility, one may
introduce algebraically decaying long-range interactions which cannot exceed
the actual distance to the nearest particle. Such interactions are motivated by
studies of non-equilibrium growth processes and may be interpreted as Levy
flights cut off at the actual distance to the nearest particle. In the
continuum limit such truncated Levy flights can be described to leading order
by terms involving fractional powers of the density field while the
differential operators remain short-ranged.

is cut off by a decay of the quadratic coupling constant in the memory
function. (Such a decay, on a time scale tau_I, has been suggested as the
likely consequence of activated processes.) If this decay is complete, so that
only a linear coupling remains at late times, then the alpha relaxation shows a
temporal crossover from a relaxation typical of the unmodified schematic model
to a final strongly slower-than-exponential relaxation. This crossover, which
differs somewhat in form from previous schematic models of the cut-off glass
transition, resembles light-scattering experiments on colloidal systems, and
can exhibit a `slower-than-alpha' relaxation feature hinted at there. We also
consider what happens when a similar but incomplete decay occurs, so that a
significant level of quadratic coupling remains for t>>tau_I. In this case the
correlator acquires a third, weaker relaxation mode at intermediate times. This
empirically resembles the beta process seen in many molecular glass formers. It
disappears when the initial as well as the final quadratic coupling lies on the
liquid side of the glass transition, but remains present even when the final
coupling is only just inside the liquid (so that the alpha relaxation time is
finite, but too long to measure). Our results are suggestive of how, in a
cut-off glass, the underlying `ideal' glass transition predicted by
mode-coupling theory can remain detectable through qualitative features in
dynamics.

calculations to study the geometric and electronic structures, together with
the strength of the atomic bonds and the associated vibrational frequencies.
The conductance is calculated by first evaluating the transmission of electrons
through the system, and secondly by calculating the conductance change due to
the excitation of vibrations. As found in previous studies [Paulsson et al.,
Phys. Rev. B. 72, 201101(R) (2005)] the change in conductance due to inelastic
effects permits to characterize the crossover from tunneling to contact. The
most notorious effect being the crossover from an increase in conductance in
the tunneling regime to a decrease in conductance in the contact regime when
the bias voltage matches a vibrational threshold. Our DFT-based calculations
actually show that the effect of vibrational modes in electron conductance is
rather complex, in particular when modes localized in the contact region are
permitted to extend into the electrodes. As an example, we find that certain
modes can give rise to decreases in conductance when in the tunneling regime,
opposite to the above mentioned result. Whereas details in the inelastic
spectrum depend on the size of the vibrational region, we show that the overall
change in conductance is quantitatively well approximated by the simplest
calculation where only the apex atoms are allowed to vibrate. Our study is
completed by the application of a simplified model where the relevant

with networks with cycles. Second, we enrich the set of components used in the
genetic algorithm, which improves the performance. Third, we develop a novel
distributed framework. Combining distributed random network coding with our
distributed optimization yields a network coding protocol where the resources
used for coding are optimized in the setup phase by running our evolutionary
algorithm at each node of the network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our

root-finding procedure. Hence, this leads to a much faster and more robust

the notion of Elementary Emitting Cells (EEC). They are intermediary objects
containing identical bosons and are supposed to be produced independently
during the hadronization process. Only bosons in EEC, which represents a single
quantum state here, are subjected to the effects of Bose-Einstein (BE)
statistics, which forces them to follow a geometrical distribution. There are
no such effects between particles from different EECs. We illustrate our
proposition by calculating a representative number of typical distributions and
discussing their sensitivity to EECs and their characteristics.

  In the first and second case the investigation is reduced to the analysis of
the nonidentical relations of the skew-symmetric differential forms that are
obtained from differential equations. It is shown that the integrability of
equations and the properties of their solutions depend on the realization of
the conditions of degenerate transformations under which the identical
relations are obtained from the nonidentical relation.
  The field-theory equations, in contrast to the equations of first two types,
are the relations made up by skew-symmetric differential forms or their analogs
(differential or integral ones). This is due to the fact that the field-theory
equations have to describe physical structures (to which closed exterior forms
correspond) rather than physical quantities. The equations that correspond to
field theories are obtained from the equations that describe the conservation
laws (of energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, and mass) of material
systems (of continuous media). This disclose a connection between field
theories and the equations for material systems (and points to that material

relation to refeeding after two different fasting phases: a long period of
protein sparing during which energy expenditure is derived from lipid oxidation
(phase II), and a later phase characterized by a rise in plasma corticosterone
triggering protein catabolism (phase III). Such a switch in body fuel uses,
leading to changes in body reserves and gluconeogenic precursors, could
modulate intestinal gluconeogenesis and glucose transport. The gene and protein
levels, and the cellular localization of the sodium-glucose cotransporter
SGLT1, and of GLUT5 and GLUT2, as well as that of the key gluconeogenic enzymes
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc6Pase)
were measured. PEPCK and Glc6Pase activities were also determined. In phase III
fasted rats, SGLT1 was up-regulated and intestinal glucose uptake rates were
higher than in phase II fasted and fed rats. PEPCK and Glc6Pase mRNA, protein
levels and activities also increased in phase III. GLUT5 and GLUT2 were
down-regulated throughout the fast, but increased after refeeding, with GLUT2
recruited to the apical membrane. The increase in SGLT1 expression during phase
III may allow glucose absorption at low concentrations as soon as food is
available. Furthermore, an increased epithelial permeability due to fasting may
induce a paracellular movement of glucose. In the absence of intestinal GLUT2
during fasting, Glc6Pase could be involved in glucose release to the
bloodstream via membrane trafficking. Finally, refeeding triggered GLUT2 and
GLUT5 synthesis and apical recruitment of GLUT2, to absorb larger amounts of
hexoses.

Betacells exhibit a complex behaviour upon stimulation with glucose including
repeated and uninterrupted bursting. Mathematical modelling is most suitable to
improve knowledge about the function of various transmembrane currents provided
the model is based on reliable data. This is the first attempt to build a
mathematical model for the betacell-electrophysiology in a bottom-up approach
which relies on single protein conductivity data. The results of previous
whole-cell-based models are reconsidered. The full simulation including all
prominent transmembrane proteins in betacells is used to provide a functional
interpretation of their role in betacell-bursting and an updated vantage point
of betacell-electrophysiology. As a result of a number of in silico knock-out-
and block-experiments the novel model makes some unexpected predictions:
Single-channel conductivity data imply that calcium-gated potassium currents
are rather small. Thus, their role in burst interruption has to be revisited.
An alternative role in high calcium level oscillations is proposed and an
alternative burst interruption model is presented. It also turns out that
sodium currents are more relevant than expected so far. Experiments are
proposed to verify these predictions.
