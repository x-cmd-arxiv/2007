gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed by the narrow field X-ray telescope (XRT)
aboard the {\it Swift} spacecraft. These flares are thought to be indicative of
late time activity by the central engine that powers the GRB and produced by
means similar to those which produce the prompt emission. We use a
non-parametric procedure to study the overall temporal properties of the flares
and a structure function analysis to look for an evolution of the fundamental
variability time-scale between the prompt and late time emission. We find a
strong correlation in 28 individual x-ray flares in 18 separate GRBs between
the flare duration and their time of peak flux since the GRB trigger. We also
find a qualitative trend of decreasing variability as a function of time since
trigger, with a characteristic minimum variability timescale $\Delta t/t=0.1$
for most flares. We interpret these results as evidence of internal shocks at
collision radii that are larger than those that produced the prompt emission.
Contemporaneous detections of high energy emission by GLAST could be a crucial
test in determining if indeed these X-ray flares originate as internal shocks
behind the afterglow, as any X-ray emission originating from behind the
afterglow is expected to undergo inverse Compton scattering as it passes
through the external shock.

weak magnetic field which varies on the same 5.37 day period found from the

time variable properties of the same resonance lines in greater detail to
determine the physical characteristics of the magnetospheric structure
responsible for them. In our formulation this structure takes the form of an
axisymmetric ""disk"" similarto those around magnetic He-strong Bp stars. This
structure corotates with the star, covering greater or lesser amounts of its
area during its transit. zeta Cas offers a special case because we observe it
from a low inclination and yet its magnetic axis is substantially inclined to
the rotation axis. The equivalent width-phase curves show a flat maximum for
half the cycle, indicating that the disk is extended out of the plane, extends
to the star's surface in the magnetic plane, or both. Synthetic spectra of the
line profiles during the maximum and minimum occultation phases can be best
reconciled with a disk geometry in which the resonance lines are formed at a
closed outer edge and along a thin outer layer. We speculate that observed weak
redshifted emission is formed in ""auroral caps"" located near the magnetic poles
of the star. We argue that this results from shocks of stagnated wind material
returning to the star and shocking against the outflowing wind.

youngest and nearest high-mass stars (O5-O7) and also known to be a close
binary system. Using new multi-epoch visual and near-infrared bispectrum
speckle interferometric observations obtained at the BTA 6 m telescope, and
IOTA near-infrared long-baseline interferometry, we trace the orbital motion of
the Theta 1 Ori C components over the interval 1997.8 to 2005.9, covering a
significant arc of the orbit. Besides fitting the relative position and the
flux ratio, we apply aperture synthesis techniques to our IOTA data to
reconstruct a model-independent image of the Theta 1 Ori C binary system.
  The orbital solutions suggest a high eccentricity (e approx. 0.91) and
short-period (P approx. 10.9 yrs) orbit. As the current astrometric data only
allows rather weak constraints on the total dynamical mass, we present the two
best-fit orbits. From these orbital solutions one can be favoured, implying a
system mass of 48 M_sun and a distance to the Trapezium cluster of 434 pc. When
also taking the measured flux ratio and the derived location in the HR-diagram
into account, we find good agreement for all observables, assuming a spectral
type of O5.5 for Theta 1 Ori C1 (M=34.0 M_sun) and O9.5 for C2 (M=15.5 M_sun).
  We find indications that the companion C2 is massive itself, which makes it
likely that its contribution to the intense UV radiation field of the Trapezium
cluster is non-negligible. Furthermore, the high eccentricity of the
preliminary orbit solution predicts a very small physical separation during
periastron passage (approx. 1.5 AU, next passage around 2007.5), suggesting
strong wind-wind interaction between the two O stars.

well-established dissipative galaxy merger remnant. These observations
supersede previous WFPC2 images which revealed the presence of a population of
metal-rich globular clusters (GCs) of intermediate age (~1.5-4 Gyr). We detect
a total of 580 GC candidates, 46% more than from the previous WFPC2 images. The
new photometry strengthens the significance of the previously found bimodality
of the color distribution of GCs. Peak colors in V-I are 0.93 +/-0.01 and 1.09
+/- 0.01 for the blue and red subpopulations, respectively. The luminosity
function (LF) of the inner 50% of the metal-rich (`red') population of GCs
differs markedly from that of the outer 50%. In particular, the LF of the inner
50% of the red GCs shows a flattening consistent with a turnover that is about
1.0 mag fainter than the turnover of the blue GC LF. This is consistent with
predictions of recent models of GC disruption for the age range mentioned above
and for metallicities that are consistent with the peak color of the red GCs as
predicted by population synthesis models. We determine the specific frequency
of GCs in NGC 3610 and find a present-day value of S_N = 1.4 +/- 0.6. We
estimate that this value will increase to S_N = 3.8 +/- 1.7 at an age of 10
Gyr, which is consistent with typical S_N values for `normal' ellipticals. Our
findings constitute further evidence in support of the notion that metal-rich
GC populations formed during major mergers involving gas-rich galaxies can
evolve dynamically (through disruption processes) into the red, metal-rich GC
populations that are ubiquitous in `normal' giant ellipticals.

spatial source distribution to constrain the local rate density, $r_{0}$, of
BBH inspiral events in the nearby Universe. Assuming Advanced LIGO
sensitivities and an upper rate of Galactic BBH inspirals of $
30\hspace{1mm}\mathrm{Myr}^{-1}$, we simulate GW data and apply a fitting
procedure to the PEH filtered data. To determine the accuracy of the PEH filter
in constraining $r_{0}$, a comparison is made with a fit to the brightness
distribution of events. We apply both methods to a data stream containing a
background of Gaussian distributed false alarms. We find that the brightness
distribution yields lower standard errors, but is biased by the false alarms.
In comparison the PEH method is less prone to errors resulting from false
alarms but has a lower resolution as fewer events contribute to the data. Used
in combination, the PEH and brightness distribution methods provide an improved
estimate of the rate density.

of massive stars accompanying the QCD phase transition. We study how the phase
transition affects the gravitational waveforms near the epoch of core-bounce.
As for initial models, we change the strength of rotation and magnetic fields.
Particularly, the degree of differential rotation in the iron core (Fe-core) is
changed parametrically. As for the microphysics, we adopt a phenomenological
equation of state above the nuclear density, including two parameters to change
the hardness before the transition. We assume the first order phase transition,
where the conversion of bulk nuclear matter to a chirally symmetric quark-gluon
phase is described by the MIT bag model. Based on these computations, we find
that the phase transition can make the maximum amplitudes larger up to $\sim$
10 percents than the ones without the phase transition. On the other hand, the
maximum amplitudes become smaller up to $\sim$ 10 percents owing to the phase
transition, when the degree of the differential rotation becomes larger. We
find that even extremely strong magnetic fields $\sim 10^{17}$ G in the
protoneutron star do not affect these results.

INTEGRAL and archival Swift XRT observations and finally to characterize the
nature of this source using the optical/near-infrared (NIR) information
available through catalogue searches. Results: We report on 5 newly discovered
outbursts from IGR J18483-0311 detected by INTEGRAL.For two of them it was
possible to constrain a duration of the order of a few days. The strongest
outburst reached a peak flux of 120 mCrab (20--100 keV): its broad band
JEM--X/ISGRI spectrum (3--50 keV) is best fitted by an absorbed cutoff power
law with photon index=1.4+/-0.3, cutoff energy of ~22 keV and Nh ~9x10^22
cm^-2. Timing analysis of INTEGRAL data allowed us to identify periodicities of
18.52 days and 21.0526 seconds which are likely the orbital period of the
system and the spin period of the X-ray pulsar respectively. Swift XRT
observations of IGR J18483$-$0311 provided a very accurate source position
which strongly indicates a highly reddened star in the USNO--B1.0 and 2MASS
catalogues as its possible optical/NIR counterpart. Conclusions: The X-ray
spectral shape, the periods of 18.52 days and 21.0526 seconds, the high
intrinsic absorption, the location in the direction of the Scutum spiral arm
and the highly reddened optical object as possible counterpart, all favour the
hypothesis that IGR J18483-0311 is a HMXB with a neutron star as compact

the dark sector of cosmology violates the weak equivalence principle (WEP) on
cosmological scales, which implies a violation of the strong equivalence
principle for ordinary matter. In this paper, dark energy (DE) is shown to
result from the violation of WEP by pressureless (dark) matter. This allows us
to build a new cosmological framework in which general relativity (GR) is
satisfied at low scales, as WEP violation depends on the ratio of the ordinary
matter over dark matter densities, but at large scales, we obtain a general
relativity-like theory with a different value of the gravitational coupling.
This explanation is formulated in terms of a tensor-scalar theory of
gravitation without WEP for which there exists a revisited convergence
mechanism toward GR. The consequent DE mechanism build upon the anomalous
gravity of dark matter (i) does not require any violation of the strong energy
condition $p<-\rho c^2/3$, (ii) offers a natural way-out of the coincidence
problem thanks to the non-minimal couplings to gravitation, (iii) accounts
fairly for supernovae data from various very simple couplings and with density
parameters very close to the ones of the concordance model $\Lambda CDM$,
therefore suggesting an explanation to its remarkable adequacy. Finally, (iv)
this mechanism ends up in the future with an Einstein-de Sitter expansion
regime once the attractor is reached.

self-consistent treatment of a central intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), the
influence of this black hole on the morphological and physical properties of
globular clusters is investigated. In agreement with recent numerical studies,
it is found that a cluster (with mass M) hosting an IMBH (with mass M_BH)
shows, outside the region of gravitational influence of the black hole, a
core-like profile resembling a King profile with concentration c < 2, although
with a slightly steeper behaviour in the core region. In particular, the core
logarithmic slope is s < 0.25 for reasonably low IMBH masses (M_BH < M/100),
and c decreases monotonically with M_BH. Completely power-law density profiles
(similar to, for example, those of collapsed clusters) are admitted only in the
presence of a black hole with an unrealistic M_BH > M. The mass range estimate
12s - 4.8 < log (M_BH/M)< -1.1c - 0.69, depending on the morphological
parameters, is deduced by considering a wide range of models. Applying this
estimate to a set of 39 globular clusters, it is found that NGC 2808, NGC 6388,
M80, M13, M62, M54 and G1 (in M31) probably host an IMBH. For them, the scaling
laws M_BH ~ 0.09(M/M_sol)^{0.7} M_sol and M_BH ~ 50[sigma/ (km s^-1)]^{1.2}
M_sol are identified from weighted least-squares fits. An important result of
this 'collective' study is that a strong correlation exists between the
presence of an extreme blue horizontal branch and the presence of an IMBH. In
particular, the presence of a central IMBH in M13 and NGC 6388 could explain
why these clusters possess extreme horizontal-branch stars, in contrast to
their 'second parameter' counterparts M3 and 47 Tuc.

NGC3079 during eight epochs between 1999 and 2005 predominantly at 5GHz, but
covering the frequency range of 1.7GHz to 22GHz. Using our data and
observations going back to 1985, we find that the separation of two of the
three visible nuclear radio components underwent two decelerations. At the time
of these decelerations, the flux density of one of the components increased by
factors of five and two, respectively. We interpret these events as a radio jet
component undergoing compression, possibly as a result of a collision with ISM
material. This interpretation strongly supports the existence of jets
surrounded by a clumpy medium of dense clouds within the first few parsecs from
the central engine in NGC3079. Moreover, based on recently published
simulations of jet interactions with clumpy media, this scenario is able to
explain the nature of two additional regions of ageing synchrotron material
detected at the lower frequencies as by-products of such interactions, and also
the origin of the kpc-scale super bubble observed in NGC3079 as the result of
the spread of the momentum of the jets impeded from propagating freely. The
generalization of this scenario provides an explanation why jets in Seyfert
galaxies are not able to propagate to scales of kpc as do jets in radio-loud
AGN.

significant, classically-calculated cooling-flow, mass-deposition rate. The
upper envelope of the derived mass-deposition rate is roughly proportional to
the cluster mass, and the fraction of cooling core clusters is found to
decrease with it. The cooling core clusters are found to have smaller core
radii than non-cooling core clusters, while some non-cooling core clusters have
high $\beta$ values (> 0.8). In the relation of the X-ray luminosity vs. the
temperature and the mass, the cooling core clusters show a significantly higher
normalization. A systematic correlation analysis, also involving relations of
the gas mass and the total infrared luminosity, indicates that this bias is
shown to be mostly due to an enhanced X-ray luminosity for cooling core
clusters, while the other parameters, like temperature, mass, and gas mass may
be less affected by the occurrence of a cooling core. These results may be
explained by at least some of the non-cooling core clusters being in
dynamically young states compared with cooling core clusters, and they may turn
into cooling core clusters in a later evolutionary stage.

of the codes are based on destriping algorithm, whereas the other three are
implementations of a maximum-likelihood algorithm. Previous papers in the
series described simulations at 100 GHz (Poutanen et al. 2006) and 217 GHz
(Ashdown et al. 2006). In this paper we make maps (temperature and
polarisation) from the simulated one-year observations of four 30 GHz detectors
of Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI). We used Planck Level S simulation
pipeline to produce the observed time-ordered-data streams (TOD). Our previous
studies considered polarisation observations for the CMB only. For this paper
we increased the realism of the simulations and included polarized galactic
foregrounds to our sky model. Our simulated TODs comprised of dipole, CMB,
diffuse galactic emissions, extragalactic radio sources, and detector noise.
The strong subpixel signal gradients arising from the foreground signals couple
to the output map through the map-making and cause an error (signal error) in
the maps. Destriping codes have smaller signal error than the
maximum-likelihood codes. We examined a number of schemes to reduce this error.
On the other hand, the maximum-likelihood map-making codes can produce maps
with lower residual noise than destriping codes.

to perturbations which, for the values of the magnetic field strength
considered here, trigger quasi-periodic oscillations lasting for tens of
orbital periods. Overall, we have found that the dynamics of the magnetized

models. The spectral distribution of the eigenfrequencies of oscillation shows
the presence of a fundamental p mode and of a series of overtones in a harmonic
ratio 2:3:.... These simulations, therefore, extend the validity of the model

sequential memory retrieval in an associative memory model with auto- and weak

  coupling dynamics in supercooled liquids","7 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  We present a theoretical analysis of the dynamic structure factor (DSF) of a
liquid at and below the mode coupling critical temperature $T_c$, by developing
a self-consistent theoretical treatment which includes the contributions both
from continuous diffusion, described using general two coupling parameter
($F_{12}$) mode coupling theory (MCT), and from the activated hopping,
described using the random first order transition (RFOT) theory, incorporating
the effect of dynamical heterogeneity. The theory is valid over the whole
temperature plane and shows correct limiting MCT like behavior above $T_{c}$
and goes over to the RFOT theory near the glass transition temperature,
$T_{g}$. Between $T_{c}$ and $T_{g}$, the theory predicts that neither the
continuous diffusion, described by pure mode coupling theory, nor the hopping
motion alone suffices but both contribute to the dynamics while interacting
with each other. We show that the interplay between the two contributions
conspires to modify the relaxation behavior of the DSF from what would be
predicted by a theory with a complete static Gaussian barrier distribution in a
manner that may be described as a facilitation effect. Close to $T_c$, coupling
between the short time part of MCT dynamics and hopping reduces the stretching
given by the F$_{12}$-MCT theory significantly and accelerates structural
relaxation. As the temperature is progressively lowered below $T_c$, the
equations yield a crossover from MCT dominated regime to the hopping dominated
regime. In the combined theory the dynamical heterogeneity is modified because
the low barrier components interact with the MCT dynamics to enhance the
relaxation rate below $T_c$ and reduces the stretching that would otherwise
arise from an input static barrier height distribution.

also includes as its special cases the conventional product model as well as

(v/c= epsilon << 1). We show that dressed particle states exist (particles
surrounded by ``virtual photons''), which, up to terms of order (v/c)^3, follow
Hamiltonian dynamics. The effective N-particle Hamiltonian contains the kinetic
energies of the particles and Coulomb-like pair potentials at order (v/c)^0 and
the velocity dependent Darwin interaction and a mass renormalization at order
(v/c)^{2}. Beyond that order the effective dynamics are expected to be
dissipative.
  The main mathematical tool we use is adiabatic perturbation theory. However,
in the present case there is no eigenvalue which is separated by a gap from the
rest of the spectrum, but its role is taken by the bottom of the absolutely
continuous spectrum, which is not an eigenvalue.
  Nevertheless we construct approximate dressed electrons subspaces, which are
adiabatically invariant for the dynamics up to order (v/c)\sqrt{\ln
(v/c)^{-1}}. We also give an explicit expression for the non adiabatic
transitions corresponding to emission of free photons. For the radiated energy
we obtain the quantum analogue of the Larmor formula of classical

hundred years before Galileo. As we shall see, the problem is more subtle than
meets the eye -- even in a frictionless medium. Philoponus and Galileo are
right part of the time, and Aristotle is partly right some of the time. In fact
they are all wrong the rest of the time, with the lightest body falling fastest
when two bodies fall toward the earth. In principle the results of a free fall
experiment depend on whether falling masses originate on earth, are
extraterrestrial, are sequential or concurrent, or are simultaneous for
coincident or separated bodies, etc. When single falling bodies originate from
the earth, all bodies (light and heavy) fall at the same rate relative to the
earth in agreement with Galileo's view. Einstein's General Relativity (EGR), in
which gravity is due to space-time curvature, was motivated by the Galilean
notion that free-fall is independent of the mass and properties of a falling
body, and is just due to the properties of the milieu it finds itself in.
Quantum mechanics is found to violate the Equivalence Principle of EGR.

background processes are frequently performed in high energy physics (HEP),
gamma ray astronomy (GRA), and other branches of science. While there are
conceptual issues already when the mean rate of background is precisely known,
the issues are even more difficult when the mean background rate has
non-negligible uncertainty. After describing a variety of methods to be found
in the HEP and GRA literature, we consider in detail three classes of
algorithms and evaluate them over a wide range of parameter space, by the
criterion of how close the ensemble-average Type I error rate (rejection of the
background-only hypothesis when it is true) compares with the nominal
significance level given by the algorithm. We recommend wider use of an
algorithm firmly grounded in frequentist tests of the ratio of Poisson means,
although for very low counts the over-coverage can be severe due to the effect
of discreteness. We extend the studies of Cranmer, who found that a popular
Bayesian-frequentist hybrid can undercover severely when taken to high Z
values. We also examine the profile likelihood method, which has long been used
in GRA and HEP; it provides an excellent approximation in much of the parameter
space, as previously studied by Rolke and collaborators.

Einstein's distant clocks synchronization procedure. In our approach, imposing

Imposing the condition that it accounts for the time dilation relativistic
effect and taking into account the fact that due to the clock synchronization a

communication network at the societal level. We assign two weights on each edge
to reflect the strength of social interaction, which are the aggregate call
duration and the cumulative number of calls placed between the individuals over
a period of 18 weeks. We present a detailed analysis of this weighted network
by examining its degree, strength, and weight distributions, as well as its
topological assortativity and weighted assortativity, clustering and weighted
clustering, together with correlations between these quantities. We give an
account of motif intensity and coherence distributions and compare them to a
randomized reference system. We also use the concept of link overlap to measure
the number of common neighbors any two adjacent nodes have, which serves as a
useful local measure for identifying the interconnectedness of communities. We
report a positive correlation between the overlap and weight of a link, thus
providing strong quantitative evidence for the weak ties hypothesis, a central
concept in social network analysis. The percolation properties of the network
are found to depend on the type and order of removed links, and they can help
understand how the local structure of the network manifests itself at the
global level. We hope that our results will contribute to modeling weighted
large-scale social networks, and believe that the systematic approach followed
here can be adopted to study other weighted networks.

coastlines on the dynamics of the depth averaged Antarctic Circumpolar Current
(ACC), driven by wind and atmospheric pressure. This is achieved with the help
of a global barotropic circulation model, under idealized and real atmospheric
conditions.
  It is shown that the variability of meridional mass fluxes due to the
atmospheric conditions over the ACC can induce short-period density anomalies
in the Southern Ocean to the north in the vicinity of 47S, which can be
transferred to low latitudes by the wave mechanism described by Ivchenko et al.
2004, that could have significance with respect to rapid extra-tropical oceanic
links. The results of the barotropic modeling demonstrate that changes in wind
strength over the ACC, together with the effect of bottom topography and
coastlines, induce some meridional flow variability in the Southern Ocean, and
this meridional flux variability in the Pacific Ocean is anticorrelated with
the strength of the wind over the ACC. The possible link between the short-term
variations of the meridional flux in the Pacific sector and the ENSO events
(Southern Oscillation) is discussed.

increasingly common. Diverse aspects of metapopulation dynamics and management
have received attention in recent years. In particular, translocation of
individuals between subpopulations of a metapopulation is practiced, or
envisaged, for a variety of reasons and requires careful consideration.
Linklater (2003) proposed that the number of individuals of each sex
translocated into a target population for the purposes of maintaining genetic
diversity could be chosen on the basis of parental investment theory. In this
paper, following basic ideas in the parental investment literature, I propose a
simple model to capture Linklater's proposal and provide a thorough
mathematical analysis of the model. Granted the necessary species-specific
biological information which would determine the model parameters in any
instance of application, the analysis indicates that a practical algorithm can
be constructed to generate the model's predictions for the optimal
translocation.
