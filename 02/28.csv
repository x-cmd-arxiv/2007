sample of 17 short duration GRBs with prompt X-ray follow-up. I find that 80%
of the bursts exhibit a linear correlation between their gamma-ray fluence and
the afterglow X-ray flux normalized to t=1 d, a proxy for the kinetic energy of
the blast wave ($F_{X,1}~F_{gamma}^1.01). An even tighter correlation is
evident between E_{gamma,iso} and L_{X,1} for the subset of 13 bursts with
measured or constrained redshifts. The remaining 20% of the bursts have values
of F_{X,1}/F_{gamma} that are suppressed by about three orders of magnitude,
likely because of low circumburst densities (Nakar 2007). These results have
several important implications: (i) The X-ray luminosity is generally a robust
proxy for the blast wave kinetic energy, indicating nu_X>nu_c and hence a
circumburst density n>0.05 cm^{-3}; (ii) most short GRBs have a narrow range of
gamma-ray efficiency, with <epsilon_{gamma}>~0.85 and a spread of 0.14 dex; and
(iii) the isotropic-equivalent energies span 10^{48}-10^{52} erg. Furthermore,
I find tentative evidence for jet collimation in the two bursts with the
highest E_{gamma,iso}, perhaps indicative of the same inverse correlation that
leads to a narrow distribution of true energies in long GRBs. I find no clear
evidence for a relation between the overall energy release and host galaxy
type, but a positive correlation with duration may be present, albeit with a
large scatter. Finally, I note that the outlier fraction of 20% is similar to
the proposed fraction of short GRBs from dynamically-formed neutron star
binaries in globular clusters. This scenario may naturally explain the
bimodality of the F_{X,1}/F_{gamma} distribution and the low circumburst
densities without invoking speculative kick velocities of several hundred km/s.

constraining choice of priors. The HST/GOODS data exhibit a slight (about
$1\sigma$ significance) preference for $w>-1$ at $z\sim 0.5$ and a drift
towards $w>-1$ at larger redshifts, which however is not robust with respect to
changes in our prior specifications. We employ both a constant equation of

only mildly dependent on this choice at high redshifts.

The PDF of the temperature fluctuations has a long tail. More than 70% power of
the SZ effect temperature fluctuations attributes to top $\sim 1%$ wavelet
modes (long tail events). On the other hand, the CMB temperature fluctuations
basically are Gaussian. Although the mean power of CMB temperature fluctuations
on sub-degree scales is much higher than that of SZ effect map, the SZ effect
temperature fluctuations associated with top 2MASS clusters is comparable to
the power of CMB temperature fluctuations on the same scales. Thus, from noisy
WMAP maps, one can have a proper estimation of the SZ effect power at the
positions of the top 2MASS clusters. The power spectrum given by these top
wavelet modes is useful to constrain the parameter of density fluctuations
amplitude $\sigma_8$. We find that the power spectrum of these top wavelet
modes of SZ effect on sub-degree scales basically is consistent with the
simulation maps produced with $\sigma_8=0.84$. The simulation samples of
$\sigma_8=0.74$ show, however, significant deviation from detected SZ power

have the magnitudes and orientations, with respect to the Galactic plane, that
are needed to make the large scale power in cut-sky maps surprisingly small.
Our analysis shows that most of the large scale power of the observed CMB

sky). One of them is a cold spot within ~40 degrees of the Galactic center and
the other one is a hot spot in the vicinity of the Gum Nebula. If the current

We show that the SZ background provides a significant background for SZ cluster

masses in a cosmology-dependent way, where confusion is defined as typical
errors in recovered flux larger than 20%. The confusion limit, corresponds to
the mass at which there are roughly ten clusters per square degree, with this
number nearly independent of cosmology and cluster gas physics. Typical errors
grow quickly as lower mass objects are included in the catalog.
  We also point out that there is nothing in particular about the rms of the
filtered map that makes it especially well-suited for capturing aspects of the
SZ effect, and other indicators of the one-point SZ probability distribution
function are at least as well suited for the task. For example, the full width
at half maximum of the one point probability distribution has a field-to-field
scatter that is about 60% that of the rms.

from the far-infrared through millimeter parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Because of the large range of wavelengths for which such detectors are
applicable, the number of modes supported by a pixel will vary according to the
specific application of a given available technology. We study the dependence
of image fidelity and induced polarization on the size of the pixel by
employing a formalism in which diffraction due to the pixel boundary is treated
by propagating the second-order statistical correlations of the radiation field
through a model optical system. We construct polarized beam pattern images of
square pixels for various ratios of p/\lambda where p is the pixel size and
\lambda is the wavelength of the radiation under consideration. For the limit
in which few modes are supported by the pixel (p/\lambda<1), we find that the
diffraction due to the pixel edges is non-negligible and hence must be
considered along with the telescope diffraction pattern in modeling the
ultimate spatial resolution of an imaging system. For the case in which the
pixel is over-moded (p/\lambda>1), the geometric limit is approached as
expected. This technique gives a quantitative approach to optimize the imaging
properties of arrays of planar detectors in the few-mode limit.

orbit (60 days) and a long-period one (about 4.5 years), so this star is a
triple system. The following orbital elements are obtained: (1) for the

B1508+55 are typical for a non-recycled pulsar, which implies that the velocity
of the pulsar cannot have originated from the second supernova disruption of a
massive binary system. The high velocity of PSR B1508+55 can be accounted for
by assuming that it received a kick at birth or that the neutron star was
accelerated after its formation in the supernova explosion. We propose an
explanation for the origin of hyperfast neutron stars based on the hypothesis
that they could be the remnants of a symmetric supernova explosion of a
high-velocity massive star which attained its peculiar velocity (similar to
that of the pulsar) in the course of a strong dynamical three- or four-body
encounter in the core of dense young star cluster. To check this hypothesis we
investigated three dynamical processes involving close encounters between: (i)
two hard massive binaries, (ii) a hard binary and an intermediate-mass black
hole, and (iii) a single star and a hard binary intermediate-mass black hole.
We find that main-sequence O-type stars cannot be ejected from young massive
star clusters with peculiar velocities high enough to explain the origin of
hyperfast neutron stars, but lower mass main-sequence stars or the stripped
helium cores of massive stars could be accelerated to hypervelocities. Our
explanation for the origin of hyperfast pulsars requires a very dense stellar
environment of the order of 10^6 -10^7 stars pc^{-3}. Although such high
densities may exist during the core collapse of young massive star clusters, we
caution that they have never been observed.

1/3 of thermally unstable gas (T ~2600 K). The WNM gas is mildly supersonic

closer to what would be expected for CNM gas. This field contains a signature

with the predicted instrument response obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations
using the GEANT 4 INTEGRAL mass model. The chi^2 distribution between the real
and simulated data as a function of the percentage polarisation and
polarisation angle was calculated for all three energy ranges. The degree of
linear polarisation in the brightest pulse of duration 66s was found to be
63+/-31% at an angle of 70+/-14 degrees in the 100-350keV energy range. The
degree of polarisation was also constrained in the brightest 12s of the GRB and
a polarisation fraction of 96+/-40% at an angle of 60+/-14 degrees was
determined over the same energy range. However, despite extensive analysis and
simulations, a systematic effect that could mimic the weak polarisation signal
could not be definitively excluded. Our results over several energy ranges and
time intervals are consistent with a polarisation signal of about 60% at a low
level of significance (2 sigma). We conclude that the procedure described here
demonstrates the effectiveness of using SPI as a polarimeter, and is a viable
method of measuring polarisation levels in intense gamma--ray bursts.

flux and power ~ 50 mJy and ~ 10^{24} W/Hz, respectively, an order of magnitude
improvement as compared to previously published (radio-selected) blazar
samples. DXRBS FSRQ are seen to evolve strongly, up to redshift ~ 1.5, above
which high-power sources show a decline in their comoving space density. DXRBS
BL Lacs, on the other hand, do not evolve. High-energy (HBL) and low-energy
(LBL) peaked BL Lacs share the same lack of cosmological evolution, which is at
variance with some previous results. The observed luminosity functions are in
good agreement with the predictions of unified schemes, with FSRQ getting close

Finally, the relative numbers of HBL and LBL in the radio and X-ray bands are

fundamental heterogeneity in lens galaxies present in groups. Our goal is to
see if a variety of group interactions between the most massive group members
can result in significant changes in the galaxy density profiles over the scale
probed by strong lensing (<15 kpc). While stripping of the outer parts of the
halo can be expected, the impact on inner regions where the luminous component
is important is less clear in the context of lensing, though still crucial, as
a steepened density profile within this inner region allows these lens systems
to be consistent with current HST/WMAP estimates on H_0. We employ the
particle-mesh code SUPERBOX to carry out the group interaction simulations. We
simulate interactions between group members, comparing the density profile for
the satellite before and after interaction for the mass range of 10^11 to 10^13
M_sun. Our investigations show a significant steepening of the density profile
in the region of < 5-20 kpc, i.e. that which dominates strong lensing in lens
galaxies. Additionally, the steepening in the inner region is transient in
nature, with consecutive interactions returning the profile to an isothermal
state within a timeframe of ~ 0.5 - 2.0 Gyr. This factor may help explain why
lens galaxies that produce lower values of H_0 (i.e. those with possibly
steeper profiles) are far fewer in number than those which agree with both the
HST key project value for H_0 and isothermality, since one would have to
observe the lens galaxy during this transient steepened phase.

periodicity of the resulting lattice could make individual addressing of the
atoms via an external laser feasible. We develop a Bose-Hubbard-like model for

analytically using the Kibble-Zurek theory. We show that the time scale for the

transition to a four sublattice Neel ordered state at a temperature near 1 K.
Despite the seemingly conventional nature of the ordered state, the specific
heat has been found to be described in the temperature range 350-800 mK by an
anomalous T-squared power law. A similar temperature dependence has also been
reported for Gd2Ti2O7, another pyrochlore Heisenberg material. Such anomalous
T-squared behavior in Cv has been argued to be correlated to an unusual
energy-dependence of the density of states which also seemingly manifests
itself in low-temperature spin fluctuations found in muon spin relaxation
experiments. In this paper, we report calculations of Cv that consider spin
wave like excitations out of the Neel order observed in Gd2Sn2O7 and argue that
the parametric T-squared behavior does not reflect the true low-energy
excitations of Gd2Sn2O7. Rather, we find that the low-energy excitations of
this material are antiferromagnetic magnons gapped by single-ion and dipolar
anisotropy effects, and that the lowest temperature of 350 mK considered in
previous specific heat measurements accidentally happens to coincide with a
crossover temperature below which magnons become thermally activated and Cv
takes an exponential form. We argue that further specific heat measurements
that extend down to at least 100 mK are required in order to ascribe an
unconventional description of magnetic excitations out of the ground state of
Gd2Sn2O7 or to invalidate the standard picture of gapped excitations proposed
herein.

electron number, N<=20, and electron gas parameter, r_s<18, using the diffusion
quantum Monte Carlo technique. Features associated with correlation appear to
develop very differently in quantum dots than in bulk. The main reason is that
translational symmetry is necessarily broken in a dot, leading to density
modulation and inhomogeneity. Electron-electron interactions act to enhance
this modulation ultimately leading to localization. This process appears to be
completely smooth and occurs over a wide range of density. Thus there is a
broad regime of ``incipient'' Wigner crystallization in these quantum dots. Our
specific conclusions are: (i) The density develops sharp rings while the pair
density shows both radial and angular inhomogeneity. (ii) The spin of the
ground state is consistent with Hund's (first) rule throughout our entire range
of r_s for all 4<N<20. (iii) The addition energy curve first becomes smoother
as interactions strengthen -- the mesoscopic fluctuations are damped by
correlation -- and then starts to show features characteristic of the classical
addition energy. (iv) Localization effects are stronger for a smaller number of
electrons. (v) Finally, the gap to certain spin excitations becomes small at
the strong interaction (large r_s) side of our regime.

medium and carries an appreciable amount of electric and magnetic
susceptibilities. The dielectric effect grows rapidly with increasing filling
factor nu in such a way that reflects the 'relativistic' Landau-level
characteristics of graphene as well as its valley and spin degeneracy. A close
look into the dielectric function also reveals that the Coulomb interaction is
efficiently screened on the scale of the magnetic length, leading to a
prominent reduction of the exciton spectra in graphene. In addition, an
effective gauge theory of graphene is constructed out of the response. It is
pointed out thereby that the electric susceptibility is generally expressed as

displacements). We show that the compaction process has many characteristics
which are reminiscent of the slow dynamics of glass forming systems, as
previously suggested. For instance the mean volume fraction slowly increases in

allow secondary users to independently search for and exploit instantaneous
spectrum availability. Integrated in the joint design are three basic
components: a spectrum sensor that identifies spectrum opportunities, a sensing
strategy that determines which channels in the spectrum to sense, and an access
strategy that decides whether to access based on imperfect sensing outcomes.
  We formulate the joint PHY-MAC design of OSA as a constrained partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Constrained POMDPs generally
require randomized policies to achieve optimality, which are often intractable.
By exploiting the rich structure of the underlying problem, we establish a
separation principle for the joint design of OSA. This separation principle
reveals the optimality of myopic policies for the design of the spectrum sensor
and the access strategy, leading to closed-form optimal solutions. Furthermore,
decoupling the design of the sensing strategy from that of the spectrum sensor
and the access strategy, the separation principle reduces the constrained POMDP
to an unconstrained one, which admits deterministic optimal policies. Numerical
examples are provided to study the design tradeoffs, the interaction between
the spectrum sensor and the sensing and access strategies, and the robustness
of the ensuing design to model mismatch.

work on how to construct good perfect hash functions, there is a gap between
theory and practice among all previous methods on minimal perfect hashing. On
one side, there are good theoretical results without experimentally proven
practicality for large key sets. On the other side, there are the theoretically
analyzed time and space usage algorithms that assume that truly random hash
functions are available for free, which is an unrealistic assumption. In this
paper we attempt to bridge this gap between theory and practice, using a number
of techniques from the literature to obtain a novel scheme that is
theoretically well-understood and at the same time achieves an
order-of-magnitude increase in performance compared to previous ``practical''
methods. This improvement comes from a combination of a novel, theoretically
optimal perfect hashing scheme that greatly simplifies previous methods, and
the fact that our algorithm is designed to make good use of the memory
hierarchy. We demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm by considering a set
of over one billion URLs from the World Wide Web of average length 64, for
which we construct a minimal perfect hash function on a commodity PC in a
little more than 1 hour. Our scheme produces minimal perfect hash functions
using slightly more than 3 bits per key. For perfect hash functions in the
range $\{0,...,2n-1\}$ the space usage drops to just over 2 bits per key (i.e.,
one bit more than optimal for representing the key). This is significantly
below of what has been achieved previously for very large values of $n$.

exactly the same probability distribution as the covertext. Then no statistical
test can reliably detect the presence of the hidden message. We refer to such
steganographic schemes as perfectly secure. A few such schemes have been
proposed in recent literature, but they have vanishing rate. We prove that
communication performance can potentially be vastly improved; specifically, our
basic setup assumes independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
covertext, and we construct perfectly secure steganographic codes from public
watermarking codes using binning methods and randomized permutations of the
code. The permutation is a secret key shared between encoder and decoder. We
derive (positive) capacity and random-coding exponents for perfectly-secure
steganographic systems. The error exponents provide estimates of the code
length required to achieve a target low error probability. We address the
potential loss in communication performance due to the perfect-security
requirement. This loss is the same as the loss obtained under a weaker order-1
steganographic requirement that would just require matching of first-order
marginals of the covertext and stegotext distributions. Furthermore, no loss
occurs if the covertext distribution is uniform and the distortion metric is
cyclically symmetric; steganographic capacity is then achieved by randomized
linear codes. Our framework may also be useful for developing computationally
secure steganographic systems that have near-optimal communication performance.

  Sampling Method",,,,"cs.CE cs.NA",,"  The first passage time (FPT) problem is ubiquitous in many applications. In
finance, we often have to deal with stochastic processes with jump-diffusion,
so that the FTP problem is reducible to a stochastic differential equation with
jump-diffusion. While the application of the conventional Monte-Carlo procedure
is possible for the solution of the resulting model, it becomes computationally
inefficient which severely restricts its applicability in many practically
interesting cases. In this contribution, we focus on the development of
efficient Monte-Carlo-based computational procedures for solving the FPT
problem under the multivariate (and correlated) jump-diffusion processes. We
also discuss the implementation of the developed Monte-Carlo-based technique
for multivariate jump-diffusion processes driving by several compound Poisson
shocks. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the developed methodologies
for analyzing the default rates and default correlations of differently rated

satisfaction and constraint optimization problems. A wide variety of
specialized global constraints provide critical assistance in achieving a good
model that can take advantage of the structure of the problem in the search for

constraints that do not have an inherent combinatorial nature, and hence are
not modeled well using narrowly specialized global constraints. We attempt to
address this issue by considering a hybrid of search and compilation.
Specifically we suggest the use of Reduced Ordered Multi-Valued Decision
Diagrams (ROMDDs) as the supporting data structure for a generic global
constraint. We give an algorithm for maintaining generalized arc consistency
(GAC) on this constraint that amortizes the cost of the GAC computation over a
root-to-leaf path in the search tree without requiring asymptotically more
space than used for the MDD. Furthermore we present an approach for
incrementally maintaining the reduced property of the MDD during the search,
and show how this can be used for providing domain entailment detection.

this implies for the very general singularities that arise according to the

overview of the current status of singularities in classical and quantum

theorems. This suggests possible routes for quantum gravity to evade the
devastating conclusion of the theorems by different means, including modified

theorem. Retaining Ryan's restriction to nearly circular and nearly equatorial
orbits, and dropping the assumption of no tidal coupling, we prove that
Thorne's conjecture is nearly fully correct: the waves encode not only the
central body's metric but also the evolving orbital elements and (in a sense
slightly different from Thorne's conjecture) the evolving tidal coupling.

bosons. In this paper, we examine the process t tbar -> W_L W_L in a family of
phenomenologically-viable deconstructed Higgsless models and we show that scale
of unitarity violation depends on the mass of the additional vector-like
fermion states that occur in these theories (the states that are the
deconstructed analogs of Kaluza-Klein partners of the ordinary fermions in a
five-dimensional theory). For sufficiently light vector fermions, and for a
deconstructed theory with sufficiently many lattice sites (that is,
sufficiently close to the continuum limit), the Appelquist-Chanowitz bound can
be substantially weakened. More precisely, we find that, as one varies the mass
of the vector-like fermion for fixed top-quark and gauge-boson masses, the
bound on the scale of top-quark mass generation interpolates smoothly between
the Appelquist-Chanowitz bound and one that can, potentially, be much higher.
In these theories, therefore, the bound on the scale of fermion mass generation
is independent of the bound on the scale of gauge-boson mass generation. While
our analysis focuses on deconstructed Higgsless models, any theory in which
top-quark mass generation proceeds via the mixing of chiral and vector fermions

effects of clouds of virtual particles. The effective weak charge can be
calculated by starting with the measured weak coupling at the Z-pole and
""running"" the coupling to lower energy or, equivalently, longer distances.
Because the ""electroweak radiative corrections"" or ""loop diagrams"" which give
rise to the running depend not only on known particles, but on particles which
have not yet been discovered, a difference between the calculated and measured
weak charges may signal new physics. A measurement of Qweak to 4% will be
sensitive to new physics at the few TeV scale. The Qweak experiment is based on
the fact that the parity-violating longitudinal analyzing power, Az, in
electron-proton scattering at low momentum transfer and small scattering angle,
is proportional to the proton's weak charge. The experiment plans to measure
the predicted Az of -0.3 ppm with a combined statistical and systematic
uncertainty of 2.2%, corresponding to a total uncertainty of 4% of Qweak. This
requires a statistical precision of 5 x 10^-9, which can be achieved in 2200
hours with an 85% polarized, 180 microamp electron beam incident on a 0.35 m
liquid hydrogen target. A synchronous data acquisition system will integrate
the detector current signals over each spin state and extract the helicity

inflation. The initial conditions for the cosmological fluctuations are
thermal. This is to be contrasted with the situation in models of inflation in
which the accelerated expansion of space is driven by the potential energy of a
scalar field, and in which the fluctuations are of quantum vacuum type. We find
that, in the limit that the expansion of space is almost exponential, the
spectrum of fluctuations is scale-invariant with a slight red tilt. The
magnitude of the tilt is different from what is obtained in a usual

algebra of (pseudo)differential operators one uses the Weyl algebra (operators
with Weyl symbols) with the Moyal *-product. Section 1, devoted to quantum
mechanics, contains a closed mathematical description of the Maslov--Shvedov
method in the theory of Schrodinger equation, including the method of canonical
operator. In particular, it contains a new simple definition of the Maslov

logically self-consistent exposition of the main results of perturbative
quantum field theory not using the subtraction of infinities from the quantum

result (dynamical evolution in quantum field theory in quasiclassical
approximation) close to the Maslov--Shvedov quantum field theory complex germ.

prove that the global stable sets are C^1 immersed (codimension one)

corollary, we deduce that in generic, one-parameter families of C^r unimodal

Floer homology is taken with respect to a Hamiltonian H: S^1 x T^*M --> R,
which is quadratic near infinity. Z(T^*M) is constructed assuming a basic
smooth gluing result of J-holomorphic cylinders. This spectrum will have a C.W
decomposition with one cell for every periodic solution of the equation defined

alternative partitions of the root system. Although significant inroads have
been made, much of the classical machinery is inapplicable in this broader
context, and some fundamental questions remain unanswered. In particular, the
structure of the reducible objects in non-classical theories has not yet been
fully understood. This question is addressed here for affine sl(2), which has a
unique non-classical highest-weight theory, termed ""imaginary"". The reducible
Verma modules in the imaginary theory possess an infinite descending series,
with all factors isomorphic to a certain canonically associated module, the
structure of which depends upon the highest weight. If the highest weight is
non-zero, then this factor module is irreducible, and conversely. This paper
examines the degeneracy of the factor module of highest-weight zero. The
intricate structure of this module is understood via a realization in terms of
the symmetric functions. The realization permits the description of a family of
singular (critical) vectors, and the classification of the irreducible
subquotients. The irreducible subquotients are characterized as those modules

structure called string topology. They proved that H_*(LX) is naturally a
Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) algebra. There are several conjectures connecting the
string topology BV algebra with algebraic structures on the Hochschild
cohomology of algebras related to the manifold X, but none of them has been
verified for manifolds of dimension n>1.
  In this work we study string topology in the case when X is aspherical (i.e.
its homotopy groups \pi_i(X) vanish for i > 1). In this case the Hochschild
cohomology Gerstenhaber algebra HH^*(A) of the group algebra A of the
fundamental group of X has a BV structure. Our main result is a theorem
establishing a natural isomorphism between the Hochschild cohomology BV algebra
HH^*(A) and the string topology BV algebra H_*(LX). In particular, for a closed
oriented surface X of hyperbolic type we obtain a complete description of the
BV algebra operations on H_*(LX) and HH^*(A) in terms of the Goldman bracket of
loops on X. The only manifolds for which the BV algebra structure on H_*(LX)
was known before were spheres and complex Stiefel manifolds.

  69-84",,,"math.ST stat.TH",,"  In the analysis of poverty and social exclusion, indicators of living
conditions are some interesting non-monetary complements to the usual
measurements in terms of current or annual income. Living conditions depend in
fact on longer term factors than income, and provide further information on
households' actual resources that allow to compare more accurately between
living standards. But in counterpart, a difficulty comes from the qualitative
nature of the information, and the large number of dimensions and items that
may be taken into account; in other words, living conditions are difficult to
""measure"". A consequence is that very often, the information is either used
only partly, or reduced into a global score of (bad) living conditions, that
results from counting ""negative"" items, and the qualitative dimension is lost.
In this paper, we propose to use the Kohonen algorithm first to describe how
the elements of living conditions are combined, and secondly to classify
households according to their living conditions. The main interest of a
classification is to make appear not only quantitative differences in the
""levels"" of living conditions, but also qualitative differences within similar
""levels"".

eliminated by Taguchi's strategy. They proposed an alternative method in which
the slid factors are modeled by nested effects. In this work we show the
inadequacy of both methods when the objective is response prediction. We
propose an analysis method based on a response surface model, and demonstrate
its superiority for prediction. We also study the relationships between these

been possible in recent years to characterize Steiner t-designs, that is
t-(v,k,1) designs, mainly for t = 2, admitting groups of automorphisms with
sufficiently strong symmetry properties. However, despite the finite simple
group classification, for Steiner t-designs with t > 2 most of these
characterizations have remained longstanding challenging problems. Especially,
the determination of all flag-transitive Steiner t-designs with 2 < t < 7 is of
particular interest and has been open for about 40 years (cf. [11, p. 147] and
[12, p. 273], but presumably dating back to 1965). The present paper continues

Algebra 37 (2009), no. 4, 1428-1444",,,"math.GR",,"  The decomposition theorem for torsion abelian groups holds analogously for
torsion commutative diassociative loops. With this theorem in mind, we
investigate commutative diassociative loops satisfying the additional condition
(trivially satisfied in the abelian group case) that all $n$th powers are
central, for a fixed $n$. For $n=2$, we get precisely commutative $C$ loops.
For $n=3$, a prominent variety is that of commutative Moufang loops.
  Many analogies between commutative C and Moufang loops have been noted in the
literature, often obtained by interchanging the role of the primes 2 and 3. We
show that the correct encompassing variety for these two classes of loops is
the variety of commutative RIF loops. In particular, when $Q$ is a commutative
RIF loop: all squares in $Q$ are Moufang elements, all cubes are $C$ elements,
Moufang elements of $Q$ form a normal subloop $M_0(Q)$ such that $Q/M_0(Q)$ is
a C loop of exponent 2 (a Steiner loop), C elements of $L$ form a normal
subloop $C_0(Q)$ such that $Q/C_0(Q)$ is a Moufang loop of exponent 3. Since
squares (resp. cubes) are central in commutative C (resp. Moufang) loops, it
follows that $Q$ modulo its center is of exponent 6. Returning to the
decomposition theorem, we find that every torsion, commutative RIF loop is a
direct product of a C 2-loop, a Moufang 3-loop, and an abelian group with each
element of order prime to 6.
  We also discuss Moufang elements, and a class of quasigroups associated with
commutative RIF loops.

acyclic by removing as few links as possible and thus altering the original
graph in the least possible way. Practically in all applications the exact
solution of this problem requires an enumeration of all combinations of removed
links, which is computationally intractable. We introduce and compare two
algorithms: the deterministic, 'greedy' algorithm that preferentially cuts the
links that participate in the largest number of feedback cycles, and the
probabilistic one based on a simulated annealing of a hierarchical layout of
the network which minimizes the number of ``backward'' links going from lower
to higher hierarchical levels. We find that the annealing algorithm outperforms
the deterministic one in terms of speed, memory requirement, and the actual
number of removed links. Implications for system biology and directions for
further research are discussed.

  Qualitative Abstractions",,,,,"q-bio.QM",,"  The switch-like character of gene regulation has motivated the use of hybrid,
discrete-continuous models of genetic regulatory networks. While powerful
techniques for the analysis, verification, and control of hybrid systems have
been developed, the specificities of the biological application domain pose a
number of challenges, notably the absence of quantitative information on
parameter values and the size and complexity of networks of biological
interest. We introduce a method for the analysis of reachability properties of
genetic regulatory networks that is based on a class of discontinuous
piecewise-affine (PA) differential equations well-adapted to the above
constraints. More specifically, we introduce a hyperrectangular partition of
the state space that forms the basis for a discrete abstraction preserving the
sign of the derivatives of the state variables. The resulting discrete
transition system provides a conservative approximation of the qualitative
dynamics of the network and can be efficiently computed in a symbolic manner
from inequality constraints on the parameters. The method has been implemented
in the computer tool Genetic Network Analyzer (GNA), which has been applied to
the analysis of a regulatory system whose functioning is not well-understood by
biologists, the nutritional stress response in the bacterium Escherichia coli.

networks (up to a few tens of nodes), e.g. the activities of cell-cycle
proteins during the mitotic cell-cycle progression. Using the framework of
deterministic discrete dynamical models, we characterize the dynamical
modifications in response to structural perturbations in the network
connectivities. In particular, we focus on how perturbations affect the set of
fixed points and sizes of the basins of attraction. Our approach uses two
analytical measures: the basin entropy $H$ and the perturbation size $\Delta$,
a quantity that reflects the distance between the set of fixed points of the
perturbed network to that of the unperturbed network. Applying our approach to
the yeast-cell cycle network introduced by Li \textit{et al.} provides a low
dimensional and informative fingerprint of network behavior under large classes
of perturbations. We identify interactions that are crucial for proper network
function, and also pinpoints functionally redundant network connections.
Selected perturbations exemplify the breadth of dynamical responses in this
cell-cycle model.
