systems HDE 245770 = A 0535+26 and X Per. We use the H-alpha equivalent widths
together with adopted values of the Be star effective temperature, disk
inclination, and disk outer boundary to determine the half-maximum emission
radius of the disk as a function of time. The observations of HDE 245770
document the rapid spectral variability that apparently accompanied the
regeneration of a new circumstellar disk. This disk grew rapidly during the
years 1998 - 2000, but then slowed in growth in subsequent years. The outer
disk radius is probably truncated by resonances between the disk gas and
neutron star orbital periods. Two recent X-ray outbursts appear to coincide
with the largest disk half-maximum emission radius attained over the last
decade. Our observations of X Per indicate that its circumstellar disk has
recently grown to near record proportions, and concurrently the system has
dramatically increased in X-ray flux, presumably the result of enhanced mass
accretion from the disk. We find that the H-alpha half-maximum emission radius
of the disk surrounding X Per reached a size about six times larger than the
stellar radius, a value, however, that is well below the minimum separation
between the Be star and neutron star. We suggest that spiral arms excited by
tidal interaction at periastron may help lift disk gas out to radii where
accretion by the neutron star companion becomes more effective.

group, using HST and multi-colour Calar Alto observations. Various approaches
are used to visualize the two known peculiar components, the so-called inner
component (IC) and the elongated component (EC), on the HST images. The methods
were checked in detail using synthetical images from simulated galaxies. For
the first time, we make the IC as well as the inner part of the EC visible on
direct images. The results confirm both the bar-like appearance of the inner EC
and the quasi-elliptical shape of the IC. The IC resembles an inclined disk
where the surface brightness becomes successively shallower towards the centre
compared to an exponential profile. The orientation of the inner part of the EC
is perpendicular to the major axis of the IC. The broad-band colour indices are
shown to be in agreement with model predictions for a 5 to 7 Gyr old stellar
population of quasi-solar metallicity. No significant large-scale variations of
the colour indices over the main body of the galaxy are found. We discuss the
previously reported colour gradients close to the nucleus and argue that the
most plausible explanation is reddening by small amounts of dust though
unsharpe masked HST images do not provide significant hints for clumpy dust.
According to the episodic dust settling scenario suggested by Lauer et al
(2005), the very low dust fraction indicates that NGC3384 is in a post-activity
phase and at the beginning of a new dust-settling cycle.

an insensitivity to systematic effects, is needed to reach the lowest value
allowed by particle physics experiments. We consider the prospects of
determining both the neutrino mass scale and the number of of massive neutrinos
using future redshift surveys, specifically those undertaken with the Square
Kilometre Array (SKA), with and without additional constraints from the
upcoming Planck CMB experiment. If the sum of the neutrino masses $\sum m_i
\gtsimeq 0.25 ~ \rm eV$ then the imprint of neutrinos on large-scale structure
(LSS) should be enough, on its own, to establish the neutrino mass scale and,
considered alongside CMB constraints, it will also determine the number of
massive neutrinos $N_{\nu}$, and hence the mass hierarchy. If $\sum m_i \sim
0.05 ~ \rm eV$, at the bottom end of the allowed range, then a combination of
LSS, CMB and particle physics constraints should be able to determine $\sum
m_i$, $N_{\nu}$ and the hierarchy. If $\sum m_i$ is in the specific range
$0.1-0.25 ~ \rm eV$, then a combination of LSS, CMB and particle physics

Once an SKA-like LSS survey is available there are good prospects of obtaining
a full understanding of the conventional neutrino sector, and a chance of
finding evidence for sterile neutrinos.

As with other such groups, the
age is important for understanding of several key questions. It is important,
for example, in establishing the origin of the group and also in comparative
studies of the properties of planetary systems, eventually surrounding some of
the AB Dor group members, with those existing in other groups. For AB Dor two
rather different estimates for its age have been proposed: a first one, of the
order of 50 Myr, by Zuckerman and coworkers from a comparison with
Tucana/Horologium moving group and a second one of about 100-125 Myr by Luhman
and coworkers from color-magnitude diagrams (CMD). Using this last value and
the closeness in velocity space of AB Dor and the Pleiades galactic cluster,
Luhman and coworkers suggested coevality for these systems. Because strictly
speaking such a closeness does not still guarantee coevality, here we address
this problem by computing and comparing the full 3D orbits of AB Dor, Pleiades,
alpha Persei and IC 2602. The latter two open clusters have estimated ages of
about 85-90 Myr and 50 Myr. The resulting age 119 $\pm$ 20 Myr is consistent
with AB Dor and Pleiades being coeval. Our solution and the scenario of open
cluster formation proposed by Kroupa and collaborators suggest that the AB Dor
moving group may be identified with the expanding subpopulation (Group I)
present in this scenario. We also discuss other related aspects as iron and
lithium abundances, eventual stellar mass segregation during the formation of
the systems and possible fraction of debris discs in AB Dor group.

distinct classes of signals: (a) detections, typically with S/N > 6.5; (b) high
velocity clouds in the Milky Way or its periphery; and (c) signals of lower S/N

these bursts, is short lived and that its source is distinct from that of the
ensuing, long-lived afterglow. Using these data, we determine the distance of
the gamma-ray source from the center of the explosion. We find this distance to
be 1e15-1e16 cm for most bursts and we show that this is within a factor of ten
of the radius of the shock-heated circumstellar medium (CSM) producing the

we show that the prompt gamma-ray emission cannot be produced in internal
shocks, nor can it be produced in the external shock; in a more general sense
gamma-ray generation mechanisms based on shock physics have problems explaining
the GRB data for the ten Swift bursts analyzed in this work. A magnetic field
dominated outflow model for GRBs has some attractive features, although the
evidence in its favor is inconclusive. Finally, the x-ray and optical data

quantitatively the physical processes that are involved in the desorption

desorption (TPD) data. This information is used to simulate the behavior of
CO-O2 ices under astrophysical conditions. The TPD spectra have been recorded
under ultra high vacuum conditions for pure, layered and mixed morphologies for
different thicknesses, temperatures and mixing ratios. An empirical kinetic
model is used to interpret the results and to provide input parameters for
astrophysical models. Binding energies are determined for different ice
morphologies. Independent of the ice morphology, the desorption of O2 is found
to follow 0th-order kinetics. Binding energies and temperature-dependent
sticking probabilities for CO-CO, O2-O2 and CO-O2 are determined. O2 is
slightly less volatile than CO, with binding energies of 912+-15 versus 858+-15
K for pure ices. In mixed and layered ices, CO does not co-desorb with O2 but
its binding energies are slightly increased compared with pure ice whereas
those for O2 are slightly decreased. Lower limits to the sticking probabilities
of CO and O2 are 0.9 and 0.85, respectively, at temperatures below 20K. The
balance between accretion and desorption is studied for O2 and CO in
astrophysically relevant scenarios. Only minor differences are found between
the two species, i.e., both desorb between 16 and 18K in typical environments

the signatures of nearby substructure. We explore the prospects for the
detection of these features by the GLAST satellite and find that, if ~10% or

dark matter annihilations, then GLAST should be sensitive to anisotropies at
the sub-percent level. Such precision would be sufficient to detect many, if

reliable estimates of flux density and surface brightness distribution. This
sub-sample represents those SNRs which fall within carefully chosen selection
criteria which minimises the effects of the known problems in establishing
reliable fluxes from the PMN survey data. Our selection criteria are based on a
judicious restriction of source angular size and telescope beam together with
careful evaluation of fluxes on a case by case basis. This gives confidence in
the newly derived PMN fluxes when the selection criteria are respected. We find
a sharp drop off in the flux densities for Galactic SNRs beyond 4 Jy and then a
fairly flat distribution from 5-9 Jy, a slight decline and a further flat
distribution from 9-20 Jy though the numbers of SNR in each Jy bin are low. We
also re-visit the contentious Sigma-D relation to determine a new power law
index for a sub-sample of shell type SNRs which yields beta= -2.2 +/- 0.6. This
new evaluation of the Sigma-D relation, applied to the restricted sample,
provides new distance estimates and their Galactic scale height distribution.
We find a peak in the SNR distribution between 7-11 kpc with most restricted to
+/- 100 pc Galactic scale height.

model collapse of cores exposed to UV radiation from O stars. We investigated
dependence of mass loss rates on the initial density profiles of cores and
variation of UV fluxes. We derived simple analytic estimates of accretion rates
and final masses of protostars. Results. Radiation-driven implosion mechanism
can increase accretion rates of protostars by 1-2 orders of magnitude. On the
other hand, mass loss due to photo-evaporation is not large enough to have a
significant impact on the luminosity. The increase of accretion rate makes
luminosity 1-2 orders higher than those of protostars that form without
external triggering. Conclusions. Radiation-driven implosion can help explain
the observed higher luminosity of protostars in molecular clouds near H II
regions.

would be expected to evolve into counterparts of the ubiquitous old GCs
believed to be among the oldest galactic building blocks. In the absence of
significant external perturbations, the key factor determining a cluster's
long-term survival chances is the shape of its stellar initial mass function
(IMF). It is, however, not straightforward to assess the IMF shape in
unresolved extragalactic YMCs. We discuss in detail the promise of using
high-resolution spectroscopy to make progress towards this goal, as well as the
numerous pitfalls associated with this approach. We also discuss the latest
progress in worldwide efforts to better understand the evolution of entire

can use recently gained insights to determine the nature of at least some of

turns out to be asymmetric and skewed to higher masses. Starting with these
initial seeds, building up to $10^9$ solar masses by $z = 6$ to power the

black holes in gas rich environments are likely to grow into the supermassive

seeds at high redshift will produce miniquasars that likely play an important
role in the reionization of the Universe. Some of these seed black holes on the

calculate the spectral function of the t-J and the t-t'-t""-J models within the
self-consistent Born approximation for widely accepted values of the parameters
of these models. The main features of the high resolution photoelectron spectra
are in general agreement with the results based on the above models and can be
understood by considering not only the lowest energy quasiparticle peak but,
also, the higher energy string-like excitations of the hole. The second goal of
the present paper is to make the case that a proper analysis of both the
numerical results obtained from these models and of the experimental results,
suggests a theoretical picture for the internal structure of the
hole-quasiparticle and a string-exchange pairing mechanism due to strong
antiferromagnetic correlations among the background spins. We find that, using
a simple model in which the Hilbert space is restricted to states of only
unbroken strings attached to the holes and in which the holes are connected
with unbroken strings, we can provide a good quantitative description of the
most accurate numerical results. We find that the holes experience an effective
interaction due to a string-exchange mechanism which is characterized by a
rather large string tension and this can provide pairing energy scales much
larger that those suggested by spin-fluctuation mediated pairing models. In
addition, it is argued that such string-exchange interaction tends to bind
holes in a bound state with the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry.

radio might know the interference signal being transmitted by a strong primary
user in a non-causal way, and use this knowledge to increase its data rates.
However, there is a subtle difference between knowing the signal transmitted by
the primary and the actual interference at our receiver since there is a
wireless channel between these two points. We show that even an unknown phase
results in a substantial decrease in the data rates that can be achieved, and
thus there is a need to feedback interference channel estimates to the
cognitive transmitter. We then consider the case of fading channels. We derive
an upper bound on the rate for given outage error probability for faded dirt.
We give a scheme that uses appropriate ""training"" to obtain such estimates and
quantify this scheme's required overhead as a function of the relevant
coherence time and interference power.

inflationary scenario involve contracting phases which precede the universe's
present phase of expansion. An important question concerning such models is
whether there are effects which could potentially distinguish them from purely
expanding cosmologies. Vector perturbations have recently been considered in
this context. At first order such perturbations are not supported by a scalar
field. In this paper, therefore, we consider second order vector perturbations.
We show that such perturbations are generated by first order scalar mode-mode
couplings, and give an explicit expression for them. We compare the magnitude
of vector perturbations produced in collapsing models with the corresponding
amplitudes produced during inflation, using a number of suitable power-law
solutions to model the inflationary and collapsing scenarios. We conclude that
the ratios of the magnitudes of these perturbations depend on the details of
the collapsing scenario as well as on how the hot big bang is recovered, but
for certain cases could be large, growing with the duration of the collapse.

relativity is no longer valid and must be replaced by a de Sitter special
relativity, in which Minkowski space is replaced by a de Sitter spacetime. In
consequence, the ordinary notions of energy and momentum change, and will
satisfy a different kinematic relation. Such a theory is a different kind of a
doubly special relativity. Since the only difference between the Poincare' and
the de Sitter groups is the replacement of translations by certain linear
combinations of translations and proper conformal transformations, the net
result of this change is ultimately the breakdown of ordinary translational
invariance. From the experimental point of view, therefore, a de Sitter special
relativity might be probed by looking for possible violations of translational
invariance. If we assume the existence of a connection between the energy scale
of an experiment and the local value of the cosmological constant, there would
be changes in the kinematics of massive particles which could hopefully be
detected in high-energy experiments. Furthermore, due to the presence of a
horizon, the usual causal structure of spacetime would be significantly

of the time series of $z$ components of the particle's position. It is found
that the pattern of the power spectrum shows not only white noise but also
$1/f$-type fluctuation, depending on the value of the total angular momentum
$J$ and the spin $S$ of the test particle. Therefore we succeed in classifying
the chaotic motions, which have been classified as simply chaotic ones in
former works, into the two distinct types. One is $1/f$, and the other is white
noise. Based on this classification, we plot, in the two-dimensional parameter
space $(J,S)$, the phase diagram for the properties of the chaos. This phase
diagram enables us in principle to guess the properties of the system $(J,S)$
by observing the dynamics of the test particle, even if the motion is chaotic.
Furthermore, we detect that the origin of the $1/f$ fluctuation is that the
particle motion stagnates around regular orbits (tori), while traveling back
and forth between them, which is called ``stagnant motion'' or ``sticky
motion'' in Hamiltonian dynamical systems. The point is that the difference of
the property of the chaos or the power spectra is due to the topological
structure of the phase space, which in turn is governed by the physical
parameter set $(J,S)$ of the system. From this point of view, the chaos we
found in this system is not always merely random.

write the wave functions of these degrees of freedom exactly. The square of the
wave function is equivalent to a probability density for a Boltzman gas of

density particle distribution for each wave function, and this distribution can
be interpreted as a special geometric locus in the gravitational dual. Studying
the wave functions associated to half-BPS giant gravitons, we are able to show
that the matrix model can measure the Planck scale directly. We also show that
the output of our simulation seems to match various theoretical expectations in

a very promising approach to explore quantum corrections and effects in

functions are described. These functions are closely related to irreducible
characters of a compact semisimple Lie group $G$ of rank $n$. Up to a sign,
values of antisymmetric orbit functions are repeated on copies of the
fundamental domain $F$ of the affine Weyl group (determined by the initial Weyl
group) in the entire Euclidean space $E_n$. Antisymmetric orbit functions are
solutions of the corresponding Laplace equation in $E_n$, vanishing on the
boundary of the fundamental domain $F$. Antisymmetric orbit functions determine
a so-called antisymmetrized Fourier transform which is closely related to
expansions of central functions in characters of irreducible representations of
the group $G$. They also determine a transform on a finite set of points of $F$
(the discrete antisymmetric orbit function transform). Symmetric and
antisymmetric multivariate exponential, sine and cosine discrete transforms are
given.

universal relation between the variances of the fluctuations of multi-port
impedance parameters, of the same type as we had observed experimentally for
scattering parameters in mode stirred chambers, is analysed in detail. However,
contrary to our own observations, these recent papers claim that only the
impedance fluctuations satisfy universal variance ratios. In the present paper,
we detail our own approach to the problem which is based on electromagnetic
scattering theory. It is shown that universal variance ratios are obtained, for
any type of multi-port model, when the environment of the multi-port system is
described by a scattering operator, which is statistically isotropic in a sense
we make precise below. The only condition on the system is that the radiation
power correlation between the ports considered vanishes. This is to be compared

the prohibitive coercivity condition that is not satisfied by the corresponding
selfdual functional on the relevant path space. We show here that such a

  I(u)= \int_0^T \Big [ L (t, u(t),\dot {u}(t)+\Lambda u(t)) +< \Lambda u(t),

solving this problem use a sort of exhaustive search in a particular finite set

proportional to the size of the finite set, even when there exist very short
conjugating elements. However, ultra summit sets are very large in some cases

to resolve this difficulty would be either to use different Garside structures
and Garside groups in order to get a sufficiently small ultra summit set, or to
develop an algorithm for finding a conjugating element faster than exhaustive
search. Using the former method, Birman, Gonz\'alez-Meneses and Gebhardt have
proposed a polynomial-time algorithm for the CSP for periodic braids.

by introducing the gradient of the primal unknown, or flux, as an additional
variable. A standard discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is then applied to the
resulting system of equations. The numerical interelement fluxes are such that
the equations for the additional variable can be eliminated at the element
level, thus resulting in a global system that involves only the original
unknown variable. The proposed method is closely related to the local
discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method [B. Cockburn and C.-W. Shu, SIAM J. Numer.
Anal., 35 (1998), pp. 2440-2463], but, unlike the LDG method, the sparsity
pattern of the CDG method involves only nearest neighbors. Also, unlike the LDG
method, the CDG method works without stabilization for an arbitrary orientation
of the element interfaces. The computation of the numerical interface fluxes
for the CDG method is slightly more involved than for the LDG method, but this
additional complication is clearly offset by increased compactness and
flexibility. Compared to the BR2 [F. Bassi and S. Rebay, J. Comput. Phys., 131
(1997), pp. 267-279] and IP [J. Douglas, Jr., and T. Dupont, in Computing
Methods in Applied Sciences (Second Internat. Sympos., Versailles, 1975),
Lecture Notes in Phys. 58, Springer, Berlin, 1976, pp. 207-216] methods, which
are known to be compact, the present method produces fewer nonzero elements in
the matrix and is computationally more efficient.

widely been known as two fundamental results in probability theory.
  Recently problems of model uncertainties in statistics, measures of risk and
superhedging in finance motivated us to introduce, in [4] and [5] (see also
[2], [3] and references herein), a new notion of sublinear expectation, called
\textquotedblleft% $G$-expectation\textquotedblright, and the related
\textquotedblleft$G$-normal distribution\textquotedblright from which we were
able to define G-Brownian motion as well as the corresponding stochastic
calculus. The notion of G-normal distribution plays the same important rule in
the theory of sublinear expectation as that of normal distribution in the
classic probability theory. It is then natural and interesting to ask if we
have the corresponding LLN and CLT under a sublinear expectation and, in
particular, if the corresponding limit distribution of the CLT is a G-normal
distribution. This paper gives an affirmative answer. The proof of our CLT is
short since we borrow a deep interior estimate of fully nonlinear PDE in [6]
which extended a profound result of [1] (see also [7]) to parabolic PDEs. The
assumptions of our LLN and CLT can be still improved. But the discovered
phenomenon plays the same important rule in the theory of nonlinear expectation
as that of the classical LLN and CLT in classic probability theory.

according to the following deterministic rule: if at least half of the

infected vertices remain infected forever. Percolation occurs if eventually
every vertex is infected.
  The elements of the set of initially infected vertices, A \subset V(G), are
normally chosen independently at random, each with probability p, say. This
process has been extensively studied on the sequence of torus graphs [n]^d, for
n = 1,2,..., where d = d(n) is either fixed or a very slowly growing function
of n. For example, Cerf and Manzo showed that the critical probability is o(1)
if d(n) < log*(n), i.e., if p = p(n) is bounded away from zero then the
probability of percolation on [n]^d tends to one as n goes to infinity.
  In this paper we study the case when the growth of d to infinity is not
excessively slow; in particular, we show that the critical probability is 1/2 +
o(1) if d > (loglog(n))^2 logloglog(n), and give much stronger bounds in the

in special cases the surface is decomposed into polygons geodesic for both the

those of regular or near-regular graphs, which are understood as being
`simple'. While a great deal of the attention so far dedicated to complex
networks has been duly driven by the `complex' nature of these structures, in
this work we address the identification of simplicity, in the sense of
regularity, in complex networks. The basic idea is to seek for subgraphs
exhibiting small dispersion (e.g. standard deviation or entropy) of local
measurements such as the node degree and clustering coefficient. This approach
paves the way for the identification of subgraphs (patches) with nearly uniform
connectivity, therefore complementing the characterization of the complexity of
networks. We also performed analysis of cascade failures, revealing that the
removal of vertices in `simple' regions results in smaller damage to the
network structure than the removal of vertices in the heterogeneous regions. We
illustrate the potential of the proposed methodology with respect to four
theoretical models as well as protein-protein interaction networks of three
different species. Our results suggest that the simplicity of protein
interaction grows as the result of natural selection. This increase in
simplicity makes these networks more robust to cascade failures.

mesoscopic bridge between the microscopic and macroscopic worlds, in the
existing form of the rhodopsin molecule with its retinal and opsin components.

""Which quantum states are universal resources for one-way quantum computation?""
We start by re-examining what is exactly meant by ""universality"" in quantum
computation, and what the implications are for universal one-way quantum
computation. Given the framework of a measurement-based quantum computer, where
quantum information is processed by local operations only, the most general
universal one-way quantum computer is one which is capable of accepting
arbitrary classical inputs and producing arbitrary quantum outputs--we refer to
this property as CQ-universality. We then show that a systematic study of
CQ-universality in one-way quantum computation is possible by identifying
entanglement features that must be present in every universal resource. These
insights are used to identify several states as being not universal, such as 1D
cluster states, W states, and ground states of non-critical 1D spin systems.
Our criteria are strengthened by considering the efficiency of a quantum
computation, and we find that entanglement measures must obey a certain scaling
law with the system size for all efficient universal resources. This again
leads to examples of non-universal resources, such as, e.g., ground states of
critical 1D spin systems. We also provide several examples of efficient
universal resources, namely graph states corresponding to hexagonal, triangular
and Kagome lattices. Finally, we consider the more general notion of encoded
CQ-universality, where quantum outputs are allowed to be produced in an encoded
form. Again we provide entanglement-based criteria for encoded universality.
Moreover, we present a general procedure to construct encoded universal
resources.

through the application of external magnetic fields. Our protocol employs
resolved-sideband cooling on the forbidden clock transition, $^1S_0 \to

deep in the Paschen-Back regime. This makes it possible to laser cool neutral

appropriate controllable two-dimensional sub-system. This prompts the obvious
question of how well a qubit, thus defined, is confined to this subspace, and
whether we can experimentally quantify the potential leakage into to states
outside the qubit subspace. In this paper we demonstrate that subspace leakage
can be quantitatively characterized using minimal theoretical assumptions by
examining the Fourier spectrum of the Rabi oscillation experiment.

generalizations of experimental facts that can be reasonably taken to be
representative of quantum phenomena, and on theoretical ideas and principles,

show that it is possible to derive the abstract quantum formalism for
finite-dimensional quantum systems and the formal relations, such as the
canonical commutation relationships and Dirac's Poisson Bracket rule, that are
needed to apply the abstract formalism to particular systems of interest. The
concept of information, via an information-theoretic invariance principle,
plays a key role in the derivation, and gives rise to some of the central
structural features of the quantum formalism.

Standard methods to measure quantum properties of Bose-Einstein condensates
(BECs) are based on matter-wave interference between atoms released from traps
which destroys the system. Here we propose a nondestructive method based on
optical measurements, and prove that atomic statistics can be mapped on
transmission spectra of a high-Q cavity. This can be extremely useful for
studying phase transitions between Mott insulator and superfluid states, since
various phases show qualitatively distinct light scattering. Joining the
paradigms of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and ultracold gases will
enable conceptually new investigations of both light and matter at ultimate
quantum levels, which only recently became experimentally possible. Here we
predict effects accessible in such novel setups.

generally underestimates three-way entanglement of a given system. This
