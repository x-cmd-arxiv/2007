remarkable transition of cosmology into a precision science. However,
addressing the systematic effects in the increasingly sensitive, high
resolution, `full' sky measurements from different CMB experiments pose a stiff
challenge. The analysis techniques must not only be computationally fast to
contend with the huge size of the data, but, the higher sensitivity also limits
the simplifying assumptions which can then be invoked to achieve the desired
speed without compromising the final precision goals. While maximum likelihood
is desirable, the enormous computational cost makes the suboptimal method of
power spectrum estimation using Pseudo-C_l unavoidable for high resolution
data. We provide a (semi)analytic framework to estimate bias in the power
spectrum due to the effect of beam non-circularity and non-uniform sky coverage
including incomplete/masked sky maps and scan strategy. The approach is
perturbative in the distortion of the beam from non-circularity, allowing for
rapid computations when the beam is mildly non-circular. We advocate that it is
computationally advantageous to employ `soft' azimuthally apodized masks whose
spherical harmonic transform die down fast with m. We numerically implement our
method for non-rotating beams. We present preliminary estimates of the
computational cost to evaluate the bias for the upcoming CMB anisotropy probes
l_max~3000, with angular resolution comparable to the Planck surveyor mission.
We further show that this implementation and estimate is applicable for
rotating beams on equal declination scans and possibly can be extended to
simple approximations to other scan strategies.

The HiRes and Auger fluorescence telescopes are simulated in detail. We analyze

  We have devised a method for predicting the expected planetary populations

at all hydrostatic envelope solutions of giant gas planets that could possibly
exist in arbitrary planetary nebulae and comparing the relative abundance of
different masses. We have completed the first such survey of hydrostatic
equilibria in an orbital range covering periods of 1 to 50 days.
  Statistical analysis of the calculated envelopes suggests division into three
classes of giant planets that are distinguished by orbital separation. We term
them classes G (close-in), H, and J (large separation). Each class has distinct
properties such as a typical mass range.
  Furthermore, the division between class H and J appears to mark important
changes in the formation: For close-in planets (classes G and H) the concept of
a critical core-mass is meaningless while it is important for class J. This
result needs confirmation by future dynamical analysis.

Numerical simulations suggest that the large-scale poloidal field in these

interior. Using the principle of conservation of total helicity, we develop a
variational principle for computing the structure of the magnetic field inside
a conducting sphere surrounded by an insulating vacuum. We show that, for a
fixed total helicity, the minimum energy state corresponds to a force-free
configuration. We find a simple class of axisymmetric solutions, parametrized
by angular and radial quantum numbers. However, these solutions have a
discontinuity in the toroidal magnetic field at the stellar surface which will
exert a toroidal stress on the surface of the star. We then describe two other
classes of solutions, the standard spheromak solutions and ones with fixed

templates providing an estimate of the total IR luminosity of each source. We
then exploit the correlation between IR and X-ray luminosities for star-forming
galaxies, established in the local Universe, to select sources that are
dominated by star-formation. This approach is efficient in discriminating
normal galaxies from AGN over a wide range of SFRs. The resulting sample
consists of 45 X-ray selected star-forming systems at a median redshift z~0.5,
the majority of which (60%) are LIRGs or ULIRGs. This sample is least affected
by incompleteness and AGN contamination and is well suited for cosmological
studies. We quantify the X-ray evolution of these sources by constructing their
differential, dN/dS, and comparing them with evolving luminosity function
models. The results are consistent with luminosity evolution of the form
(1+z)^{p} with p~2.4. This is similar to the evolution rate of star-forming
galaxies selected at other wavelengths, suggesting that the deep X-ray surveys,
are indeed finding the starburst galaxy population that drives the rapid
evolution of the global SFR density in the range z~0-1. Our analysis also
reveals a separate population of IR-faint X-ray sources. These include old
galaxies but also systems that are X-ray luminous for their stellar mass
compared to local E/S0. We argue that these may be post-starbursts that will,
over time, become fainter at X-rays and will eventually evolve into early-type
systems (e.g. E/S0).

consistent with this idea. In this work we search for observational evidence of
vertical chemical stratification in the atmosphere of HD135485. If this
evidence exists, it will demonstrate the importance of atomic diffusion
processes in the atmospheres of BHB stars. We undertake an extensive abundance
stratification analysis of the atmosphere of HD135485, based on recently
acquired high resolution and S/N CFHT ESPaDOnS spectra and a McDonald-CE
spectrum. Our numerical simulations show that nitrogen and sulfur reveal
signatures of vertical abundance stratification in the stellar atmosphere. It
appears that the abundances of these elements increase toward the upper
atmosphere. This fact cannot be explained by the influence of microturbulent
velocity, because oxygen, carbon, neon, argon, titanium and chromium do not
show similar behavior and their abundances remain constant throughout the
atmosphere. It seems that the iron abundance may increase marginally toward the
lower atmosphere. This is the first demonstration of vertical abundance
stratification of metals in a BHB star.

sources are spatially well mixed with dust(a normal starburst) or are more
centrally concentrated than the dust (a buried AGN). Infrared spectra of at
least 30%, and possibly 50%, of the observed optical non-Seyfert ULIRGs are
naturally explained by emission consisting of (1) energetically insignificant,
modestly obscured (Av < 20-30 mag) PAH-emitting normal starbursts, and (2)
energetically dominant, highly dust-obscured, centrally concentrated energy
sources with no PAH emission. We interpret the latter component as a buried
AGN. The fraction of ULIRGs showing some buried AGN signatures is higher in
LINER ULIRGs than in HII-region ULIRGs. Most of the luminous buried AGN
candidates are found in ULIRGs with cool far-infrared colors. Where the
absorption-corrected intrinsic AGN luminosities are derivable with little
uncertainty, they are found to be of the order of 10^12Lsun, accounting for the
bulk of the ULIRGs' luminosities. The 5-35 micron spectroscopic starburst/AGN
classifications are generally consistent with our previous classifications
based on 3-4 micron spectra for the same sample.

stellar yields from massive stars. The main purpose of the paper is to compare
the predictions of this model with new observations of chemical abundance
ratios and metallicity distributions in order to put constraints on the
formation and evolution of the bulge. We computed the evolution of several
alpha-elements and Fe and performed several tests by varying different
parameters such as star formation efficiency, slope of the initial mass
function and infall timescale. We also tested the effect of adopting a primary
nitrogen contribution from massive stars. The [alpha/Fe] abundance ratios in
the Bulge are predicted to be supersolar for a very large range in [Fe/H], each
element having a different slope. These predictions are in very good agreement
with most recent accurate abundance determinations. We also find a good fit of
the most recent Bulge stellar metallicity distributions. We conclude that the
Bulge formed on a very short timescale (even though timescales much shorter
than about 0.1 Gyr are excluded) with a quite high star formation efficiency of
about 20 Gyr$^{-1}$ and with an initial mass function more skewed toward high
masses (i.e. x <= 0.95) than the solar neighbourhood and rest of the disk. The
results obtained here are more robust than previous ones since they are based
on very accurate abundance measurements.

Field Camera (WFC) point spread function (PSF) using the two square degree
COSMOS survey. We show that stochastic aliasing of the PSF necessarily occurs
during `drizzling'. This aliasing is maximal if the output pixel scale is equal
to the input pixel scale of 0.05''. We show that this source of PSF variation
can be significantly reduced by choosing a Gaussian drizzle kernel and by
setting the output pixel size to 0.03''. We show that the PSF is temporally
unstable, most likely due to thermal fluctuations in the telescope's focus. We
find that the primary manifestation of this thermal drift in COSMOS images is
an overall slow periodic focus change. Using a modified version of TinyTim, we
create undistorted stars in a 30x30 grid across the ACS WFC CCDs. These PSF
models are created for telescope focus values in the range -10 microns to +5
microns, thus spanning the allowed range of telescope focus values. We then use
the approximately ten well measured stars in each COSMOS field to pick the
best-fit focus value for each field. The TinyTim model stars are then used to
perform PSF corrections for weak lensing allowing systematics due to
incorrectly modeled PSFs to be greatly reduced. We have made the software for
PSF modeling using our modified version of TinyTim available to the
astronomical community. We show the effects of Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE)
degradation, which distorts the object in the readout direction, mimicking a
weak lensing signal. We derive a parametric correction for the effect of CTE on
the shapes of objects in the COSMOS field as a function of observation date,
position within the ACS WFC field, and object flux.

carried out orbital phase resolved spectroscopy to measure changes in the

standard treatment of these processes includes only the spontaneous two-photon

additional effects, some of which have been suggested in recent papers but
whose impact on He I recombination has not been fully quantified. These are:
(i) stimulated two-photon decays; (ii) two-photon absorption of redshifted HeI

state, for scattering lengths $a_4>a_2$, and the square biaxial nematic state
for $a_4<a_2$. Paradoxically, the fluctuation induced order is stronger at
higher temperatures, for a range of temperatures below $T_c$. For the
experimentally relevant cases of spin-2 $^{87}$Rb and $^{23}$Na, we argue that
such fluctuations could successfully compete against other effects like the
quadratic Zeeman field, and stabilize the uniaxial phase for experimentally

the characteristic spin excitation energy decreases. We show that our
well-annealed YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO6+x) single crystals are orthorhombic and
superconducting but not antiferromagnetically ordered. Near the critical
concentration for superconductivity for x = 0.35 the spins fluctuate on two
energy scales, one a relaxational spin response at ~2 meV and the other a slow
central mode that is resolution-limited in energy (<0.08 meV) but broad in
momentum. The gradual formation on cooling of a central mode over a range of
momenta suggests that the spin ground state from which coherent superconducting
pairing emerges may be quantum disordered. We show that YBCO6.35 adopts a
homogeneous state that consists of highly-organized frozen sub-critical
three-dimensional spin correlations. The continuous spin evolution indicates
that a single quantum state occurs in contrast to claims from site-based probes
that lightly doped YBCO undergoes a transition to antiferromagnetic Bragg order
followed by a sharp transition to a cluster glass phase. For x = 0.35, where Tc
= 18 K is reduced to 1/5 of Tcmax, the spin ground state is reached without a
sharp transition and consists of short correlations extending over only 8
Angstrom between cells and 42 Angstrom within the planes. Polarized neutrons
show the angular spin distribution to be isotropic unlike the AF insulator.
Since moment is conserved we interpret this as evidence for hole-induced spin
rotations rather than decay.

results of structural, electrical, and magnetic measurements indicate that Ir
substitutes Ru for x <= 0.10 with no significant structural distortions.
Ir-doping gradually suppresses both the magnetic and the superconducting
states. However, all samples were observed to attain the zero-resistance state
at temperatures >= 2 K up to the highest applied magnetic field of 18 T. The
resistive upper-critical field Hc2 as a function of temperature has been
determined for these polycrystalline samples. Values of Hc2(0) were found to be
\~ 52 T, and weakly dependent on the Ir concentration. We have also observed
that the superconducting transition width decreases and the slope of the
resistive transition increases with increasing Ir doping, a feature which is
much more pronounced at high applied magnetic fields. The double-peak structure
observed in the derivative of the resistive curves has been related to an
inhomogeneous nature of the physical grains which is enhanced due to the Ru
substitution by Ir. This indicates that the Josephson-junction-array (JJA)
model seems to be appropriated to describe the superconducting state in these
ruthenocuprates. The low temperature rho(T) data along with the determined
vortex thermal activation energy are consistent with a 2D vortex dynamics in
these materials.

$\mu(T=0)=0$ up to $\mu(T_{gap}) \sim 2$. (ii) for $T_{gap}<T<T_c$, the
distribution $P_1(w)$ vanishes at some value $w_0(T)<1$, and accordingly the
moments $\bar{Y_k(i)}$ decay exponentially as $(w_0(T))^k$ in $k$. The
histograms of spatial correlations also display Derrida-Flyvbjerg singularities
for $T<T_{gap}$. Both below and above $T_{gap}$, the study of typical and

between the diffusion constant $D$ and the alpha relaxation time
$\tau_{\alpha}$. For water simulated with the TIP5P and ST2 potentials, we find
that the temperature of the decoupling of diffusion and alpha relaxation
correlates with the temperature of the maximum in specific heat that
corresponds to crossing the Widom line $T_W(P)$. Specifically, we find that our
results for $D\tau_{\alpha}/T$ collapse onto a single master curve if
temperature is replaced by $T-T_W(P)$, where $T_W(P)$ is the temperature where
the constant-pressure specific heat achieves a maximum. Also, we find agreement
between our ST2 simulations and experimental values of $D\tau_{\alpha}/T$. We
further find that the size of the mobile molecule clusters (dynamical
heterogeneities) increases sharply near $T_W(P)$. Moreover, our calculations of
mobile particle cluster size $<n(t^*)>_w$ for different pressures, where $t^*$
is the time for which the mobile particle cluster size is largest, also
collapse onto a single master curve if $T$ is replaced by $T-T_W(P)$. The
crossover to a more locally structured low density liquid (LDL) environment as
$T\to T_W(P)$ appears to be well correlated with both the breakdown of the

  Diego, January 2007. 7 pages",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  This paper addresses the following question, which is of interest in the
design and deployment of a multiuser decentralized network. Given a total
system bandwidth of W Hz and a fixed data rate constraint of R bps for each
transmission, how many frequency slots N of size W/N should the band be
partitioned into to maximize the number of simultaneous transmissions in the
network? In an interference-limited ad-hoc network, dividing the available
spectrum results in two competing effects: on the positive side, it reduces the
number of users on each band and therefore decreases the interference level
which leads to an increased SINR, while on the negative side the SINR
requirement for each transmission is increased because the same information
rate must be achieved over a smaller bandwidth. Exploring this tradeoff between
bandwidth and SINR and determining the optimum value of N in terms of the
system parameters is the focus of the paper. Using stochastic geometry, we
analytically derive the optimal SINR threshold (which directly corresponds to
the optimal spectral efficiency) on this tradeoff curve and show that it is a
function of only the path loss exponent. Furthermore, the optimal SINR point
lies between the low-SINR (power-limited) and high-SINR (bandwidth-limited)
regimes. In order to operate at this optimal point, the number of frequency
bands (i.e., the reuse factor) should be increased until the threshold SINR,
which is an increasing function of the reuse factor, is equal to the optimal
value.

open string amplitudes at tree level. We study the single baryon number

invariance condition for the full gluon propagator. Since due to color
confinement the gluon is not a physical state, none of physical
observables/processes in low-energy QCD will be directly affected by such a
temporary violation of color gauge invriance/symmetry. In order to make the
existence of a mass gap perfectly clear the corresponding subtraction procedure
is introduced. All this llows one to etablish the general structure of the full
gluon propagator in the presence of a mass gap. It is mainly generated by the
nonlinear interaction of massless gluon modes. The physical meaning of the mass
gap is to be responsible for the large-scale (low-energy/momentum), i.e.,
nonperturbative structure of the true QCD vacuum. The direct nonlinear
iteration solution of the transcendental equation for the full gluon propagator
in the presence of a mass gap is present. We formulate a generl method how to
restore the transversality of the full gluon propagator relevant for the
nonperturbative QCD. It is explicitly shown that such a solution confines QCD.

step is done by first proving an auxiliary recursion relation where the
vanishing at infinity follows directly from a Feynman diagram analysis. The
auxiliary recursion relation gives rise to a representation of gravity
amplitudes where the vanishing under the BCFW deformation can be directly
proven. Since all our steps are based only on Feynman diagrams, our proof

governed by a spinning particle action whose internal coordinates are Lorentz

the theory are tensors or spinor-tensors on the curved background while
conserved charges correspond to the various differential geometry operators
acting on these. The Hamiltonian generalizes Lichnerowicz's wave/Laplace
operator. It is central, and the models are supersymmetric whenever the
background is a symmetric space, although there is an osp(2p|Q) superalgebra
for any curved background. The lowest purely bosonic example (2p,Q)=(2,0)
corresponds to a deformed Jacobi group and describes Lichnerowicz's original
algebra of constant curvature, differential geometric operators acting on
symmetric tensors. The case (2p,Q)=(0,1) is simply the {\cal N}=1 superparticle
whose supercharge amounts to the Dirac operator acting on spinors. The
(2p,Q)=(0,2) model is the {\cal N}=2 supersymmetric quantum mechanics
corresponding to differential forms. (This latter pair of models are
supersymmetric on any Riemannian background.) When Q is odd, the models apply
to spinor-tensors. The (2p,Q)=(2,1) model is distinguished by admitting a
central Lichnerowicz-Dirac operator when the background is constant curvature.
The new supersymmetric models are novel in that the Hamiltonian is not just a
square of super charges, but rather a sum of commutators of supercharges and
commutators of bosonic charges. These models and superalgebras are a very
useful tool for any study involving high rank tensors and spinors on manifolds.

the MHV formalism manifest but which is inaccessible from space-time. The
framework is extended to describe matter fields: as an illustration we
explicitly construct twistor actions for an adjoint scalar with arbitrary
polynomial potential and a fermion in the fundamental representation and show
how this leads to additional towers of MHV vertices in the MHV diagram
formalism.

Westfahl","Compactness and Measures of Noncompactness in Metric Trees","16 pages",,,,"math.MG math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A metric tree ($M$, $d$), also known as $\mathbb{R}$-trees or $T$-theory, is
a metric space such that between any two points there is an unique arc and that
arc is isometric to an interval in $\mathbb{R}$. In this paper after presenting
some fundamental properties of metric trees and metric segments, we will give a
characterization of compact metric trees in terms of metric segments. Two
common measures of noncompactness are the ball and set measures, respectively
defined as \[ \beta(S) = \inf \{\epsilon \mid S {has a finite} \epsilon {-net
in} M\} {and} \] \[ \alpha(S) = \inf\{\epsilon \mid S {has a finite cover of
sets of diameter} \leq \epsilon\}. \] We will prove that $\alpha = 2\beta$ for
all metric trees. We give two independent proofs of this result, first of which
depends on the fact that given a metric tree $M$ and a subset $E$ of diameter
$2r$, then for all $\ep >0$ there exists $m \in M$ such that $E \subset
B(m;r+\ep)$. The second proof depends on the calculation of underlying
geometric constant, Lifschitz characteristic of a metric tree. It is well known
that the classes of condensing or contractive operators defined relative to
distinct measures of noncompactness are not equal in general, however in case
of metric trees, we show that a map $T$ between two metric trees is $k$-set
contractive if and only if it is $k$-ball contractive for $k\geq 0$.}

properties in the nuclear medium, in connection with the recent experimental
claims of very deeply bound antikaon-nuclear states. We argue that proper
many-body formulations using modern realistic antikaon-nucleon interactions are
not able to generate such systems. Instead, a simple two-nucleon antikaon
absorption mechanism where the remaining nucleus acts as spectator explains the
peak in the semi-inclusive proton momentum spectrum, observed on a 4He target
at KEK (but later not confirmed in an inclusive experiment) and on a 6Li target
at FINUDA. This signal is clearly seen in another FINUDA experiment measuring
the invariant mass of Lambda-proton pairs after two-nucleon kaon absorption. We
show that another peak of this experiment, seen at lower invariant masses and
interpreted as a bound K-pp state, is simply generated by the same two-nucleon
absorption mechanism followed by final-state interactions of the produced
particles with the residual nucleus. Our conclusion is that all the
experimental claims for the formation of very deeply bound antikaonic nuclear
systems receive an alternative explanation in terms of conventional nuclear
processes.

infected). For fixed average transmissibility, we find upper and lower bounds
on these. An epidemic is most likely if infectivity is homogeneous and least
likely if the variance of infectivity is maximized. Similarly, the attack rate
is largest if susceptibility is homogeneous and smallest if the variance is

recent works have demonstrated the utility of leveraging information across

sharing of information across alleles is controlled by a user-defined measure

highly robust to imperfect single photon sources and inefficient detectors. In
particular we show that if the product of the detector efficiency with the
source efficiency is greater than 2/3, then efficient LOQC is possible. This
threshold is many orders of magnitude more relaxed than those which could be
inferred by application of standard results in fault tolerance. The result is
achieved within the cluster state paradigm for quantum computation.

of entanglement-enhanced communication, which is very close to quantum
communication. The advantages are based on the properties of
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states.

gradually transforms into the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, which describes the

field. We demonstrate quantum annealing for 2-, 3-, and 9-spin systems. In
particular, we consider the alternate (ferro- and antiferromagnetic) exchange
integral. By changing the sign of the exchange integrals we switch from the

due to spin tunneling is treated in an adapted WKB approach and it is shown
