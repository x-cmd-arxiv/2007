the halo mass function, a key probe of cosmology. By performing a large suite
of nested-box N-body simulations with careful convergence and error controls
(60 simulations with box sizes from 4 to 256 Mpc/h, we determine the mass
function and its evolution with excellent statistical and systematic errors,
reaching a few percent over most of the considered redshift and mass range.
Across the studied redshifts, the halo mass is probed over 6 orders of
magnitude (10^7 - 10^13.5 M_sun/h). Historically, there has been considerable
variation in the high redshift mass function as obtained by different groups.
We have made a concerted effort to identify and correct possible systematic
errors in computing the mass function at high redshift and to explain the
discrepancies between some of the previous results. We discuss convergence
criteria for the required force resolution, simulation box size, halo mass
range, initial and final redshift, and time stepping. Because of conservative
cuts on the mass range probed by individual boxes, our results are relatively
insensitive to simulation volume, the remaining sensitivity being consistent
with extended Press-Schechter theory. Previously obtained mass function fits
near z=0, when scaled by linear theory, are in good agreement with our results
at all redshifts, although a mild redshift dependence consistent with that
found by Reed and collaborators exists at low redshifts.

line profiles. We find a solar argon abundance in the H-rich central star
NGC1360 and in the H-deficient PG1159 star PG1424+535. This confirms stellar
evolution modeling that predicts that the argon abundance remains almost

surprising result, we directly measure the critical mass ratio for stability by
imposing artificial angular momentum loss at various rates to drive the binary

the mass of any substructures along the line of sight, which is expressed as
M_E < 10^5 M_solar for the mass inside an Einstein radius. In contrast, the

anomaly in the flux ratio between images B and C, i.e., a factor two smaller
C/B ratio than predicted by smooth-lens models. The ratio of A/B in the H_beta
line is well reproduced. We show that the anomalous C/B ratio for the H_beta
line is caused most likely by micro/milli-lensing of image C. This is because
other effects, such as the differential dust extinction and/or arrival time
difference between images B and C, or the simultaneous lensing of another pair

linear growth of the resistive hose instability of a filamentary beam that
could lead to snake-like distortion. For both the rectangular radial density
profile and the diffuse profile reflecting the Bennett-type equilibrium for a
self-collimating flow, the modified eigenvalue equations are derived from a
Vlasov-Maxwell equation. While for the simple rectangular profile, current
perturbation is localized at the sharp radial edge, for the realistic Bennett
profile with an obscure edge, it is non-locally distributed over the entire
beam, removing catastrophic wave-particle resonance. The pair production
effects likely decrease the betatron frequency, and expand the beam radius to
increase the resistive decay time of the perturbed current; these also lead to
a reduction of the growth rate. It is shown that, for the Bennett profile case,
the characteristic growth distance for a preferential mode can exceed the
observational length-scale of astrophysical jets. This might provide the key to
the problem of the stabilized transport of the astrophysical jets including
extragalactic jets up to Mpc ($\sim 3\times 10^{24}$ cm) scales.

and geometrical properties of an AGN Warm Absorber wind. The absorber consists
of two different ionization components. By tracking the response in the opacity
of the gas in each component to changes in the ionizing continuum, we were able
to constrain the electron density of the system. The measured densities require
that the high and low ionization absorbing components of NGC 4051 must be
compact, at distances 0.5-1.0 l-d (2200 - 4400Rs) and < 3.5 l-d (< 15800Rs)
from the continuum source, respectively. This rules out an origin in the dusty
obscuring torus, as the dust sublimation radius is at least an order of
magnitude larger (>12 l-d). An accretion disk origin for the warm absorber wind
is strongly suggested, and an association with the high ionization, HeII
emitting, broad emission line region (radius <2 l-d) is possible. The two
detected phases are consistent with pressure equilibrium, which suggests that
the absorber consists of a two phase medium. A radial flow in a spherical
geometry is unlikely, and a conical wind geometry is preferred. The implied
mass outflow rate from this wind, can be well constrained, and is 2-5% of the
mass accretion rate. If the mass outflow rate scaling with accretion rate is
representative of all quasars, our results imply that warm absorbers in
powerful quasars are unlikely to produce important evolutionary effects on
their larger environment, unless we are observing the winds before they get
fully accelerated. Only in such a scenario can AGN winds be important for
cosmic feedback.

two different drift rates: an inner region with steeper apparent drift rate
flanked on each side by a region of slower apparent drift rate. Furthermore,
these closely spaced drift bands always maintain a constant phase relationship.
Though these drift regions have significantly different values for the measured
P2, the measured P3 value is the same and equal to 18.3 P1. We interpret the
unique drift pattern of this pulsar as being created by the intersection of our
line of sight (LOS) with two conal rings on the polar cap of a fairly aligned
rotator (inclination angle alpha ~ 11 deg), with an ``inner'' LOS geometry
(impact angle beta ~ -5.4 deg). We argue that both the rings have the same
values for the carousel rotation periodicity P4 and the number of sparks Nsp.
We find that Nsp is 19-21 and show that it is very likely that, P4 is the same
as the measured P3, making it a truly unique pulsar. We present results from
simulations of the radiation pattern using the inferred parameters, that
support our interpretations and reproduce the average profile as well as the
observed features in the drift pattern quite well.

are addressed by non-linear modelling of radial pulsations of these stars. In
this approach radial modes are treated as representative for all acoustic
oscillations.
  Several models of different masses and metallicities were converged to limit
cycles through Stellingwerf (1974) relaxation technique. Resulting peak-to-peak
amplitudes are of order of DeltaV=0.3 mag. Such amplitudes are significantly
larger than those observed in beta Cephei pulsators. Assuming that all acoustic
modes are similar, we show that collective saturation of the driving mechanism
by several acoustic modes can easily lower predicted saturation amplitudes to
the observed level. Our calculations predict significant decrease of saturation
amplitudes as we go to high mass/high luminosity models. However, this effect
is not strong enough to explain scarcity of high mass beta Cephei variables.
  We also discuss robust double-mode behaviour, encountered in our radiative
models. On a single evolutionary track we identify two double-mode domains with
two different mechanisms resposible for double-mode behaviour. The non-resonant
double-mode domain separates first overtone and fundamental mode pulsation
domains. The resonant double-mode domain appears in the middle of the first
overtone pulsation domain. Its origin can be traced to the
2omega_1=omega_0+omega_2 parametric resonance, which destabilizes the first

emission broadly traces the pattern of the spiral arms, establishing a strong
link with recent star formation, but it also exhibits a radial scale length of
\~2.6 arcmins (5.4 kpc) consistent with optical data. We estimate the soft

a strong correlation with images recorded in the far-UV through to V band, with
the best match being with the U band. We interpret these results in terms of a

over thermal pressure alone has several important effects on fragmentation and
the formation of binary and multiple systems, and on the properties of massive
circumstellar discs. The extra support suppresses the tendency of molecular
cloud cores to fragment due to either initial density perturbations or disc
fragmentation. Furthermore, unlike most previous studies, we find that magnetic
pressure plays the dominant role in inhibiting fragmentation rather than
magnetic tension or magnetic braking. In particular, we find that if the
magnetic field is aligned with the rotation axis of the molecular cloud core,
the effects of the magnetic field on fragmentation and disc structure are
almost entirely due to magnetic pressure, while if the rotation axis is
initially perpendicular to the magnetic field, magnetic tension plays a greater
role and can actually aid fragmentation. Despite these effects, and contrary to
several past studies, we find that strongly-perturbed molecular cloud cores are
able to fragment to form wide binary systems even in the presence of quite
strong magnetic fields. For massive circumstellar discs, we find that slowing
of the collapse caused by the magnetic support decreases the mass infall rate
on to the disc and, thus, weakens gravitational instabilities in young massive
circumstellar discs. This not only reduces the likelihood that they will
fragment, but also decreases the importance of spiral density waves in
providing angular momentum transport and in promoting planet formation.

the radio source is no longer being powered by a detected active jet, so that
the dynamical state of the radio plasma is at the mercy of the ambient medium.
Secondly the two early-type galaxies, NGC 7236 and NGC 7237, one of which was

  in Astrophys. J",,,,"astro-ph nucl-ex",,"  Neutron stars in close binary star systems often accrete matter from their
companion stars. Thermonuclear ignition of the accreted material in the
atmosphere of the neutron star leads to a thermonuclear explosion which is
observed as an X-ray burst occurring periodically between hours and days
depending on the accretion rate. The ignition conditions are characterized by a
sensitive interplay between the accretion rate of the fuel supply and its
depletion rate by nuclear burning in the hot CNO cycle and the rp-process. For
accretion rates close to stable burning the burst ignition therefore depends
critically on the hot CNO breakout reaction, O15(alpha,gamma)Ne19, that
regulates the flow between the hot CNO cycle and the rapid proton capture
process. Until recently, the O15(alpha,gamma)Ne19-reaction rate was not known
experimentally and the theoretical estimates carried significant uncertainties.
In this paper we perform a parameter study of the uncertainty of this reaction
rate and determine the astrophysical consequences of the first measurement of
this reaction rate. Our results corroborate earlier predictions and show that
theoretically burning remains unstable up to accretion rates near the Eddington
limit, in contrast to astronomical observations.

the HQVs in superfluid $^3$He confined between two parallel plates with a gap D
$\sim$ 10 $\mu$m in the presence of a magnetic field H $\sim$ 26 mT
perpendicular to the parallel plates. We find that the bound HQVs are more
stable than the singular vortices and free pairs of HQVs, when the rotation
perpendicular to the parallel plates is below the critical speed, $\Omega_c
\sim$ 2 rad/s. The bound pair of HQVs accompanies the tilting of ${\hat
d}$-vector out of the plane, which leads to an additional absorption in NMR
spectra. Our study appears to describe the temperature and rotation dependence
of the observed satellite NMR signal, which supports the existence of the HQVs
in $^3$He.

which may or may not be critical. Second, we prove a generalised version of
Luttinger's theorem for a Mott insulator. Namely, regardless of the spatial
dimension, the Fermi surface of the non-interacting system is converted into a
surface of zeros of the single-particle Green function when the Mott insulator
posesses particle-hole symmetry. Only in the presence of particle-hole symmetry
does the volume of the surface of zeros equal the particle density. The surface
of zeros persists at finite doping and is shown to provide a framework from
which pseudogaps, broad spectral features, spectral weight transfer on the Mott
gap scale can be understood.

bound for the total energy, even in the presence of pseudopotentials, and
allows to improve systematically the accuracy of the trial wave function, which
already yields a large fraction of the dynamical and non-dynamical electron

relative angles and relative separations are meaningful, while in similarity
relational particle mechanics (SRPM) only relative times, relative angles and
ratios of relative separations are. These theories are clearly of interest in
the absolute or relative motion debate. In this paper, ERPM and SRPM are
provided in fully reduced form for 3 particles in 2D, i.e. the classical
dynamics on triangleland in 2D with and without scale. Exact solutions to each
of these are then found, and simple Newton--Coulomb-like and harmonic
oscillator-like SRPM models are studied numerically. The mathematics one
arrives at thus overlaps in many ways with that which arises in the absolutist
approach. The ERPM gives standard mathematics, while the SRPM has standard
small-relative-scale behaviour and an unexpected but in itself standard
universal large-relative-scale behaviour. One way in which SRPM is unusual is
that it is a model in which a symmetry principle underlies an unexpected
departure from standard physical behaviour at sufficiently large relative
scales (interpolation between the abovementioned two behaviours). ERPM and SRPM
are also theoretically interesting at the quantum level, both on their own
merit and as toy models for the development of various approaches to the
problems of time and of observables in quantum general relativity.

mass, non-spinning, eccentric binary black hole systems in general relativity.
We show that with appropriate fine-tuning of the initial conditions to a region
of parameter space we denote the threshold of immediate merger, the binary
enters a phase of close interaction in a near-circular orbit, stays there for
an amount of time proportional to logarithmic distance from the threshold in
parameter space, then either separates or merges to form a single Kerr black
hole. To gain a better understanding of this phenomena we study an analogous
problem in the evolution of equatorial geodesics about a central Kerr black
hole. A similar threshold of capture exists for appropriate classes of initial
conditions, and tuning to threshold the geodesics approach one of the unstable
circular geodesics of the Kerr spacetime. Remarkably, with a natural mapping of
the parameters of the geodesic to that of the equal mass system, the scaling
exponent describing the whirl phase of each system turns out to be quite
similar. Armed with this lone piece of evidence that an approximate
correspondence might exist between near-threshold evolution of geodesics and
generic binary mergers, we illustrate how this information can be used to
estimate the cross section and energy emitted in the ultra relativistic black
hole scattering problem. This could eventually be of use in providing estimates
for the related problem of parton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider in
extra dimension scenarios where black holes are produced.

this implies a violation of the strong equivalence principle (SEP) for ordinary
matter and consequent cosmic acceleration in the observable frame as well as
variation of the gravitational constant. The consequent DE mechanism build upon
the AWE hypothesis (i) does not require a violation of the strong energy
condition $p<-\rho c^2/3$, (ii) assumes rather non-negligible direct couplings
to the gravitational scalar field (iii) offers a natural convergence mechanism
toward general relativity (iv) accounts fairly for supernovae data from various

decaying into a pseudoscalar meson, to twist-3 accuracy only the leading twist
distribution amplitude (DA) is involved if we start from a chiral current. If
we choose a suitable chiral current in the vector meson case, the main twist-3

P} (1S)$ are equal to 210(10) and 260(10) MeV, respectively, and their ratio
$f_{D_s}/f_D$=1.24(3) agrees with recent CLEO experiment. The values $f_{\rm

with the ratio $f_{B_s}/f_B$=1.19(2) and $f_D/f_B$=1.14(2). The decay constants
$f_{\rm P}(2S)$ for the first radial excitations as well as the decay constants
$f_{\rm V}(1S)$ in the vector channel are also calculated. The difference of

flow (like water along the hulls of ships or air on airplanes) is hindered by a
drag, which increases many-folds when the fluid flow turns from laminar to
turbulent. A major technological problem is how to reduce this drag in order to
minimize the expense of transporting fluids like oil in pipelines, or to move
ships in the ocean. It was discovered in the mid-twentieth century that minute
concentrations of polymers can reduce the drag in turbulent flows by up to 80%.
While experimental knowledge had accumulated over the years, the fundamental
theory of drag reduction by polymers remained elusive for a long time, with
arguments raging whether this is a ""skin"" or a ""bulk"" effect. In this
colloquium review we first summarize the phenomenology of drag reduction by
polymers, stressing both its universal and non-universal aspects, and then
proceed to review a recent theory that provides a quantitative explanation of
all the known phenomenology. We treat both flexible and rod-like polymers,
explaining the existence of universal properties like the Maximum Drag
Reduction (MDR) asymptote, as well as non-universal cross-over phenomena that
depend on the Reynolds number, on the nature of the polymer and on its
concentration. Finally we also discuss other agents for drag reduction with a
stress on the important example of bubbles.

wave functions with explicitly controlled functional-analytic arbitrariness.
This arbitrariness corresponds to the arbitrariness in the choice of
phase-equivalent nonlocal potentials and causes the necessary to include some
additional concepts of quantum measurement theory to a complete description of
quantum-mechanical systems. The mathematical apparatus of the approach thus
developed is illustrated by the example of describing the nucleon-nucleon
interaction in uncoupled partial channels.

decoherence. The control objective is to generate target one- and two-qubit
unitary gates in the presence of strong environmentally-induced decoherence and
under physically motivated restrictions on the control field. The quantum-gate
fidelity, expressed in terms of a novel state-independent distance measure, is
maximized with respect to the control field using combined genetic and gradient
algorithms. The resulting high-fidelity gates demonstrate the feasibility of
precisely guiding the quantum evolution via optimal control, even when the
system complexity is exacerbated by environmental coupling. It is found that
the gate duration has an important effect on the control mechanism and

quantum formalism begun in Paper I), and derive many of the formal rules (such
as operator rules, commutation relations, and Dirac's Poisson bracket rule)
that are needed to apply the abstract quantum formalism to model particular
physical systems.

  through a non-maximally entangled quantum channel","Comments are welcome; txl@xiyou.edu.cn",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We propose a method of the Bell bases decomposition to teleport an arbitrary
unknown N-qubit state through a nonmaximally entangled quantum channel, and
give the universal decomposition matrix of N-qubit. Using the decomposition
matrix, we can easily obtain the collapsed state at the receiver site. The
inverse matrix that the decomposition matrix is just the transformation matrix
that the receiver can manipulate. The decomposition matrix is a function of the
parameters of the quantum channel. After defining the sub-matrix of the quantum
channel, we find that the decomposition matrix is a tensor product of the
sub-matrixes.

characterization of the phenomenon of quantum catalysis: when can the
surrounding entanglement be used to perform transformations of a jointly held
quantum state under LOCC (local operations and classical communication) ?
Mathematically, the question amounts to describe, for a fixed vector $y$, the
set $T(y)$ of vectors $x$ such that we have $x \otimes z \prec y \otimes z$ for
some $z$, where $\prec$ denotes the standard majorization relation. Our main
result is that the closure of $T(y)$ in the $\ell_1$ norm can be fully
described by inequalities on the $\ell_p$ norms: $\|x\|_p \leq \|y\|_p$ for all
$p \geq 1$. This is a first step towards a complete description of $T(y)$
itself. It can also be seen as a $\ell_p$-norm analogue of Ky Fan dominance
theorem about unitarily invariant norms. The proofs exploits links with another
quantum phenomenon: the possibiliy of multiple-copy transformations
($x^{\otimes n} \prec y^{\otimes n}$ for given $n$). The main new tool is a
variant of Cram\'er$ theorem on large deviations for sums of i.i.d. random
variables.
