independent from other empirical successes of MOND at reproducing the
phenomenology of galactic rotation curves. The galactic escape speed in MOND is
entirely determined by the baryonic content of the Galaxy and the external
field in which it is embedded. We estimate that the external field in which the
Milky Way must be embedded to produce the observed local escape speed of 550
km/s is of the order of a_0/100, where a_0 is the dividing acceleration scale
below which gravity is boosted in MOND. This is compatible with the external
gravitational field actually acting on the Milky Way.

bump'', indicating a transition from a radiatively efficient, geometrically
thin, accretion disc in high-luminosity AGNs, to a geometrically thick,
radiatively inefficient accretion flow at low luminosities and accretion rates.
I revisit the issue of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of
low-luminosity AGNs using recently published, high-angular-resolution data at
radio, UV, and X-ray wavelengths, for a sample of 13 nearby galaxies with LINER
nuclei. I show that, contrary to common wisdom, low-luminosity AGNs have
significant nonstellar UV flux, and UV/X-ray luminosity ratios similar, on
average, to those of Seyfert 1 nuclei ~10^4 times more luminous. The alpha_ox
index that quantifies this ratio is in the range between -0.8 to -1.4, and is
below the extrapolation to low luminosities of the relation between alpha_ ox
and UV luminosity observed at higher luminosities. In terms of radio loudness,
most of the LINERs are indeed radio loud (or sometimes even ``super radio
loud'') based on their radio/UV luminosity ratios, when compared to the most
luminous quasars. However, the entire distribution of radio loudness has been
shown to shift to higher radio/UV ratios at low AGN luminosities. In the
context of this global shift, some LINERs (the majority) can be considered
radio quiet, and some (from among those with black hole masses >~10^8.5 M_sun)
are radio loud. The SEDs of low-luminosity (~10^40 erg/s) AGNs are thus quite
similar to those of Seyferts up to luminosities of ~10^44erg/s, and there is no
evidence for a sharp change in the SEDs at the lowest luminosities. Thin AGN
accretion discs may therefore persist at low accretion rates, in analogy to
some recent findings for Galactic stellar-mass accreting black holes.

possible ionization effects in these systems. For the systems in which we could
constrain the ionization parameter, we find that the ionization corrections as
predicted by the Cloudy models are generally small and within the typical error
bars (~0.15 dex), in general agreement with previous studies. The Al III to Al

find that while the sub-DLAs have a larger scatter in the Al III to Al II

the profile for these systems is investigated. We show that the sub-DLAs that

more metal rich systems exhibiting large velocity widths. We also find that the

interstellar medium, it is not yet reliably explored to what extent the
diagnostic HII gas is already contaminated by chemically processed stellar wind
matter. In a recent paper, we therefore analyzed our models of radiation-driven
and wind-blown HII bubbles around an isolated 85 Msun star with originally
solar metallicity with respect to its chemical abundances. Although the hot
stellar wind bubble (SWB) is enriched with 14N during the WN phase and even
much higher with 12C and 16O during the WC phase of the star, we found that at
the end of the stellar lifetime the mass ratios of the traced lements N and O

enrichment of 22% above solar is found for C. The transport of enriched
elements from the hot SWB to the cool gas occurs mainly by means of mixing of
hot gas with cooler at the backside of the SWB shell.

and topological constraints on the current-carrying solar loops are obtained by
assuming that the plasma filament is stable. This is analogous to early
computations by Liley [(Plasma Physics (1964)] in the case of hydromagnetic
equilibria of magnetic surfaces. It is shown that exists a relationship between
the ratio of the current components along and cross the plasma filament and the
Frenet torsion and curvature. The computations are performed for the helical
plasma filaments where torsion and curvature are proportional. The constraints
imposed on the electric currents by the energy stability condition are used to
solve the remaining magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) equations which in turn allows
us to compute magnetic helicity and from them the twist and writhe topological
numbers. Magnetic energy is also computed from the solutions of MHD equations.

paper, we use a ~ 160 ks XMM-Newton RGS spectrum to get the most accurate view
yet of the ionised outflow (warm absorber) in NGC 7469 as seen in X-rays,
finding that there is a wide range of ionisation, with log xi in the range ~
0.5-3.5 erg cm s^-1, and two main velocity regimes, at 580-720 and 2300 km
s^-1, with the highest velocity gas being the least ionised. The total
absorbing column density in the X-rays is of order 3 x 10^21 cm^-2. We find
that the lowest ionisation phase of the absorber is probably identical with one
of the phases of the UV absorber discovered in previous studies. We show that
both X-ray and UV absorbers are consistent with an origin near the base of a
torus wind, where matter is being launched and accelerated. Calculating the
mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity of all the absorber phases, we
demonstrate that the X-ray absorbing gas carries respectively ~ 90% and 95% of
the mass and kinetic energy output of the ionised outflow.

theoretically. Limiting cases of scattering under Zeeman effect and Hanle
effect in weak magnetic fields are discussed. The theory is general enough to
handle scattering in intermediate magnetic fields (Hanle-Zeeman effect) and for
arbitrary orientation of magnetic field. The quadrupolar electric field
produces asymmetric line shifts and causes interesting level-crossing phenomena
either in the absence of an ambient magnetic field or in its presence. It is
shown that the quadrupolar electric field produces an additional depolarization
in the $Q/I$ profiles and rotation of the plane of polarization in the $U/I$
profile over and above that arising from magnetic field itself. This
characteristic may have a diagnostic potential to detect steady state and time

particles, like the excitons, which are made of two fermions. Although commonly
dealed with as elementary bosons, these composite bosons -- ``cobosons'' in
short -- differ from them due to their composite nature which makes the
handling of their many-body effects quite different from the existing
treatments valid for elementary bosons. Due to this composite nature, it is not
possible to correctly describe the interaction between cobosons as a potential
$V$. Consequently, the standard Fermi golden rule, written in terms of $V$,
cannot be used to obtain the transition rates between exciton states. Through
an unconventional expression for this Fermi golden rule, which is here given in
terms of the Hamiltonian only, we here give a detailed calculation of the time
evolution of two excitons. We compare the results of this exact approach with
the ones obtained by using an effective bosonic exciton Hamiltonian. We show
that the relation between the inverse lifetime and the sum of transition rates
for elementary bosons differs from the one of composite bosons by a factor of
1/2, whatever the mapping from composite bosons to elementary bosons is. The
present paper thus constitutes a strong mathematical proof that, in spite of a
widely spread belief, we cannot forget the composite nature of these cobosons,
even in the extremely low density limit of just two excitons. This paper also
shows the (unexpected) cancellation, in the Born approximation, of the
two-exciton transition rate for a finite value of the momentum transfer.

derivative of the cycle probabilities is related to the probability of
condensing k bosons. We use this relation to derive the precise form of the
\pi_k in the thermodynamic limit. We also determine the function \pi_k for
arbitrary systems. Furthermore we use the cycle probabilities to compute the
probability distribution of the maximum-length cycles both at T=0, where the

argue that in the two-band superconductor MgB_2 such a case is realised.
Motivated by the experimental findings on MgB_2, we assume that
superconductivity in the diffusive band is ``weak'', i.e., mostly induced. We
examine intriguing features of the order parameter, the current density, and
the vortex core spectrum in the ``strong'' ballistic band under the influence
of hybridization with the ``weak'' diffusive band. Although the order parameter
in the diffusive band is induced, the characteristic length scales in the two
bands differ due to Coulomb interactions. The current density in the vortex
core is dominated by the contribution from the ballistic band, while outside
the core the contribution from the diffusive band can be substantial, or even
dominating. The current density in the diffusive band has strong temperature
dependence, exhibiting the Kramer-Pesch effect when hybridization is strong. A
particularly interesting feature of our model is the possibility of additional
bound states near the gap edge in the ballistic band, that are prominent in the
vortex centre spectra. This contrasts with the single band case, where there is
no gap-edge bound state in the vortex centre. We find the above-mentioned
unique features for parameter values relevant for MgB_2.

proposed approach has more general scope, for the sake of clarity we focus on a
specific application example, namely, the transmission of digital images over
noisy binary-input output-symmetric channels. The basic building blocks of most
state-of the art source coders are: 1) a linear transformation; 2) scalar
quantization of the transform coefficients; 3) probability modeling of the
sequence of quantization indices; 4) an entropy coding stage. We identify the
weakness of the conventional separated source-channel coding approach in the
catastrophic behavior of the entropy coding stage. Hence, we replace this stage
with linear coding, that maps directly the sequence of redundant quantizer
output symbols into a channel codeword. We show that this approach does not
entail any loss of optimality in the asymptotic regime of large block length.
However, in the practical regime of finite block length and low decoding
complexity our approach yields very significant improvements. Furthermore, our
scheme allows to retain the transform, quantization and probability modeling of
current state-of the art source coders, that are carefully matched to the
features of specific classes of sources. In our working example, we make use of
``bit-planes'' and ``contexts'' model defined by the JPEG2000 standard and we
re-interpret the underlying probability model as a sequence of conditionally
Markov sources. The Markov structure allows to derive a simple successive
coding and decoding scheme, where the latter is based on iterative Belief
Propagation. We provide a construction example of the proposed scheme based on
punctured Turbo Codes and we demonstrate the gain over a conventional separated
scheme by running extensive numerical experiments on test images.

where the extra structure on a map now encodes a choice of liftings with

example, a natural w.f.s. on C induces a canonical natural w.f.s. structure on

produces factorisations which are much smaller and easier to handle, and show

its generating cofibrations. Finally, we show that the two categories of

hypoellipticity assumptions on the diffusion. In this paper, we considerably
weaken these assumptions in order to allow for the diffusion coefficient to
even vanish on an open set.
  As a consequence, it is no longer the case that the effective diffusivity
matrix is necessarily non-degenerate. It turns out that, provided that some
very weak regularity conditions are met, the range of the effective diffusivity
matrix can be read off the shape of the support of the invariant measure for
the periodic diffusion. In particular, this gives some easily verifiable
conditions for the effective diffusivity matrix to be of full rank. We also

decompression. This paper proposed an experimental method to quantify the

concerned one clinical case. The eyeball's backward displacement was measured
by an optical 3D localizer and the load applied by the surgeon was
simultaneously measured by a custom-made force gauge. Quasi-static stiffness of
the intra-orbital content was evaluated. The average values for the whole
experiment was 16 N (SD: 3 N) for the force exerted by the surgeon and 9 mm

control protein functions. We have recently proposed a dynamical description of
multisite protein modification which embodies all the essential features of the
process (E. Milotti, A. Del Fabbro, C. Dalla Pellegrina, and R. Chignola,
Physica A, in press), and we have used this model to analyze the stability and
the time-scales of this mechanism. The same model can be used to understand how
the system responds to stimuli: here we show that it displays
frequency-dependent dynamical hysteresis. This behavior closely parallels --
with the due differences -- what is observed in magnetic systems. By selecting
model parameters that span the known biological ranges, we find that the
frequency-dependent features cover the band of the observed oscillations of
molecular intracellular signals, and this suggests that this mechanism may have
an important role in cellular information processing.

the space-time in order to enable us to find a connection between
electrodynamics and gravitation, from where quantum principles naturally
emerge. To do that, first of all we build a heuristic model of the
electromagnetic nature of the electron so that the influence of the
gravitational field on the electrodynamics of such moving particle leads us
essentially to an elimination of the classical idea of rest by introducing the
idea of a universal minimum limit of speed ($V$). Such a lowest limit $V$,
being unattainable by the particles, represents a fundamental and preferred
reference frame connected to a universal background field (a vacuum energy)
that breaks Lorentz symmetry. So there emerges a new principle of symmetry in
the space-time at the subatomic level for very low energies close to the
background frame ($v\approx V$), providing a fundamental understanding for the
uncertainty principle.

expenditure and is clearly a nonequilibrium process for which standard
equilibrium thermodynamics is not rigorously applicable. Here we derive a

energy invested by the membrane. A novel method is used whereby a Hamiltonian
function is constructed using particle concentrations as generalized
coordinates. The associated generalized momenta are simply related to the
individual particle energy from which we identify the effective potential.
Examples are given and the formalism is compared with the equilibrium Gibb's

their use in the analysis of stochastic SIR epidemic models on undirected
contact networks. We then show how the same theory can be used to analyze
stochastic SIR models with random and proportionate mixing. The epidemic
percolation networks for these models are purely directed because undirected
edges disappear in the limit of a large population. In a series of simulations,
we show that epidemic percolation networks accurately predict the mean outbreak
size and probability and final size of an epidemic for a variety of epidemic
models in homogeneous and heterogeneous populations. Finally, we show that
epidemic percolation networks can be used to re-derive classical results from
several different areas of infectious disease epidemiology. In an appendix, we
show that an epidemic percolation network can be defined for any
time-homogeneous stochastic SIR model in a closed population and prove that the
distribution of outbreak sizes given the infection of any given node in the SIR
model is identical to the distribution of its out-component sizes in the
corresponding probability space of epidemic percolation networks. We conclude
that the theory of percolation on semi-directed networks provides a very
general framework for the analysis of stochastic SIR models in closed
populations.

demonstrate the construction of two forms of the action variable for a one
dimensional harmonic oscillator in classical, relativistic and quantum regimes.
The relativistic effects are considered as perturbative, within the context of
a non-relativistic quantum formalism. The transition of the relativistic
quantum system to both classical relativistic and classical non-relativistic
regimes is illustrated in a unified framework. Formulas for the frequency of a
classical relativistic oscillator and the energy eigenvalues of the
corresponding quantum oscillator for the weak relativistic case are derived.
Also studied are the non-relativistic and classical limits of these formulas
which provide valuable insights on the parallels between relativistic and
non-relativistic systems on the one hand and between classical and quantum
systems on the other.

exponentially and it also increases the mean photon number.
