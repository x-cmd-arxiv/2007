Supernovae (SNe) explosions of Type Ib/c. We intend to test whether the
hypothesis of Type Ib/c SNe from different massive progenitors can reproduce
the local GRB rate as well as the GRB rate as a function of redshift. We aim to
predict the GRB rate at very high redshift under different assumptions about
galaxy formation and star formation histories in galaxies. We assume different
star formation histories in galaxies of different morphological type:
ellipticals, spirals and irregulars. We explore different hypotheses concerning
the progenitors of Type Ib/c SNe. We find an excellent agreement between the
observed GRB local rate and the predicted Type Ib/c SN rate in irregular
galaxies, when a range for single Wolf-Rayet stars of 40-100 M_sun is adopted.
We also predict the cosmic Type Ib/c SN rate by taking into account all the
galaxy types in an unitary volume of the Universe and we compare it with the
observed cosmic GRB rate as a function of redshift. By assuming the formation
of spheroids at high redshift, we predict a cosmic Type Ib/c SN rate, which is
always higher than the GRB rate, suggesting that only a small fraction (0.1-1
%) of Type Ib/c SNe become GRBs. In particular, we find a ratio between the
cosmic GRB rate and the cosmic Type Ib/c rate in the range 0.001-0.01, in
agreement with previous estimates. Finally, due to the high star formation in
spheroids at high redshift, which is our preferred scenario for galaxy
formation, we predict more GRBs at high redshift than in the hierarchical
scenario for galaxy formation, a prediction which awaits to be proven by future
observations.

the problem. Furthermore, the inclusion of radiative transfer allows us to
directly compare the simulation results with actual observations of emerging
flux. We find that the interaction between the magnetic flux tube and the
external flow field has an important influence on the emergent morphology of
the magnetic field. Depending on the initial properties of the flux tube (e.g.
field strength, twist, entropy etc.), the emergence process can also modify the
local granulation pattern. The emergence of magnetic flux tubes with a flux of

Its wide frequency coverage, superb receivers and flexible spectrometer will

Science\cite{RefA}, the ALMA team has substantially enhanced its capability for
line observations. ALMA's sensitivity increased when Japan joined the project,
bringing the 16 antennas of the Atacama Compcat Array (ACA), equivalent to
eight additional 12m telescopes. The first four receiver cartridges for the
baseline ALMA (Japan's entry has brought two additional bands to ALMA's
receiver retinue) have been accepted, with performance above the
already-challenging specifications. ALMA's flexibility has increased with the
enhancement of the baseline correlator with additional channels and
flexibility, and with the addition of a separate correlator for the ACA. As an
example of the increased flexibility, ALMA is now capable of
multi-spectral-region and multi-resolution modes. With the former, one might
observe e.g. four separate transitions anywhere within a 2 GHz band with a high
resolution bandwidth. With the latter, one might simultaneously observe with
low spectral resolution over a wide bandwidth and with high spectral resolution
over a narrow bandwidth; this mode could be useful for observations of
pressure-broadened lines with narrow cores, for example. Several science
examples illustrate ALMA's potential for transforming millimeter and

show that IR pumping via the 14 micron bending mode of HCN is the most likely

CO conversion factor is higher than usually assumed for high-z galaxies with
alpha~5 SM/(K km/s pc^2). Using brightness temperature arguments, the results

that the molecular lines and the dust continuum emission arise from a very
compact (r~100-300 pc), highly gravitationally magnified (m= 60-110) region
surrounding the central AGN. Part of the difference relative to other high-$z$

APM08279+5255 where IR pumping plays a significant role for the excitation of

authors since 1970. Recently, it has been pointed out that two putative neutron
stars, RXJ 1856.5 - 3754 in Corona Australis and 3C58 in Cassiopeia are too
small and too dense to be neutron stars; they show evidence of being quark
stars. Apart from these two objects, there are several other compact objects
which fit neither in the category of neutron stars nor in that of black holes.
It has been suggested that they may be quark stars.In this paper it is shown
that a black hole cannot collapse to a singularity, instead it may end up as a
quark star. In this context it is shown that a gravitationally collapsing black
hole acts as an ultrahigh energy particle accelerator, hitherto inconceivable
in any terrestrial laboratory, that continually accelerates particles
comprising the matter in the black hole. When the energy \textit{E} of the
particles in the black hole is $\geq 10^{2}$GeV, or equivalently the
temperature \textit{T} of the matter in the black holes is $\geq 10^{15}$K, the
entire matter in the black hole will be converted into quark-gluon plasma
permeated by leptons. Since quarks and leptons are spin 1/2 particles,they are
governed by Pauli's exclusion principle. Consequently, one of the two
possibilities will occur; either Pauli's exclusion principle would be violated
and the black hole would collapse to a singularity, or the collapse of the
black hole to a singularity would be inhibited by Pauli's exclusion principle,
and the black hole would eventually explode with a mini bang of a sort. After
explosion, the remnant core would stabilize as a quark star.

be located near the periphery. The colours of the GLIMPSE point sources

value of the neutron exposure will reach about 7.0 mbarn$^{-1}$, which is close
to the theoretical predictions by the AGB model. The calculated result is a
significant evidence for the primary nature of the neutron source. Combining
the result obtained in this work and the neutron exposure-initial mass

gamma-rays produced through hadronic interactions. While gamma-rays can be

the most straightforward and unambiguous information about the nucleonic

including the effects of strong stratification, compressibility, partial
ionization, radiative transfer, as well as an open lower boundary. Results:
Exponential growth of a weak magnetic seed field (with vanishing net flux

electrically control the core magnetisation, which is a key for constructing a

switching of the core magnetisation by utilizing the current-driven resonant
dynamics of the vortex; the core switching is triggered by a strong dynamic
field which is produced locally by a rotational core motion at a high speed of
several hundred m/s. Efficient switching of the vortex core without magnetic
field application is achieved thanks to resonance. This opens up the
potentiality of a simple magnetic disk as a building block for spintronic
devices like a memory cell where the bit data is stored as the direction of the

random matrix methods to calculate the density of stationary points, as well as
minima, of the associated energy surface. This is used to show that for a
generic smooth, concave confining potentials the condition of the
zero-temperature replica symmetry breaking coincides with one signalling that
{\it both} mean total number of stationary points in the energy landscape, {\it
and} the mean number of minima are exponential in $N$. For such systems the
(annealed) complexity of minima vanishes cubically when approaching the
critical confinement, whereas the cumulative annealed complexity vanishes
quadratically. Different behaviour reported in our earlier short communication
[Y.V. Fyodorov et al., {\it JETP Lett.} {\bf 85}, 261, (2007)] was due to
non-analyticity of the hard-wall confinement potential. Finally, for the
simplest case of parabolic confinement we investigate how the complexity
depends on the index of stationary points. In particular, we show that in the
vicinity of critical confinement the saddle-points with a positive annealed
complexity must be close to minima, as they must have a vanishing {\it

statistics over a sliding window of some fixed time-horizon. What makes the
streaming model interesting is that as the time progresses, old items expire
and new ones arrive. One of the simplest and central tasks in this model is
sampling. That is, the task of maintaining up to $k$ uniformly distributed
items from a current time-window as old items expire and new ones arrive. We
call sampling algorithms {\bf succinct} if they use provably optimal (up to
constant factors) {\bf worst-case} memory to maintain $k$ items (either with or

sufficient, as small probability events eventually happen with probability 1.

somewhat surprisingly, we show that $S^3$-algorithms are possible for {\em all}

calculus. One of its contributions is the simplification and rationalization of
the suspension calculus that embodies such a treatment. The earlier version of
this calculus provides a cumbersome encoding of substitution composition, an
operation that is important to the efficient realization of reduction. This
encoding is simplified here, resulting in a treatment that is easy to use
directly in applications. The rationalization consists of the elimination of a
practically inconsequential flexibility in the unravelling of substitutions
that has the inadvertent side effect of losing contextual information in terms;
the modified calculus now has a structure that naturally supports logical
analyses, such as ones related to the assignment of types, over lambda terms.
The overall calculus is shown to have pleasing theoretical properties such as a
strongly terminating sub-calculus for substitution and confluence even in the
presence of term meta variables that are accorded a grafting interpretation.
Another contribution of the paper is the identification of a broad set of
properties that are desirable for explicit substitution calculi to support and
a classification of a variety of proposed systems based on these. The
suspension calculus is used as a tool in this study. In particular, mappings
are described between it and the other calculi towards understanding the
characteristics of the latter.

This singlet have prospects of causing a very large mass hierarchy between
SU(2)L and SU(2)R triplet scalars.
  We test our model by computing baryogenesis via leptogenesis. The heavy
right-handed neutrinos N's and the SU(2)L triplet scalar can generate the
lepton number asymmetry. Leptogenesis scenarios can be categorized by these
mass scales. If the light neutrinos are Majorana and have a hierarchical mass

N-decay. But we found that the normal mass hierarchy of the light neutrinos
conflicts with leptogenesis through triplet-decay.

decomposition of Einstein's theory. Based on the view that Einstein's theory
can be interpreted as a gauge theory of Lorentz group, we decompose the
Einstein's gravitational connection (the gauge potential of Lorentz group
$\vGm_\mu$) into the restricted connection made of the potential of the maximal
Abelian subgroup $H$ of Lorentz group $G$ and the valence connection made of
$G/H$ part of the potential which transforms covariantly under Lorentz group.
With this decomposition we show that the Einstein's theory can be decomposed
into the restricted part made of the restricted connection which has the full
Lorentz gauge invariance and the valence part made of the valence connection
which plays the role of gravitational source of the restricted gravity. We show
that there are two different Abelian decomposition of Einstein's theory,
because Lorentz group has two maximal Abelian subgroups. In this decomposition
the role of the space-time metric $g_\mn$ is replaced by a four-index metric
tensor $\vg_\mn$ which transforms covariantly under the Lorentz group, and the
metric-compatibility condition $\nabla_\alpha g_\mn=0$ of the connection is
replaced by the gauge covariant condition $D_\mu \vg^\mn$ which tells that
$\vg_\mn$ is invariant under the parallel transport along the
$\pro_\mu$-direction defined by $\vGm_\mu$. We discuss the physical
implications of the Abelian decomposition. In particular, we argue that the
decomposition implies the existence of a restricted theory of gravitation which
has the full general invariance but has less physical degrees of freedom.

$X_t=Z_t-\theta_0Z_{t-1}$, with independent and identically distributed
$\{Z_t\}$. This is arguably the simplest time series model that one can write
down. The MA(1) with unit root ($\theta_0=1$) arises naturally in a variety of
time series applications. For example, if an underlying time series consists of
a linear trend plus white noise errors, then the differenced series is an MA(1)
with unit root. In such cases, testing for a unit root of the differenced
series is equivalent to testing the adequacy of the trend plus noise model. The
unit root problem also arises naturally in a signal plus noise model in which
the signal is modeled as a random walk. The differenced series follows a MA(1)
model and has a unit root if and only if the random walk signal is in fact a
constant. The asymptotic theory of various estimators based on Gaussian
likelihood has been developed for the unit root case and nearly unit root case
($\theta=1+\beta/n,\beta\le0$). Unlike standard $1/\sqrt{n}$-asymptotics, these
estimation procedures have $1/n$-asymptotics and a so-called pile-up effect, in
which P$(\hat{\theta}=1)$ converges to a positive value. One explanation for
this pile-up phenomenon is the lack of identifiability of $\theta$ in the
Gaussian case. That is, the Gaussian likelihood has the same value for the two
sets of parameter values $(\theta,\sigma^2)$ and $(1/\theta,\theta^2\sigma^2$).
It follows that $\theta=1$ is always a critical point of the likelihood
function. In contrast, for non-Gaussian noise, $\theta$ is identifiable for all
real values. Hence it is no longer clear whether or not the same pile-up
phenomenon will persist in the non-Gaussian case. In this paper, we focus on
limiting pile-up probabilities for estimates of $\theta_0$ based on a Laplace
likelihood. In some cases, these estimates can be viewed as Least Absolute
Deviation (LAD) estimates. Simulation results illustrate the limit theory.

parameters or assume the stationarity of the series. Not much are known on the
forecasting theory for nonstationary process with estimated parameters. This
paper investigates the recursive least square forecast for stationary and
nonstationary processes with unit roots. We first prove that the accumulated
forecast mean square error can be decomposed into two components, one of which
arises from estimation uncertainty and the other from the disturbance term. The
former, of the order of $\log(T)$, is of second order importance to the latter
term, of the order T. However, since the latter is common for all predictors,
it is the former that determines the property of each predictor. Our theorem
implies that the improvement of forecasting precision is of the order of
$\log(T)$ when existence of unit root is properly detected and taken into
account. Also, our theorem leads to a new proof of strong consistency of
predictive least squares in model selection and a new test of unit root where
no regression is needed. The simulation results confirm our theoretical
findings. In addition, we find that while mis-specification of AR order and
under-specification of the number of unit root have marginal impact on
forecasting precision, over-specification of the number of unit root strongly
deteriorates the quality of long term forecast. As for the empirical study
using Taiwanese data, the results are mixed. Adaptive forecast and imposing
unit root improve forecast precision for some cases but deteriorate forecasting
precision for other cases.

vector field. This is used in showing that double (or higher) vector bundles
present in the literature can be equivalently defined as manifolds with a
family of commuting Euler vector fields. Higher vector bundles can be therefore
defined as manifolds admitting certain $\N^n$-grading in the structure sheaf.
Consequently, multi-graded (super)manifolds are canonically associated with
higher vector bundles that is an equivalence of categories. Of particular
interest are symplectic multi-graded manifolds which are proven to be
associated with cotangent bundles. Duality for higher vector bundles is then
explained by means of the cotangent bundles as they contain the collection of
all possible duals. This gives, moreover, higher generalizations of the known
`universal Legendre transformation' T*E->T*E*, identifying the cotangent
bundles of all higher vector bundles in duality. The symplectic multi-graded
manifolds, equipped with certain homological Hamiltonian vector fields, lead to
an alternative to Roytenberg's picture generalization of Lie bialgebroids,
Courant brackets, Drinfeld doubles and can be viewed as geometrical base for
higher BRST and Batalin-Vilkovisky formalisms. This is also a natural framework
for studying n-fold Lie algebroids and related structures.

for every $(a_1, ..., a_n) \in A^n$, the sign of $P(a_1,...,a_n)$ equals
$(-1)^{f(a_1,...,a_n)}$. Such sign representations are well-studied in computer
science and have applications to computational complexity and computational
learning theory. In this work, we present a systematic study of tradeoffs
between degree and sparsity of sign representations through the lens of the
parity function. We attempt to prove bounds that hold for any choice of set
$A$. We show that sign representing parity over $\{0,...,m-1\}^n$ with the
degree in each variable at most $m-1$ requires sparsity at least $m^n$. We show
that a tradeoff exists between sparsity and degree, by exhibiting a sign
representation that has higher degree but lower sparsity. We show a lower bound
of $n(m -2) + 1$ on the sparsity of polynomials of any degree representing
parity over $\{0,..., m-1\}^n$. We prove exact bounds on the sparsity of such
polynomials for any two element subset $A$. The main tool used is Descartes'
Rule of Signs, a classical result in algebra, relating the sparsity of a
polynomial to its number of real roots. As an application, we use bounds on
sparsity to derive circuit lower bounds for depth-two AND-OR-NOT circuits with
a Threshold Gate at the top. We use this to give a simple proof that such
circuits need size $1.5^n$ to compute parity, which improves the previous bound
of ${4/3}^{n/2}$ due to Goldmann (1997). We show a tight lower bound of $2^n$

a 12th order rod model and the computational effort increases rapidly with
increasing cable length and integration time. However, marine cable

large zones of high-tension where the effects of flexure and torsion are

  Metapopulations","9 pages, 11 figures","PLoS ONE 2(2): e233 (2007)","10.1371/journal.pone.0000233",,"q-bio.PE",,"  A large number of theoretical studies predict that the dynamics of spatially
structured populations (metapopulations) can be altered by constant
perturbations to local population size. However, these studies presume large
metapopulations inhabiting noise-free, zero-extinction environments, and their
predictions have never been empirically verified.
  Here we report an empirical study on the effects of localized perturbations
on global dynamics and stability, using fruitfly metapopulations in the
laboratory. We find that constant addition of individuals to a particular
subpopulation in every generation stabilizes that subpopulation locally, but
does not have any detectable effect on the dynamics and stability of the
metapopulation. Simulations of our experimental system using a simple but
widely applicable model of population dynamics were able to recover the
empirical findings, indicating the generality of our results. We then simulated
the possible consequences of perturbing more subpopulations, increasing the
strength of perturbations, and varying the rate of migration, but found that
none of these conditions were expected to alter the outcomes of our
experiments. Finally, we show that our main results are robust to the presence
of local extinctions in the metapopulation.
  Our study shows that localized perturbations are unlikely to affect the
dynamics of real metapopulations, a finding that has cautionary implications
for ecologists and conservation biologists faced with the problem of
stabilizing unstable metapopulations in nature.

population in the framework of three possible scenarios. In two of the cases,
bistability provides the basis for binary gene expression. In the third case,
the system is monostable in a deterministic description and stochasticity in
gene expression is solely responsible for the appearance of the two expression
states.

Lett. v98, p230503 (2007)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.230503",,"quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  We propose an experimentally feasible architecture with controllable
long-range couplings built up from local exchange interactions. The scheme
consists of a spin-bus, with strong, always-on interactions, coupled
dynamically to external qubits of the Loss and DiVincenzo type. Long-range
correlations are enabled by a spectral gap occurring in a finite-size chain.
The bus can also form a hub for multiqubit entangling operations. We show how
multiqubit gates may be used to efficiently generate $W$-states (an important
entanglement resource). The spin-bus therefore provides a route for scalable
solid-state quantum computation, using currently available experimental
resources.

  to appear in QIC vol. 8 #5",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We present an extremal result for the class of graphs G which (together with
some specified sets of input and output vertices, I and O) have a certain
""flow"" property introduced by Danos and Kashefi for the one-way measurement
model of quantum computation. The existence of a flow for a triple (G,I,O)
allows a unitary embedding to be derived from any choice of measurement bases
allowed in the one-way measurement model. We prove an upper bound on the number
of edges that a graph G may have, in order for a triple (G,I,O) to have a flow
for some $I, O \subseteq V(G)$, in terms of the number of vertices in G and O.
This implies that finding a flow for a triple (G,I,O) when |I| = |O| = k
(corresponding to unitary transformations in the measurement model) and |V(G)|
= n can be performed in time O(k^2 n), improving the earlier known bound of
O(km) given in [quant-ph/0611284], where m = |E(G)|.

the qubit is encoded in the molecule two-electron spin states. By arranging the
two dots inside each molecule perpendicular to the qubit scaling line, the
interactions between neighboring qubits are largely simplified and the scaling
to multi-qubit system becomes straightforward. As an Ising-model effective
interaction can be expediently switched on and off between any two neighboring
molecules by adjusting the potential offset between the two dots, universal
two-qubit gates can be implemented without requiring time-dependent control of
the tunnel coupling between the dots. A Bell-state measurement scheme for qubit
encoded in double-dot singlet and triplet states is also proposed for quantum
molecules arranged in this way.

thus leading to highly non-physical results. To overcome this problem, we shall
propose an alternative adiabatic procedure which (i) in the semiclassical limit
reduces to the standard Fermi's golden rule, and (ii) describes a genuine
Limblad evolution, thus providing a reliable/robust treatment of
energy-dissipation and dephasing processes.

means of quantum interference effects similar to electromagnetically induced
transparency. Coupling a magnetic dipole transition coherently with an electric
dipole transition leads to electromagnetically induced chirality, which can
provide negative refraction without requiring negative permeability, and also
suppresses absorption. This technique allows negative refraction in the optical
regime at densities where the magnetic susceptibility is still small and with
refraction/absorption ratios that are orders of magnitude larger than those
achievable previously. Furthermore, the value of the refractive index can be
fine-tuned via external laser fields, which is essential for practical
realization of sub-diffraction-limit imaging.
