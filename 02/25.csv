codes, which will be used during self-consistent modelling of dynamics and
chemistry in the winds from C-rich AGB stars. We use the thermodynamical
equilibrium code to test the different databases of dissociation constants. We
also calculate the equilibrium content of the gas using the kinetic code, which
includes the chemical network of neutral--neutral reactions studied by Willacy
& Cherchneff (1998). The influence of reaction rates updated using the UMIST
database for Astrochemistry 2005 (UDFA05), was tested.
  The local thermodynamical equilibrium calculations have shown that the NIST
database reproduces fairly well equilibrium concentrations of Willacy &
Cherchneff (1998), while agreement in case of Tsuji (1973) dissociation
constants is much worse. The most important finding is that the steady state
solution obtained with the kinetic code for reaction network of Willacy &
Cherchneff (1998) is different from the thermodynamical equilibrium solution.
In particular, CN and C2, which are important opacity sources are underabundant
relative to hermodynamical equilibrium, while O-bearing molecules (like SiO,
H2O, and OH) are overabundant. After updating the reaction rates by data from
the UDFA05 database consistency in O-bearing species becomes much better,
however the disagreement in C-bearing species is still present.

mass, Ms. We investigate three basic possibilities: (1) a standard constant
alphaCE prescription, with alphaCE = 1.0, 0.6, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05, to
provide a baseline for comparison, (2) a power law dependence, alphaCE =
(Ms)^n, with n = 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0, and (3) a dependence in which alphaCE
approaches1 for large secondary masses and alphaCE = 0 below some assumed
cutoff mass, alphaCE = 1 - Mcut/Ms, where Mcut is the cutoff mass and is equal
to 0.0375, 0.075 and 0.15 solar mass. For each population, we compute orbital
period, orbital separation, white dwarf mass and secondary mass distributions.
  We find that if alphaCE is less than ~0.2 in our constant alphaCE sequence,
the predicted present-day ZACV population is significantly modified compared
with our standard model (alphaCE = 1.0). In our variable alphaCE sequences for
ZACVs, we find that for models in which alphaCE decreases very rapidly for
small secondary masses, the orbital period distribution below the period gap
differs significantly from our standard model. These differences are most
evident in our power law sequence model with n = 2 and in our cutoff mass
sequence model with Mcut = 0.15 solar mass. In these two models, the fraction
of CVs forming with orbital periods below the gap is reduced significantly, the
fraction forming in the gap is increased significantly, and both the

cloud and associated with the H II region NGC6334--D, there is a molecular
""void"". [C I] correlates well with 13^CO and other molecular lines and shows no
rim brightening relative to molecular cloud regions farther off the void. While
an interpretation in terms of a highly clumped cloud morphology is possible,
with photon dominated regions (PDRs) reaching deep into the cloud, the data do

Kinetic temperatures are ~40--50K in the molecular cloud and >=200K toward the

radio continuum as well as the distribution of 2.2um H_2 emission indicates
that the well-evolved H II region expands into a medium that is homogeneous on
pc-scales. If the H_2 emission is predominantly shock excited, both the
expanding ionization front (classified as subsonic, ""D-type"") and the
associated shock front farther out (traced by H_2) can be identified,
observationally confirming for the first time a classical scenario that is
predicted by evolutionary models of H II regions. Integrated line intensity
ratios of the observed molecules are determined, implying a mean C18^O/C17^O
abundance ratio of 4.13+-0.13 that reflects the 18^O/17^O isotope ratio. This
ratio is consistent with values determined in nearby clouds. Right at the edge
of the void, however, the oxygen isotope ratio might be smaller.

known that the problem of exact maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding of general
linear codes is NP-hard. In this paper, we show that exact ML decoding of a
classs of asymptotically good error correcting codes--expander codes, a special
case of low density parity check (LDPC) codes--over binary symmetric channels
(BSCs) is possible with an expected polynomial complexity. More precisely, for
any bit-flipping probability, $p$, in a nontrivial range, there exists a rate
region of non-zero support and a family of asymptotically good codes, whose
error probability decays exponentially in coding length $n$, for which ML
decoding is feasible in expected polynomial time. Furthermore, as $p$
approaches zero, this rate region approaches the channel capacity region. The
result is based on the existence of polynomial-time suboptimal decoding
algorithms that provide an ML certificate and the ability to compute the
probability that the suboptimal decoder yields the ML solution. One such ML
certificate decoder is the LP decoder of Feldman; we also propose a more
efficient $O(n^2)$ algorithm based on the work of Sipser and Spielman and the
Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. The results can be extended to AWGN channels and
suggest that it may be feasible to eliminate the error floor phenomenon
associated with message-passage decoding of LDPC codes in the high SNR regime.
Finally, we observe that the argument of Berlekamp, McEliece and van Tilborg
can be used to show that ML decoding of the considered class of codes
constructed from LDPC codes with regular left degree, of which the considered
expander codes are a special case, remains NP-hard; thus giving an interesting
contrast between the worst-case and expected complexities.

fragmentation functions are estimated in this analysis. The results indicate
that the fragmentation functions, especially gluon and light-quark
fragmentation functions, have large uncertainties at small $Q^2$. There are
large differences between widely-used functions by KKP (Kniehl, Kramer, and
P\""otter) and Kretzer; however, they are compatible with each other and also
with our functions if the uncertainties are taken into account. We find that
determination of the fragmentation functions is improved in
next-to-leading-order (NLO) analyses for the pion and kaon in comparison with
leading-order ones. Such a NLO improvement is not obvious in the proton. Since
the uncertainties are large at small $Q^2$, the uncertainty estimation is very
important for analyzing hadron-production data at small $Q^2$ or $p_T$ ($Q^2,
p_T^2 << M_Z^2$) in lepton scattering and hadron-hadron collisions. A code is

  Physics","J. Chem. Phys. 126, 134107 (2007)","10.1063/1.2716387",,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci quant-ph",,"  This work identifies geometric effects on dynamics due to nonadiabatic
couplings in Born Oppenheimer systems and provides a systematic method for
deriving corrections to mixed quantum-classical methods. Specifically, an exact
path integral formulation of the quantum nonadiabatic dynamics of Born
Oppenheimer systems is described. Stationary phase approximations to the
propagator for full quantum dynamics are derived. It is shown that quantum
corrections to mixed quantum classical methods can be obtained through
stationary phase approximations to the full quantum dynamics. A rigorous
description of the quantum corrections due to electronic nonadiabatic coupling
on the nuclear dynamics within the Ehrenfest framework is obtained. The fewest
switches surface hopping method is shown to be obtained as a quasiclassical
approximation to the dynamics and natural semiclassical extensions to include
classically forbidden nonadiabatic transitions are suggested.

the outcome of the algorithm. Particularly, the performance of Grover's search
algorithm gets worsened if the initial state of the algorithm is an entangled
one. Biham et al [14] have shown that the success probability of search
algorithm can be seen as an operational measure of entanglement. Following the
same line of thought, analytical expressions for entanglement measure for three
and five qubit system have been derived, which reveals that entanglement
measure based on Grover's search algorithm is valid for any state with real
coefficients for even number of qubits.

teleportation have been proposed using different types of channels. Not
restricting to qubit based systems, qutrit states and channels have also been
of considerable interest. In the present paper we investigate the teleportation
of an unknown single qutrit state as well as two qutrit state through a three

This is further generalized to the case of teleportation of n-qutrit system.

nonlocal phenomenon as well as its classical limit in terms of Bohmian

appearance. As an illustration, theoretical results obtained from diffraction
