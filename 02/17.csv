colliding wind binary systems. To make the calculations tractable, we assume
adiabatic, constant velocity winds. The neglect of radiative driving,
gravitational deceleration, and cooling limit the application of our models to
real systems. However, these assumptions allow us to isolate the effect of the
Coriolis force, and by simplifying the calculations, allow us to use a higher
resolution (up to 640^3) and to conduct a larger survey of parameter space. We
study the dynamics of collidng winds with equal mass loss rates and velocities
emanating from equal mass stars on circular orbits, with a range of values for
the ratio of the wind to orbital velocity. We also study the dynamics of winds
from stars on elliptical orbits and with unequal strength winds. Orbital motion
of the stars sweeps the shocked wind gas into an Archimedean spiral, with
asymmetric shock strengths and therefore unequal postshock temperatures and
densities in the leading and trailing edges of the spiral. We observe the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the contact surface between the shocked winds
in systems with orbital motion even when the winds are identical. The change in
shock strengths caused by orbital motion increases the volume of X-ray emitting
post-shock gas with T > 0.59 keV by 63% for a typical system as the ratio of
wind velocity to orbital velocity decreases to V_w/V_o = 2.5. This causes
increased free-free emission from systems with shorter orbital periods and an
altered time-dependence of the wind attenuation. We comment on the importance
of the effects of orbital motion on the observable properties of colliding wind
binaries.

corona. It uses radioastronomical polarization measurements of a
spatially-extended radio source viewed through the corona. The observations
yield the difference in the Faraday rotation measure between two closely-spaced
lines of sight through the corona, a measurement referred to as {\em
differential Faraday rotation}. It is shown that the expression for
differential Faraday rotation is proportional to the path integral $\oint n
\vec{B}\cdot \vec{ds}$ where $n$ is the plasma density and $\vec{B}$ is the
coronal magnetic field. The integral is around a closed loop (Amperian Loop) in
the corona. If the plasma density is assumed roughly constant, the differential
Faraday rotation is proportional to the current within the loop, via Ampere's
Law. The validity of the constant density approximation is discussed, and two
test cases are presented in which the associated error in the inferred current
is small, of order tens of percent or less. The method is illustrated with
observations of the radio source 3C228 with the Very Large Array (VLA) in
August, 2003. A measurement of a differential Faraday rotation ``event'' on
August 16, 2003, yields an estimate of $2.5 \times 10^9$ Amperes in the
Amperian Loop. A smaller event on August 18 yields an enclosed current of $2.3

iron, and we searched for stellar and substellar companions around the

differential abundance analysis for several elements was performed, while
suitable spectral synthesis was performed for C, N, and Li. High precision
radial velocities obtained with the iodine cell were combined with available

difference for the elements studied increases with increasing condensation
temperature, suggesting that accretion of chemically fractionated material
might have occurred in the system. Alteration of C and N likely due to CNO

binary with a period of 445 days and moderate eccentricity. The minimum mass of
the companion is 0.17 Msun. Two scenarios were explored to explain the observed
abundance pattern. In the first, all abundance anomalies arise on the blue
straggler. If this is the case, the dust-gas separation may have been occurred
in a circumbinary disk around the blue straggler and its expected white dwarf
companion, as observed in several RV Tauri and post AGB binaries. In the second
scenario, accretion of dust-rich material occurred on the secondary. This would
also explain the anomalous carbon isotopic ratio of the secondary. Such a

has been accreted by the wide component.

possible candidate is the effect of pulse shape evolution on the DM estimation

investigate the effect of pulse profile evolution on pulsar DM estimates. We
find that it is only for asymmetric pulse shapes that the DM estimate is
significantly affected due to profile evolution with frequency. Using
multi-frequency data sets from our earlier observations, we have carried out
systematic analyses of PSR B0329+54 and PSR B1642-03. Both these pulsars have
central core dominated emission which does not show significant asymmetric

significant variation with frequency for these pulsars. We also report results
from new, simultaneous multi-frequency observations of PSR B1133+16 carried out
using the GMRT in phased array mode. This pulsar has an asymmetric pulse
profile with significant evolution with frequency. We show that in such a case,
amplitude of the observed DM variations can be attributed to profile evolution

arise due to propagation effects through the interstellar medium and/or the

in some case up to hundreds of seconds, such as in GRB041219A, GRB050820A and
GRB060124. Both the origin of the precursor and the large value of the time gap
are controversial. Here we investigate the maximum possible time gaps arising
from the jet propagation inside the progenitor star, in models which assume
that the precursor is produced by the jet bow shock or the cocoon breaking out
of the progenitor. Due to the pressure drop ahead of the jet head after it
reaches the stellar surface, a rarefaction wave propagates back into the jet at
the sound speed, which re-accelerates the jet to a relativistic velocity and
therefore limits the gap period to within about ten seconds. This scenario
therefore cannot explain gaps which are hundreds of seconds long. Instead, we
ascribe such long time gaps to the behavior of the central engine, and suggest
a fallback collapsar scenario for these bursts. In this scenario, the precursor
is produced by a weak jet formed during the initial core collapse, possibly
related to MHD processes associated with a short-lived proto-neutron star,
while the main burst is produced by a stronger jet fed by fallback accretion
onto the black hole resulting from the collapse of the neutron star. We have
examined the propagation times of the weak precursor jet through the stellar
progenitor. We find that the initial weak jet can break out of the progenitor
in a time less than ten seconds (a typical precursor duration) provided that it
has a moderately high relativistic Lorentz factor \Gamma>=10 (abridged).

under MOND. Assuming mass-to-light ratios compatible with a naked stellar
population, we found that the present Galactic dSphs preserve their integrity
over one Hubble time, except Sextans which may survive the tidal interaction
only for several Gyr. Mass-to-light ratios as inferred from the internal

accounted for only by the stellar population in Willman 1, Coma Berenice, Ursa

of the Sculptor dwarf to retain the observed population of low-mass X-ray

retention fraction in Sculptor is likely not larger than a few percent.
Compared to the dark matter scenario, it turns out that MOND makes the
retention problem worse. We propose that measurements of the radial velocities

modified gravities or extended and massive dark matter halos.

realistic framework for understanding mass loss from C-rich AGB stars. For
M-type objects, however, recent detailed models demonstrate that radiation
pressure on silicate grains is not sufficient to drive the observed winds,
contrary to previous expectations. In this paper, we suggest an alternative
mechanism for the mass-loss of M-type AGB stars, involving the formation of
both carbon and silicate grains due to non-equilibrium effects, and we study
the viability of this scenario. We model the dynamical atmospheres and winds of
AGB stars by solving the coupled system of frequency-dependent radiation
hydrodynamics and time-dependent dust formation, using a parameterized
description of non-equilibrium effects in the gas phase. This approach allows
us to assess under which circumstances it is possible to drive winds with small
amounts of carbon dust and to get silicate grains forming in these outflows at
the same time. The properties of the resulting wind models, such as mass loss
rates and outflow velocities, are well within the observed limits for M-type
AGB stars. Furthermore, according to our results, it is quite unlikely that
significant amounts of silicate grains will condense in a wind driven by a
force totally unrelated to dust formation, as the conditions in the upper
atmosphere and wind acceleration region put strong constraints on grain growth.
The proposed scenario provides a natural explanation for the observed
similarities in wind properties of M-type and C-type AGB stars and implies a
smooth transition for stars with increasing carbon abundance, from
solar-composition to C-rich AGB stars, possibly solving the long-standing
problem of the driving mechanism for stars with C/O close to one.

regions of their radial profiles. The limitations imposed by the presence of a
large starburst emission overlapping the underlying component makes this kind
of analysis a difficult task. We propose a two-dimensional fitting methodology
in order to improve the extraction of the structural parameters of the LSB
host. We discuss its advantages and weaknesses by using a set of simulated
galaxies and compare the results for a sample of eight objects with those
already obtained using a one-dimensional technique. We fit a PSF convolved
Sersic model to synthetic galaxies, and to real galaxy images in the B, V, R
filters. We restrict the fit to the stellar host by masking out the starburst
region and take special care to minimize the sky-subtraction uncertainties. In
order to test the robustness and flexibility of the method, we carry out a set
of fits with synthetic galaxies. Furthermore consistency checks are performed
to assess the reliability and accuracy of the derived structural parameters.
The more accurate isolation of the starburst emission is the most important
advantage and strength of the method. Thus, we fit the host galaxy in a range
of surface brightness and in a portion of area larger than in previous
published 1D fits with the same dataset. We obtain robust fits for all the
sample galaxies, all of which, except one, show Sersic indices n very close to
1, with good agreement in the three bands. These findings suggest that the
stellar hosts in BCDs have near-exponential profiles, a result that will help

its early (t<=1 d) optical-UV emission, can be explained by a model in which a
radiation- mediated shock propagates through a compact progenitor star into a
dense wind. The prompt thermal X-ray emission is produced in this model as the
mildly relativistic shock, v/c=0.85 carrying few x 10^49 erg, reaches the wind
(Thomson) photosphere, where the post-shock thermal radiation is released and
the shock becomes collisionless. Adopting this interpretation of the thermal
X-ray emission, a subsequent X-ray afterglow is predicted, due to synchrotron
emission and inverse-Compton scattering of SN UV photons by electrons
accelerated in the collisionless shock. Early optical-UV emission is also
predicted, due to the cooling of the outer \delta M ~10^{-3} M_sun envelope of

velocity dispersion and the local galaxy density in order to understand the
role played by mass and environment on the evolution of early-type galaxies. We
find that the chemical path is mainly driven by the halo mass, more massive
galaxies exhibiting the more efficient chemical enrichment and shorter star
formation timescales. Galaxies in denser environments are on average older than
galaxies in less dense environments. The last ones show a large age spread
which is likely to be due to rejuvenation episodes.

energy-dependent soft/hard time lags and pulsed fraction (amplitude) associated
with the pulsed emission of a neutron star (NS). We account for the soft lags
by downscattering of hard X-ray photons in the relatively cold plasma of the
disk or NS surface. A fraction of the soft X-ray photons coming from the disk
or NS surface upscatter off hot electrons in the accretion column. This effect
leads to hard lags as a result of thermal Comptonization of the soft photons.
This model reproduces the observed soft and hard lags due to the down- and
upscattered radiation as a function of the electron number densities of the
reflector, n_{e}^{ref}, and the accretion column, n_{e}^{hot}. In the case of
the accretion-powered millisecond pulsars IGR J00291+5934, XTE J1751-305, and
SAX J1808.4-3658, the observed time lags agree well with the model. Soft lags
are observed only if n_e^{ref} << n_e^{hot}. Scattering of the pulsed emission
in the NS environment may account for the observed time lags as a non-monotonic
function of energy. The time lag measurements can be used as a probe of the
innermost parts of the NS and accretion disk. We determine the upper and lower
limits of the density variation in this region using the observed time lags.
The observed energy-dependent pulsed amplitude allows us to infer a variation
of the Thomson optical depth of the Compton cloud in which the accretion column
is embedded.

arbitrary mass distributions. The method is based on the following principle.
Our task is to generate an equilibrium N-body system with a given mass
distribution. For this purpose, we let the system reach equilibrium through its
dynamical evolution. During this evolution we hold mass distribution in this
system. This principle is realized in our method by means of an iterative
procedure. We have used our method to construct a phase model of the disc of
our Galaxy. In our method, we use the mass distribution in the Galaxy as input
data. Here we used two Galactic density models (suggested by Flynn,
Sommer-Larsen and Christensen and by Dehnen and Binney). For a fixed-mass model
of the Galaxy we can construct a one-parameter family of equilibrium models of
the Galactic disc. We can, however, choose a unique model using local kinematic
parameters that are known from Hipparcos data. We show that the phase models
constructed using our method are close to equilibrium. The problem of
uniqueness for our models is discussed, and we discuss some further
applications of our method.

one based on the local density approximation, and a second based on a modified

paper, we completely characterize observable and partly observable graphs and
show how these concepts relate to observable discrete event systems and to
local automata. Based on these characterizations, we provide polynomial time

compute the minimal number of observations necessary for finding the position

ABSG, and consider two different setups for the analysis. In the first case,
the input is assumed to be a m-sequence; we show that all possible output
sequences can be classified into two sets, each of which is characterized by
the equivalence of their elements up to shifts. Furthermore, we prove that the
cardinality of each of these sets is equal to the period of one of its elements
and subsequently derive the first known bounds on the expected output period
(assuming that no subperiods exist). In the second setup, we work in a
probabilistic framework and assume that the input sequence is evenly
distributed (i.e., independent identically distributed Bernoulli process with
probability 1/2). Under these assumptions, we derive closed-form expressions
for the distribution of the output length and the output rate, which is shown
to be asymptotically Gaussian-distributed and concentrated around the mean with
exponential tightness.

the setup of parallel broadcast channels with one sender, multiple intended

broadcasts either a common message or independent messages to the intended

independent messages we establish the secrecy sum-capacity when the users are
reversely degraded.
  In the second part of the paper we apply our results to fading channels:
perfect channel state information of all intended receivers is known globally,
whereas the eavesdropper channel is known only to her. For the common message
case, a somewhat surprising result is proven: a positive rate can be achieved
independently of the number of intended receivers. For independent messages, an
opportunistic transmission scheme is presented that achieves the secrecy
sum-capacity in the limit of large number of receivers. Our results are stated
for a fast fading channel model. Extensions to the block fading model are also

is shown here that a metastable gas of heavy mesons in a particular controlled

  (To the centenary of Mark G.Krein)","P.25 Ref.32",,,,"math.QA",,"  The Krein--Tannaka duality for compact groups was a generalization the
Pontryagin--Van Kampen duality for locally compact abelian groups and a remote
predecessor of the theory of tensor categories. It is less known that it found
applications in algebraic combinatorics (``Krein algebras''). Later, this
duality was substantially extended: in \cite{V}, the notion of {\it involutive
algebras in positive vector duality} was introduced. In this paper, we
reformulate the notions of this theory using the language of bialgebras (and
Hopf algebras) and introduce the class of involutive bialgebras and positive
2-algebras. The main goal of the paper is to give a precise statement of a new
problem, which we consider as one of the main problems in this field,
concerning the existence of dilations (embeddings) of positive 2-algebras into
involutive bialgebras, or, in other words, the problem of describing subobjects
in involutive bialgebras. We define two types of subobjects in the category of
bialgebras, strict and nonstrict ones, and consider the corresponding
embeddings (dilations) of positive 2-algebras into bialgebras. The difference
between the two types of dilations is illustrated by the example of
bicommutative positive 2-algebras (commutative hypergroups). The most
interesting instance of our problem concerns dilations of the Hecke algebra
$H_n(q)$. It seems that in this case strict dilations may exist only for
$q=p^k$ (with $p$ a prime); it is not known whether nonstrict dilations exist
for other $q$. We also show that the class of finite-dimensional involutive

singularities of plurisubharmonic (psh) functions developed by the last two

It is a union of simplices naturally endowed with an affine structure. Using
relative positivity properties of divisors living on modifications of C^n above
the origin, we define formal psh functions on V, designed to be analogues of
the usual psh functions. For bounded formal psh functions on V, we define a
mixed Monge-Ampere operator which reflects the intersection theory of divisors
above the origin of C^n. This operator associates to any (n-1)-tuple of formal
psh functions a positive measure of finite mass on V. Next, we show that the
collection of Lelong numbers of a given germ u of a psh function at all
infinitely near points induces a formal psh function u' on V called its
valuative transform. When \phi is a psh Holder weight in the sense of Demailly,
the generalized Lelong number nu_\phi(u) equals the integral of u' against the
Monge-Ampere measure of the valuative transform of \phi. In particular, any
generalized Lelong number is an average of valuations. We also show how to
compute the multiplier ideal of u and the relative type of u with respect to
\phi in the sense of Rashkovskii, in terms of the valuative transforms of u and
\phi.

matrices is said to have the finiteness property if the maximal rate of growth
of long products of matrices taken from the set can be obtained by a periodic
product. It was conjectured a decade ago that all finite sets of real matrices
have the finiteness property. This conjecture, known as the ``finiteness
conjecture"", is now known to be false but no explicit counterexample to the
conjecture is available and in particular it is unclear if a counterexample is
possible whose matrices have rational or binary entries. In this paper, we
prove that finite sets of nonnegative rational matrices have the finiteness
property if and only if \emph{pairs} of \emph{binary} matrices do. We also show
that all {pairs} of $2 \times 2$ binary matrices have the finiteness property.
These results have direct implications for the stability problem for sets of
matrices. Stability is algorithmically decidable for sets of matrices that have
the finiteness property and so it follows from our results that if all pairs of
binary matrices have the finiteness property then stability is decidable for
sets of nonnegative rational matrices. This would be in sharp contrast with the
fact that the related problem of boundedness is known to be undecidable for
sets of nonnegative rational matrices.

two normal direction motions separately. The performance of this formulation is
good for a short time simulation. It performs even better by adding an extra
term to adjust the tangential velocity of grid points. The PDAE formulation
preserves the scaled arc length property and performs much better with no need

discovered at the CERN-ISR in 1972 by measurements utilizing inclusive single
or pairs of hadrons with large transverse momentum ($p_T$). It was generally
assumed, following Feynman, Field and Fox, as shown by data from the CERN-ISR
experiments, that the $p_{T_a}$ distribution of away side hadrons from a single
particle trigger [with $p_{T_t}$], corrected for <z_t> of fragmentation would
be the same as that from a jet-trigger and follow the same fragmentation
function as observed in $e^+ e^-$ or DIS. PHENIX attempted to measure the
fragmentation function from the away side $x_E\sim p_{T_a}/p_{T_t}$
distribution of charged particles triggered by a $\pi^0$ in p-p collisions at
RHIC and showed by explicit calculation that the $x_E$ distribution is actually
quite insensitive to the fragmentation function. Illustrations of the original
arguments and ISR results will be presented. Then the lack of sensitivity to
the fragmentation function will be explained, and an analytic formula for the
$x_E$ distribution given, in terms of incomplete Gamma functions, for the case
where the fragmentation function is exponential. The away-side distribution in
this formulation has the nice property that it both exhibits $x_E$ scaling and
is directly sensitive to the ratio of the away jet $\hat{p}_{T_a}$ to that of
the trigger jet, $\hat{p}_{T_t}$, and thus can be used, for example, to measure
the relative energy loss of the two jets from a hard-scattering which escape
from the medium in A+A collisions. Comparisons of the analytical formula to
RHIC measurements will be presented, including data from STAR and PHENIX,
leading to some interesting conclusions.

information presently available. The effect of couplings on elastic scattering
and fusion is studied with a series of model calculations within the
coupled-channels framework. The experimental data on fusion are compared to
""bare"" no-coupling one-dimensional barrier penetration model calculations. On
the basis of these calculations and comparisons with experimental data,
conclusions are drawn from the observation of recurring features. The total
fusion cross sections for halo nuclei show a suppression with respect to the
""bare"" calculations at energies just above the barrier that is probably due to
single neutron transfer reactions. The data for total fusion are also
consistent with a possible sub-barrier enhancement; however, this observation
is not conclusive and other couplings besides the single-neutron channels would
be needed in order to explain any actual enhancement. We find that a
characteristic feature of halo nuclei is the dominance of direct reactions over
fusion at near and sub-barrier energies; the main part of the cross section is
related to neutron transfers, while calculations indicate only a modest
contribution from the breakup process.

the original networks than the lower-ranking nodes. A closeness-based order

which very accurate experiments have not seen. Is there a reason in principle
why nonlinearity is not found? Is it impossible? Does quantum dynamics have to
be linear? Attempts to prove this have not been decisive, because either their
assumptions are not compelling or their arguments are not conclusive. The
question has been left unsettled. There is a simple answer, based on a simple
assumption. It was found in two steps separated by 44 years. They are steps
back to simpler and more compelling assumptions. A proof of the assumptions of
the Wigner-Bargmann proof has been known since 1962. It assumes that the maps
of density matrices in time are linear. For this step, it is also assumed that
density matrices are mapped one-to-one onto density matrices. An alternative is
to assume that pure states are mapped one-to-one onto pure states and that
entropy does not decrease. In a step taken in 2006, it is proved that the maps
of density matrices in time are linear. It is assumed, as in the earlier step,
that at each time the physical quantities and states are described by the usual
linear structures of quantum mechanics, so the question is only about how
things change in time. Beyond that, the proof assumes only that the dynamics
does not depend on anything outside the system, but must allow the system to be
described as part of a larger system.

associated with distinct properties of the corresponding classical systems, as

topology, both local and global, of the classical phase space may reveal, or
influence, the entangling power of the quantum system. As it has been shown in
the literature, the bifurcation points, in autonomous dynamical systems, play a
crucial role for the onset of entanglement. Similarly, the existence of scars
among the quantum states seems to be a factor in the dynamics of entanglement.
Here we study these issues for a non-autonomous system, the Quantum Kicked Top,
as a collective model of a multi-qubit system. Using the bifurcation diagram of
the corresponding classical limit (the Classical Kicked Top), we analyzed the
pair-wise and the bi-partite entanglement of the qubits and their relation to
scars, as a function of the critical parameter of the system. We found that the
pair-wise entanglement and pair-wise negativity show a strong maximum precisely
at the bifurcation points, while the bi-partite entanglement changes slope at
these points. We have also investigated the connection between entanglement and
the fixed points on the branch of the bifurcation diagram between the two first
bifurcation points and we found that the entanglement measures take their
extreme values precisely on these points. We conjecture that our results on
this behaviour of entanglement is generic for many quantum systems with a
non-linear classical analogue.

(Paul) ion trap array. We develop a general theoretical framework for the
application of time-dependent electric fields to shuttle laser-cooled ions
along any desired trajectory, and describe a method for determining the effect
of arbitrary shuttling schedules on the quantum state of trapped ion motion. In
addition to the general case of linear shuttling over short distances, we
introduce issues particular to the shuttling through multidimensional
junctions, which are required for the arbitrary control of the positions of
large arrays of trapped ions. This includes the transport of ions around a
corner, through a cross or T junction, and the swapping of positions of
multiple ions in a laser-cooled crystal. Where possible, we make connections to
recent experimental results in a multidimensional T junction trap, where
arbitrary 2-dimensional transport was realized.

generated from optical fiber, and compared the theory predictions with an
experimental result which exhibits a Hong-Ou-Mandel dip visibility of around
94%. Excellent agreement between theory and experiment has been achieved, and
we attribute the missing 6% visibility mainly to spatial mode mismatch between
signal and idler photons at the beamsplitter.
