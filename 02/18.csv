the tremendous potential of HARPS for the search of this class of very low-mass
planets. Aiming to discovering new worlds similar to $\mu$ Ara b, we carried
out an intensive campaign with HARPS to observe a selected sample of northern
stars covering a range of metallicity from about solar to twice solar. Two
stars in our program were found to present radial velocity variations
compatible with the presence of a planet-mass companion. The first of these, HD
219218, was found to be orbited by a planet with a minimum mass of 19.8
$M_\oplus$ and an orbital period of 3.83 days. It is the 11th Neptune-mass
planet found so far orbiting a solar-type star. The radial velocity data
clearly show the presence of an additional body to the system, likely of
planetary mass. The second planet orbits HD 102195, has a mass of 0.45$M_{Jup}$
and an orbital period of 4.11 days. This planet has been already announced by
Ge et al. (2006). Our data confirm and improve the orbital solution found by
these authors. We also show that the high residuals of the orbital solution are
caused by stellar activity, and use the bisectors of the HARPS
cross-correlation function to correct the noise introduced by stellar activity.
An improved orbital solution is obtained after this correction. This kind of
analysis may be used in the future to correct the radial-velocities for stellar
activity induced noise.

particular by enabling magnetic reconnection. Unfortunately, sufficiently thin
current sheets cannot be resolved observationally and the theory of their
formation is an unresolved issue as well. We consider two predictors of coronal
current concentrations, both based on geometrical or even topological
properties of a force free coronal magnetic field. First, there are
separatrices related to magnetic nulls. Through separatrices the magnetic
connectivity changes discontinuously. Coronal magnetic nulls are, however, very
rare. At second, inspired by the concept of generalized magnetic reconnection
without nulls, quasi-separatrix layers (QSL) were suggested. Through QSL the
magnetic connectivity changes continuously, though strongly. The strength of
the connectivity change can be quantified by measuring the squashing of the
flux tubes which connect the magnetically conjugated photospheres.
  We verify the QSL and separatrix concepts by comparing the sites of magnetic
nulls and enhanced squashing with the location of current concentrations in the
corona. Due to the known difficulties of their direct observation we simulated
the coronal current sheets by numerically calculating the response of the
corona to energy input from the photosphere heating a simultaneously observed
EUV Bright Point. We did not find coronal current sheets not at the
separatrices but at several QSL locations. The reason is that although the
geometrical properties of force free extrapolated magnetic fields can indeed,
hint at possible current concentrations, a necessary condition for current
sheet formation is the local energy input into the corona.

with information-theoretic secrecy. That is, each receiver is kept in total
ignorance with respect to the message intended for the other receiver. The
secrecy level is measured by the equivocation rate at the eavesdropping

regions for these two communication systems. The derived outer bounds have an
identical mutual information expression that applies to both channel models.
The difference is in the input distributions over which the expression is
optimized. The inner bound rate regions are achieved by random binning
techniques. For the broadcast channel, a double-binning coding scheme allows
for both joint encoding and preserving of confidentiality. Furthermore, we show
that, for a special case of the interference channel, referred to as the switch
channel, the two bound bounds meet. Finally, we describe several transmission
schemes for Gaussian interference channels and derive their achievable rate
regions while ensuring mutual information-theoretic secrecy. An encoding scheme
in which transmitters dedicate some of their power to create artificial noise
is proposed and shown to outperform both time-sharing and simple multiplexed

  Such a new gauge boson U, light and very weakly coupled, allows for Light
Dark Matter particles, which could be at the origin of the 511 keV line from
the galactic bulge. Could it be found directly in e+e- annihilations ? Not so
easily, due to various constraints on its couplings, especially axial ones,
leading to an axionlike behavior or extra parity-violation effects. Searches
for the decay Upsilon -> gamma + invisible U may be used to constrain severely
its axial coupling to the electron, f_eA = f_bA, to be less than about 10^-6
m_U(MeV).
  The vector coupling to the electron may in principle be larger. We find from
g_mu-2, under reasonable assumptions, that this coupling can be at most as
large as ~ 1.3 10^-3, for m_U < m_mu. Such a coupling of the order of 10^-3
could also be responsible for the somewhat large value of g_mu-2, compared to
Standard Model expectations.
  The U couplings to electrons are otherwise likely to be smaller, e.g. \lsim 3
10^-6 m_U(MeV), if the couplings to neutrinos and electrons are similar. This
restricts significantly the possibility of detecting a light U boson in e+e- ->

black holes in closed string theory. The BPS equations take the form of a
gradient flow and describe worldvolume solitons interpolating between an AdS_2
geometry where the two-sphere has collapsed, and an attractor solution with
AdS_2 x S^2 geometry. In these limiting solutions, the preserved supersymmetry
is enhanced from 4 to 8 supercharges. We also discuss the interpretation of our
solutions as intersecting brane configurations placed in the D1-D5 background,
as well as the S-duality transformation to the F1-NS5 background.

extension of the neighbor-joining algorithm and is used for constructing split
networks. We begin by describing the output of neighbor-net in terms of the
tessellation of $\bar{\MM}_{0}^n(\mathbb{R})$ by associahedra. This highlights
the fact that neighbor-net outputs a tree in addition to a circular ordering
and we explain when the neighbor-net tree is the neighbor-joining tree. A key
observation is that the tree constructed in existing implementations of
neighbor-net is not a neighbor-joining tree. Next, we show that neighbor-net is
a greedy algorithm for finding circular split systems of minimal balanced
length. This leads to an interpretation of neighbor-net as a greedy algorithm
for the traveling salesman problem. The algorithm is optimal for Kalmanson
matrices, from which it follows that neighbor-net is consistent and has optimal
radius 1/2. We also provide a statistical interpretation for the balanced
length for a circular split system as the length based on weighted least
squares estimates of the splits. We conclude with applications of these results

algebraic proofs, to a certain class ${\mathcal C}$ of finite Baer *-rings. The
results in this paper can also be viewed as a study of the properties of Baer
*-rings in the class ${\mathcal C}$.
  First, we show that a finitely generated module over a ring from the class
${\mathcal C}$ splits as a direct sum of a finitely generated projective module
and a certain torsion module. Then, we define the dimension of any module over
a ring from ${\mathcal C}$ and prove that this dimension has all the nice
properties of the dimension studied in [W. L\""{u}ck, Dimension theory of

algebras. This dimension defines a torsion theory that we prove to be equal to
the Goldie and Lambek torsion theories. Moreover, every finitely generated
module splits in this torsion theory.
  If $R$ is a ring in ${\mathcal C},$ we can embed it in a canonical way into a
regular ring $Q$ also in ${\mathcal C}.$ We show that $K_0(R)$ is isomorphic to
$K_0(Q)$ by producing an explicit isomorphism and its inverse of monoids Proj$

and quotient rings, Math. Z. 120 (1971) 25--40], $Q_{\mathrm{tot}}^r(R)$ is
constructed in a different way, by transfinite induction on ordinals. Starting
with the maximal right ring of quotients $Q_{\mathrm{max}}^r(R)$, its subrings
are constructed until $Q_{\mathrm{tot}}^r(R)$ is obtained.
  Here, we prove that Morita's construction of $Q_{\mathrm{tot}}^r(R)$ can be
simplified for rings satisfying condition (C) that every subring of the maximal

regions show similar preferences. Sequences ultraconserved between the genomes
of honeybee and Nasonia, another hymenopteran insect, were determined. They
showed strong preferences towards locating in the GC-rich regions of the bee
genome.

functions on unphysical energy sheets in multichannel scattering problems with
binary channels and in the three-body problem. Based on the explicit
representations obtained for the values of T- and S-matrices on the unphysical
sheets, we prove that the resonances belonging to an unphysical sheet are just
those energies where the correspondingly truncated scattering matrix, taken in
the physical sheet, has eigenvalue zero. We show, in addition, that
eigenvectors of the truncated scattering matrix associated with its zero
eigenvalue are formed of the breakup amplitudes for the respective resonant
states.

generalized to the case in which the qubits are divided into any $m \le n$
parties and the entanglement between these parties is evaluated. To demonstrate
this measure we apply it to general states of three qubits and to symmetric
states with any number of qubits such as the Greenberg-Horne-Zeiliner state and
the W state.
