6 solar masses and a mean length scale L ~ 0.47pc. The polarimetric data
allowed us to investigate the distribution of the local magnetic field in small
(~pc) scales across the I-front. Using the dispersion of polarization position
angles, we find variations in the kinetic-to-magnetic energy density ratio of,
at least, one order of magnitude along the I-front, with the magnetic pressure
generally dominating over the turbulent motions. These findings suggest that
the magnetic component has a significant contribution to the dynamical balance
of this region. Along the I-front, the mean magnetic field projected on the sky
is [0.018 +/- 0.013]mG. The polarization efficiency seems to change along the
I-front. We attribute high polarization efficiencies in regions of relatively
low extinction to an optimum degree of grain alignment. Analysis of the
mass-to-magnetic flux ratio shows that this quantity is consistent with the
subcritical regime (lambda < 1), showing that magnetic support is indeed
important in the region. Our data extend the overall lambda-N(H2) relation
toward lower density values and show that such trend continues smoothly toward
low N(H2) values. This provides general support for the evolution of initially
subcritical clouds to an eventual supercritical stage.

population models have been used to derive ages, metallicities and alpha/Fe

both, positive and negative, although small, variations in the [alpha/Fe] ratio
with radius. We do not find a correlation between the metallicity and the
[alpha/Fe] gradients, and the local metallicity is not correlated with the
local velocity dispersion for all the galaxies of our sample, which rules out
scenarios where the delay in the onset of the galactic winds is the only
mechanism producing the metallicity gradients. We found that metallicity
gradients are correlated with the shape of the isophotes and the central mean
age and metallicity of the galaxies, for galaxies younger than ~10 Gyr. We show
that the correlation between the gradients and the central values is not due to
the correlation of the errors and indicates that the same process that shaped
the gradient, also modified the structural parameters of the galaxies and
triggered star formation in their centres. This strongly supports the merger
scenario for the formation of these systems, where the degree of dissipation
during those mergers increases as the mass of the progenitor galaxies
decreases. Finally, we also find a dichotomy in the plane
grad[alpha/Fe]-[alpha/Fe] between galaxies with velocity dispersions below and

in which the initial uniform particle load is a cubic lattice exhibit artifacts
related to this lattice. In particular, the filaments which form in such
simulations break up into regularly spaced clumps which reflect the initial
grid pattern. We demonstrate that a similar artifact is present even when the
initial uniform particle load is not a lattice, but rather a glass with no
preferred directions and no long-range coherence. Such regular fragmentation
also occurs in simulations of the collapse of idealised, uniform filaments,
although not in simulations of the collapse of infinite uniform sheets. In HDM
or WDM simulations all self-bound nonlinear structures with masses much smaller
than the free streaming mass appear to originate through spurious fragmentation
of filaments. These artificial fragments form below a characteristic mass which
scales as $m_p^{1/3}k_{peak}^{-2}$, where $m_p$ is the $N$-body particle mass
and $k_{peak}$ is the wavenumber at the maximum of $k^3 P(k)$ ($P(k)$ is the

lowest luminosity type 1 Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN, L_bol~10^40 erg/s)
revealed a size of only ~1 light hour for the C IV broad line region (BLR),
which is by far the smallest BLR. This, together with a similar determination
of a size of ~200 light days in a luminous quasar (Kaspi et al. 2007), suggests
that the R_BLR\propto L^1/2 relation holds over a range of 10^7 in L. This
relation was suggested to result from dust sublimation, which sets R_BLR. This
suggestion was beautifully confirmed recently by the dust reverberation results
of Suganuma et al. (2006). The R_BLR\propto L^1/2 relation implies that the
broad lines width increases with decreasing luminosity according to v\propto
L^-1/4. But, there is an observational cutoff at v~25,000 km/s, and thus below
a certain threshold L the BLR would not be detectable. Such objects constitute
the so-called ""true type 2"" AGN (e.g. most FR I radio galaxies). The physical
origin of the BLR gas is not established yet, but high quality Keck spectra of
the Halpha profile in NGC 4395 rule out a clumped distribution, and indicate
that the gas resides in a smooth flow, most likely in a thick rotationally
supported configuration. The Halpha line also reveals extended exponential
wings, which are well modeled by electron scattering within the BLR emitting
gas. Such wings can be used as a direct probe of the BLR temperature and
optical depth.

spectrum of the unresolved emission above a few keV smoothly joins the X-ray
spectrum of the Milky Way's ridge measured with RXTE and INTEGRAL. These
results strongly suggest that weak discrete X-ray sources (accreting white

this gas-poor galaxy. Within the uncertainties, the average X-ray properties of
the M32 stars are consistent with those of the old stellar population in the

We assume that the flows are non-rotating and exposed to quasar radiation. We
take into account X-ray heating and the radiation force due to electron
scattering and spectral lines. To compute the radiation field, we consider a
standard accretion disk as a source of UV photons and a spherical central
object as a source of X-rays. The gas temperature and ionization state in the
flow are calculated self-consistently from the photoionization and heating rate
of the central object. We find that for a 10e8 MSUN black hole with an
accretion luminosity of 0.6 of the Eddington luminosity the flow settles into a
steady state and has two components: (1) an equatorial inflow and (2) a bipolar
inflow/outflow with the outflow leaving the system along the disk rotational
axis. The inflow is a realization of a Bondi-like accretion flow. The second
component is an example of a non-radial accretion flow which becomes an outflow
once it is pushed close to the rotational axis where thermal expansion and the
radiation pressure accelerate it outward. Our main result is that the existence
of the above two flow components is robust to the outer boundary conditions and
the geometry and spectral energy distribution of the radiation field. However,
the flow properties are not robust. In particular, the outflow power and
collimation is higher for the radiation dominated by the UV/disk emission than
for the radiation dominated by the X-ray/central engine emission. Our most
intriguing result is that a very narrow outflow driven by radiation pressure on
lines can carry more energy and mass than a broad outflow driven by thermal
expansion.

consists of the observed integrated spectra of ~120 early-type galaxies, of 7
metal-rich globular clusters in M31 and the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc,
and of the open cluster M67. We have measured H-delta using index definitions
designed to assess contamination from the CN molecule in and around H-delta by
choosing combinations of bandpasses that both avoid and include a region of CN
molecular lines redward of H-delta. We find systematic differences in the ages
derived from H-delta measurements among the various definitions when extracting
ages from H-delta in old stellar populations with enhanced CN bands due to
non-solar abundance ratios. We propose that neighboring CN lines have a strong
effect on pseudocontinuum and central bandpass levels. For stellar populations
which have non-solar abundance ratios in C and/or N, population synthesis
models that do not account for abundance ratio variations cannot reproduce
accurately the CN 4216 \AA band, which leads to a corresponding inaccuracy in
reproducing the various H-delta indices. Hence, caution must be used when
extracting galaxy ages from the H-delta line in old stellar populations with
significant non-solar abundance ratios.

broad Halpha emission lines of seven broad-line radio galaxies. These extremely
broad, double-peaked lines are successfully modeled by emission from gas in the
outer accretion disk, and their profiles vary on timescales of months to years.
This variability is a valuable probe for understanding the structure and
dynamics of the accretion disk. We characterize the long-term broad-line
profile variability in detail, and compare the evolution of the line profiles
with predictions from a few simple physical models for dynamical processes in
the accretion disk. We find no evidence for persistent, periodic variability
that would be indicative of a precessing elliptical disk, or a circular disk
with a long-lived, single-armed spiral or warp. We do find transient, periodic
variability on the orbital timescale, possibly resulting from shocks induced by
tidal perturbations, and variability in the wings of the profile which suggests
changes in the emissivity of the inner accretion flow. Dramatic but localized
profile changes are observed during flares and high-states of broad-line flux.
In 3C 332, these changes can be explained by a slow, smooth, secular change in
disk illumination. In Arp 102B and 3C 390.3, however, a simple disk model
cannot explain the asymmetric profile changes, suggesting a need for more
sophisticated models. We also observe sharp, transient features that appear in

for up to hundreds of cycles and were observed over a wide range of rotational
phases of the neutron stars believed to host SGRs. Therefore these QPOs must
have originated from a compact, virtually non-expanding region inside the

all). The fastest QPOs imply a luminosity variation of $\Delta L/\Delta t

Both intra-valley and inter-valley scattering mediated by acoustic (AP),

phonon dispersion calculations are performed using force-constant methods, and
electron-phonon coupling is determined through microscopic theory. Specific
simulation results are presented for (16,0), (19,0), and (22,0) zigzag CNTFETs

to moderate gate biases the influence of high-energy OP scattering is
suppressed, and the device current is reduced due to elastic back-scattering by
AP and low-energy RBM phonons. At large gate biases the current degradation is
mainly due to high-energy OP scattering. The influence of both AP and
high-energy OP scattering is reduced for larger diameter tubes. The effect of
RBM mode, however, is nearly independent of the diameter for the tubes studied

barrier. The CIS effect is here studied in TJs with two thin (20 \AA)
non-magnetic (NM) Ta electrodes inserted above and below the insulating
barrier. We observe resistance (R) switching for positive applied electrical
current (flowing from the bottom to the top lead), characterized by a
continuous resistance decrease and associated with current-driven displacement
of metallic ions from the bottom electrode into the barrier (thin barrier
state). For negative currents, displaced ions return into their initial
positions in the electrode and the electrical resistance gradually increases
(thick barrier state). We measured the temperature (T) dependence of the
electrical resistance of both thin- and thick-barrier states ($R_b$ and R$_B$
respectively). Experiments showed a weaker R(T) variation when the tunnel
junction is in the $R_b$ state, associated with a smaller tunnel contribution.
By applying large enough electrical currents we induced large irreversible
R-decreases in the studied TJs, associated with barrier degradation. We then
monitored the evolution of the R(T) dependence for different stages of barrier
degradation. In particular, we observed a smooth transition from tunnel- to
metallic-dominated transport. The initial degradation-stages are related to
irreversible barrier thickness decreases (without the formation of pinholes).
Only for later barrier degradation stages do we have the appearance of metallic
paths between the two electrodes that, however, do not lead to metallic
dominated transport for small enough pinhole radius.

  Optimality of Hub and Spoke Models",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  Consider networks on $n$ vertices at average density 1 per unit area. We seek
a network that minimizes total length subject to some constraint on journey
times, averaged over source-destination pairs. Suppose journey times depend on
both route-length and number of hops. Then for the constraint corresponding to
an average of 3 hops, the length of the optimal network scales as $n^{13/10}$.
Alternatively, constraining the average number of hops to be 2 forces the
network length to grow slightly faster than order $n^{3/2}$. Finally, if we
require the network length to be O(n) then the mean number of hops grows as
order $\log \log n$. Each result is an upper bound in the worst case (of vertex
positions), and a lower bound under randomness or equidistribution assumptions.
The upper bounds arise in simple hub and spoke models, which are therefore
optimal in an order of magnitude sense.

distribution widths, but also for the dynamical approach to a steady state or
to collective oscillatory behaviors in multi-field systems. Because the theory
yields dynamical information, it can also predict the
initial-condition-dependent final state (disordered state, steady or

the presence of Fe3+ is due to the possible hole doping in the system by cation

polarized Gowdy $T^3$ cosmologies admit a scalar field description whose
evolution is governed by a Klein-Gordon type equation in a flat background in
1+1 dimensions with the spatial topology of $S^1$, though in the presence of a
time-dependent potential. The model is still subject to a homogeneous
constraint, which generates $S^1$-translations. Recently, a Fock quantization
of this scalar field was introduced and shown to be unique under the
requirements of unitarity of the dynamics and invariance under the gauge group
of $S^1$-translations. In this work, we extend and complete this uniqueness
result by considering other possible scalar field descriptions, resulting from
reasonable field reparameterizations of the induced metric of the reduced
model. In the reduced phase space, these alternate descriptions can be obtained
by means of a time-dependent scaling of the field, the inverse scaling of its
canonical momentum, and the possible addition of a time-dependent, linear
contribution of the field to this momentum. Demanding again unitarity of the
field dynamics and invariance under the gauge group, we prove that the
alternate canonical pairs of fieldlike variables admit a Fock representation if
and only if the scaling of the field is constant in time. In this case, there
exists essentially a unique Fock representation, provided by the quantization
constructed by Corichi, Cortez, and Mena Marugan. In particular, our analysis
shows that the scalar field description proposed by Pierri does not admit a
Fock quantization with the above unitarity and invariance properties.

limit, are exponentially suppressed. They may be sizable, however, for the

new possibility to measure the antistrange quark distribution function. COMPASS
data in a domain of x that has not been studied previously will provide
valuable extra information to fix models for the nucleon spin structure. The

account the contribution arising from the two pion intermediate state. With the
interpolating currents of the different chiral combinations of scalar and
pseudoscalar diquarks, it is demonstrated that the interpolating current with
maximum chirality has a large coupling to the two pion state, but the current
with zero chirality interacts only weekly with this state. Taking into account
the form factor in the $f_0$--two pion vertex, it is shown that the
$f_0$--coupling to the two pion state leads to an increase of the lightest
tetraquark mass by a value of about 100 MeV. The analysis of the resulting sum
rule shows that the $\sigma(f_0(600))$--meson state might be treated as the
four--quark bound state in the instanton field which has a rather strong
coupling to the two pion state.

density, deriving an explicit lower bound for it, while the minima set has
density 0. We also produce formulas for the number of such lattices with a
fixed determinant and with a fixed minimum. These formulas are related to the
number of divisors of an integer in short intervals and to the number of its
representations as a sum of two squares. We investigate the growth of the
number of such lattices with a fixed determinant as the determinant grows,
exhibiting some determinant sequences on which it is particularly large. To
this end, we also study the behavior of the associated zeta function, comparing
it to the Dedekind zeta function of Gaussian integers and to the Solomon zeta
function of ${\mathbb Z}^2$. Our results extend automatically to well-rounded

continuous one-parameter family of closed curves starting and ending at point
curves. Pull the sweepout tight by, in a continuous way, pulling each curve as
tight as possible yet preserving the sweepout. We show the following useful
property (see Theorem 1.9 below); cf. [CM1], [CM2], proposition 3.1 of [CD],
proposition 3.1 of [Pi], and 12.5 of [Al]:
  Each curve in the tightened sweepout whose length is close to the length of
the longest curve in the sweepout must itself be close to a closed geodesic. In
particular, there are curves in the sweepout that are close to closed
geodesics.
  Finding closed geodesics on the 2-sphere by using sweepouts goes back to
Birkhoff in the 1920s. The above useful property is virtually always implicit
in any sweepout construction of critical points for variational problems yet it
is not always recorded since most authors are only interested in the existence
of one critical point.
  Similar results holds for sweepouts by 2-spheres instead of circles; cf.
\cite{CM2}. The ideas are essentially the same in the two cases, though
technically easier for curves where there is no concentration of energy (i.e.,
``bubbling''); cf. \cite{Jo}.

unit interval into $b$ subintervals and multiplies the density in each

density can be renormalized so that, as $n\to \infty $ ($n$ being the number of
iterations) the signed measure converges in some sense to a non-degenerate
limit. If $H=1+\log_{b}$ $p>{1}/{2}$, hence $p>b^{{-1}/{% 2}}$, renormalization
creates a martingale, the convergence is strong, and the limit shares the
H\""{o}lder and Hausdorff properties of the fractional Brownian motion of
exponent $H$. If $H\leq {1}/{2}$, hence $p\leq b^{{-1}/{2}%}$, this martingale
does not converge. However, a different normalization can be applied, for
$H\leq {1/2}$ to the martingale itself and for $H>% {1/2}$ to the discrepancy
between the limit and a finite approximation. In all cases the resulting
process is found to converge weakly to the Wiener Brownian motion,
independently of $H$ and of $b$. Thus, to the usual additive paths toward
Wiener measure, this procedure adds an infinity of multiplicative paths.

function in linear regression for functional data analysis. However, as in the
case of more conventional finite-dimensional regression, much of the practical
interest in the slope centers on its application for the purpose of prediction,
rather than on its significance in its own right. We show that the problems of
slope-function estimation, and of prediction from an estimator of the slope
function, have very different characteristics. While the former is
intrinsically nonparametric, the latter can be either nonparametric or
semiparametric. In particular, the optimal mean-square convergence rate of
predictors is $n^{-1}$, where $n$ denotes sample size, if the predictand is a
sufficiently smooth function. In other cases, convergence occurs at a
polynomial rate that is strictly slower than $n^{-1}$. At the boundary between
these two regimes, the mean-square convergence rate is less than $n^{-1}$ by
only a logarithmic factor. More generally, the rate of convergence of the
predicted value of the mean response in the regression model, given a
particular value of the explanatory variable, is determined by a subtle
interaction among the smoothness of the predictand, of the slope function in
the model, and of the autocovariance function for the distribution of
explanatory variables.

for their robustness and efficiency. They can serve as robust alternatives to

on projection depth induced regions. Robustness of these depth trimmed means is
investigated in terms of the influence function and finite sample breakdown
point. The influence function captures the local robustness whereas the
breakdown point measures the global robustness of estimators. It is found that
the projection depth trimmed means are highly robust locally as well as
globally. Asymptotics of the depth trimmed means are investigated via those of
the directional radius of the depth induced regions. The strong consistency,
asymptotic representation and limiting distribution of the depth trimmed means
are obtained. Relative to the mean and other leading competitors, the depth
trimmed means are highly efficient at normal or symmetric models and
overwhelmingly more efficient when these models are contaminated. Simulation
studies confirm the validity of the asymptotic efficiency results at finite

The ``COSSO'' is a method of regularization with the penalty functional being
the sum of component norms, instead of the squared norm employed in the
traditional smoothing spline method. The COSSO provides a unified framework for
several recent proposals for model selection in linear models and smoothing
spline ANOVA models. Theoretical properties, such as the existence and the rate
of convergence of the COSSO estimator, are studied. In the special case of a
tensor product design with periodic functions, a detailed analysis reveals that
the COSSO does model selection by applying a novel soft thresholding type
operation to the function components. We give an equivalent formulation of the
COSSO estimator which leads naturally to an iterative algorithm. We compare the
COSSO with MARS, a popular method that builds functional ANOVA models, in
simulations and real examples. The COSSO method can be extended to
classification problems and we compare its performance with those of a number
of machine learning algorithms on real datasets. The COSSO gives very
competitive performance in these studies.

energy in traversing the QGP fluid, which is described by fully
three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. When a jet parton escapes from the
QGP fluid, it picks up a partner parton from a fluid and forms a color singlet
string, then it decays to hadrons. We find that high-$p_T$ $v_2$ values in JFS
are about two times larger than in the independent fragmentation model.

at Harvard by Eric Mazur (1997). The method has been welcomed by the science
community and adopted by a large number of colleges and universities, due among
other reasons to its common sense approach and its documented effectiveness. In
PI, the progression of any given class depends on the outcome of real-time
student feedback to ConcepTests: multiple-choice conceptual questions. In the
early 1990s, students responded to ConcepTests using flashcards showing their
answer. Instructors would then estimate the proportion of students holding each
alternative conception. A few years later Mazur began using wireless handheld
devices - colloquially called clickers- to replace the flashcards. Previous
users of clickers in university classrooms had reported benefits such as
increased rates of attendance and decreased rates of attrition (Owens et al.,
2004; Lopez-Herrejon & Schulman, 2004). This paper empirically measures the
specific contribution of clickers to conceptual learning and traditional
problem solving skills as compared to low-budget flashcards. Results show that
clickers do not provide any learning advantage when compared to flashcards.
Nevertheless, clickers offer many advantages from a teaching perspective which
should be considered.

  thresholds","Put all figures into one file. Fixed errors in abstract",,,,"q-bio.QM q-bio.GN",,"  Motivation: In microarray analysis, special consideration must be given to
the issues of multiple statistical tests and typically p-values are adjusted to
control family-wise error rate (FWER) or false discovery rate (FDR). FDR
metrics have been suggested for controlling false positives, however, genes
with p-values close to the threshold typically have a higher chance of being
false positives than genes with very low p-values. The local FDR (fdr) metric
gives the number of false positives in the vicinity of a test statistic. We
propose a new fdr estimator that uses windows instead of binsand define
heuristics that use the fluctuations in the estimator to determine robust
thresholds for classifying differential expression.
  Results: Our fdr approach estimates the false discovery rate within a window
of p-values. We present heuristics that derive robust fdr thresholds such that
a significant change in the fdr threshold yields a small change in the number
of rejected hypotheses. We compare these thresholds with thresholds from other
approaches using two simulated datasets and one cancer microarray dataset. In
the latter, our estimator finds two robust thresholds. Since our fdr estimator
is an extension of the FDR metric, it can be used with many FDR estimation
methods.
