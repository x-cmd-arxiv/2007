field dark energy, Cuscuton, which can be realized as the incompressible (or
infinite speed of sound) limit of a k-essence fluid. In this paper, we study
how Cuscuton modifies the constraint sector of Einstein gravity. In particular,
we study Cuscuton cosmology and show that even though Cuscuton can have an
arbitrary equation of state, or time dependence, and is thus inhomogeneous; its
perturbations do not introduce any additional dynamical degree of freedom and
only satisfy a constraint equation, amounting to an effective modification of
gravity on large scales. Therefore, Cuscuton can be considered to be a minimal
theory of evolving dark energy, or a minimal modification of a cosmological
constant, as it has no internal dynamics. Moreover, this is the only
modification of Einstein gravity to our knowledge that does not introduce any
additional degrees freedom (and is not conformally equivalent to the Einstein
gravity). We then study two simple Cuscuton models, with quadratic and
exponential potentials. The quadratic model has the exact same expansion
history as LCDM, and yet contains an early dark energy component with constant
energy fraction, which is constrained to < 2%, mainly from WMAP Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) and SDSS Lyman-alpha forest observations. The
exponential model has the same expansion history as the DGP self-accelerating
braneworld model, but generates a much smaller Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)
effect, and is thus consistent with the CMB observations. Finally, we show that
the evolution is local on super-horizon scales, implying that there is no gross
violation of causality, despite Cuscuton's infinite speed of sound.

variability with flux-doubling times down to 2 minutes was observed during the

variations ever observed in Mrk 501. The ~20-minute long flare of July 9 showed
an indication of a 4 +/- 1 min time delay between the peaks of F(<0.25 TeV) and
F(>1.2 TeV), which may indicate a progressive acceleration of electrons in the
emitting plasma blob. The flux variability was quantified for several energy
ranges, and found to increase with the energy of the gamma-ray photons. The
spectra hardened significantly with increasing flux, and during the two most
active nights, a spectral peak was clearly detected at 0.43 +/- 0.06 TeV and
0.25 +/- 0.07 TeV, respectively for June 30 and July 9. There is no evidence of

derive a generalized Ohm's law that explicitly distinguishes between flux
advection (and the associated process of ambipolar diffusion) and Ohmic
dissipation, in order to assess the contribution of each mechanism to the
increase of the mass-to-flux ratio of the central parts of a collapsing core

We show how our formulation is related to and can be transformed into the
traditional, directional formulation of the generalized Ohm's law, and we
derive formulae for the perpendicular, parallel and Hall conductivities
entering the latter, which include, for the first time, the effect of inelastic
collisions between grains. In addition, we present a general (valid in any

velocity of the neutrals and of the effective flux velocity (which can in turn
be calculated from the dynamics of the system and Faraday's law). The last two
sets of formulae can be adapted for use in any general non-ideal MHD code to
study phenomena beyond star formation in magnetic clouds. The results,

We also find that the electrons do not decouple from the field lines before
thermal ionization becomes important and recouples the magnetic field to the

evolution of hydrogen-triggered type I X-ray bursts on accreting neutron stars.
At the lowest accretion rates, thermally unstable hydrogen burning ignites
helium as well and produces a mixed hydrogen and helium burst. For somewhat
higher accretion rates, thermally unstable hydrogen burning does not ignite
helium and thus triggers only a weak hydrogen flash. The peak luminosities of
weak hydrogen flashes are typically much lower than the accretion luminosity.
These results are in accord with previous theoretical work. We find that a
series of weak hydrogen flashes generates a massive layer of helium that
eventually ignites in an energetic pure helium flash. Although previously
conjectured, this is the first time such bursting behavior has been actually
demonstrated in a theoretical model. For yet higher accretion rates, hydrogen
burning is thermally stable and thus steadily generates a layer of helium that
ultimately ignites in a pure helium flash. We find that, for a narrow range of
accretion rates between the mixed hydrogen and helium burst and weak hydrogen
flash regimes, unstable hydrogen burning ignites helium only after a short
series of weak hydrogen flashes has generated a sufficiently deep layer of
helium. These bursts have fluences that are intermediate between those of
normal mixed hydrogen and helium bursts and energetic pure helium flashes.

Of particular interest, HESS has detected gamma rays from the Sagittarius (Sgr)
B Molecular Cloud Complex. Prompted by the suggestion of a hadronic origin for
the gamma rays, we have examined archival 330 and 74 MHz Very Large Array radio
data and 843 MHz Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey data covering Sgr B,
looking for synchrotron emission from secondary electrons and positrons
(expected to be created in the same interactions that supply the observed gamma
rays). Intriguingly, we have uncovered non-thermal emission, but at a level
exceeding expectation. Adding to the overall picture, recent observations by
the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment telescope show that the cosmic ray ionization
rate is ten times greater in the Sgr B2 region of Sgr B than the local value.
Lastly, Sgr B2 is also a very bright X-ray source. We examine scenarios for the
spectra of CRHs and/or primary electrons that would reconcile all these
different data. We determine that (i) a hard (~ E^-2.2), high-energy (> TeV)
population CRHs is unavoidably required by the HESS gamma ray data and (ii) the
remaining broad-band, non-thermal phenomenology is explained either by a rather
steep (~ E^-2.9) spectrum of primary electrons or a (~ E^-2.7) population of
CRHs. No single, power-law population of either leptons or hadrons can explain
the totality of broadband, non-thermal Sgr B phenomenology.

accretion is the tendency for the accumulating hydrogen to ignite unstably and
potentially trigger mass loss. It has been known for many years that there is a
narrow range of accretion rates for which the hydrogen can burn stably,
allowing for the white dwarf mass to increase as a pure helium layer
accumulates. We first review the physics of stable burning, providing a clear
explanation for why radiation pressure stabilization leads to a narrow range of
accretion rates for stable burning near the Eddington limit, confirming the
recent work of Nomoto and collaborators. We also explore the possibility of
stabilization due to a high luminosity from beneath the burning layer. We then
examine the impact of the beta-decay-limited ''hot'' CNO cycle on the stability
of burning. Though this plays a significant role for accreting neutron stars,
we find that for accreting white dwarfs, it can only increase the range of
stably-burning accretion rates for metallicities below 0.01 solar metallicity.

important parameters to our understanding of planetary structure and evolution.
This makes asteroseismology a very powerful tool to complement planetary
transits. As an example, the transit measurement alone does not give the radius
of the planet unless the radius of the host star is known, which again requires
a known distance to the system. Transit measurements will therefore often
require additional measurements to establish the radius of the planet. With
asteroseismology we can determine the radius of a star to very high precision

valuable for a mission such as Kepler, which will produce photometric time

of temperature bands. Traditional approaches involve simple visualisation or
explicit modelling. We take a more empirical approach, using statistical
methods. The morphology of solar structures changes with the wavelength of
observation and, therefore, with temperature. We explore the possibility of
separating the different solar structures from a linear combination of images.
Using a blind source separation approach, we build a new set of statistically
independent ""source"" images from the original EUV images. Two techniques are
compared: the singular value decomposition and independent component analysis.
The source images show more contrast than the original ones, thereby easing the
characterisation of morphological structures. A comparison with the
differential emission measure shows that each source image also isolates
structures with specific emission temperatures.

atmospheric layers is usually investigated by comparing patterns of temporal
correlations. We consider instead a statistical approach. The TIMED/SEE
experiment, which has been continuously operating since Feb. 2002, allows for
the first time to compare in a statistical manner the EUV spectral irradiance
to five EUV proxies: the sunspot number, the f10.7, Ca K, and Mg II indices,
and the He I equivalent width.
  Using multivariate statistical methods such as multidimensional scaling, we
represent in a single graph the measure of relatedness between these indices
and various strong spectral lines. The ability of each index to reproduce the
EUV irradiance is discussed; it is shown why so few lines can be effectively
reconstructed from them. All indices exhibit comparable performance, apart from
the sunspot number, which is the least appropriate. No single index can
satisfactorily describe both the level of variability on time scales beyond 27
days, and relative changes of irradiance on shorter time scales.

directly to speed-up the calculations. The integration of the equations of
motions were, running on the host computer, implemented in C using the 4th
order predictor-corrector Hermite integrator with block time steps. We find
that for a large number of particles ($N \apgt 10^4$) modern graphics
processing units offer an attractive low cost alternative to GRAPE special
purpose hardware. A modern GPU continues to give a relatively flat scaling with
the number of particles, comparable to that of the GRAPE. The GRAPE is designed
to reach double precision, whereas the GPU is intrinsically single-precision.
For relatively large time steps, the total energy of the N-body system was
conserved better than to one in $10^6$ on the GPU, which is impressive given
the single-precision nature of the GPU. For the same time steps, the GRAPE gave
somewhat more accurate results, by about an order of magnitude. However,
smaller time steps allowed more energy accuracy on the grape, around
$10^{-11}$, whereas for the GPU machine precision saturates around $10^{-6}$

outperform GRAPE in their low cost, long mean time between failure and the much

pollution in GRO J1655--40 after the burst in 2005. Moreover, we argue that
uncertainties in the equivalent widths were previously underestimated by a
factor of $\sim$3. Consequently, our results challenge the existence of general
overabundances of $\alpha$-elements observed in this galactic black-hole

In this paper, we
present a new mass modelling formalism for ellipticals that invokes no
observations other than the central velocity dispersion ($\sigma_0$) and
photometry. The essence of the method lies in choosing a local mass-to-light
ratio ($M/L$) profile for a galaxy, with which the deprojected luminosity
density distribution (along the major axis coordinate $x$) is scaled. The
resulting discontinuous mass density profile is then smoothed, according to a
laid out prescription; the local $M/L$ profile that stems from this smoothed
mass density, is found to be significantly different from the raw $M/L$
distribution. A suite of model galaxies (both Sersic and cored in nature) is
used for extensive experimentation in order to characterise this raw $M/L$
profile and in each case, the mass density recovered from this mass modelling
technique is compared to the known mass distribution. We opt to work with a raw
$M/L$ profile that is a simple two-stepped function of $x$, with a low inner
and higher outer value of $M/L-\Upsilon_{in}$ and $\Upsilon_{out}$,
respectively. The only constraint that we have on this profile is in the centre
of the galaxy, via $\sigma_0$. This value of $\sigma_0$ is implemented in the
virial theorem to obtain an estimate of the central $M/L$ ratio of the galaxy.
The fallibility of the virial mass estimate is taken care of, by allowing for a
range in the values of $\Upsilon_{in}$ that can be used for a given galaxy
model. Moreover, our experiments indicate that $\Upsilon_{out}$ is uniquely

stellar objects (YSOs) aimed at detecting H2CO, CH3OH, CH2CO, CH3CHO, C2H5OH,
HCOOH, HNCO and NH2CHO. In addition, other organic species such as CH3CN have
been observed. The aim is to establish the chemical origin of a set of complex
organic molecules thought to be produced by grain surface chemistry in high
mass YSOs. Rotation temperatures and beam-averaged column densities are
determined. Based on their rotation diagrams, molecules can be classified as
either cold (<100 K) or hot (>100 K). This implies that complex organics are
present in at least two distinct regions. Furthermore, the abundances of the
hot oxygen-bearing species are correlated, as are those of HNCO and NH2CHO.
This is suggestive of chemical relationships within, but not between, those two
groups of molecules. The most likely explanation for the observed correlations
of the various hot molecules is that they are ``first generation'' species that
originate from solid-state chemistry. This includes H2CO, CH3OH, C2H5OH,
HCOOCH3, CH3OCH3, HNCO, NH2CHO, and possibly CH3CN, and C2H5CN. The
correlations between sources implies very similar conditions during their
formation or very similar doses of energetic processing. Cold species such as
CH2CO, CH3CHO, and HCOOH, some of which are seen as ices along the same lines
of sight, are probably formed in the solid state as well, but appear to be
destroyed at higher temperatures. A low level of non-thermal desorption by
cosmic rays can explain their low rotation temperatures and relatively low
abundances in the gas phase compared to the solid state. The CH3CCH abundances
can be fully explained by low temperature gas phase chemistry. No cold
N-containing molecules are found.

most precise chronometers of events in the early solar system, provided that
they were initially homogeneously distributed. On the other hand, the
abundances of the three stable isotopes of oxygen in primitive meteorites show
a mass-independent fractionation that survived homogenization in the solar
nebula. As as result of this and other cosmochemical evidence, the degree of
spatial heterogeneity of isotopes in the solar nebula has long been a puzzle.
We show here that based on hydrodynamical models of the mixing and transport of
isotopic anomalies formed at, or injected onto, the surface of the solar
nebula, initially high levels of isotopic spatial heterogeneity are expected to
fall to steady state levels (~10%) low enough to validate the use of 26Al for
chronometry, but high enough to preserve the evidence for mass-independent
fractionation of oxygen isotopes. The solution to this puzzle relies on the
mixing being accomplished by the chaotic fluid motions in a marginally
gravitationally unstable disk, as seems to be required for the formation of gas
giant planets and by the inability of alternative physical processes to drive
large-scale mixing and transport in the planet-forming midplane of the solar
nebula. Such a disk is also capable of large-scale outward transport of the
thermally annealed dust grains found in comets, and of driving the shock fronts
that appear to be responsible for much of the thermal processing of the
components of primitive meteorites, creating a self-consistent picture of the
basic physical processes shaping the early solar nebula.

information about the magnetic state and properties of the sample is contained
in the frequency position, width, and intensity of the BLS peaks. Previously
[Phys. Rev. B 67, 184404 (2003)], we have shown that spin wave frequencies can
be conveniently calculated within the ultrathin film approach, treating the
intralayer exchange as an effective bilinear interlayer coupling between thin
virtual sheets of the ferromagnetic layers. Here we give the consequent
extension of this approach to the calculation of the Brillouin light scattering
(BLS) peak intensities. Given the very close relation of the BLS cross-section
to the magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE), the depth-resolved longitudinal and
polar MOKE coefficients calculated numerically via the usual magneto-optic
formalism can be employed in combination with the spin wave precessional
amplitudes to calculate full BLS spectra for a given magnetic system. This
approach allows an easy calculation of BLS intensities even for noncollinear
spin configurations including the exchange modes. The formalism is applied to a
Fe/Cr/Fe/Ag/Fe trilayer system with one antiferromagnetically coupling spacer

partially self-avoiding deterministic walk. The walker, with memory $\mu$,
leaves from the leftmost point and moves, at each discrete time step, to the
nearest point which has not been visited in the preceding $\mu$ steps. Using
open boundary conditions, we have calculated analytically the probability
$P_N(\mu) = (1 - 2^{-\mu})^{N - \mu - 1}$ that all $N$ points are visited, with
$N \gg \mu \gg 1$. This approximated expression for $P_N(\mu)$ is reasonable

\mu_1 - e/(2\ln2)$, the walker gets trapped in cycles and does not fully
explore the system. For $\mu > \mu_1 + e/(2\ln2)$ the walker explores the whole

constant, a sharp transition is obtained for one-dimensional large systems.
This means that the walker needs not to have full memory of its trajectory to
explore the whole system. Instead, it suffices to have memory of order

self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules (such as detergents) in solution. Giant
micelles are typically flexible, and can become highly entangled even at modest
concentrations. The resulting viscoelastic solutions show fascinating flow
behaviour (rheology) which we address theoretically in this article at two
levels. First, we summarise advances in understanding linear viscoelastic
spectra and steady-state nonlinear flows, based on microscopic constitutive
models that combine the physics of polymer entanglement with the reversible
kinetics of self-assembly. Such models were first introduced two decades ago,
and since then have been shown to explain robustly several distinctive features
of the rheology in the strongly entangled regime, including extreme
shear-thinning. We then turn to more complex rheological phenomena,
particularly involving spatial heterogeneity, spontaneous oscillation,
instability, and chaos. Recent understanding of these complex flows is based
largely on grossly simplified models which capture in outline just a few
pertinent microscopic features, such as coupling between stresses and other
order parameters such as concentration. The role of `structural memory' (the
dependence of structural parameters such as the micellar length distribution on
the flow history) in explaining these highly nonlinear phenomena is addressed.
Structural memory also plays an intriguing role in the little-understood
shear-thickening regime, which occurs in a concentration regime close to but
below the onset of strong entanglement, and which is marked by a shear-induced
transformation from an inviscid to a gelatinous state.

novel combinatorial characterization of LP decoding success, based on the
notion of a generalized matching. An interesting by-product of our analysis is
to establish the existence of ``probabilistic expansion'' in random bipartite

through redundancy spread over nodes across the Internet. A key goal is to
minimize the amount of bandwidth used to maintain that redundancy. Storing a
file using an erasure code, in fragments spread across nodes, promises to
require less redundancy and hence less maintenance bandwidth than simple
replication to provide the same level of reliability. However, since fragments
must be periodically replaced as nodes fail, a key question is how to generate
a new fragment in a distributed way while transferring as little data as
possible across the network.
  In this paper, we introduce a general technique to analyze storage
architectures that combine any form of coding and replication, as well as
presenting two new schemes for maintaining redundancy using erasure codes.
First, we show how to optimally generate MDS fragments directly from existing
fragments in the system. Second, we introduce a new scheme called Regenerating
Codes which use slightly larger fragments than MDS but have lower overall
bandwidth use. We also show through simulation that in realistic environments,
Regenerating Codes can reduce maintenance bandwidth use by 25 percent or more

three-flavor quark matter responds to shear stress like a very rigid solid. To
evaluate the shear modulus, we derive the low energy effective Lagrangian that
describes the phonons that originate from the spontaneous breaking of
translation invariance by the spatial modulation of the gap parameter $\Delta$.
These massless bosons describe space- and time-dependent fluctuations of the
crystal structure and are analogous to the phonons in ordinary crystals. The
coefficients of the spatial derivative terms of the phonon effective Lagrangian
are related to the elastic moduli of the crystal; the coefficients that encode
the linear response of the crystal to a shearing stress define the shear
modulus. We analyze the two particular crystal structures which are
energetically favored over a wide range of densities, in each case evaluating
the phonon effective action and the shear modulus up to order $\Delta^2$ in a
Ginzburg-Landau expansion, finding shear moduli which are 20 to 1000 times
larger than those of neutron star crusts. The crystalline color superconducting
phase has long been known to be a superfluid -- by picking a phase its order
parameter breaks the quark-number $U(1)_B$ symmetry spontaneously. Our results
demonstrate that this superfluid phase of matter is at the same time a rigid
solid. We close with a rough estimate of the pinning force on the rotational
vortices which would be formed embedded within this rigid superfluid upon
rotation. Our results raise the possibility that (some) pulsar glitches could
originate within a quark matter core deep within a neutron star.

additive in the usual way. The integrated Noether current had previously been
discarded as a conserved quantity, because it was correctly realized that it
does no longer obey the DSR transformations. We identify the reason for this
mismatch in the fact that DSR depends only on the extensive quantity of total
four-momentum instead of the energy-momentum densities as would be appropriate
for a field theory. We argue that the reason for the failure of DSR to
reproduce the standard transformation behavior in the well established limits
is due to the missing sensitivity to the volume inside which energy is
accumulated. We show that the soccer-ball problem is absent if one formulates
DSR instead for the field densities. As a consequence, estimates for predicted
effects have to be corrected by many orders of magnitude. Further, we derive
that the modified quantum field theory implies a locality bound.

Harmonic fields on such a metric can be interpreted as the hodograph image of

generalized Plateau problems in 3-dimensional space-time via Hodge theory on
the extended projective disc. Analogous variational problems arise on

consider both the vanishing viscosity method and finite difference schemes

regularization methods generate different boundary layers. Hence, the boundary
condition can be formulated only if an approximation scheme is selected first.
Assuming solely uniform L\infty bounds on the approximate solutions and so
dealing with L\infty solutions, we derive several entropy inequalities
satisfied by the boundary layer in each case under consideration. A Young
measure is introduced to describe the boundary trace. When a uniform bound on
the total variation is available, the boundary Young measure reduces to a Dirac
mass. Form the above analysis, we deduce several formulations for the boundary
condition which apply whether the boundary is characteristic or not. Each
formulation is based a set of admissible boundary values, following Dubois and

fixed time interval $[0,\beta]$ with symmetrised initial-terminal condition.
That is, for any $i$, the terminal location of the $i$-th motion is affixed to
the initial point of the $\sigma(i)$-th motion, where $\sigma$ is a uniformly
distributed random permutation of $1,...,N$.
  In this paper, we describe the large-N behaviour of the empirical path
measure (the mean of the Dirac measures in the $N$ paths) when $
\Lambda\uparrow\mathbb{R}^d $ and $ N/|\Lambda|\to\rho $. The rate function is
given as a variational formula involving a certain entropy functional and a
Fenchel-Legendre transform.
  Depending on the dimension and the density $ \rho $, there is phase
transition behaviour for the empirical path measure. For certain parameters
(high density, large time horizon) and dimensions $ d\ge 3 $ the empirical path
measure is not supported on all paths $ [0,\infty)\to\mathbb{R}^d $ which
contain a bridge path of any finite multiple of the time horizon $ [0,\beta] $.
For dimensions $ d=1,2 $, and for small densities and small time horizon $
[0,\beta] $ in dimensions $ d\ge 3$, the empirical path measure is supported on
those paths. In the first regime a finite fraction of the motions lives in
cycles of infinite length.
  We outline that this transition leads to an empirical path measure

Bosons.

Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment and the classical Erdos and Renyi

connected to some, but not all, of others. In social dilemma games with a fixed
population size, heterogeneity in the number of contacts per player is known to
promote evolution of cooperation. Under a common assumption of positively
biased payoff structure, well-connected players earn much by playing
frequently, and cooperation once adopted by well-connected players is
unbeatable and spreads to others. However, maintaining a social contact can be
costly, which would prevent local payoffs from being positively biased. In
replicator-type evolutionary dynamics, it is shown that even a relatively small
participation cost extinguishes the merit of heterogeneous networks in terms of
cooperation. In this situation, more connected players earn less so that they
are no longer spreaders of cooperation. Instead, those with fewer contacts win
and guide the evolution. The participation cost, or the baseline payoff, is
irrelevant in homogeneous populations but is essential for evolutionary games
on heterogeneous networks.

of phase transition with the available information about the solution of the
computation being the order parameter. We draw a number of striking analogies
between standard thermodynamical quantities such as energy, temperature, work,
and corresponding computational quantities such as the amount of entanglement,
time, potential capacity for computation, respectively. Aside from being
intuitively pleasing, this picture allows us to make novel conjectures, such as
an estimate of the necessary critical time to finish a computation and a
proposal of suitable architectures for universal one-way computation in 1D.
