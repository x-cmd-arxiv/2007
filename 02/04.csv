fitting parameters to single field stars. The most ambitious attempt to pursue
these prospects was by Gilliland et al. (1993) who targeted 11 turn-off stars
in the open cluster M67 (NGC 2682), but the oscillation amplitudes were too
small (<20micromag) to obtain unambiguous detections. Like Gilliland et al.
(1993) we also aim at detecting solar-like oscillations in M67, but we target
red giant stars with expected amplitudes in the range 50-500micromag and
periods of 1 to 8 hours. We analyse our recently published photometry
measurements, obtained during a six-week multisite campaign using nine
telescopes around the world. The observations are compared with simulations and
with estimated properties of the stellar oscillations. Noise levels in the
Fourier spectra as low as 27micromag are obtained for single sites, while the
combined data reach 19micromag, making this the best photometric time series of
an ensemble of red giant stars. These data enable us to make the first test of
the scaling relations (used to estimate frequency and amplitude) with an
homogeneous ensemble of stars. The detected excess power is consistent with the
expected signal from stellar oscillations, both in terms of its frequency range
and amplitude. However, our results are limited by apparent high levels of
non-white noise, which cannot be clearly separated from the stellar signal.

The shells have temperatures of 1 keV and 0.7 keV, compared to an ISM
temperature of 0.23 keV. The estimated expansion speed of the shells is 850
km/s, corresponding to a Mach number of ~ 4. This is the second X-ray detection
of strong shocks produced by a low-power radio galaxy, and allows us to measure
directly the contribution of shock heating to the radio galaxy's total
energetic input to the ISM. We show that the gas properties of the shells and

We estimate the energy stored in the hot gas shells (thermal + kinetic energy)
to be 1.7x10^56 ergs, which is equivalent to the thermal energy of the ISM
within ~11 kpc of the galaxy centre, and a factor of ~25 larger than the

shock heating in the early supersonic phase of FRI radio-source expansion can

antennas $2^a$ the rate (in complex symbols per channel use) of the $g$-SD
codes presented in this paper is $\frac{a+1-g}{2^{a-g}}$. The maximum rate of
the DSD STBCs from QODs reported in the literature is $\frac{a}{2^{a-1}}$ which
is smaller than the rate $\frac{a-1}{2^{a-2}}$ of the DSD codes of this paper,
for $2^a$ transmit antennas. In particular, the reported DSD codes for 8 and 16
transmit antennas offer rates 1 and 3/4 respectively whereas the known STBCs
from QODs offer only 3/4 and 1/2 respectively. The construction of this paper
is applicable for any number of transmit antennas.

show that variation of the resulting action with respect to the coframe

require the use of spinors, Pauli matrices or covariant differentiation. The

the correct amount of the neutralino relic density is generated as an interplay
of several processes. This feature makes the explanation of the observed amount

hierarchy between moduli masses, the gravitino mass and the scale of the
cosmological constant has been revisited in the context of supergravities with
consistent D-terms. We have studied (extended) racetrack models where
supersymmetry breaking and moduli stabilisation cannot be separated from each
other. We show that even in such cases the realistic hierarchy can be achieved
on the expense of a single fine-tuning. The presence of two condensates changes
the role of the constant term in the superpotential, W_0, and solutions with
small vacuum energy and large gravitino mass can be found even for very small
values of W_0. Models where D-terms are allowed to vanish at finite vevs of
moduli fields - denoted `cancellable' D-terms - and the ones where D-terms may
vanish only at infinite vevs of some moduli - denoted `non-cancellable' -
differ markedly in their properties. It turns out that the tuning with respect
to the Planck scale required in the case of cancellable D-terms is much weaker
than in the case of non-cancellable ones. We have shown that, against
intuition, a vanishing D-term can trigger F-term uplifting of the vacuum energy
due to the stringent constraint it imposes on vacuum expectation values of
charged fields. Finally we note that our models only rely on two dimensionful
parameters: M_P and W_0.

questions has been: is there an outer billiards system with an unbounded orbit.
We answer this question by proving that outer billiards defined relative to the
Penrose Kite has an unbounded orbit. The Penrose kite is the quadrilateral that
appears in the famous Penrose tiling. We also analyze some of the finer orbit
structure of outer billiards on the penrose kite. This analysis shows that
there is an uncountable set of unbounded orbits. Our method of proof relates
the problem to self-similar tilings, polygon exchange maps, and arithmetic

falls to an upright position and then rocks up to a somewhat opposite tilt.
Superficially this rocking motion involves a collision when the flat circular
base of the container slaps the table before rocking up to the opposite tilt. A
keen eye notices that the after-slap rising tilt is not generally just
diametrically opposite the initial tilt but is veered to one side or the other.
Cushman and Duistermaat (2006) recently noticed such veering when a flat disk
with rolling boundary conditions is dropped nearly flat. Here, we generalize
these rolling disk results to arbitrary axi-symmetric bodies and to
frictionless sliding. More specifically, we study motions that almost but do
not quite involve a face-down collision of the round container's bottom with
the table-top. These motions involve a sudden rapid motion of the contact point
around the circular base. Surprisingly, like for the rolling disk, the net
angle of motion of this contact point is nearly independent of initial
conditions. This angle of turn depends simply on the geometry and mass
distribution but not on the moment of inertia about the symmetry axis. We
derive simple asymptotic formulas for this ""angle of turn"" of the contact point
and check the result with numerics and with simple experiments. For tall
containers (height much bigger than radius) the angle of turn is just over
$\pi$ and the sudden rolling motion superficially appears as a nearly symmetric
collision leading to leaning on an almost diametrically opposite point on the
bottom rim.

S and B in various deformed energy shells, it is found that, for the
overwhelming majority of the ""universe"" states (they are entangled at least),
the diagonal canonical typicality remains robust with respect to finite
interactions between S and B. Particularly, the kinematic decoherence is
utilized here to account for the vanishing of the off-diagonal elements of the
reduced density matrix of S. It is pointed out that the non-vanishing
off-diagonal elements due to the finiteness of bath and the stronger
system-bath interaction might offer more novelties of the quantum
thermalization.
