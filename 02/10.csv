S. Refsdal proposed the idea in 1966. The parallax measurement yields a
projected velocity \tilde v ~ 230 km/s, the typical value expected for halo
lenses, but an order of magnitude smaller than would be expected for lenses
lying in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) itself. The lens is a weak (i.e.,
non-caustic-crossing) binary, which complicates the analysis considerably but
ultimately contributes additional constraints. Using a test proposed by Assef
et al. (2006), which makes use only of kinematic information about different
populations but does not make any assumptions about their respective mass
functions, we find that the likelihood ratio is L_halo/L_SMC = 20. Hence, halo
lenses are strongly favored but SMC lenses are not definitively ruled out.
Similar Spitzer observations of additional lenses toward the Magellanic Clouds
would clarify the nature of the lens population. The Space Interferometry
Mission could make even more constraining measurements.

the geometry to be one where the H+ region and associated PDR is embedded in
the molecular cloud. Constant density PDR calculations are presented which
predict line intensities as a function of AV (or N(H)), hydrogen density (nH),
and incident UV radiation field (G0). We find that a single component model
with AV ~650 mag, nH = 5x10^5 cm-3, and G0 = 7x10^4 reproduces the observed [O

to line optical depth effects in the [O I] lines, produced by a large column
density of atomic/molecular gas. We find that the effects of a density-law
would increase our derived AV, while the effects of an asymmetric geometry
would decrease AV, with the two effects largely canceling. We conclude that
optically selected H+ regions adjacent to PDRs, such as Orion, likely have a
different viewing angle or geometry than similar regions detected through IR

utility for any PDR embedded in a molecular cloud.

young stars are almost always estimated only from evolutionary tracks. Since
the tracks published by different groups differ, it is often only possible to
give a rough estimate of the masses of young stars. It is thus crucial to test
and calibrate the tracks. Up to now, only a few tests of the tracks could be
carried out. However, with the VLTI it is now possible to set constrains on the
tracks by determining the masses of many young binary stars precisely. In order
to use the VLTI efficiently, a first step is to find suitable targets, which is
the purpose of this work. Given the distance of nearby star-forming regions,
suitable VLTI targets are binaries with orbital periods between at least 50
days, and few years. Although a number of surveys for detecting spectroscopic
binaries have been carried out, most of the binaries found so far have periods
which are too short. We thus surveyed the Chamaeleon, Corona Australis, Lupus,
Sco-Cen, rho Ophiuci star-forming regions in order to search for spectroscopic
binaries with periods longer than 50 days, which are suitable for the VLTI
observations. As a result of the 8 years campaign we discovered 8 binaries with
orbital periods longer than 50 days. Amongst the newly discovered long period
binaries is CS Cha, which is one of the few classical T Tauri stars with a
circumbinary disk. The survey is limited to objects with masses higher than 0.1
to 0.2 Modot for periods between 1 and 8 years. We find that the frequency of
binaries with orbital periods < 3000 days is of 20+/-5 percent. The frequency
of long and short period pre-main sequence spectroscopic binaries is about the
same as for stars in the solar neighbourhood. In total 14 young binaries are
now known which are suitable for mass determination with the VLTI.

rapidly rotating black holes has been seen as an astrophysically important
effect that may significantly reduce or even nullify the efficiency of the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism of powering the relativistic jets in Active Galactic
Nuclei and Gamma Ray Bursts. However, this Meissner-like effect is seen in
vacuum solutions of black hole electrodynamics whereas the Blandford-Znajek
mechanism is concerned with plasma-filled magnetospheres. In this paper we
argue that conductivity dramatically changes the properties of axisymmetric
electromagnetic solutions -- even for a maximally rotating Kerr black hole the
magnetic field is pulled inside the event horizon. Moreover, the conditions
resulting in outgoing Poynting flux in the Blandford-Znajek mechanism exist not
on the event horizon but everywhere within the black hole ergosphere. Thus, the
Meissner effect is unlikely to be of interest in astrophysics of black holes,
at least not in the way this has been suggested so far. These conclusions are
supported by the results of time-dependent numerical simulations with three
different computer codes. The test problems involve black holes with the
rotation parameter ranging from $a=0.999$ to $a=1$. The pure electrodynamic
simulations deal with the structure of conductive magnetospheres of black holes
placed in a uniform-at-infinity magnetic field (Wald's problem) and the
magnetohydrodynamic simulations are used to study the magnetospheres arising in
the problem of disk accretion.

determining all stellar parameters and in particular the mass, where a good

photometry from HST/ACS, we find that the absorption-line members define an
exceptionally tight red sequence over a span of ~3.5 magnitudes in i775: their
intrinsic scatter in (V-i) color is only 0.048, corresponding to a (U-B)_z
scatter of 0.041. Their color scatter is comparable to that of the ellipticals
(sigma_Vi=0.055), but measurably smaller than that of the combined E+S0 sample
(sigma_Vi=0.072). The color scatter of MS1054's absorption-line population is
approximately twice that of the ellipticals in Coma; this difference is
consistent with passive evolution where most of the absorption-line members
(>75%) formed by z~2, and all of them by z~1.2. For red members, we find a
trend (>95% confidence) of weakening Hdelta absorption with redder colors that
we conclude is due to age: in MS1054, the color scatter on the red sequence is
driven by differences in mean stellar age of up to ~1.5 Gyr. We also generate
composite spectra and estimate that the average S0 in MS1054 is ~0.5-1 Gyr
younger than the average elliptical; this difference in mean stellar age is
mainly due to a number of S0s that are blue (18%) and/or are post-starburst
systems (21%).

mid-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 234 radio-quiet quasars
originally presented by Richards et al. In quasars without evident dust
extinction, the spectrally integrated optical and infrared luminosities are
linearly correlated over nearly three decades in luminosity. We find a
significant (>99.99% confidence) correlation between the 1.8-8.0 micron
spectral index and infrared luminosity that indicates an enhancement of the
mid-infrared continuum with increasing luminosity. Coupled with strong evidence
for spectral curvature in more luminous quasars, we conclude this trend is
likely a manifestation of the `near-infrared (3-5 micron) bump' noticed in
earlier quasar SED surveys. The strength of this feature is indicative of the
contribution of emission from the hottest (>1000 K) dust to the mid-infrared
spectrum; higher luminosity quasars tend to show more hot dust emission.
Finally, the comparable distribution of bolometric corrections from the
monochromatic 3 micron luminosity as well as its lack of sensitivity to dust
extinction as compared to the standard bolometric correction from nu*L_{5100A}
suggest that the former may be a more robust indicator of bolometric quasar
luminosity. The close link between the power in the mid-infrared and optical
and the effect of luminosity on the shape of the mid-infrared continuum
indicate that considering mid-infrared emission independent of the properties
of the quasar itself is inadequate for understanding the parsec-scale quasar
environment.

hole masses from small to large: narrow to broad line Seyfert galaxies,
providing new evidence for the evolutionary sequence of Seyfert galaxies. We
find that the opening angles of the torus in NLS1s and absorbed non-HBLR S2s
are significantly smaller than that in BLS1s and HBLR S2s. The growth of the
black holes and increases of the opening angles of the tori determine the
various appearances of Seyfert galaxies. We also find that the unabsorbed
Seyfert 2 galaxies could be caused by low gas-to-dust ratios in the present
sample. This indicates that the star formation histories could be different in
the unabsorbed from in absorbed Seyfert 2 galaxies, showing evidence for
suppressed star formation by black hole activities. We outline a new
unification scheme based on the orientation hypothesis: Seyfert galaxies can be
unified by including growth of black holes, Eddington ratios, changing opening
angles of tori and gas-to-dust ratios in the tori. Seyfert galaxies are tending
to finally evolve to unabsorbed non-HBLR Seyfert 2 galaxies, in which the black
holes are accreting with low accretion rates and both the broad line region and
dusty torus disappear.

clusters, namely NGC 265, K~29, NGC 290, located in the main body of the Small
Magellanic Cloud. In addition, we derive the history of star formation in the
companion fields. We make use of ACS/WFC HST archive data. For the clusters,
the age and metallicity are derived fitting the integrated luminosity function
with single synthetic stellar population by means of the $\chi^2$ minimization.
For the companion fields, the history of star formation is derived using the
$\chi^2$ minimization together with the downhill-simplex method.For the
clusters we find the following ages and metallicities: NGC 265 has
log(Age)=$8.5\pm0.3$ yr and metallicity $0.004\pm0.003$(or [Fe/H]=-0.62);
\object{K~29} has log(Age)=$8.2\pm0.2$ yr and metallicity Z=$0.003\pm0.002$ (or
[Fe/H]=-0.75); NGC 290 has log(Age)=$7.8\pm0.5$ yr and metallicity
$0.003\pm0.002$(or [Fe/H]=-0.75). The superior quality of the data allows the
study of the initial mass function down to M$ \sim$ 0.7 M$_\odot$. The initial
mass function turns out to be in agreement with the standard Kroupa model. The
comparison of the NGC 265 luminosity function with the theoretical ones from
stellar models both taking overshoot from the convective core into account and
neglecting it, seems to suggest that a certain amount of convective overshoot
is required. The star formation rate of the field population presents periods
of enhancements at 300-400 Myr, 3-4 Gyr and finally 6 Gyr. However it is
relatively quiescent at ages older than 6 Gyr. This result suggests that at
older ages, the tidal interaction between the Magellanic Clouds and the Milky
Way was not able to trigger significant star formation events.

at arbitrary rational filling factors for the 2DEG in FQHE regime is given. Its
use allows to obtain analytic expressions for the solutions at filling factors

two general classes of states characterized by $\gamma=1$ or $\gamma={1/2}$
particles per unit cell. Instead of the periodic peaks of the Wigner solid
solution, the new states show electron densities forming percolating ridges
that may favor an energy decrease through correlated ring of exchange
contributions. Therefore, we estimate that they can realize mean field versions
of the so called Hall Crystal (HC) states. The obtained analytic HC solution
shows the same crystalline symmetry that the corresponding WC state in its
class $\gamma=1$, but a qualitatively different charge density distribution.
The energy dependence of the corresponding HC and WC states on the filling
factor is also evaluated here for the class $\gamma=1/2$. The results show a
crossover between HC state and the Wigner crystal, close to filling 1/7.
Therefore, transitions may occur from one to the other as the electron density
is varied. This result is consistent with recent experimental findings.

add a non local interaction which depends on two potentials. The model is
solved exactly in terms of a Jost like function which is analytic in the
complex upper half plane. This function vanishes, either on the real axis,
corresponding to bound states, or below it, corresponding to resonances. We
find potentials for which the resonances converge asymptotically toward the
average position of the Riemann zeros. These potentials realize, at the quantum
level, the semiclassical regularization of H = x p proposed by Berry and
Keating. Furthermore, a linear superposition of them, obtained by the action of
integer dilations, yields a Jost function whose real part vanishes at the
Riemann zeros and whose imaginary part resembles the one of the zeta function.
Our results suggest the existence of a quantum mechanical model where the
Riemann zeros would make a point like spectrum embbeded in the continuum. The
associated spectral interpretation would resolve the emission/absortion debate
between Berry-Keating and Connes. Finally, we indicate how our results can be
extended to the Dirichlet L-functions constructed with real characters.

object, a linear system similar to those which were observed by Halton Arp. We
suppose that these stars remains bright in extreme UV, to maintain the strong
ionization of a bubble of hot hydrogen nearly transparent in far UV (defined as
the range of Lyman frequencies of atomic hydrogen). Outside the bubbles, three
shells containing atomic hydrogen generate resonant, superradiant scatterings
at Lyman frequencies, in tangential competing modes. The superradiance cools
the gas and absorbs strongly the radial far UV light, hiding the stars. The
shells may be identified with the inner active shells found from light echoes.

of rainfall behavior must rest on the acknowledgment of its discrete drop-like
nature.

are reported for the interior of a rotating, perfectly-conducting, rigid
spherical shell that is insulator-coated on the inside. A previously-reported
spectral method is used which relies on a Galerkin expansion in
Chandrasekhar-Kendall vector eigenfunctions of the curl. The new ingredient in
this set of computations is the rigid rotation of the sphere. After a few
purely hydrodynamic examples are sampled (spin down, Ekman pumping, inertial
waves), attention is focused on selective decay and the MHD dynamo problem. In
dynamo runs, prescribed mechanical forcing excites a persistent velocity field,
usually turbulent at modest Reynolds numbers, which in turn amplifies a small
seed magnetic field that is introduced. A wide variety of dynamo activity is
observed, all at unit magnetic Prandtl number. The code lacks the resolution to
probe high Reynolds numbers, but nevertheless interesting dynamo regimes turn
out to be plentiful in those parts of parameter space in which the code is
accurate. The key control parameters seem to be mechanical and magnetic
Reynolds numbers, the Rossby and Ekman numbers (which in our computations are
varied mostly by varying the rate of rotation of the sphere) and the amount of
mechanical helicity injected. Magnetic energy levels and magnetic dipole
behavior are exhibited which fluctuate strongly on a time scale of a few eddy
turnover times. These seem to stabilize as the rotation rate is increased until
the limit of the code resolution is reached.

approach is used to tackle this nonlinear problem. The method is based on the
computation of the so-called Conditional Nonlinear Optimal Perturbation (CNOP)
which is a nonlinear generalization of the linear singular vector approach
(LSV). It is shown that linearly stable thermohaline circulation states can
become nonlinearly unstable and the properties of the perturbations with
optimal nonlinear growth are determined. An asymmetric nonlinear response to
perturbations exists with respect to the sign of finite amplitude freshwater
perturbations, on both thermally dominated and salinity dominated thermohaline
flows. This asymmetry is due to the nonlinear interaction of the perturbations
through advective processes.

of these motifs are known transcription factors, but sequence inspection often
provides valuable clues, even discovery of novel motifs with uncharacterized
function in gene expression. Coupled with the complexity underlying
tissue-specific gene expression, there are several motifs that are putatively
responsible for expression in a certain cell type. This has important
implications in understanding fundamental biological processes, such as
development and disease progression. In this work, we present an approach to
the principled selection of motifs (not necessarily transcription factor sites)
and examine its application to several questions in current bioinformatics
research.
  There are two main contributions of this work: Firstly, we introduce a new
metric for variable selection during classification, and secondly, we
investigate a problem of finding specific sequence motifs that underlie tissue
specific gene expression. In conjunction with the SVM classifier we find these
motifs and discover several novel motifs which have not yet been attributed
with any particular functional role (eg: TFBS binding motifs). We hypothesize
that the discovery of these motifs would enable the large-scale investigation
for the tissue specific regulatory potential of any conserved sequence element
identified from genome-wide studies.
  Finally, we propose the utility of this developed framework to not only aid
discovery of discriminatory motifs, but also to examine the role of any motif
of choice in co-regulation or co-expression of gene groups.

for each signal 7. A further Fourier transform is then performed8,9, to analyze
these new functions, finding typical frequencies and their corresponding

states with variable entropies, temperatures and mean energies. We derive the
most general statement of Landauer's Principle and prove it's universality,
extending considerably the validity of previous proofs. This confirms
conjectures made in [Mar05b], in particular that all logical operations may, in
principle, be performed in a thermodynamically reversible fashion. We
demonstrate a physical process that can perform any computation without work
requirements or heat exchange with the environment. Many widespread statements
of Landauer's Principle are shown to be only special cases of our generalised
principle.

can therefore be used for the controlled generation of entanglement. Finite
photon detector efficiencies do not affect the success rate of the state
preparation, which is triggered upon the observation of a macroscopic
fluorescence signal. High fidelities can be achieved even in the vicinity of
the bad cavity limit due to the inherent role of dissipation in the jump
process.
