Andromeda IX) are satellites of the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxies. They
are members of a class of faint galaxies, devoid of gas, known as dwarf
spheroidals, and have by far the highest ratio of dark to luminous matter. None
of the models proposed to unravel their origin can simultaneously explain their
exceptional dark matter content and their proximity to a much larger galaxy.
Here we report simulations showing that the progenitors of these galaxies were
probably gas-dominated dwarf galaxies that became satellites of a larger galaxy
earlier than the other dwarf spheroidals. We find that a combination of tidal
shocks and ram pressure swept away the entire gas content of such progenitors
about ten billion years ago because heating by the cosmic ultraviolet
background kept the gas loosely bound: a tiny stellar component embedded in a
relatively massive dark halo survived until today. All luminous galaxies should
be surrounded by a few extremely dark-matter-dominated dwarf spheroidal
satellites, and these should have the shortest orbital periods among dwarf
spheroidals because they were accreted early.

optical emission line and radio data. There is no evidence for bi-conical
emission line features on the large-scale and there is a divergance in the
relative position angles of the optical and radio structure. This enables us to
exclude starburst driven outflows. However, we are unable to clearly
distinguish between radiative AGN wind driven outflows and outflows powered by
relativistic radio jets. The small scale bi-conical features, indicative of
such mechanisms could be below the resolution limit of ACS, especially if
aligned close to the line of sight. In addition, there may be offsets between
the radio and optical nuclei induced by heavy dust obscuration, nebular
continuum or scattered light from the AGN.

great potential for finding large numbers of such dwarfs. Ultracool dwarfs are
selected by combinations of their YJH(K) UKIDSS colours and SDSS DR4 z-J and

of DR4 dropouts. After passing visual inspection tests, candidates have been
followed up by methane imaging and spectroscopy at 4m and 8m-class facilities.
Our main result is the discovery following CH4 imaging and spectroscopy of a

ULASJ 1301+0023, has very similar CH4 colours but has not yet been confirmed

might have formed from binary mergers of disk galaxies. Difficulties with the
scenario that emerged from earlier studies included providing the necessary
stellar mass and metallicity, maintaining the tight color-magnitude relation
and avoiding phase space limits. In this paper we revisit the issue and put
constraints on the binary disc merger scenario based on the stellar populations
of disc galaxies. We draw the following conclusions: Low redshift collisionless
or gaseous mergers of present day Milky Way like disc galaxies do not form
present day elliptical galaxies. Binary mergers of the progenitors of present
day Milky Way like disc galaxies can have evolved into intermediate mass
elliptical galaxies ($M < M_*$) if they have merged earlier than $\approx$ 3-4
Gyrs ago. Assuming that most present day disk galaxies formed in a similar way
to the Milky Way model presented here, more massive giant ellipticals in
general can not have formed from binary mergers of the progenitors of present
day disc galaxies. A major reason for these conclusions is that the mass in
metals of typical disk galaxy is approximately a factor of 4-8 smaller than the
mass in metals of a typical early-type galaxy and this ratio grows to larger
values with increasing redshift.

Eight bursts of seventeen entering the sample, have significant extragalactic

a few hundred times the solar value. There is a complete lack of correlation
between the X-ray and optical column densities. This, and the large range and
extreme values of these 'metallicities', suggest that the column densities
derived by one or both methods are not a reliable indication of the true total
column densities towards GRBs. Ionisation of the GRB's gas cloud to large
distances along the line of sight seems the most likely cause. From the lower
limit on the total column density and the UV luminosity of the GRBs, we derive
a maximum distance to the majority of the gas surrounding GRBs of ~3 pc,
suggesting that the gas probed by optical afterglow spectra is not the cloud in
which the burst occurs. This is an encouraging result for the use of GRB
optical afterglows as probes of the interstellar medium (ISM) in their host
galaxies, as the ISM observed is less likely to be strongly affected by the GRB

Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) and their progeny, the Centaur objects. These
physical parameters are critical, e.g., for interpreting spectroscopic data,
deriving densities from the masses of binary systems, and predicting
occultation tracks. Here we summarize Spitzer Space Telescope observations of
47 KBOs and Centaurs at wavelengths near 24 and 70 microns. We interpret the
measurements using a variation of the Standard Thermal Model (STM) to derive
the physical properties (albedo and diameter) of the targets. We also summarize
the results of other efforts to measure the albedos and sizes of KBOs and
Centaurs. The three or four largest KBOs appear to constitute a distinct class
in terms of their albedos. From our Spitzer results, we find that the geometric
albedo of KBOs and Centaurs is correlated with perihelion distance (darker
objects having smaller perihelia), and that the albedos of KBOs (but not
Centaurs) are correlated with size (larger KBOs having higher albedos). We also
find hints that albedo may be correlated with with visible color (for
Centaurs). Interestingly, if the color correlation is real, redder Centaurs
appear to have higher albedos. Finally, we briefly discuss the prospects for
future thermal observations of these primitive outer solar system objects.

of magnetic stresses and the creation and propagation of MHD jets. We find that
a quasi-steady state can be quickly established after bounce, during which a
well-collimated MHD jet is maintained by continuous pumping of power from the
differentially rotating core. If the initial spin period of the progenitor core
is $\sles$ 2 seconds, the free energy reservoir in the secularly evolving
protoneutron star is adequate to power a supernova explosion, and may be enough
for a hypernova. The jets are well collimated by the infalling material and
magnetic hoop stresses, and maintain a small opening angle. We see evidence of
sausage instabilities in the emerging jet stream. Neutrino heating is
sub-dominant in the rapidly rotating models we explore, but can contribute
10$-$25% to the final explosion energy. Our simulations suggest that even in
the case of modest or slow rotation, a supernova explosion might be followed by
a secondary, weak MHD jet explosion, which, because of its weakness may to date
have gone unnoticed in supernova debris. Furthermore, we suggest that the
generation of a non-relativistic MHD precursor jet during the early
protoneutron star/supernova phase is implicit in both the collapsar and
""millisecond magnetar"" models of GRBs. The multi-D, multi-group, rapidly
rotating RMHD simulations we describe here are a start along the path towards
more realistic simulations of the possible role of magnetic fields in some of

(embedded) cluster of about 60 stars, with a radius ca. 1.3 pc and an average
stellar surface density of ca. 12 pc^{-2}. We find at least 14 stars with
NIR-excess, 3 of which are possibly Class I objects. The cluster is embedded in
a 1000 Mo molecular/dust core, from which a molecular outflow originates. The
temperature of most of the outflowing gas is < 40 K, and the total mass of the
swept-up material is < 10 Mo. Near the center of the flow, indications of much
higher temperatures are found, probably due to shocks. A spectrum of one of the
probable cluster members shows a tentative likeness to that of a K3III-star

distance. This cluster is the furthest one from the Galactic center yet
detected. The combination of old and recent activity implies that star
formation has been going on for at least 20 Myr, which is difficult to
understand considering the location of this object, where external triggers are
either absent or weak, compared to the inner Galaxy. This suggests that once

counts and 2-D clustering - to an assessment of their detailed,
multi-wavelength properties, their contribution to the history of cosmic star
formation and their links with present-day galaxy populations. In this paper,
we identify robust radio and/or IR counterparts, and hence accurate positions,
for over two thirds of the SCUBA HAlf-Degree Extragalactic Survey (SHADES)
Source Catalogue, presenting optical, 24-um and radio images of each SMG.
Observed trends in identification rate have given no strong rationale for
pruning the sample. Uncertainties in submm position are found to be consistent
with theoretical expectations, with no evidence for significant additional
sources of error. Employing the submm/radio redshift indicator, via a
parameterisation appropriate for radio-identified SMGs with spectroscopic
redshifts, yields a median redshift of 2.8 for the radio-identified subset of
SHADES, somewhat higher than the median spectroscopic redshift. We present a
diagnostic colour-colour plot, exploiting Spitzer photometry, in which we
identify regions commensurate with SMGs at very high redshift. Finally, we find
that significantly more SMGs have multiple robust counterparts than would be
expected by chance, indicative of physical associations. These multiple systems
are most common amongst the brightest SMGs and are typically separated by 2-6"",
or 15-50/(sin i) kpc at z ~ 2, consistent with early bursts seen in merger
simulations.

result of stellar density or total association mass, but instead might depend
on another environmental parameter like the gas temperature. We also analyze
the mass ratio distribution as a function of mass and find that it agrees with
the distribution for field stars to within the statistical uncertainties. The
binary populations in these associations generally follow the empirical
mass-maximum separation relation observed for field binaries, but we have found

clumps found in a wide-field (10 X 10 arcmin) census of clouds in 32 massive
star-forming regions that are known to harbour UCHII regions.
  We find that 65% of the observed sources have strong NH2D emission and more
than 50% of the sources exhibit a high degree of deuteration, (0.1 < NH2D/NH3 <
0.7), 0.7 being the highest observed deuteration of NH3 reported to date. Our
search for NHD2 in two sources did not result in a detection. The enhancement
in deuteration coincides with moderate CO depletion onto dust grains. There is
no evidence of a correlation between the two processes, though an underlying
correlation cannot be ruled out as the depletion factor is very likely to be
only a lower limit. In summary, we find CO depletion and high deuteration
towards cold cores in massive star forming regions. Therefore, these are good
candidates for sources at the early phases of massive star formation. While our
sensitive upper limits on NHD2 do not prove the predictions of the gas-phase

  ApJ",,"10.1086/521781",,"astro-ph",,"  Migration of protoplanets in their gaseous host disks may be largely
responsible for the observed orbital distribution of extrasolar planets. Recent
simulations have shown that the magnetorotational turbulence thought to drive
accretion in protoplanetary disks can affect migration by turning it into an
orbital random walk. However, these simulations neglected the disk's ionization
structure. Low ionization fraction near the midplane of the disk can decouple
the magnetic field from the gas, forming a dead zone with reduced or no
turbulence. Here, to understand the effect of dead zones on protoplanetary
migration, we perform numerical simulations of a small region of a stratified
disk with magnetorotational turbulence confined to thin active layers above and
below the midplane. Turbulence in the active layers exerts decreased, but still
measurable, gravitational torques on a protoplanet located at the disk
midplane. We find a decrease of two orders of magnitude in the diffusion
coefficient for dead zones with dead-to-active surface density ratios
approaching realistic values in protoplanetary disks. This torque arises
primarily from density fluctuations within a distance of one scale height of
the protoplanet. Turbulent torques have correlation times of only $\sim 0.3$
orbital periods and apparently time-stationary distributions. These properties
are encouraging signs that stochastic methods can be used to determine the
orbital evolution of populations of protoplanets under turbulent migration. Our
results indicate that dead zones may be dynamically distinct regions for
protoplanetary migration.

infrared to active galactic nuclei (AGN) Eddington luminosity, $L_{\rm
IR}/L_{\rm Edd}$, over four orders of magnitude for ultraluminous infrared
galaxies with type I Seyfert nuclei (type I ULIRGs) and nearby QSOs. This
anti-correlation ($M_{\rm BH}$ vs. $L_{\rm IR}/L_{\rm Edd}$) can be interpreted
as the anti-correlation between the mass of a SMBH and the rate of mass
accretion onto a SMBH normalized by the AGN Eddington rate, $\dot{M}_{\rm
BH}/\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$. In other words, the mass accretion rate $\dot{M}_{\rm
BH}$ is not proportional to that of the central BH mass. Thus, this
anti-correlation indicates that BH growth is determined by the external mass
supply process, and not the AGN Eddington-limited mechanism. Moreover, we found
an interesting tendency for type I ULIRGs to favor a super-Eddington accretion
flow, whereas QSOs tended to show a sub-Eddington flow. On the basis of our
findings, we suggest that a central SMBH grows by changing its mass accretion
rate from super-Eddington to sub-Eddington. According to a coevolution scenario
of ULIRGs and QSOs based on the radiation drag process, it has been predicted
that a self-gravitating massive torus, whose mass is larger than a central BH,
exists in the early phase of BH growth (type I ULIRG phase) but not in the
final phase of BH growth (QSO phase). At the same time, if one considers the
mass accretion rate onto a central SMBH via a turbulent viscosity, the
anti-correlation ($M_{\rm BH}$ vs. $L_{\rm IR}/L_{\rm Edd}$) is well explained
by the positive correlation between the mass accretion rate $\dot{M}_{\rm BH}$
and the mass ratio of a massive torus to a SMBH.

ionisation parameters log\xi~0 and 2.5. Comparing this observation with a 2002
XMM-Newton data set, we see a clear anti-correlation between the X-ray
ionisation parameter xi_X and the 0.1-10 keV luminosity. Viable explanations
for this effect include transient clouds or filaments crossing the line of
sight in a complex geometry or a gas observed in non-equilibrium. The outflow
velocity of the X-ray low-ionisation absorber is consistent with the outflow of
the UV absorber detected in a past Hubble Space Telescope observation. In
addition, the ionic column densities of CIV and NV derived from the X-ray model
are consistent with the UV values. This suggests that the low-ionisation
outflowing gas may survive for many years, despite large changes in flux, and
that there is a tight connection between the X-ray and UV absorbers that can
only be confirmed with a simultaneous UV and X-ray observation.

is based on differences between images of a hadronic shower and a gamma induced

of hadronic events containing Cherenkov light from one gamma subcascade only is
possible. In fact, simulations show that for the MAGIC telescope their fraction
in the total protonic background is about 1.5% to 5.2% depending on the trigger
threshold. It has been found that such images have small sizes (mainly below
400 photoelectrons) which correspond to the low energy primary gamma's (below
100 GeV). It is shown that parameters describing shapes of images from one
subcascade have similar distributions to primary gamma events, so those
parameters are not efficient in all methods of gamma selection. Similar studies
based on MC simulations are presented also for the images from 2 gamma
subcascades which are products of the same pi^0 decay. The ratio of the number
of the expected background from false gamma and one pi^0 to the number of the
triggered high energy photons from the Crab direction has been estimated for
images with a small alpha parameter to show that the occurrence of this type of
protonic shower is the reason for the difficulties with true gamma selection at

homologous among various white dwarf (WD) masses and chemical compositions when
free-free emission from optically thin ejecta dominates the continuum flux of
novae. Such a homologous template light-curve is called a ``universal decline

weakly on the chemical composition, so we are able to roughly estimate the WD
mass from the light-curve fitting. We have applied the universal decline law to
the old nova GK Persei 1901 and recent novae that outbursted in 2005. The
estimated WD mass is 1.15 M_sun for GK Per, which is consistent with a central
value of the WD mass determined from the orbital velocity variations. The other
WD masses of 10 novae in 2005 are also estimated to be 1.05 M_sun (V2361 Cyg),
1.15 M_sun (V382 Nor), 1.2 M_sun (V5115 Sgr), 0.7 M_sun (V378 Ser), 0.9 M_sun

of ten novae in the year 2005 are probably neon novae on an O-Ne-Mg WD. Each WD
mass depends weakly on the chemical composition (especially the hydrogen

+0.5(X-0.35) M_sun for the six CO novae and by +0.5(X-0.55) M_sun for the four

Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7582 taken four years apart (2001 May and 2005 April). We
present the analysis of the high-resolution (0.3-1 keV) RGS and low-resolution
(0.3-10 keV) EPIC spectroscopic data. A comparison with a 1998 BeppoSAX
observation suggests that XMM-Newton caught the source in a
`reflection-dominated' phase, measuring the lowest continuum flux level ever
(F(2-10 keV) = 2.3 x 10^(-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1) in 2005. NGC 7582 therefore
experienced a dramatic spectral transition most likely due to the partial
switching-off of the nuclear activity. The XMM-Newton spectrum of the continuum
emission is very complex. It can be well described by a model consisting of a
combination of a heavily absorbed (Nh ~ 10^(24) cm^-2) power law and a pure
reflection component both obscured by a column density of ~ 4 x 10^(22) cm^-2.
Notably, we detect a significant increase by a factor of ~2 in the column
density of the inner, thicker absorber covering the primary X-ray source
between 2001 and 2005. The 2005 XMM-Newton spectra show the strongest Fe Kalpha
emission line ever measured in this source. This is consistent with the line
delayed time response to the decrease of the nuclear activity. Our analysis
also reveals that the soft X-ray spectrum is dominated by emission lines from
highly ionized metals. The detection of a narrow OVIII radiative recombination
continuum suggests an origin in a photoionized plasma.

the bolometric light curve (about 0.45 solar masses) lies near the lower limit

calculated the scattering time and the mobility of the majority and
minority-spin carriers with both the effects of thermal spin fluctuations and
of spatial disorder of magnetic atoms taken into account. These are responsible
for the magnetic-field dependence of electrical resistivity. Namely, the
application of the external magnetic field suppresses the thermodynamic spin
fluctuations thus promoting negative magnetoresistance. Simultaneously,
scattering off the built-in spatial fluctuations of the atomic spin
concentrations may increase with the magnetic field. The latter effect is due
to the growth of the magnitude of random local Zeeman splittings with the
magnetic field. It promotes positive magnetoresistance. We discuss the role of
the above effects on magnetoresistance of non-degenerate semiconductors where

with \Delta relative difference in plasmon velocities. We show that \Delta \neq

longitudinal noise is restricted by the shorter Landau-Zener time, the same as
in the regular Landau-Zener process. The large ratio of time scales allows
solving the Landau-Zener problem with longitudinal noise only, then solving the
same problem with the transverse noise only and matching the two solutions. The
correlation of the longitudinal and transverse noise renormalizes the
Landau-Zener transition matrix element and can strongly enhance the survival
probability, whereas the transverse noise always reduces it. Both longitudinal

proportional to the noise intensity. If the noise is fast, its intensity at

which are expected to be modified by the doping-induced tuning of the Fermi
energy level $\epsilon_F$, obtained through the intercalation of SWNTs with
alkali atoms or by the application of a gate potential. We present a
Density-Functional Theory (DFT) study of the phonon properties of a (9,9)
metallic SWNT as a function of electronic doping. For such study, we use, as in
standard DFT calculations of vibrational properties, the Born-Oppenheimer (BO)
approximation. We also develop an analytical model capable of reproducing and
interpreting our DFT results. Both DFT calculations and this model predict, for
increasing doping levels, a series of EPC-induced KAs in the vibrational mode
parallel to the tube axis at the $\mathbf\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone,
usually indicated in Raman spectroscopy as the $G^-$ peak. Such KAs would arise
each time a new conduction band is populated. However, we show that they are an
artifact of the BO approximation. The inclusion of non-adiabatic (NA) effects
dramatically affects the results, predicting KAs at $\mathbf\Gamma$ only when
$\epsilon_F$ is close to a band crossing $E_{X}$. For each band crossing a
double KA occurs for $\epsilon_F=E_{X}\pm \hbar\omega/2$, where $\hbar\omega$
is the phonon energy. In particular, for a 1.2 $nm$ metallic nanotube, we
predict a KA to occur in the so-called $G^-$ peak at a doping level of about
$N_{el}/C=\pm 0.0015$ atom ($\epsilon_F\approx \pm 0.1 ~eV$). Furthermore, we

a finite-range Fr\""ohlich electron-phonon interaction (EPI) with c-axis
polarized optical phonons is important in cuprate superconductors, in agreement
with an earlier proposal by Alexandrov and Kornilovitch. The estimated
unscreened EPI is so strong that it could easily transform doped holes into
mobile lattice bipolarons in narrow-band Mott insulators such as cuprates.
Applying a continuous-time quantum Monte-Carlo algorithm (CTQMC) we compute the
total energy, effective mass, pair radius, number of phonons and isotope
exponent of lattice bipolarons in the region of parameters where any
approximation might fail taking into account the Coulomb repulsion and the
finite-range EPI. The effects of modifying the interaction range and different
lattice geometries are discussed with regards to analytical
strong-coupling/non-adiabatic results. We demonstrate that bipolarons can be
simultaneously small and light, provided suitable conditions on the
electron-phonon and electron-electron interaction are satisfied. Such light
small bipolarons are a necessary precursor to high-temperature Bose-Einstein
condensation in solids. The light bipolaron mass is shown to be universal in
systems made of triangular plaquettes, due to a novel crab-like motion. Another
surprising result is that the triplet-singlet exchange energy is of the first
order in the hopping integral and triplet bipolarons are heavier than singlets
in certain lattice structures at variance with intuitive expectations. Finally,
we identify a range of lattices where superlight small bipolarons may be
formed, and give estimates for their masses in the anti-adiabatic
approximation.

for Theoretical Studies in Nuclear Physics and Related Areas (ECT*, Trento)
from January 15 to 19, 2007. The workshop gathered both theorists and
experimentalists to discuss the current status of investigations of high-energy
photon-induced processes at different colliders (HERA, RHIC, and Tevatron) as
well as preparations for extension of these studies at the LHC. The main
physics topics covered were: (i) small-$x$ QCD in photoproduction studies with
protons and in electromagnetic (aka. ultraperipheral) nucleus-nucleus
collisions, (ii) hard diffraction physics at hadron colliders, and (iii)
photon-photon collisions at very high energies: electroweak and beyond the
Standard Model processes. These mini-proceedings consist of an introduction and
short summaries of the talks presented at the meeting.

models in the framework of gravity-scalar theory. This new type of self-tuning
mechanism exhibits a remarkable feature. In the limit $g_s \to 0$, $g_s$ being
the string coupling, the geometry of bulk spacetime remains virtually unchanged
by an introduction of the Standard Model(SM)-brane, and consequently it is
virtually unaffected by quantum fluctuations of SM fields with support on the
SM-brane. Such a feature can be obtained by introducing Neveu-Schwarz(NS)-brane
as a background brane on which our SM-brane is to be set. Indeed, field
equations naturally suggest the existence of the background NS-brane. Among the
given such models, of the most interest is the case with $\Lambda=0$, where
$\Lambda$ represents the bulk cosmological constant. This model contains a pair
of coincident branes (of the SM- and the NS-branes), one of which is a
codimension-2 brane placed at the origin of 2d transverse space ($\equiv
\Sigma_2$), another a codimension-1 brane placed at the edge of $\Sigma_2$.
These two branes are (anti) T-duals of each other, and one of them may be
identified as our SM-brane plus the background NS-brane. In the presence of the
background NS-brane (and in the absence of $\Lambda$), the 2d transverse space
$\Sigma_2$ becomes an orbifold $R_2 /Z_n$ with an appropriate deficit angle.
But this is only possible if the ($3+p$)d Planck scale $M_{3+p}$ and the string
scale $M_s$($\equiv 1/\sqrt{\alpha^{\prime}}$) are of the same order, which
accords with the hierarchy assumption \cite{1,2,3} that the electroweak scale
$m_{EW}$ is the only short distance scale existing in nature.

author is based upon the idea that an elementary particle is a physical system
with no excited states. It can be annihilated by the interaction with its
antiparticle but, if not destroyed, its internal structure can never be
modified. All possible states of the particle are just kinematical
modifications of any one of them. The kinematical state space of the
variational formalism of an elementary particle is necessarily a homogeneous
space of the kinematical group of spacetime symmetries. By assuming Poincare
invariance we have already described a model of a classical spinning particle
which satisfies Dirac's equation when quantized. We have recently shown that
the spacetime symmetry group of this Dirac particle is larger than the Poincare
group. It also contains spacetime dilations and local rotations. In this work
we obtain an interaction Lagrangian for two Dirac particles, which is invariant
under this enlarged spacetime group. It describes a short- and long-range
interaction such that when averaged, to supress the spin content of the
particles, describes the instantaneous Coulomb interaction between them. As an
application, we analyse the interaction between two spinning particles, and
show that it is possible the existence of metastable bound states for two
particles of the same charge, when the spins are parallel and provided some
initial conditions are fulfilled. The possibility of formation of bound pairs
is due to the zitterbewegung spin structure of the particles because when the
spin is neglected, the bound states vanish.

the definition of the self-consistent Fermi sea of the perfect crystal, which
is obtained as a minimizer of some periodic problem, as was shown by Catto, Le
Bris and Lions. We also prove some of its properties which were not mentioned
before. Then, we define and study in details a nonlinear model for the
electrons of the crystal in the presence of a defect. We use formal analogies
between the Fermi sea of a perturbed crystal and the Dirac sea in Quantum
Electrodynamics in the presence of an external electrostatic field. The latter
was recently studied by Hainzl, Lewin, S\'er\'e and Solovej, based on ideas
from Chaix and Iracane. This enables us to define the ground state of the
self-consistent Fermi sea in the presence of a defect. We end the paper by
proving that our model is in fact the thermodynamic limit of the so-called
supercell model, widely used in numerical simulations.

  Naive Bayes Classification Models",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH",,"  For many classification and regression problems, a large number of features
are available for possible use - this is typical of DNA microarray data on gene
expression, for example. Often, for computational or other reasons, only a
small subset of these features are selected for use in a model, based on some
simple measure such as correlation with the response variable. This procedure
may introduce an optimistic bias, however, in which the response variable
appears to be more predictable than it actually is, because the high
correlation of the selected features with the response may be partly or wholely
due to chance. We show how this bias can be avoided when using a Bayesian model
for the joint distribution of features and response. The crucial insight is
that even if we forget the exact values of the unselected features, we should
retain, and condition on, the knowledge that their correlation with the
response was too small for them to be selected. In this paper we describe how
this idea can be implemented for ``naive Bayes'' models of binary data.
Experiments with simulated data confirm that this method avoids bias due to
feature selection. We also apply the naive Bayes model to subsets of data
relating gene expression to colon cancer, and find that correcting for bias
from feature selection does improve predictive performance.

presented that is subject to scattering event with small momentum transfer. It
is suited for three dimensions and allows for an additional potential. For a
random value of a phase parameter, it is equivalent to the decoherence by
scattering off plane wave field states. Imposing some condition on the same
phase parameter, the model delivers definite outcomes in a local pointer base.
Common sense notions about the quantum-classical transition are readily
obtained: Decoherent free particle solutions are localized constant-width
wavepackets, quantum barrier scattering results in random reflection and
transmission. The scattering process assumed in the phenomenological model is
realized by scattering of a particle pair interacting by a force-distance law
with small momentum transfer. Particles are localized not by decoherence but by
a classical lensing effect. Schmidt paths in the Schmidt representation of the
multiparticle state are products of single-particle wavepackets. Therefore the
model has a natural 'Many Worlds' interpretation, identifying each Schmidt path
with a classical branch. Different runs of the phenomenological model map the

  Quantum microscopic theory","9pages, 5figures","Phys. Rev. B 73, 195312 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevB.73.195312",,"quant-ph",,"  We have developed a full quantum microscopic theory to analyze the time
evolution of transversal and longitudinal components of an exciton-single
photon system coupled to bulk acoustic phonons. These components are subjected
to two decay processes. One is radiative relaxation and the other is
pure-dephasing due to exciton-phonon interaction. The former results in a decay
with an exponent linear to time, while the latter causes a faster initial decay
than the radiative decay. We analyzed the dependence of the components on the
duration of the input one-photon pulse, temperature, and radiative relaxation
rates. Such a quantitative analysis is important for the developments of
atom-photon interfaces which enable coherent transfer of quantum information
between photons and atomic systems. We found that, for a GaAs spherical quantum
dot in which the exciton interacts with bulk phonons, the maximal probability
of the excited state can be increased up to 75 %. This probability can be
considered as the efficiency for quantum information transfer from photon to
exciton.

  Grothendieck bound","18 pages, two figures, some corrections and additional references,
  published version","Journal of Mathematical Physics 49, 012101 (2008)","10.1063/1.2826227",,"quant-ph",,"  Contemporary versions of Bell's argument against local hidden variable (LHV)
theories are based on the Clauser Horne Shimony and Holt (CHSH) inequality, and
various attempts to generalize it. The amount of violation of these
inequalities cannot exceed the bound set by the Grothendieck constants.
However, if we go back to the original derivation by Bell, and use the perfect
anti-correlation embodied in the singlet spin state, we can go beyond these
bounds. In this paper we derive two-particle Bell inequalities for traceless
two-outcome observables, whose violation in the singlet spin state go beyond
the Grothendieck constants both for the two and three dimensional cases.
Moreover, creating a higher dimensional analog of perfect correlations, and
applying a recent result of Alon and his associates (Invent. Math. 163 499
(2006)) we prove that there are two-particle Bell inequalities for traceless
two-outcome observables whose violation increases to infinity as the dimension
and number of measurements grow. Technically these result are possible because
perfect correlations (or anti-correlations) allow us to transport the indices
of the inequality from the edges of a bipartite graph to those of the complete
graph. Finally, it is shown how to apply these results to mixed Werner states,
provided that the noise does not exceed 20%.

of a single photon pulse. The method is based on registering Hong-Ou-Mandel
interference between photon to be measured and a pair of attenuated and
suitably delayed laser pulses described by a known spectral amplitude. The
density matrix is retrieved from a two-dimensional interferogram of coincidence
counts. The method has been implemented for a type-I downconversion source,
pumped by ultrashort laser pulses. The experimental results agree well with a
theoretical model which takes into account the temporal as well as spatial
effects in the source.
