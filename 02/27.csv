proven to be a valuable tool for assessing the roles of jets and accretion
flows in microquasars, as well as the coupling between the two. The coupling
might manifest itself observationally in the correlated radio and X-ray
variabilities of a source. Such a radio/X-ray correlation has indeed been seen
in several microquasars during the low-hard state and subsequently been claimed
to be universal for all. If proven, the universal correlation would have
profound implications on theoretical models. However, there is already
observational evidence that suggests otherwise. [Aims] In this paper, we
critically examine the radio/X-ray correlation in a sample of microquasars, in
the low-hard state as well as during state transitions, with a goal of testing
the claimed universality of the correlation on observational grounds. [Methods]
We have assembled a comprehensive data set from the
simultaneous/contemporaneous radio and X-ray observations of representative
microquasars. The data have allowed us to quantify the radio/X-ray correlation
on a source by source basis. [Results] We find that the radio/X-ray correlation
of microquasars exhibits diverse behaviors, both in the low-hard and
transitional states, ranging from being very week (or none at all) to very
strong. There is even a hint of spectral dependence of the correlation in some
cases. [Conclusions] Our results rule out the claimed universality of the
radio/X-ray correlation of microquasars, even for the low-hard state. On the
other hand, we do find that the radio and X-ray variabilities are, to varying
degrees, correlated in most cases.

The reprocessing by cold blobs predicts positive time delays and a saturation
in the time delay -- energy relation, which is likely present in the data. The
model requires a strong reflection component and relies on the apparent

D, in particular, hosts a number of small embedded young clusters. We present
the results of a large-scale map in the dust continuum at 1.2 mm of a ~ 1deg x
1deg area within cloud D. The main aim of the observations was to obtain a
complete census of cluster-forming cores and isolated (both high- and low-mass)
young stellar objects in early evolutionary phases. The bolometer array SIMBA
at SEST was used to map the dust emission in the region with a typical
sensitivity of ~ 20 mJy/beam. This allows a mass sensitivity of ~ 0.2 Msun. The
resolution is 24 arcsec, corresponding to ~ 0.08 pc, roughly the radius of a
typical young embedded cluster in the region. The continuum map is also
compared to a large scale map of CO(1-0) integrated emission. Using the
CLUMPFIND algorithm, a robust sample of 29 cores has been obtained, spanning
the size range 0.03 - 0.25 pc and the mass range 0.4 - 88 Msun. The most
massive cores are associated both with red IRAS sources and with embedded young
clusters, and coincide with CO(1-0) integrated emission peaks. The cores are
distributed according to a mass spectrum ~ M^{-alpha} and a mass-versus-size
relation ~ D^{x}, with alpha ~ 1.45 - 1.9 and x ~ 1.1 - 1.7. They appear to
originate in the fragmentation of gas filaments seen in CO(1-0) emission and
their formation is probably induced by expanding shells of gas. The core mass
spectrum is flatter than the Initial Mass Function of the associated clusters
in the same mass range, suggesting further fragmentation within the most
massive cores. A threshold A_V ~ 12 mag seems to be required for the onset of
star formation in the gas.

the effect of the local magneto-rotational instability. The flow consists of an
accretion disk and an accreting corona, and the local dynamo affects the
disk/corona mass exchange. The model is aimed to explain the power spectrum
density of the sources in their soft, disk-dominated states. The local
perturbations of the magnetic field in the disk are described as in King et al.
(2004) and Mayer and Pringle (2005), but the time-dependent local magnetic
field is assumed to affect the local supply of the material to the corona.
Since the viscous timescale in the corona is much shorter than in the disk, the
local perturbations are not smeared in the corona. Simple analytical estimates
and full time-dependent computations of the disk-corona system are performed.
The accreting corona model can reproduce the broad power spectra of Soft State
X-ray binaries and AGN. The model, however, predicts that (i) sources
undergoing radiation pressure instability (GRS 1915+105) should have
systematically steeper power spectra than other sources, (ii) AGN should have
systematically steeper power spectra than GBH, even if their disks are
described using viscosity proportional to the gas pressure. More precise
measurements of power spectra of Soft State sources are clearly needed.

sulphur abundances from the weak and strong SI lines provides important
constraints on non-LTE effects. The high sulphur abundances reported by others
for some metal-poor stars are not confirmed; instead, when taking non-LTE
effects into account, the Galactic halo stars distribute around a plateau at
[S/Fe] = +0.2 dex with a scatter of 0.07 dex only. This indicates that sulphur
in Galactic halo stars has been made by alpha-capture processes in massive SNe.
The observed scatter in S/Fe is, however, much smaller than predicted from
current stochastic models of the chemical evolution of the early Galaxy,
suggesting that either the models or the calculated yields of massive SNe
should be revised. [Zn/Fe] is close to zero for metallicities in the range -2.0

of S/Zn and find that departures from the solar ratio are significantly reduced
at all metallicities if non-LTE corrections to the abundances of these two
elements are adopted. This effect, if confirmed, would reduce the usefulness of
the S/Zn ratio as a diagnostic of past star-formation activity, but would bring
closer together the values measured in damped Lyman-alpha systems and in
Galactic stars.

helium-burning reactions supply a reasonable fraction of the outgoing flux

  Ast. Rev. accepted Feb 2007",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Binary and Millisecond pulsars have a great deal to teach us about stellar
evolution and are invaluable tools for tests of relativistic theories of
gravity. Our understanding of these objects has been transformed by large-scale
surveys that have uncovered a great deal of new objects, exquisitely timed by
ever-improving instrumentation. Here we argue that there exists a fundamental
relation between the spin period of a pulsar and its companion mass, and that
this determines many of the observable properties of a binary pulsar. No
recycled pulsars exist in which the minimum companion mass exceeds (P/10 ms)
Solar Masses. Furthermore, the three fastest disk millisecond pulsars are
either single, or possess extremely low-mass companions Mc~0.02 Mo, consistent
with this relation. Finally, the four relativistic binaries for which we have
actual measurements of neutron star masses, suggest that not only are their
spin periods related to the companion neutron star mass, but that the kick
imparted to the system depends upon it too, leading to a correlation between
orbital eccentricity and spin period. The isolation of the relativistic binary
pulsars in the magnetic field-period diagram is used to argue that this must be
because the kicks imparted to proto-relativistic systems are usually small,
leading to very few if any isolated runaway mildly-recycled pulsars. This calls
into question the magnitude of supernova kicks in close binaries, which have
been usually assumed to be similar to those imparted to the bulk of the pulsar
population. Finally, we review some of the highlights of the Parkes precision
timing efforts, which suggest 10 nanosecond timing is obtainable on PSR
J1909-3744 that will aid us in searching for cosmological sources of
gravitational waves.

controls coronal energy release via the transition between the slow collisional
Sweet-Parker regime and the fast collisionless reconnection regime; (2) In
turn, coronal energy release through reconnection leads to an increase in the
ambient plasma density via chromospheric evaporation, which temporarily shuts
off any subsequent reconnection involving the newly-reconnected loops.

previous simulations in the literature that used the shallow water formalism;
we find that the disagreement is explained by the factor of 30 shorter
radiative timescale used in our model. We also examine the case that the planet
is in Cassini state 2, in which the expected obliquity is ~90 degrees. Under
these circumstances, a periodic equilibrium is reached, with the temperature
slightly leading the solar forcing. Using these temperature distributions, we
calculate disk-integrated bolometric infrared light curves from the planet. The
light curves for the two models are surprisingly similar, despite large
differences in temperature patterns in the two cases. In the zero-obliquity
case, the intensity at the minimum is 66% of the maximum intensity, with the
minimum occuring 72 degrees ahead of transit. In the high-obliquity case, the

their response to a range of wavefront correction levels, in order to identify
regimes of atmospheric compensation where the use of hard-edge, Gaussian, and
band-limited image masks becomes observationally advantageous. To delineate
performances, we calculate the speckle noise floor mean intensity. We find that
apodized masks provide little improvement over hard-edge masks until on-sky

masks may be preferentially chosen, since they are less susceptible to
low-order aberration content. The use of higher-order band-limited masks is
relegated to situations where quasi-static residual starlight cannot be

in modelling the evolution of AGB stars at varying surface C/O ratio. In
particular, it has been shown the large inadequacy of solar-scaled opacities
when applied to models of carbon stars, and hence the need for correctly
coupling the molecular opacities to the current surface chemical composition of
AGB stars. The aim of the present follow-up study is to investigate the effects
of variable molecular opacities on the evolutionary properties of luminous AGB
stars with massive envelopes, i.e. with initial masses from ~3.5 Msun up to 5-8
Msun, which are predicted to experience both the third dredge-up and hot-bottom
burning. It is found that if the dredge-up of carbon is efficient enough to
lead to an early transition from C/O<1 to C/O>1, then hot-bottom burning may be
weakened, extinguished, or even prevented. The physical conditions for this
occurrence are analysed and a few theoretical and observational implications
are discussed. Importantly, it is found that the inclusion of variable
molecular opacities could significantly change the current predictions for the
chemical yields contributed by intermediate-mass AGB stars, with M~3.5 - 4.0
Msun that make as much as ~ 30-50 % of all stars expected to undergo hot-bottom

perform five simulations and conclude that such two-generation clusters are
both possible and would not differ significantly from their single-generation

symplectic-class sigma model including a topological term with $\theta = \pi$.
As a consequence, the system is at a quantum critical point with a universal
value of the conductivity of the order of $e^2/h$. When the effective time

Relaxation then effectively proceeds via diffusion limited pair coagulation
(DLPC) of mobility excitations. By employing a familiar stochastic similarity
transformation, we map exact results from the free fermion case of diffusion
limited pair annihilation to DLPC. Crucially, we are able to adapt the mapping
technique to averages involving multiple time quantities. This relies on
knowledge of the explicit form of the evolution operators involved. Exact
results are obtained for two-time correlation and response functions in the
free fermion DLPC process. The corresponding long-time scaling forms apply to a
wider class of DLPC processes, including the FA model. We are thus able to
exactly characterise the violations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem
(FDT) in the aging regime of the FA model. We find nontrivial scaling forms for
the fluctuation-dissipation ratio (FDR) X = X(tw/t), but with a negative
asymptotic value X = -3*pi/(6*pi - 16) = -3.307. While this prevents a
thermodynamic interpretation in terms of an effective temperature, it is a
direct consequence of probing FDT with observables that couple to activated
dynamics. The existence of negative FDRs should therefore be a widespread
feature in non mean-field systems.

  Ion Conductor La2Mo2O9 (LAMOX)","20 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  La2Mo2O9 (LAMOX) is a fast oxygen ion conductor which shows high oxygen ion
conductivities comparable to those of yttria-sabilized zirconia (YSZ) . LAMOX
is subject to a structural phase transition from the non-conductive monoclinic
form to the highly-conductive cubic form at about 580C. The origin of the
conductivity in cubic LAMOX has been suggested to be due to a ""disorder"" in the
O sub-lattice without any insight into the real distribution of the oxygen ion.
In this paper, thanks to the application of the neutron atomic pair
distribution function (PDF) analysis, we provided evidences that the local
structure of the cubic polymorph of LAMOX is exactly the same of that of the
monoclinic phase thus indicating that the structural phase transition is
actually a transition from a static to a dynamic distribution of the oxygen
defects. This work represent the first application of the atomic-pair
distribution function analysis to the study of an oxygen fast-oxide ion
conductor and clearly indicates that a more reliable and detailed description
of their local structure, particularly in the highly conductive phases, and can
lead to a better comprehension of the structure-property correlation, which is
the starting point for the design of new and optimized functional materials.

  transition","28 pages, 19 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.76.041135",,"cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  A fast computer algorithm, the pebble game, has been used successfully to
study rigidity percolation on 2D elastic networks, as well as on a special
class of 3D networks, the bond-bending networks. Application of the pebble game
approach to general 3D networks has been hindered by the fact that the
underlying mathematical theory is, strictly speaking, invalid in this case. We
construct an approximate pebble game algorithm for general 3D networks, as well
as a slower but exact algorithm, the relaxation algorithm, that we use for
testing the new pebble game. Based on the results of these tests and additional
considerations, we argue that in the particular case of randomly diluted
central-force networks on BCC and FCC lattices, the pebble game is essentially
exact. Using the pebble game, we observe an extremely sharp jump in the largest
rigid cluster size in bond-diluted central-force networks in 3D, with the
percolating cluster appearing and taking up most of the network after a single
bond addition. This strongly suggests a first order rigidity percolation
transition, which is in contrast to the second order transitions found
previously for the 2D central-force and 3D bond-bending networks. While a first
order rigidity transition has been observed for Bethe lattices and networks
with ``chemical order'', this is the first time it has been seen for a regular
randomly diluted network. In the case of site dilution, the transition is also
first order for BCC, but results for FCC suggest a second order transition.
Even in bond-diluted lattices, while the transition appears massively first
order in the order parameter (the percolating cluster size), it is continuous
in the elastic moduli. This, and the apparent non-universality, make this phase
transition highly unusual.

which the transmission among power limited nodes is assisted by powerful

when there is one source, one destination, and multiple relays, which we call
the single source multiple relay single destination (SSMRSD) mesh network. We
derive the asymptotic capacity of the SSMRSD mesh network when the relay powers
grow to infinity. Our approach is as follows. We first look at an upper bound
on the information theoretic capacity of these networks in a Gaussian setting.
We then show that this bound is achievable asymptotically using the
compress-and-forward strategy for the multiple relay channel. We also perform
numerical computations for the case when the relays have finite powers. We
observe that even when the relay power is only a few times larger than the
source power, the compress-and-forward rate gets close to the capacity. The
results indicate the value of cooperation in wireless mesh networks. The
capacity characterization quantifies how the relays can cooperate, using the
compress-and-forward strategy, to either conserve node energy or to increase
transmission rate.

`billiard attractor'. Our analysis rests on two pillars: (i) a dynamical
systems formulation based on the conformal Hubble-normalized orthonormal frame
approach expressed in an Iwasawa frame; (ii) stochastic methods and the
interplay between genericity and stochasticity. Our work generalizes and
improves the level of rigor of previous work by Belinskii, Khalatnikov, and
Lifshitz; furthermore, we establish that our approach and the Hamiltonian
approach to `cosmological billiards', as elaborated by Damour, Hennaux, and
Nicolai, can be viewed as yielding `dual' representations of the asymptotic
dynamics.

  the CMS collaboration at CERN",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We have suggested, that the size of extra spatial dimensions (if they exist)
should be related to the quantum vacuum fluctuations; an extra dimension must
be sufficiently large to allow appearance of virtual quark-antiquark pairs,
which are an inherent part of the physical vacuum in quantum chromodynamics. We
argue that the conjecture of extra dimensions with the universal size equal to
the reduced Compton wavelength of a pion is a serious alternative to the
postulated universal mass in the theory of large extra dimensions (LED). Our
conjecture leads to the conclusion that the production of artificial mini black
holes at LHC at CERN is unlikely. It is shown that the recent lower limit on
the mass of a microscopic black hole (established by CMS collaboration at CERN)
may be interpreted as the upper limit (equal to six) for the number of extra
dimensions. Additionally, we challenge the current wisdom that mini black holes
disintegrate through the Hawking radiation. We point that it might be wrong, if
there is a hypothetical repulsion between matter and antimatter; resulting in
the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs from the quantum vacuum and
matter-antimatter asymmetry in the spectrum of radiation.

effects. The problem of CT-CL separation arises especially at medium energies,
corresponding to HERMES experiment, when the coherence length is of the order
of the nuclear radius R_A. Only at asymptotic large energies, corresponding to
large CL, l_c >> R_A, the CT-CL mixing can be eliminated. On the other hand,
the net CT effects can be studied in the kinematic range accessible by the CLAS
experiment, since in this case the CL is much smaller than the nuclear radius.
Using light-cone quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dipole formalism we investigate
manifestations of CT effects in electroproduction of vector mesons. Motivated
by expected data from the CLAS experiment at JLab, we predict the A and Q^2
dependence of nuclear transparency for rho^0 mesons produced incoherently off
nuclei. We demonstrate that in the CLAS kinematical region the CL effects are
weak enough to keep the photon energy at such values as to obtain maximal
photon virtualities keeping optimal statistics of the data. This has a clear

the branching ratio and direct CP asymmetry of B^0_d -> pi^- K^+, this

-0.24+-0.04, which favours the BaBar result, and extract
gamma=(70.0^{+3.8}_{-4.3})deg, which agrees with the unitarity triangle fits.
Extending our analysis to other B -> pi K modes and B^0_s -> K^+ K^- with the
help of the SU(3) flavour symmetry and plausible dynamical assumptions, we find
that all observables with colour-suppressed electroweak penguin contributions
are measured in excellent agreement with the Standard Model. As far as the
ratios R_{c,n} of the charged and neutral B -> pi K branching ratios are
concerned, which are sizeably affected by electroweak penguin contributions,
our Standard-Model predictions have almost unchanged central values, but
significantly reduced errors. Since the new data have moved quite a bit towards
these results, the ""B -> pi K puzzle"" for the CP-conserving quantities has been
significantly reduced. However, the mixing-induced CP violation of B^0_d ->
pi^0 K_S does look puzzling; if confirmed by future measurements, this effect
could be accommodated through a modified electroweak penguin sector with a
large CP-violating new-physics phase. Finally, we point out that the

QCD is not conformally invariant, one can nevertheless use the mathematical
representation of the conformal group in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space
to construct a first approximation to the theory. The AdS/CFT correspondence
also provides insights into the inherently non-perturbative aspects of QCD,
such as the orbital and radial spectra of hadrons and the form of hadronic
wavefunctions. In particular, we show that there is an exact correspondence
between the fifth-dimensional coordinate of AdS space z and a specific impact
variable zeta which measures the separation of the quark and gluonic
constituents within the hadron in ordinary space-time. This connection allows
one to compute the analytic form of the frame-independent light-front
wavefunctions, the fundamental entities which encode hadron properties and
allow the computation of decay constants, form factors, and other exclusive
scattering amplitudes. New relativistic light-front equations in ordinary
space-time are found which reproduce the results obtained using the
5-dimensional theory. The effective light-front equations possess remarkable
algebraic structures and integrability properties. Since they are complete and
orthonormal, the AdS/CFT model wavefunctions can also be used as a basis for
the diagonalization of the full light-front QCD Hamiltonian, thus
systematically improving the AdS/CFT approximation.

the cone opens up and the theory turns 5D. The gravitational light scalar in

classification. Many regression models are controlled by some smoothness or
flexibility or complexity parameter c, e.g. the number of neighbors to be
averaged over in k nearest neighbor (kNN) regression or the polynomial degree
in regression with polynomials. Let f_D^c be the (best) regressor of complexity
c on data D. A more flexible regressor can fit more data D' well than a more
rigid one. If something (here small loss) is easy to achieve it's typically
worth less. We define the loss rank of f_D^c as the number of other
(fictitious) data D' that are fitted better by f_D'^c than D is fitted by
f_D^c. We suggest selecting the model complexity c that has minimal loss rank
(LoRP). Unlike most penalized maximum likelihood variants (AIC,BIC,MDL), LoRP
only depends on the regression function and loss function. It works without a
stochastic noise model, and is directly applicable to any non-parametric
regressor, like kNN. In this paper we formalize, discuss, and motivate LoRP,
study it for specific regression problems, in particular linear ones, and
compare it to other model selection schemes.

of an investment to its standard deviation, has been widely cited in the
financial literature by researchers and practitioners. However, very little
attention has been paid to the statistical properties of the estimation of the
ratio. Lo (2002) derived the $\sqrt{n}$-normality of the ratio's estimation
errors for returns which are iid or stationary with serial correlations, and
pointed out that to make inference on the accuracy of the estimation, the
serial correlation among the returns needs to be taken into account. In the
present paper a class of time series models for returns is introduced to
demonstrate that there exists a factor other than the serial correlation of the
returns that dominates the asymptotic behavior of the Sharpe ratio statistics.
The model under consideration is a linear process whose innovation sequence has
summable coefficients and contains a latent volatility component which is
long-memory. It is proved that the estimation errors of the ratio are
asymptotically normal with a convergence rate slower than $\sqrt{n}$ and that
the estimation deviation of the expected return makes no contribution to the
limiting distribution.

nonstationarity does not invalid the classical concerns of structural equation
modeling -- identification and simultaneity bias. The same rank condition for
identification holds for stationary and nonstationary data and some sort of
instrumental variable estimators will have to be employed to yield consistency.
However, nonstationarity does raise issues of inference if the rank of
cointegration or direction of nonstationarity is not known a priori. The usual
test statistics may not be chi-square distributed because of the presence of
unit roots distributions. Classical instrumental variable estimators have to be
modified to ensure valid inference.

bandit problem with precedence relations. In Chan, Fuh and Hu (2005), a class
of asymptotically optimal arm-pulling strategies is constructed to minimize the
shortfall from perfect information payoff. Here we further explore optimality
properties of the proposed strategies. First, we show that the efficiency
benchmark, which is given by the regret lower bound, reduces to those in Lai
and Robbins (1985), Hu and Wei (1989), and Fuh and Hu (2000). This implies that
the proposed strategy is also optimal under the settings of aforementioned
papers. Secondly, we establish the super-efficiency of proposed strategies when
the bad set is empty. Thirdly, we show that they are still optimal with
constant switching cost between arms. In addition, we prove that the Wald's
equation holds for Markov chains under Harris recurrent condition, which is an
important tool in studying the efficiency of the proposed strategies.

for $\gamma<1$. It is then shown that the MPS gives estimators closer to the
true parameters compared to the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) in a

stably while the MLE does not. The performance of MPS estimators is also more
stable than those of the probability-weighted moment (PWM) estimators. Finally,
as a by-product of the MPS, a goodness of fit statistic, Moran's statistic, is
available for the extreme value distributions. Empirical significance levels of

setting into the continuous-time Wiener process setting in which the Gittins

By an application of Chernoff's continuity correction in optimal stopping, the

Log-resolutions of ideals, play a central role in algebraic geometry. If two
sheaves of ideals, say $I_1$ and $I_2$, over a smooth scheme $V$ have the same

Log-resolution of the other. On the other hand, in case $V$ is smooth over a
field of characteristic zero, an algorithm of desingularization provides, for
each sheaf of ideals, a unique Log-resolution.

Log-resolution for two ideals having the same integral closure. We prove this
result here by using the form of induction introduced by W{\l}odarczyk.
  We extend the notion of Log-resolution of ideals over a smooth scheme $V$, to
that of Rees algebras over $V$; and then we show that two Rees algebras with

quantum ABMs set within a social circuit as a building block for an

fundamental departure from traditional observational methods of social science

replacing the traditional method of observation with a predictive science must
account for when cognitive observations work and when they do not (illusions).

new resource as real as energy.
  This holistic property of compound quantum systems, which involves

decipher its rich structure.
  This article reviews basic aspects of entanglement including its
characterization, detection, distillation and quantifying. In particular, the
authors discuss various manifestations of entanglement via Bell inequalities,
entropic inequalities, entanglement witnesses, quantum cryptography and point
out some interrelations. They also discuss a basic role of entanglement in
quantum communication within distant labs paradigm and stress some
peculiarities such as irreversibility of entanglement manipulations including
its extremal form - bound entanglement phenomenon. A basic role of entanglement
witnesses in detection of entanglement is emphasized.

The general theory of unambiguous discrimination among unitary operators is
extended with this application in mind. We prove that entanglement with an
ancilla cannot assist any discrimination strategy for commuting unitary
operators. We also obtain a simple, practical test for the unambiguous
distinguishability of an arbitrary set of unitary operators on a given system.
Using this result, we prove that the unambiguous distinguishability criterion
is the same for both standard and minimal oracle operators. We then show that,
except in certain trivial cases, unambiguous discrimination among all standard
oracle operators corresponding to integer functions with fixed domain and range
is impossible. However, we find that it is possible to unambiguously
discriminate among the Grover oracle operators corresponding to an arbitrarily
large unsorted database. The unambiguous distinguishability of standard oracle
operators corresponding to totally indistinguishable functions, which possess a
strong form of classical indistinguishability, is analysed. We prove that these
operators are not unambiguously distinguishable for any finite set of totally
indistinguishable functions on a Boolean domain and with arbitrary fixed range.
Sets of such functions on a larger domain can have unambiguously
distinguishable standard oracle operators and we provide a complete analysis of
the simplest case, that of four functions. We also examine the possibility of
unambiguous oracle operator discrimination with multiple parallel calls and
investigate an intriguing unitary superoperator transformation between standard
and entanglement-assisted minimal oracle operators.

function of the angle between the pump and the probe beams. The measurements
are in good agreement with an analytic theory with no fit parameters. The
