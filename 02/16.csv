presenting a heavy circumstellar envelope (CSE). We aim to study the
morphology, exceptional kinematics, and excitation conditions of their CSEs,

characteristics. The maps show that the overall shape of both CSEs is
approximately spherical, although they also reveal several aspherical features.
The CSE around IRC +10420 shows a rounded extended halo surrounding a bright
inner region, with both components presenting aspherical characteristics. It
presents a brightness minimum at the center. The envelope around AFGL 2343 is a
detached shell, showing spherical symmetry and clumpiness at a level of about
15% of the maximum brightness. The envelopes expand isotropically at about 35
km/s, about two or three times faster than typical CSEs around AGB stars. High
temperatures (~ 200 K) are derived for the innermost regions in IRC +10420,
while denser and cooler (~ 30 K) gas is found in AFGL 2343. The mass-loss
processes in these YHGs have been found to be similar. The deduced mass-loss
rates (~ 10E-4 - 10E-3 Msun/yr) are much higher than those obtained in AGB
stars, and they present significant variations on time scales of ~ 1000 yr.

star Eta Carinae, concentrating on the 2003 X-ray minimum as seen by the
XMM-Newton observatory. These are the first spatially-resolved X-ray monitoring
observations of the stellar X-ray spectrum during the minimum. The hard X-ray
emission, believed to be associated with the collision of Eta Carinae's wind
with the wind from a massive companion star, varied strongly in flux on
timescales of days, but not significantly on timescales of hours. The lowest
X-ray flux in the 2-10 keV band seen by XMM-Newton was only 0.7% of the maximum
seen by RXTE just before the X-ray minimum. The slope of the X-ray continuum
above 5 keV did not vary in any observation, which suggests that the electron
temperature of the hottest plasma associated with the stellar source did not
vary significantly at any phase. Through the minimum, the absorption to the
stellar source increased by a factor of 5-10 to NH ~3-4E23 cm-2. The thermal Fe
XXV emission line showed significant excesses on both the red and blue sides of
the line outside the minimum and exhibited an extreme red excess during the
minimum. The Fe fluorescence line at 6.4 keV increased in equivalent width from
100 eV outside the minimum to 200 eV during the minimum. From these observed
features, we discuss two possible causes of the X-ray minimum; the eclipse of
the X-ray plasma and an intrinsic fading of the X-ray emissivity. The drop in
the colliding wind X-ray emission also revealed the presence of an additional
X-ray component which exhibited no variation on timescales of weeks to years.
This component may be produced by the collision of high speed outflows at v
\~1000-2000 km s-1 from Eta Carinae with ambient gas within a few thousand AU
from the star.

of star cluster formation. Early studies have revealed a clear dichotomy
between old globular clusters and young clusters, with the former characterised
by Gaussian-shaped LFs, and the latter following a power law. Recently, this
view was challenged by studies of galaxy merger remnants and post-starburst
galaxies. In this paper we re-evaluate the young ($\lta$ few hundreds of Myrs,
with the majority $\lta$ few tens of Myrs) star cluster system in the ongoing
spiral-spiral major merger system NGC 4038/39, the ""Antennae"" galaxies. The
Antennae galaxies represent a very active and complex star-forming environment,
which hampers cluster selection and photometry as well as the determination of
observational completeness fractions. A main issue of concern is the large
number of bright young stars contained in most earlier studies, which we
carefully exclude from our cluster sample by accurately determining the source
sizes. The resulting LFs are fitted both with Gaussian and with power-law
distributions, taking into account both the observational completeness
fractions and photometric errors, and compared using a likelihood ratio test.
The likelihood ratio results are rigidly evaluated using Monte Carlo
simulations. We perform a number of additional tests, e.g. with subsets of the
total sample, all confirming our main result: that a Gaussian distribution fits
the observed LFs of clusters in this preferentially very young cluster system
significantly better than a power-law distribution, at a (statistical) error
probability of less than 0.5 per cent.

high-redshift UV-continuum selected galaxies and to derive the physical
conditions that determine the Lyman alpha profile and the line strength.
VLT/FORS spectra with a resolution of R ~ 2000 of 16 galaxies in the redshift
range of z = 2.7 to 5 are presented. The observed Lyman alpha profiles are
compared with theoretical models. The Lyman alpha lines range from pure
absorption (EW = -17 Angstroem) to strong emission (EW = 153 Angstroem). Most
Lyman alpha emission lines show an asymmetric profile, and three galaxies have
a double-peaked profile. Both types of profiles can be explained by a uniform
model consisting of an expanding shell of neutral and ionised hydrogen around a
compact starburst region. The broad, blueshifted, low-ionisation interstellar
absorption lines indicate a galaxy-scale outflow of the ISM. The strengths of
these lines are found to be determined in part by the velocity dispersion of
the outflowing medium. We find star-formation rates of these galaxies ranging
from SFR(UV) = 1.2 to 63.2 Msun uncorrected for dust absorption. The Lyman
alpha emission strength of our target galaxies is found to be determined by the
amount of dust and the kinematics of the outflowing material.

modeled by the affine equation of state (EoS) $P= p_0 +\alpha \rho$, resulting

affine EoS arises from the simple assumption that the speed of sound is
constant; it may be seen as an approximation to an unknown barotropic EoS
$P=P(\rho)$, and may as well represent the tracking solution for the dynamics
of a scalar field with appropriate potential. Furthermore, in principle the
affine EoS allows the UDM to be phantom. We constrain the parameters of the
model, $\alpha$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$, using data from a suite of different
cosmological observations, and perform a comparison with the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model, containing both cold dark matter and a cosmological
constant. First considering a flat cosmology, we find that the UDM model with
affine EoS fits the joint observations very well, better than $\Lambda$CDM,
with best fit values $\alpha=0.01 \pm 0.02$ and $\Omega_\Lambda=0.70 \pm 0.04$
(95% confidence intervals). The standard model (best fit
$\Omega_\Lambda=0.71\pm 0.04$), having one less parameter, is preferred by a
Bayesian model comparison. However, the affine EoS is at least as good as the
standard model if a flat curvature is not assumed as a prior for $\Lambda$CDM.
For the latter, the best fit values are $\Omega_K=-0.02^{+0.01}_{-0.02} $ and
$\Omega_\Lambda=0.71 \pm 0.04$, i.e. a closed model is preferred. A phantom UDM
with affine EoS is ruled out well beyond $3\sigma$.

star-formation in the host galaxy. Firstly, the mid-IR (24micron) properties of
these sources are consistent with the infrared/radio correlation of starbursts.
Secondly, most of them are found in galaxies with blue rest-frame optical

abundances of carbon and oxygen at log epsilon = 8.39 and 8.66, respectively.
These values are ~ 40 % lower than earlier estimates. A coalition of
corrections due to the adoption of an improved model atmosphere, updated atomic
data and non-LTE corrections, and a reevaluation of the effect of blending
features, is responsible for the change. The adopted hydrodynamical model of
the solar surface is an important element to the update, but using a
theoretical 1D model atmosphere leads to an average oxygen abundance modestly
increased by 0.09 dex, and a carbon abundance only 0.02 dex higher. Considering
a state-of-the-art 3D hydrodynamical model of the solar surface yields
consistent results from different sets of atomic and molecular lines.
Systematic errors are likely to dominate the final uncertainties, but the
available information indicates they are limited to <0.1 dex. The new
abundances are closer to expectations based on the compositions of other nearby
objects, although a fully consistent picture, considering galactic chemical
evolution and diffusion at the bottom of the solar convection zone, is still
lacking.

This technique needs none of the usual a-priori assumptions (luminosity

main drawback (decrease of efficiency with increasing background) is overcame
by the use of narrow slices in photometric redshift space. There are two main

evaluation of the selection function in particular if one wants ""complete""
samples. We deal here with the first concern using random distributions. For
the second, comparison with detailed simulations is foreseen but we use here a
pragmatic approach with comparing our results to GalICS simulations to check
that our detection number is not totally at odds compared to cosmological
simulations. We use XMM-LSS survey and secured VVDS redshifts up to z~1 to
check individual detections. We show that our detection method is basically
capable to recover (in the regions in common) 100% of the C1 XMM-LSS X-ray

the radiation from the current that is produced by ionization electrons moving

the analysis of 216 disk galaxies (S0s and spirals from NIRS0S and OSUBGS
surveys, respectively). For that purpose we have collected together, and
completed when necessary, the various analysis we have previously made
separately for early and late types. We find strong photometric and kinematic
evidence of pseudobulges in the S0-S0/a galaxies: their bulges are on average
fairly exponential, inner disks are common (in 56%), and in many of the
galaxies the bulges are rotationally supported. This would be difficult to
understand in such gas poor galaxies as in S0s, if these pseudobulge candidates
were formed by star formation in the disk in a a similar manner as in spirals.
A more likely explanation is that pseudobulges in the early-type galaxies are
bar-related structures, connected to the evolution of bars, which
interpretation is supported by our Fourier analysis and structural
decompositions. Bars in the early-type galaxies are found to have many
characteristics of evolved systems: (1) they have flat-top/double peaked
Fourier amplitude profiles, (2) bars have typically sharp outer cut-offs, (3)
the higher Fourier modes appear in the amplitude profiles, and (4) many bars
have also ansae-type morphologies. We show the distributions of bar strength in
different Hubble type bins using four bar strength indicators, $Q_g$, $A_2$,
$f_{bar}$ and the bar length, which are expected to give important clues for
understanding the mechanism of how bars evolve.

conditions for the nonequilibrium Green's functions for spin transport through
the ferromagnetic interfaces. A signature of the nonequilibrium torque is a
component perpendicular to the plane spanned by the two ferromagnetic moments.
The perpendicular component is absent in normal-metal-ferromagnetic nanopillars

in-plane torque for non-equilibrium SFNFS contacts. The out-of-plane torque is
due to the rotation of quasiparticle spin by the exchange fields of the

to the spectrum of spin-polarized Andreev bound states, while the {\sl ac}
component, for small bias voltages, is determined by the nearly adiabatic
dynamics of the Andreev bound states. The nonlinear voltage dependence of the
non-equilibrium torque, including the subharmonic gap structure and the

Andreev reflections, spin filtering and spin mixing. These properties of spin

phase of homogeneous aggregation with conserved total particle density. The
physical ingredients behind the predictions are essentially classical:
Super-critical nuclei are created at the Zeldovich rate, and before the
depletion of monomers is significant, the characteristic cluster size is so
large that the clusters undergo diffusion limited growth. Mathematically, the
distribution of cluster sizes satisfies an advection PDE in ""size-space"".
During this creation phase, clusters are nucleated and then grow to a size much
larger than the critical size, so nucleation of super-critical clusters at the
Zeldovich rate is represented by an effective boundary condition at zero size.
The advection PDE subject to the effective boundary condition constitutes a
""creation signaling problem"" for the evolving distribution of cluster sizes
during the creation era.
  Dominant balance arguments applied to the advection signaling problem show
that the characteristic time and cluster size of the creation era are
exponentially large in the initial free-energy barrier against nucleation, G_*.
Specifically, the characteristic time is proportional to exp(2 G_*/ 5 k_B T)
and the characteristic number of monomers in a cluster is proportional to
exp(3G_*/5 k_B T). The exponentially large characteristic time and cluster size
give a-posteriori validation of the mathematical signaling problem. In a short
note, Marchenko obtained these exponentials and the numerical pre-factors, 2/5
and 3/5. Our work adds the actual solution of the kinetic model implied by
these scalings, and the basis for connection to subsequent stages of the
aggregation process after the creation era.

counting statistics (FCS) of electrons crossing the lead-system interface. The
FCS is calculated using a many-body quantum master equation (QME) combined with
a Liouville space generating function (GF) formalism. For a model of two
coupled quantum dots, we show that the FT becomes valid for long binning times
and provide an estimate for the finite-time deviations. We also demonstrate
that the Mandel (or Fano) parameter associated with the incoming or outgoing
electron transfers show subpoissonian (antibunching) statistics.

that of symmetries and entanglement. We introduce the concept of
low-dimensional Gauge-Like Symmetries (GLSs), and the physical conservation
laws (including topological terms and fractionalization) which emerge from
them. We prove then sufficient conditions for TQO at both zero and finite
temperatures. The topological defects which are associated with the restoration
of GLSs lead to TQO. Selection rules associated with the GLSs enable us to
systematically construct states with TQO; these selection rules do not rely on
the existence of a finite gap between the ground states to all other excited
states. All currently known examples of TQO display GLSs. We analyze spectral
structures and show that Kitaev's toric code model and Wen's plaquette model
are equivalent and reduce, by a duality mapping, to an Ising chain. Despite the
spectral gap in these systems, the toric operator expectation values may vanish
once thermal fluctuations are present. This mapping illustrates that the
quantum states themselves in a particular (operator language) representation
encode TQO and that the duality mappings, being non-local in the original
representation, disentangle the order. We present a general algorithm for the
construction of long-range string orders in general systems with entangled
ground states.

under hydrostatic pressure transforms discontinuously from $P4mm$ to $R3c$ at 9
GPa. Spontaneous polarization decreases with increasing pressure so that the
$R3c$ phase transforms to the centrosymmetric $R\bar{3}c$ phase at around 30
GPa. The first-order phase transition between tetragonal and rhombohedral phase
is exceptional since there is no evidence for a bridging phase. The essential
feature of the $R3c$ and $R\bar{3}c$ phases is that they allow the oxygen
octahedron to increase its volume $V_B$ at the expense of cuboctahedral volume
$V_A$ around a Pb ion. This is further supported by the fact that neither the
$R3m$ nor $Cm$ phase, which keep the $V_A/V_B$ ratio constant, is a ground
state within the pressure range between 0 and 40 GPa. Thus tetragonal strain is
dominant up to 9 GPa, whereas at higher pressures efficient compression through
oxygen octahedra tilting plays the central role for PbTiO$_3$. Previously
predicted pressure induced colossal enhancement of piezoelectricity in
PbTiO$_3$ corresponds to unstable $Cm$ and $R3m$ phases. This suggests that the
phase instability, in contrast to the polarization rotation, is responsible for
the large piezoelectric properties observed in systems like Pb(Zr,Ti)O$_3$ in
the vicinity of the morphotropic phase boundary.

helps fixed-point computation. Inspired by this open problem and recent

optimum? In this paper, we give a nearly-tight bound of Omega(n)^{d-1} on the
randomized query complexity for computing a fixed point of a discrete Brouwer
function over [1:n]^d. Since the randomized query complexity of global
optimization over [1:n]^d is Theta (n^{d}), the randomized query model over

optimization is harder than fixed-point computation, and fixed-point
computation is harder than local search. Our result indeed demonstrates that

paradox. When combined with a nonlinear scheme for cosmological evolution with
back-reaction via the Buchert equations, a new observationally viable
quantitative model of the universe is obtained. The expansion age is increased,
allowing more time for structure formation. The baryon density fraction
obtained from primordial nucleosynthesis bounds can be significantly larger,
yet consistent with primordial lithium abundance measurements. The angular
scale of the first Doppler peak in the CMB anisotropy spectrum fits the new
model despite an average negative spatial curvature at late epochs, resolving
the anomaly associated with ellipticity in the CMB anisotropies. A number of
other testable consequences are discussed, with the potential to profoundly
change the whole of theoretical and observational cosmology. [Abridged]

gravitational potential of the Yukawa type. We follow the technique employed by
Toomre in 1963 in the study of galactic disks in the Newtonian theory. This new
solution allows an easy comparison between the Newtonian solution and the
Yukawian one. Therefore, constraints on the parameters of theories of
gravitation can be imposed, which in the weak field limit reduce to Yukawian
potentials. We then apply our formulae to the study of rotation curves for a
zero-thickness exponential disk and compare it with the Newtonian case studied
by Freeman in 1970. As an application of the mathematical tool developed here,
we show that in any theory of gravity with a massive graviton (this means a
gravitational potential of the Yukawa type), a strong limit can be imposed on
the mass (m_g) of this particle. For example, in order to obtain a galactic
disk with a scale length of b ~ 10 kpc, we should have a massive graviton of
m_g << 10^{-59} g. This result is much more restrictive than those inferred
from solar system observations.

observables which encode the dynamics of the system. We apply this scheme to
perturbations around a homogeneous and isotropic sector (cosmology) of general

arbitrary high order in a self--consistent and fully gauge invariant manner.
Methods to compute these observables are given. The question of backreaction
effects of inhomogeneities onto a homogeneous and isotropic background can be

its implications for several flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) processes.
In this model, where the weak SU(2)_L gauge group of the Standard Model is
extended to a SU(3)_L, the by far dominant new contributions come from an
additional neutral Z' gauge boson, that can transmit FCNCs at tree-level. At
the same time, electroweak precision observables receive new contributions only
at the loop level and do not constrain the model very strongly. In our
analysis, we take into account new CP violating effects that have been
neglected in earlier analyses, and account for a general flavor structure
without reference to a certain parameterization of the new mixing matrix. We
begin by studying the bounds obtained from quantities such as Delta M_K,
epsilon_K, Delta M_{d/s} as well as sin 2 beta|_{J/psi K_S}, and go on to
explore the implications for several clean rare decay channels, namely the
decays K+->pi+ nu nu, K_L -> pi0 nu nu, B_{d/s} -> mu+ mu- and K_L -> pi0 l+l-.
We find sizeable effects in all these decays, but the most interesting quantity
turns out to be the B_s - bar B_s mixing phase beta_s, as measured in the
mixing induced CP asymmetry of B_s -> J/psi phi, which can be large. In
general, we find effects in purely hadronic channels to be larger than in

we find that there exists a rich spectrum of excitations including solitons
with nontrivial ""magnetic flux"" and quasi-holes with nontrivial ""charges"",
which we describe in this article. The magnetic flux corresponds to vorticity
in the fluid fluctuations while the charges correspond to sources of fluid
fluctuations. We find that the quasi-hole solutions exhibit a gap in the
spectrum of allowed charge.

inequality for rectangular contours. The inequalities are compatible with the
area law for large contours. The Polyakov cusp anomalous dimension of Wilson
lines (playing an important role in QCD applications to hard processes) has a
convex angular dependence. This convexity is crucial for the consistency of the
inequalities with renormalization. Some parallel properties can be found in the
string theory. The Kac-Ray cusp term from the ""shape of a drum"" problem has the
same angular convexity property and plays the role of the cusp anomalous
dimension in the effective string model for Wilson loops studied by Luescher,
Symanzik and Weisz (LSW). Using heuristic arguments based on the LSW model, one
can find an interesting connection between the inequalities for Wilson loops

holes may carry a test electric charge we show that the Killing one-form which
represents the difference between the timelike generators in the spacetime and
in the reference background can be used as a potential one-form for the
associated electromagnetic field. In four dimensions the potential one-form and
the Kerr-AdS metric with properly re-scaled mass parameter solve the
Einstein-Maxwell equations, thereby resulting in the familiar Kerr-Newman-AdS
solution. We solve the quartic equation governing the location of the event
horizons of the Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes and present closed analytic
expressions for the radii of the horizons. We also compute the gyromagnetic
ratio for these black holes and show that it corresponds to g=2 just as for
ordinary black holes in asymptotically flat spacetime. Next, we compute the
gyromagnetic ratio for the Kerr-AdS black holes with a single angular momentum
and with a test electric charge in all higher dimensions. The gyromagnetic
ratio crucially depends on the dimensionless ratio of the rotation parameter to
the curvature radius of the AdS background. At the critical limit, when the
boundary Einstein universe is rotating at the speed of light, it tends to g=2
irrespective of the spacetime dimension. Finally, we consider the case of a
five dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole with two angular momenta and show that it
possesses two distinct gyromagnetic ratios in accordance with its two
orthogonal 2-planes of rotation. In the special case of two equal angular
momenta, the two gyromagnetic ratios merge into one leading to g=4 at the

the cluster of the origin is finite but has at least t vertices at distance one
from the infinite cluster is exponentially small in t. We use this to give a
short proof of the strongest version of the important fact that the
isoperimetric profile of the infinite cluster basically coincides with the
profile of the original lattice. This implies, e.g., that simple random walk on
the largest cluster of a finite box [-n,n]^d with high probability has
L^\infty-mixing time \Theta(n^2), and that the heat kernel (return probability)
on the infinite cluster a.s. decays like p_n(o,o)=O(n^{-d/2}). Versions of
these results have been proven by Benjamini and Mossel (2003), Mathieu and Remy

that anchored isoperimetric properties survive supercritical percolation,
provided that the probability of the cluster of the origin being finite with
large boundary decays rapidly; this is the case for a large class of graphs
when $p$ is close to 1. As an application (with the help of some entropy
inequalities), we give a short conceptual proof of a theorem of Angel,

solitary waves in general scalar and vector nonlinear wave equations are
proposed. These methods are based on iterating new differential equations whose
linearization operators are squares of those for the original equations,
together with acceleration techniques. The first two methods keep the
propagation constants fixed, while the third method keeps the powers (or other
arbitrary functionals) of the solution fixed. It is proved that all these
methods are guaranteed to converge to any solitary wave (either ground state or
not) as long as the initial condition is sufficiently close to the
corresponding exact solution, and the time step in the iteration schemes is
below a certain threshold value. Furthermore, these schemes are
fast-converging, highly accurate, and easy to implement. If the solitary wave
exists only at isolated propagation constant values, the corresponding
squared-operator methods are developed as well. These methods are applied to
various solitary wave problems of physical interest, such as higher-gap vortex
solitons in the two-dimensional nonlinear Schr\""odinger equations with periodic
potentials, and isolated solitons in Ginzburg-Landau equations, and some new
types of solitary wave solutions are obtained. It is also demonstrated that the

area avalanche photodiodes (LAAPDs) to the detection of X-rays and vacuum
ultraviolet (VUV) light. The operational characteristics of four different
LAAPDs manufactured by Advanced Photonix Inc., with active areas of 80 and 200
mm^2 were investigated for X-ray detection at room temperature. The best energy
resolution was found to be in the 10-18% range for 5.9 keV X-rays. The LAAPD,
being compact, simple to operate and with high counting rate capability (up to
about 10^5/s), proved to be useful in several applications, such as low-energy
X-ray detection, where they can reach better performance than proportional
counters. Since X-rays are used as reference in light measurements, the gain
non-linearity between 5.9 keV X-rays and light pulses was investigated. The
gain ratio between X-rays and VUV light decreases with gain, reaching 10 and 6%
variations for VUV light produced in argon (~128 nm) and xenon (~172 nm),
respectively, for a gain 200, while for visible light (~635 nm) the variation
is lower than 1%. The effect of temperature on the LAAPD performance was
investigated. Relative gain variations of about -5% per Celsius degree were
observed for the highest gains. The excess noise factor was found to be
independent on temperature, being between 1.8 and 2.3 for gains from 50 to 300.
The energy resolution is better for decreasing temperatures due mainly to the
dark current. LAAPDs were tested under intense magnetic fields up to 5 T, being
insensitive when used in X-ray and visible-light detection, while for VUV light
a significant amplitude reduction was observed at 5 T.

from single molecule activities have become ubiquitous. Common examples are
trajectories of ionic flux through individual membrane-channels, and of photon
counts collected from diffusion, activity, and conformational changes of
biopolymers. By analyzing the trajectory, one wishes to deduce the underlying
mechanism, which is usually described by a multi-substate kinetic scheme. In
previous works, we divided kinetic schemes that generate two-state trajectories
into two types: reducible schemes and irreducible schemes. We showed that all
the information in trajectories generated from reducible schemes is contained
in the waiting time probability density functions (PDFs) of the two states. It
follows that reducible schemes with the same waiting time PDFs are not
distinguishable. In this work, we further characterize the topologies of
kinetic schemes, now of irreducible schemes, and further study two-state
trajectories from the two types of scheme. We suggest various methods for
extracting information about the underlying kinetic scheme from the trajectory
(e. g., calculate the binned successive waiting times PDF and analyze the
ordered waiting times trajectory), and point out the advantages and
disadvantages of each. We show that the binned successive waiting times PDF is
not only more robust than other functions when analyzing finite trajectories,
but contains, in most cases, more information about the underlying kinetic
scheme than other functions in the limit of infinitely long trajectories. For
some cases however, analyzing the ordered waiting times trajectory may supply
unique information about the underlying kinetic scheme.

Tsirelson's bound) with two-mode entangled coherent states using only homodyne
measurements. This requires Kerr nonlinear interactions for local operations on
the entangled coherent states. Our example is a demonstration of
Bell-inequality violations using classical measurements. We conclude that
entangled coherent states with coherent amplitudes as small as 0.842 are
sufficient to produce such violations.

processes and obtain the global information balance in quantum measurements, in
the form of a closed chain equation for quantum mutual entropies. Our balance
provides a tight and general entropic information-disturbance trade-off, and
explains the physical mechanism underlying it. Finally, the single-outcome
case, that is, the case of measurements with post-selection, is briefly
discussed.

decomposition, which has the merit that the entanglement of quantum strategies
is manifestly quantified. We apply this formulation to 2-player, 2-strategy
symmetric games and obtain a complete set of quantum Nash equilibria. Apart
from those available with the maximal entanglement, these quantum Nash
equilibria are extensions of the Nash equilibria in classical game theory. The
phase structure of the equilibria is determined for all values of entanglement,
and thereby the possibility of resolving the dilemmas by entanglement in the
game of Chicken, the Battle of the Sexes, the Prisoners' Dilemma, and the Stag
Hunt, is examined. We find that entanglement transforms these dilemmas with
each other but cannot resolve them, except in the Stag Hunt game where the
dilemma can be alleviated to a certain degree.

in the intermediate regime of cavity QED with comparable coherent and
decoherent coupling constants, we find an enhancement of the emission into the
undriven cavity mode by more than a factor of 18.5 over that expected by the
solid angle subtended by the mode. A model that incorporates three atomic
levels and two polarization modes quantitatively explains the observations.
