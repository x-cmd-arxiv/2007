study and a study of morphological asymmetries. The results yielded by the two
analysis are highly consistent. For the first time, it is possible to show that
deviations from pure ellipses are produced by inhomogeneous stellar mass
distributions related to galaxy interactions and mergers. We find evidence of
mass asymmetries in 74% of the galaxies in our sample. In 59% of these cases,
the asymmetries come in pairs, and are consistent with tidal effects produced
by the proximity of companion galaxies. The symmetric galaxies are generally
small in size or mass, inactive, and have an early-type morphology. In 20% of
the galaxies we find evidence for cannibalism. In 36% of the early-type
galaxies the color gradient is positive (blue nucleus) or flat. Summing up
these results, as much as 52% of the galaxies in our sample could show evidence
of an on going or past mergers. Our observations suggest that galaxies in CGs
merge more frequently under ``dry'' conditions. The high frequency of
interacting and merging galaxies observed in our study is consistent with the
bias of our sample towards CGs of type B, which represents the most active
phase in the evolution of the groups. In these groups we also find a strong
correlation between asymmetries and nuclear activity in early-type galaxies.

clusters (GCs) by adopting a new ``external pollution'' scenario. In this
framework, GCs are assumed to originate in forming low-mass dwarfs embedded in
dark matter subhalos at very high redshifts (z) and thus be chemically
influenced by field AGB stars of the dwarfs during early GC formation
processes. In this external pollution scenario, the ratio of the total mass of
infalling gas to that of AGB ejecta during GC formation in a dwarf (s) and the
time scale of gas infall (sigma_I) are the most important key parameters that
can determine abundance properties of GCs. We mainly investigate the abundance
inhomogeneity among light elements (e.g., C, N, O, Na, and Al) of stars in GCs
by using the latest stellar yield models of metal-poor AGB stars with and
without third dredge-up. Our principal results for the models with no third
dredge-up, which are more consistent with observations, are as follows.
  Both [N/Fe] and [C/Fe] can be diverse among stars within a GC owing to
chemical pollution from field AGB stars. [N/Fe] distributions in some GCs can
clearly show bimodality whereas [C/Fe] is monomodal in most models. [N/Fe]
distributions depend on s such that models with smaller $s$ (i.e., larger mass
fraction of AGB ejecta used for GC formation) show the [N/Fe] bimodality more
clearly. N-rich, C-poor stars in GCs also have higher He abundances owing to
pollution from massive AGB stars with He-rich ejecta. The number fraction of
He-rich stars (Y >0.30) is higher for the models with smaller s and shorter
sigma_I for 3 < s <24 and 10^5 < sigma_I < 10^7 yr.Our models are in strong

over macroscopic distances, should also display magnetic noise, but this must
be sampled at spatial wavelengths of order several interatomic spacings, rather
than the macroscopic scales characteristic of ferromagnets. Here we present the
first direct measurement of the fluctuations in the nanometre-scale spin-

Spectroscopy, where coherent x-ray diffraction produces a speckle pattern that
serves as a ""fingerprint"" of a particular magnetic domain configuration. The
temporal evolution of the patterns corresponds to domain walls advancing and
retreating over micron distances. While the domain wall motion is thermally
activated at temperatures above 100K, it is not so at lower temperatures, and
indeed has a rate which saturates at a finite value - consistent with quantum
fluctuations - on cooling below 40K. Our work is important because it provides
an important new measurement tool for antiferromagnetic domain engineering as

scalar degree on top of the ad-hoc dilaton and mixing of these two modes around

to embed the standard model into some larger theory that accounts for the

stabilizes the values of the fundamental constants of nature. In these lecture
notes we describe in nontechnical terms how such a sector can be constructed.
Our additional sector is based on rapidly fluctuating scalar fields that,
although completely deterministic, evolve in the strongest possible chaotic way
and exhibit complex behaviour. These chaotic fields generate potentials for
moduli fields, which ultimately fix the fundamental parameters. The chaotic
dynamics can be physically interpreted in terms of vacuum fluctuations. These
vacuum fluctuations are different from those of QED or QCD but coupled with the
same moduli fields as QED and QCD are. The vacuum energy generated by the
chaotic fields underlies the currently observed dark energy of the universe.
Our theory correctly predicts the numerical values of the electroweak and
strong coupling constants using a simple principle, the minimization of vacuum
energy. Implementing some additional discrete symmetry assumptions one also
obtains predictions for fermion masses, as well as a Higgs mass prediction of
154 GeV.

spectral structure of periodic operators of mathematical physics (e.g.,
Schroedinger, Maxwell, waveguide operators, etc.). Is it true that one can
obtain the correct spectrum by using the values of the quasimomentum running
over the boundary of the (reduced) Brillouin zone only, rather than the whole
zone? Or, do the edges of the spectrum occur necessarily at the set of
``corner'' high symmetry points? This is known to be true in 1D, while no
apparent reasons exist for this to be happening in higher dimensions. In many
practical cases, though, this appears to be correct, which sometimes leads to
the claims that this is always true. There seems to be no definite answer in
the literature, and one encounters different opinions about this problem in the
community.
  In this paper, starting with simple discrete graph operators, we construct a
variety of convincing multiply-periodic examples showing that the spectral
edges might occur deeply inside the Brillouin zone. On the other hand, it is
also shown that in a ``generic'' case, the situation of spectral edges
appearing at high symmetry points is stable under small perturbations. This
explains to some degree why in many (maybe even most) practical cases the
statement still holds.

$\beta^* \in \real^p based on a set of $n$ noisy observations arises in a
variety of settings, including subset selection in regression, graphical model
selection, signal denoising, compressive sensing, and constructive

distance-decreasing maps. This follows as a corollary of the following
stability theorem: if a minimal submanifold $\Sigma$ is the graph of a
(strictly) distance-decreasing map, then $\Sigma$ is (strictly) stable. It is
known that a minimal graph of codimension one is stable without assuming the
distance-decreasing condition. We give another criterion for the stability in
terms of the two-Jacobians of the map which in particular covers the
codimension one case. All theorems are proved in the more general setting for
minimal maps between Riemannian manifolds.

is that the free energy for overlapping $n$ chains is \emph{independent} of
chain length and scales as $n^{9/4}$, slowly crossing over to $n^3$, as $n$

that rearranging the chains does not cost an additional free energy. Our

understanding of the rhythmic phenomena of living organisms at both molecular
and cellular levels. Genetic networks are intrinsically noisy due to natural
random intra- and inter-cellular fluctuations. Therefore, it is important to
study the effects of noise perturbation on the synchronous dynamics of genetic
oscillators. From the synthetic biology viewpoint, it is also important to
implement biological systems that minimizing the negative influence of the
perturbations. In this paper, based on systems biology approach, we provide a
general theoretical result on the synchronization of genetic oscillators with
stochastic perturbations. By exploiting the specific properties of many genetic
oscillator models, we provide an easy-verified sufficient condition for the
stochastic synchronization of coupled genetic oscillators, based on the Lur'e
system approach in control theory. A design principle for minimizing the
influence of noise is also presented. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our
theoretical results, a population of coupled repressillators is adopted as a
numerical example. In summary, we present an efficient theoretical method for
analyzing the synchronization of genetic oscillator networks, which is helpful
for understanding and testing the synchronization phenomena in biological
organisms. Besides, the results are actually applicable to general oscillator
networks.

canonical variables of the system and analyze the relative importance of these
fluctuations in the evolution of the system. We show that upon contact with the
