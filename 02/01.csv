  Galaxies During the Reionization Era","17 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ApJ",,"10.1086/520947",,"astro-ph",,"  [Abridged] We develop a simple star formation model whose goal is to
interpret the emerging body of observational data on star-forming galaxies at
z>~6. The efficiency and duty cycle of the star formation activity within dark
matter halos are determined by fitting the luminosity functions of Lya emitter
and Lyman-break galaxies at redshifts z~5-6. Using our model parameters we
predict the likely abundance of star forming galaxies at earlier epochs and
compare these to the emerging data in the redshift interval 7<z<10. We find
that the abundance of luminous Lyman-break galaxies in the 500 Myr between z~6
and 10 can be naturally explained by the hierarchical assembly of dark matter
haloes; there is only marginal evidence for strong physical evolution. In
contrast, the first estimates of the abundance of less luminous star forming
galaxies at z=9-10 are higher than predicted and, if verified by further data,
may suggest a top-heavy stellar mass function at these early epochs. Although
these abundances remain uncertain because of the difficulty of spectroscopic
confirmation and cosmic variance, even a modest improvement in survey
capability with present or upcoming facilities should yield great progress. In
this context, we use our model to consider those observational techniques that
hold the most promise and make predictions for specific surveys that are, or
will soon be, underway. We conclude that narrowband Lya emitter surveys should
be efficient on searches at z~7-8; however, such conventional surveys are
unlikely to detect sufficient galaxies at z~10 to provide useful constraints.
For this reason, gravitational lensing offers the best prospect for probing the
z~10 universe prior to JWST.

as the progenitors of globular clusters, via a combination of gravitational
segregation and cluster evaporation. We use simple analytic arguments supported
by detailed N-body simulations to determine how frequently black holes born in
a single stellar cluster should form binaries, be ejected from the cluster, and
merge through the emission of gravitational radiation. We then convolve this
``transfer function'' relating cluster formation to black hole mergers with (i)
the distribution of observed cluster masses and (ii) the star formation history
of the universe, assuming that a significant fraction gcl of star formation
occurs in clusters and that a significant fraction gcand of clusters undergo
this segregation and evaporation process. We predict future ground--based
gravitational wave (GW) detectors could observe ~500 (gcl/0.5) (gcand/0.1)

interferometer would have a chance (50%) at detecting a merger during its first
full year of science data. More realistically, advanced LIGO and similar
next-generation gravitational wave observatories provide unique opportunities
to constrain otherwise inaccessible properties of clusters formed in the early
universe.

forest data is the study of their second order properties. Usually, this is
accomplished by means of the two-point correlation function or, alternatively,
the K-function. In the computation of these functions it is necessary to take
into account the presence of strong metal line complexes and strong Ly-alpha
lines that can hidden part of the Ly-alpha forest and represent a non
negligible source of bias. Aims. In this work, we show quantitatively what are
the effects of the gaps introduced in the spectrum by the strong lines if they
are not properly accounted for in the computation of the correlation
properties. We propose a geometric method which is able to solve this problem
and is computationally more efficient than the Monte Carlo (MC) technique that
is typically adopted in Cosmology studies. The method is implemented in two
different algorithms. The first one permits to obtain exact results, whereas
the second one provides approximated results but is computationally very
efficient. The proposed approach can be easily extended to deal with the case
of two or more lists of lines that have to be analyzed at the same time.
Methods. Numerical experiments are presented that illustrate the consequences
to neglect the effects due to the strong lines and the excellent performances
of the proposed approach. Results. The proposed method is able to remarkably
improve the estimates of both the two-point correlation function and the

fields) of a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background are considered. In the
presence of this type of perturbations, the polarization vector rotates. A
formula giving the rotation angle is obtained and, then, it is used to prove
that this angle depends on both the observation direction and the emission
redshift. Hence, rotations are different for distinct quasars and also for the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation coming along different directions
(from distinct points of the last scattering surface). As a result of these
rotations, some correlations could appear in an initially random field of
quasar polarization orientations. Furthermore, the polarization correlations of
the CMB could undergo alterations. Quasars and CMB maps are both considered in
this paper. In the case of linear vector modes with very large spatial scales,
the maximum rotation angles appear to be of a few degrees for quasars (located
at redshifts z < 2.6) and a few tenths of degree for the CMB. These last
rotations produce contributions to the B-mode of the CMB polarization which are
too small to be observed with PLANCK (in the near future); however, these
contributions are large enough to be observed with the next generation of
satellites, which are being designed to detect the small B-mode produced by
primordial gravitational waves.

classes remains unexplained.We complement previous ACF analysis studying the
corresponding power density spectra (PDS). With the addition of Beppo-SAX data
and taken advantage of its broad-band capability, we not only increase the
burst sample but we extend the analysis to X-ray energies. The rest-frame PDS
analysis at gamma-ray energies shows that the two ACF classes are not simply
characterised by a different low frequency cut-off, but they have a distinct
variability as a whole in the studied frequency range. Both classes exhibit
average PDS with power-law behaviour at high frequencies (f' > 0.1 Hz) but
significantly different slopes, with index values close to those of Brownian
(-2) and Kolmogorov (-5/3) spectra for the narrow and broad classes
respectively. The latter spectrum presents an additional PDS component, a
low-frequency noise excess with a sharp cut-off. At X-ray energies we find the
power-law index unchanged for the broad class, but a significantly steeper
slope in the narrow case (~ -3). We interpret this as an indication that the
broad class bursts have weaker spectral evolution than the narrow ones, as
suggested also by our analysis of the ACF energy dependence. The low and high
frequency PDS components may then arise from two radiating regions involving
different emission mechanisms.

where optimality is defined by saturation of the Cramer Rao bound, if noise is
homogeneous. Our estimator is also computationally efficient, scaling as
$O(N^{3/2})$ compared to the $O(N^{5/2})$ scaling of the brute force bispectrum
calculation for sky maps with $N$ pixels. For Planck this translates into a
speed-up by factors of millions, reducing the required computing time from
thousands of years to just hours and thus making $f_{NL}$ estimation feasible
for future surveys. Our estimator in its current form is optimal if noise is
homogeneous. In future work our fast polarized bispectrum estimator should be
extended to deal with inhomogeneous noise in an analogous way to how the
existing fast temperature estimator was generalized.

evolution of SF since z~1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in
most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or
a decreasing factor by which SFR are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z~1 seem
to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The

formation prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas

remaining quarter from dissolved galaxies. I.e., the formation of the DSC is
parallel to the build-up of the BCG and other massive galaxies. (ii) Most DSC
star particles become unbound during mergers in the formation history of the
BGCs and of other massive galaxies, independent of cluster mass. Our results
suggest that the tidal stripping mechanism is responsible only for a minor
fraction of the DSC. (iii) At cluster radii larger than 250 kpc/h, the DSC
fraction from the BCG is reduced and the largest contribution comes from the
other massive galaxies; in the cluster outskirts, galaxies of all masses
contribute to the DSC. (iv) The DSC does not have a preferred redshift of

We find that f_st < 50 per cent with a decrease to higher cluster
masses/more-massive primaries. The interpretation would be that cluster
formation is very disruptive. It appears that clusters with a birth stellar
mass in the range 10 to 10^3 Msun keep at most 50 per cent of their stars.

companion from the same spectra. We have combined new spectroscopic orbits for
the white dwarf and M-dwarf with an analysis of the primary eclipse and cooling
models for helium white dwarfs to measure the mass and radius of the M-dwarf.
The mass of the M-dwarf is (0.182 - 0.183) +- 0.013 Msun and the radius is
(0.203 - 0.215) +- 0.013 Rsun, where the ranges quoted for these values reflect
the range of white dwarf models used. In contrast to previous studies, which
lacked a spectroscopic orbit for the white dwarf, we find that the mass and
radius of the M-dwarf are normal for an M4 dwarf. The mass of the white dwarf
is (0.440 +-0.022) Msun. With these revised masses and radii we find that RR
Cae will become a cataclysmic variable star when the orbital period is reduced
from its current value of 7.3 hours to 121 minutes by magnetic braking in 9-20

a ``nozzle'' analogy for terms that constrain the local mass flux. For low
rotation, we find the nozzle minimum occurs near the stellar surface, allowing
a transition to a standard, CAK-type steep-acceleration solution; but for
rotations > 75% of the critical rate, this inner nozzle minimum exceeds the
global minimum, implying near-surface supercritical solutions would have an
overloaded mass loss rate. In steady, analytic models in which the acceleration
is assumed to be monotonically positive, this leads the solution to switch to a
slow acceleration mode. However, time-dependent simulations using a numerical
hydrodynamics code show that, for rotation rates 75 - 85% of critical, the flow
can develop abrupt ""kink"" transitions from a steep acceleration to a
decelerating solution. For rotations above 85% of critical, the hydrodynamic
simulations confirm the slow acceleration, with the lower flow speed implying
densities 5 - 30 times higher than the polar (or a nonrotating) wind. Still,
when gravity darkening and 2D flow effects are accounted for, it seems unlikely
that rotationally modified equatorial wind outflows could account for the very
large densities inferred for the equatorial regions around B[e] supergiants.

We confirm that the hotspot size correlates with the core-hotspot distance. The
hotspot spectral index is correlated with, and flatter than the lobe spectral
index, consistent with the assumptions of spectral aging models. Both the
hotspot and lobe spectral index are correlated with redshift. The
depolarization asymmetry in the lobes is not correlated with the radio core
prominence or misalignment angle, which are statistical indicators of
orientation. The `Liu-Pooley' correlation of lobe depolarization with the lobe
spectral index is significant in our radio galaxy sample. Further, the lobe
with the steeper spectral index and greater depolarization is shorter and
fatter. The arm-length ratio seems to be correlated with the misalignment angle
between the two sides of the radio source and strongly anti-correlated with the
axial ratio, consistent with environmental effects and/or a change in the
outflow direction. In this sample, asymmetries in the local environments and/or

investigate the effects of the lower than galactic metallicity on dust
properties. A dust features -- gas lines -- continuum fitting technique on the
data, allows the production of images in each single emission and the detailed
analysis of dust, and ionized gas. The NIR photometry provides, for the first
time, information on the stellar content of N4. The images in single dust
feature bands and gas lines clearly show that the HII region core is completely
devoid of the carriers responsible for the Aromatic Features (AFs). On the
other hand, the ionized gas arises almost completely in this dust cavity, where
also the two main exciting stars of N4 are located. We find evidences that the
effect of lower than Galactic metallicity on the carriers responsible for the
AFs, is not to prevent their formation or to modify their chemical properties,
but to enhance their destruction by the high and hard ISRF. We show that this
mechanism is more efficient on smaller dust particles/molecules thus affecting
the dust-size distribution. We argue that effects on dust--size distribution,
rather than thedifferent dust properties due to a lower metallicity, should be
taken into account when analyzing more distant relatively low metallicity
galaxies. Finally, the analysis of the stellar content of N4 reveals 7 stars: 4
reddened O MS stars and 3 stars with envelopes. In particular, one of these,
seems to be an Ultra Compact HII region containing an embedded YSO.

behavior during the two outbursts was very similar. In particular, Ldisk was
proportional to Tin^4 up to the same critical luminosity and in both outbursts
there were periods during which the energy spectra were very soft, but could
not be fit with standard disk models.

by measuring the spectral lags between different energy bands. We want to
understand the origin of the LLR and test its validity. This appears especially
important if the LLR is to be used as a distance indicator. We perform a linear
analysis of the lag between two spectral bands. The lag is obtained as the time
interval between the maxima of a given pulse in the two bands. We get a simple
expression for the lag, which shows in a very simple way how it is related to
the spectral evolution of the burst via the variation of the peak energy and
spectral indices. When this expression is coupled to the Amati relation, it
leads to a LLR that agrees with the observational results only if the burst's
spectral evolution is limited to a decrease in peak energy during pulse decay.
However, when the variation of the spectral indices is also taken into account,
the predicted LLR differs from the observed one. We briefly discuss some ways
to solve this problem, such as a possible correlation between pulse spikiness

ultraviolet (UV) irradiation from a central T Tauri star, as well as dust size
growth and settling toward the disk midplane. The spatial and size
distributions of dust grains in the disks are numerically computed by solving
the coagulation equation for settling dust particles. The level populations and
line emission of molecular hydrogen are calculated using the derived physical
structure of the disks. X-ray irradiation is the dominant heating source of the
gas in the inner disk region and in the surface layer, while the far UV heating
dominates otherwise. If the central star has strong X-ray and weak UV
radiation, the H2 level populations are controlled by X-ray pumping, and the
X-ray induced transition lines could be observable. If the UV irradiation is
strong, the level populations are controlled by thermal collisions or UV
pumping, depending on the properties of the dust grains in the disks. As the
dust particles evolve in the disks, the gas temperature at the disk surface
drops because the grain photoelectric heating becomes less efficient, while the
UV radiation fields become stronger due to the decrease of grain opacity. This
makes the H2 level populations change from local thermodynamic equilibrium
(LTE) to non-LTE distributions, which results in changes to the line ratios of
H2 emission. Our results suggest that dust evolution in protoplanetary disks
could be observable through the H2 line ratios. The emission lines are strong
from disks irradiated by strong UV and X-rays and possessing small dust grains;
such disks will be good targets in which to observe H2 emission.

We show that the occurrence of scaling in the fluctuations of both the number
of packets passing nodes and the number flowing along edges is related to
preferential behaviour in either the topology (in the case of nodes) or in the
dynamics (in case the of edges). Within our model the absence of any preference
leads to the absence of scaling, and when scaling occurs it is non-universal;
for random diffusion the number of packets passing a node scales with an
exponent $\mu$ which increases continuously with increased acquisition time
window from $\mu =1/2$ at small windows, to $\mu =1$ at long time windows; In
the preferentially navigated diffusive motion, busy nodes and edges have
exponent $\mu =1$, in contrast to less busy parts of the network, where an
exponent $\mu =1/2$ is found. Broad distributions of the return times at nodes
and edges illustrate that the basis of the observed scaling is the cooperative
behaviour between groups of nodes or edges. These conclusions are relevant for
a large class of diffusive dynamics on networks, including packet transport

capacities, which are well-known to be associated in general with the

data. For the K-edge XAS of Ag, we find nearly complete removal of ~9.3 eV FWHM
broadening from the combined effects of the short core-hole lifetime and
instrumental resolution. We are also able to remove nearly all instrumental
broadening in an XRS measurement of diamond, with the resulting improved
spectrum comparing favorably with prior soft x-ray XAS measurements. We present
a practical methodology for implementing the RL algorithm to these problems,
emphasizing the importance of testing for stability of the deconvolution
process against noise amplification, perturbations in the initial spectra, and
uncertainties in the core-hole lifetime.

developed. It is based on the observation that in the case of strong electron
correlation the one-electron Green's function is strongly spatially damped so
that its intersite matrix elements may be considered as small perturbations.
Because the non-local corrections are at least quadratic in these matrix
elements, DMFT in such cases may be a very accurate approximation in dimensions
d = 1-3. This observation provides a rigorous justification for the application
of DMFT to physical systems. Furthermore, the technique allows for a systematic
evaluation of the nonlocal corrections. This is illustrated with the
calculation of the magnetic short range order parameter for nearest neighbor
spins in the half filled Hubbard model on the square lattice in its insulating

frozen spin network, in which the color (i.e. the twice spin of an edge)
labeling edge changes but the underlying graph remains fixed. The mainly
considered evolution rule, the random edge model, is depending on choosing an
edge randomly and changing the color of it by an even integer. Since the change
of color generally violate the gauge invariance conditions imposed on the
system, detailed propagation rule is needed and it can be defined in many ways.
Here, we provided one new propagation rule, in which the involved even integer
is not a constant one as in previous works, but changeable with certain
probability. In random edge model, we do find the evolution of the system under
the propagation rule exhibits power-law behavior, which is suggestive of the
self-organized criticality (SOC), and it is the first time to verify the SOC
behavior in such evolution model for the frozen spin network. Furthermore, the
increase of the average color of the spin network in time can show the nature
of inflation for the universe.

that has the form of the Maxwell Lagrangian with the metric tensor replaced by
the symmetrized Ricci tensor, is dynamically equivalent to the metric
Einstein-Maxwell Lagrangian, except the zero-field limit, for which the metric
tensor is not well-defined. This feature indicates that, for the
Ferraris-Kijowski model to be physical, there must exist a background field
that depends on the Ricci tensor. The simplest possibility, supported by recent
astronomical observations, is the cosmological constant, generated in the
purely affine formulation of gravity by the Eddington Lagrangian. In this paper
we combine the electromagnetic field and the cosmological constant in the
purely affine formulation. We show that the sum of the two affine (Eddington
and Ferraris-Kijowski) Lagrangians is dynamically inequivalent to the sum of
the analogous ($\Lambda$CDM and Einstein-Maxwell) Lagrangians in the
metric-affine/metric formulation. We also show that such a construction is
valid, like the affine Einstein-Born-Infeld formulation, only for weak
electromagnetic fields, on the order of the magnetic field in outer space of
the Solar System. Therefore the purely affine formulation that combines
gravity, electromagnetism and cosmological constant cannot be a simple sum of
affine terms corresponding separately to these fields. A quite complicated form
of the affine equivalent of the metric Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ Lagrangian
suggests that Nature can be described by a simpler affine Lagrangian, leading
to modifications of the Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$CDM theory for
electromagnetic fields that contribute to the spacetime curvature on the same
order as the cosmological constant.

especially when comparing waveforms from different simulations. Recently,
progress has been made in defining a general technique which uses Weyl scalars
to extract the gravitational wave signal, through the introduction of the {\it

numerical simulations; however, it involves complicated calculations. The work
in this paper simplifies the procedure by showing that the choice of the {\it

to create it. The space-like vectors needed to complete the tetrad are then
easily identified, and it is possible to write the expression for the Weyl

$\rho_c$ (the order of Planck density). After incorporating the inverse volume
modifications both in the gravitational and matter part in the improved
framework of LQC, we find that the inverse volume modification can decrease the
bouncing energy scale, and the presence of nonsingular bounce is generic. For
the backward evolution in the expanding branch, in terms of different initial
states the evolution trajectories classify into two classes. One class with
larger initial energy density leads to the occurrence of bounce in the region
$a>a_{ch}$ where $a_{ch}$ marks the different inverse volume modification
region. The other class with smaller initial energy density evolves back into
the region $a<a_{ch}$. In this region, both the energy density for the scalar
field and the bouncing energy scale decrease with the backward evolution.
However, in the deep modification region, because of the inverse volume
modification the scalar field is frozen, such that the bounce is present when
the bouncing energy scale decreases to be equal to the energy density of the
scalar field. Using numerical method, we show the evolution picture for the
second class bounce.

comment on some of these possibilities, and discuss in more detail the class of

scenario can help to understand some controversies in cosmology, for example
the natural existence of slow roll inflation and dark energy in the landscape,
the apparent smallness of the cosmological constant. We see also that moduli
stabilization is no longer necessary. We further identify the glass transition
point, where the viscosity diverges, as the location of the cosmic horizon. We

_{\mathrm{c}}$ to a positive fraction of $n$ for $\rho<\rho_{\mathrm{c}}$, with
a transition window size $\Theta(n^{-1/2})$ around $\rho_{\mathrm{c}}>0$.
Analyzing the corresponding ``leaf removal'' algorithm, we determine the
associated finite-size scaling behavior. In particular, if $\rho$ is inside the
scaling window (more precisely, $\rho=\rho_{\mathrm{c}}+rn^{-1/2}$), the
probability of having a core of size $\Theta(n)$ has a limit strictly between 0
and 1, and a leading correction of order $\Theta(n^{-1/6})$. The correction
admits a sharp characterization in terms of the distribution of a Brownian
motion with quadratic shift, from which it inherits the scaling with $n$. This
behavior is expected to be universal for a wide collection of combinatorial
problems.

approximation of the distribution of a random element by another, often
simpler, distribution. In applications of Stein's method, one needs to
establish a Stein identity for the approximating distribution, solve the Stein
equation and estimate the behaviour of the solutions in terms of the metrics
under study. For some Stein equations, solutions with good properties are
known; for others, this is not the case. Barbour and Xia (1999) introduced a
perturbation method for Poisson approximation, in which Stein identities for a
large class of compound Poisson and translated Poisson distributions are viewed
as perturbations of a Poisson distribution. In this paper, it is shown that the
method can be extended to very general settings, including perturbations of
normal, Poisson, compound Poisson, binomial and Poisson process approximations
in terms of various metrics such as the Kolmogorov, Wasserstein and total
variation metrics. Examples are provided to illustrate how the general
perturbation method can be applied.

process of chaotic tunneling in a quantum mechanical model with two degrees of
freedom. Our analysis reveals rich dynamics of the system. At the classical
level, there exists an infinite set of unstable solutions forming a fractal
structure. This structure is inherited by the complex tunneling paths and plays
the central role in the semiclassical study. The process we consider exhibits
the phenomenon of optimal tunneling: the suppression exponent of the tunneling
probability has a local minimum at a certain energy which is thus (locally) the
optimal energy for tunneling. We test the proposed method by comparison of the
semiclassical results with the results of the exact quantum computations and
find a good agreement.

significant for $\theta=0$, is blurred out long before the Wick rotation is
completed ($\theta=\pi/2$). The influence of resonances on tunnelling rates
weakens exponentially as $\theta$ increases from zero, all the more rapidly the

transfer between its mean and eddy processes. In a Reynolds decomposition
framework, energy transfer can be defined from the decomposed energy equations,
but the definition is subjective with the classical energetics formalism. This
paper shows that a faithful formalism can be rigorously established within the
same framework. The resulting transfer sums to zero everywhere over the
decomposed subspaces, representing a mere redistribution of energy between the
mean and eddy processes, without generating or destroying energy as a whole.
For this reason, it has been referred to as perfect transfer in distinction
from other energy transfers one may have encountered. The perfect transfer has
a simple form in expression, with the introduction of an eddy flow coupled with
the mean and eddy processes of the field under concern. The eddy or turbulence
production is then totally determined by the divergence of this flow. This
formalism has been validated with a well-known barotropic instability model,
and a wake control problem. It is expected to be useful for the harnessing of
turbulence, in that it may help to identify the best locations to place passive
controls, or design the performance functional for active controls.

markets and the next price change, especially in an on-line foreign exchange
trading service for individual customers via the internet. Basic technical idea
of our present work is dependent on the so-called renewal-reward theorem.
Assuming that stochastic processes of the market price changes could be
regarded as a renewal process, we use the theorem to calculate the average
waiting time of the process. In the conventional derivation of the theorem, it
is apparently hard to evaluate the higher order moments of the waiting time. To
overcome this type of difficulties, we attempt to derive the waiting time
distribution Omega(s) directly for arbitrary time interval distribution (first
passage time distribution) of the stochastic process P_{W}(tau) and observation
time distribution P_{O}(t) of customers. Our analysis enables us to evaluate
not only the first moment (the average waiting time) but also any order of the
higher moments of the waiting time. Moreover, in our formalism, it is possible
to model the observation of the price on the internet by the customers in terms
of the observation time distribution P_{O}(t). We apply our analysis to the
stochastic process of the on-line foreign exchange rate for individual
customers from the Sony bank and compare the moments with the empirical data

comparison of the results with experimental data of other authors indicates
that the basic assumption of the capacity estimation for bottlenecks has to be

that a jam occurs even if the incoming flow does not overstep the capacity

characteristics of interest, such as mean values of the fitness or any trait

dramatically depend on the initial distribution. The Fisher Fundamental theorem
of natural selection (FTNS) and more general the Price equations are the famous

dynamic insufficiency for the Price equations and for the FTNS can be resolved
within the framework of selection systems. Effective formulas for solutions of
the Price equations and for the FTNS are derived. Applications of the developed
theory to some other problems of mathematical biology (dynamics of
inhomogeneous logistic and Ricker model, selection in rotifer populations) are
also given. Complex behavior of the total population size, the mean fitness (in

the human, fruit fly and nematode worm protein networks, using a lenient
criterion based on connectedness and matching edges, coupled with a betweenness
clustering heuristic. We evaluate the detected conserved modules against
reference yeast protein complexes using sensitivity and specificity measures.
In these evaluations, our method performs competitively with and sometimes
better than two previous network comparison methods. Further under some
conditions (proper homolog and species selection), our method performs better
than a popular single-species clustering method. Beyond these evaluations, we
discuss the biology of a couple of conserved modules detected by our method. We
demonstrate the utility of network comparison for transferring annotations from

has constant size N. Individuals reproduce (at rates depending on their types),
the offspring inherits the parent's type, and replaces a randomly chosen
individual (to keep population size constant). Independently of the

Gaussian. We have proven an analogous statement for finite-dimensional quantum
systems. In this context, the role of Gaussian states is taken on by stabilizer
states. The general results have been published in [D. Gross, J. Math. Phys.

with their environmental perturbations. Harmonic perturbation is a rare special
case of time-dependent perturbations in which exact analysis exists. Some
important technology advances, such as masers, lasers, nuclear magnetic
resonance, etc., originated from it. Here we add quantum computation to this
list with a theoretical demonstration. Based on harmonic perturbation, a
quantum mechanical algorithm is devised to search the ground state of a given
Hamiltonian. The intrinsic complexity of the algorithm is continuous and
parametric in both time T and energy E. More precisely, the probability of
locating a search target of a Hamiltonian in N-dimensional vector space is
shown to be 1/(1+ c N E^{-2} T^{-2}) for some constant c. This result is
optimal. As harmonic perturbation provides a different computation mechanism,
the algorithm may suggest new directions in realizing quantum computers.

  universality proof. Most readers will want to read only the first part.
  Presented at QIP 2007, Brisbane, Australia",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In the first 36 pages of this paper, we provide polynomial quantum algorithms
for additive approximations of the Tutte polynomial, at any point in the Tutte
plane, for any planar graph. This includes as special cases the AJL algorithm
for the Jones polynomial, the partition function of the Potts model for any
weighted planer graph at any temperature, and many other combinatorial graph
properties. In the second part of the paper we prove the quantum universality
of many of the problems for which we provide an algorithm, thus providing a
large set of new quantum-complete problems. Unfortunately, we do not know that
this holds for the Potts model case; this is left as an important open problem.
The main progress in this work is in our ability to handle non-unitary
representations of the Temperley Lieb algebra, both when applying them in the
algorithm, and, more importantly, in the proof of universality, when encoding
quantum circuits using non-unitary operators. To this end we develop many new
tools, that allow proving density and applying the Solovay Kitaev theorem in
the case of non-unitary matrices. We hope that these tools will open up new
possibilities of using non-unitary reps in other quantum computation contexts.

the model: i) throughout the whole measurement process, the pointer of the
measuring device is always perfectly well localized in space; ii) the
probabilities for the possible outcomes are distributed in agreement with the
Born probability rule; iii) at the end of the measurement the state of the
microscopic system has collapsed to the eigenstate corresponding to the
measured eigenvalue. This analysis shows rigorously how dynamical reduction
models provide a consistent solution to the measurement problem of quantum
mechanics.

represent \textit{open} quantum systems, thus being subject to decoherence.
