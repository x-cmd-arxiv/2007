the cosmological interpretation of the galaxy power spectrum, but can also
provide insights about the physics underlying galaxy formation. To study the
nature of this relative clustering, we perform a counts-in-cells analysis of
galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in which we measure the
relative bias between pairs of galaxy subsamples of different luminosities and
colours. We use a generalized chi-squared test to determine if the relative
bias between each pair of subsamples is consistent with the simplest
deterministic linear bias model, and we also use a maximum likelihood technique
to further understand the nature of the relative bias between each pair. We
find that the simple, deterministic model is a good fit for the
luminosity-dependent bias on scales above ~2 Mpc/h, which is good news for
using magnitude-limited surveys for cosmology. However, the colour-dependent
bias shows evidence for stochasticity and/or non-linearity which increases in
strength toward smaller scales, in agreement with previous studies of
stochastic bias. Also, confirming hints seen in earlier work, the
luminosity-dependent bias for red galaxies is significantly different from that
of blue galaxies: both luminous and dim red galaxies have higher bias than
moderately bright red galaxies, whereas the biasing of blue galaxies is not
strongly luminosity-dependent. These results can be used to constrain galaxy
formation models and also to quantify how the colour and luminosity selection
of a galaxy survey can impact measurements of the cosmological matter power
spectrum.

on the Swift satellite, before Swift had slewed to the burst location, while
the last three flares were strongly detected by the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) but
only weakly detected by the BAT. This burst provides an unusual opportunity to
track a complete sequence of flares over a wide energy range. The flares were
very similar in their light curve morphology, showing power-law rise and fall
components, and in most cases significant sub-structure. The flares also showed
strong evolution with time, both spectrally and temporally. The small time
scale and large amplitude variability observed are incompatible with an
external shock origin for the flares, and support instead late time sporadic
activity either of the central source or of localized dissipation events within
the outflow. We show that the flares in GRB 060714 cannot be the result of
internal shocks in which the contrast in the Lorentz factor of the colliding
shells is very small, and that this mechanism faces serious difficulties in
most Swift GRBs. The morphological similarity of the flares and the prompt
emission and the gradual and continual evolution of the flares with time makes
it difficult and arbitrary to draw a dividing line between the prompt emission

building block of the coronal heating process. The key to explaining where, how
and how much energy is released during such an interaction is to calculate the
resulting evolution of the magnetic skeleton. A skeleton is essentially the web
of magnetic flux surfaces (called separatrix surfaces) that separate the
coronal volume into topologically distinct parts. For the first time the
skeleton of the magnetic field in a 3D numerical MHD experiment is calculated
and carefully analysed, as are the ways in which it bifurcates into different
topologies. A change in topology normally changes the number of magnetic
reconnection sites.
  In our experiment, the magnetic field evolves through a total of six distinct
topologies. Initially, no magnetic flux joins the two sources. Then a new type
of bifurcation, called a global double-separator bifurcation, takes place: this
bifurcation is likely to be one of the main ways in which new separators are
created in the corona (separators are field lines at which 3D reconnection
takes place). This is the first of five bifurcations in which the skeleton
becomes progressively more complex before simplifying. Surprisingly, for such a
simple initial state, at the peak of complexity there are five separators and
eight flux domains present.

each source was found to be close to the theoretical value expected for
optically thin free-free emission, thus confirming that the majority of flux at
31 GHz is due to free-free emission from ionised gas with an electron
temperature of $\approx 7000-8000$ K.
  We also found that, for all six sources, the 31 GHz flux density was slightly
higher than the predicted value from data in the literature. This excess
emission could be due to spinning dust or another emission mechanism.
Comparisons with $100 \mu$m data indicate an average dust emissivity of
$3.3\pm1.7 \mu$K (MJy/sr)$^{-1}$, or a 95 per cent confidence limit of $<6.1
\mu$K (MJy/sr)$^{-1}$. This is lower than that found in diffuse clouds at high
Galactic latitudes by a factor of $\sim 3-4$. The most significant detection
($3.3\sigma$) was found in $G284.3-0.3$ (RCW49) and may account for up to

dust emissivity of the excess emission is $13.6\pm4.2 \mu$K (MJy/sr)$^{-1}$ and
is within the range observed at high Galactic latitudes.
  Low level polarised emission was observed in all six sources with
polarisation fractions in the range $0.3-0.6$ per cent. This is likely to be
mainly due to instrumental leakage and is therefore upper an upper limit to the
free-free polarisation. It corresponds to an upper limit of $\sim1$ per cent

experiments at Goldstone, USA, and Kalyazin, Russia, have also recorded null
results, and computer simulations have been used to model the experimental
sensitivities of these two experiments and put useful limits on the UHE
neutrino flux.
  Proposed future experiments include the use of broad-bandwidth receivers,
making the sensitivity achieved by the Parkes experiment highly relevant to the
future prospects of this field. We have therefore calculated the effective
aperture for the Parkes experiment and found that when pointing at the lunar
limb, the effective aperture at all neutrino energies was superior to
single-antenna, narrow-bandwidth experiments, and that the detection threshold
was comparable to that of the double-antenna experiment at Goldstone. However,
because only a small fraction of the observing time was spent pointing the
limb, the Parkes experiment places only comparatively weak limits on the UHE
neutrino flux. Future efforts should use multiple telescopes and
broad-bandwidth receivers.

X-ray Telescope on board the Swift satellite, on time scales from ~1 minute up
to weeks and in some cases months from the burst explosion. These data allow us
to investigate the physics of the highly relativistic fireball outflow and its
interaction with the circumburst environment. Here we review the main results
of the XRT observations, with particular regard to the evolution of the X-ray
light curves in the early phases. Unexpectedly, they are characterised by
different slopes, with a very steep decay in the first few hundred of seconds,
followed by a flatter decay and, a few thousand of seconds later, by a somewhat
steeper decay. Often strong flare activity up to few hours after the burst
explosion is also seen. These flares, most likely, are still related to the
central engine activity, that last much longer than expected and it is still
dominating the X-ray light curve well after the prompt phase, up to a few
thousand of seconds. The real afterglow emission (external shock) is dominating
the X-ray light curve only after the flatter phase ends. The flatter phase is
probably the combination of late-prompt emission and afterglow emission. When
the late-prompt emission ends the light curve steepens again. Some flare
activity can still be detected during these later phases. Finally, even the
late evolution of the XRT light curves is puzzling, in particular many of them
do not show a ``jet-break''. There are various possibilities to explain these
observations (e.g.time evolution of the microphysical parameters, structured
jet). However, a clear understanding of the formation and evolution of the jet
and of the afterglow emission is still lacking.

such signals are robust, changing in the M-star world atmospheric column by up
to 20% due to the GCR NOx effects compared to an M-star run without GCR effects
and can therefore survive at least the effects of galactic cosmic rays. We have
not however investigated stellar cosmic rays here. CH4 levels are about 10
times higher than on the Earth related to a lowering in hydroxyl (OH) in
response to changes in UV. The increase is less than reported in previous
studies. This difference arose partly because we used different biogenic input.
For example, we employed 23% lower CH4 fluxes compared to those studies. Unlike
on the Earth, relatively modest changes in these fluxes can lead to larger
changes in the concentrations of biomarker and related species on the M-star

of a sample of Low Mass X-Ray Binaries including both Z and atoll classes have
shown that bulk (dynamical) Comptonization of soft photons can be a possible
alternative mechanism for producing hard X-ray tails in such systems. We start
from the INTEGRAL results and we exploit the broad-band capability of BeppoSAX

develops into turbulence in our unstratified local model. Marginally coupled
solids (that couple to the gas on a Keplerian time-scale) trigger an upward
cascade to large particle clumps with peak overdensities above 100. The clumps
evolve dynamically by losing material downstream to the radial drift flow while
receiving recycled material from upstream. Smaller, more tightly coupled solids
produce weaker turbulence with more transient overdensities on smaller length
scales. The net inward radial drift is decreased for marginally coupled
particles, whereas the tightly coupled particles migrate faster in the
saturated turbulent state. The turbulent diffusion of solid particles, measured
by their random walk, depends strongly on their stopping time and on the
solids-to-gas ratio of the background state, but diffusion is generally modest,
particularly for tightly coupled solids. Angular momentum transport is too weak
and of the wrong sign to influence stellar accretion. Self-gravity and
collisions will be needed to determine the relevance of particle overdensities
for planetesimal formation.

the window of consistency with the WMAP3 and LSS data narrows for growing n.
New inflation models yield a good fit to the r and n_s data in a wide range of

mass-loss variations influence the spectral energy distribution (SED). To
constrain the variability, extra observations at millimetre wavelengths (1.2
mm) were acquired. From the analysis of the dust models, two indications for
the presence of mass-loss variations can be found, being (1) a dust temperature
at the inner boundary of the dust envelope that is far below the dust
condensation temperature and (2) an altered density distribution with respect
to rho(r) \propto r^{-2} resulting from a constant mass-loss rate. For 5 out of
the 18 studied sources a two-component model of the envelope is required,
consisting of an inner region with a constant mass-loss rate and an outer
region with a less steep density distribution. For one source an outer region
with a steeper density distribution was found. Moreover, in a search for time
variability in our data set at 1.2 mm, we found that WX Psc shows a large
relative time variation of 34% which might partially be caused by variable
molecular line emission.

plus embedded femtocell hotspots-- offer an economically viable solution to
achieving high cellular user capacity and improved coverage. With universal
frequency reuse and DS-CDMA transmission however, the ensuing cross-tier
cochannel interference (CCI) causes unacceptable outage probability. This paper
develops an uplink capacity analysis and interference avoidance strategy in
such a two-tier CDMA network. We evaluate a network-wide area spectral
efficiency metric called the \emph{operating contour (OC)} defined as the
feasible combinations of the average number of active macrocell users and
femtocell base stations (BS) per cell-site that satisfy a target outage
constraint. The capacity analysis provides an accurate characterization of the
uplink outage probability, accounting for power control, path-loss and
shadowing effects. Considering worst case CCI at a corner femtocell, results
reveal that interference avoidance through a time-hopped CDMA physical layer
and sectorized antennas allows about a 7x higher femtocell density, relative to
a split spectrum two-tier network with omnidirectional femtocell antennas. A
femtocell exclusion region and a tier selection based handoff policy offers

that for a large number of particles ($N \apgt 10^4$) modern graphics

the number of particles, comparable to that of the GRAPE. Using the same time

than to one in $10^6$ on the GPU, which is only about an order of magnitude
worse than obtained with GRAPE. For $N\apgt 10^6$ the GeForce 8800GTX was about
20 times faster than the host computer. Though still about an order of

in non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics. The short-distance parts of

the inclusive process $e^{+}e^{-}\to J/\psi+c\bar{c}$ the relativistic
correction is tiny and negligible. The physical reason for the above difference
between exclusive and inclusive processes largely lies in the fact that in the
exclusive process the relative momentum between quarks in charmonium
substantially reduces the virtuality of the gluon that converts into a charm
quark pair, but this is not the case for the inclusive process, in which the

inflation has real consequences in terms of the way that predictions are
extracted from theoretical models. The ambiguities in defining probabilities in
eternally inflating spacetimes are reviewed, with emphasis on the youngness
paradox that results from a synchronous gauge regularization technique.
Although inflation is generically eternal into the future, it is not eternal
into the past: it can be proven under reasonable assumptions that the inflating
region must be incomplete in past directions, so some physics other than
inflation is needed to describe the past boundary of the inflating region.

the explicitly solvable quantum linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) problem which

post-model-selection estimator where the conditioning is on the selected model.
The notion of a post-model-selection estimator here refers to the combined
procedure resulting from first selecting a model (e.g., by a model selection
criterion such as AIC or by a hypothesis testing procedure) and then estimating
the parameters in the selected model (e.g., by least-squares or maximum
likelihood), all based on the same data set. We show that it is impossible to
estimate this distribution with reasonable accuracy even asymptotically. In
particular, we show that no estimator for this distribution can be uniformly
consistent (not even locally). This follows as a corollary to (local) minimax
lower bounds on the performance of estimators for this distribution. Similar
impossibility results are also obtained for the conditional distribution of
linear functions (e.g., predictors) of the post-model-selection estimator.

oscillators. This system has attracted mathematical attention, in part because
of its applications in fields ranging from neuroscience to condensed-matter
physics, and also because it provides a beautiful connection between nonlinear
dynamics and statistical mechanics. The model consists of a large population of
phase oscillators with all-to-all sinusoidal coupling. The oscillators'
intrinsic frequencies are randomly distributed across the population according
to a prescribed probability density, here taken to be unimodal and symmetric
about its mean. As the coupling between the oscillators is increased, the
system spontaneously synchronizes: the oscillators near the center of the
frequency distribution lock their phases together and run at the same
frequency, while those in the tails remain unlocked and drift at different
frequencies. Although this ``partially locked'' state has been observed in
simulations for decades, its stability has never been analyzed mathematically.
Part of the difficulty is in formulating a reasonable infinite-N limit of the
model. Here we describe such a continuum limit, and prove that the
corresponding partially locked state is, in fact, neutrally stable, contrary to
what one might have expected. The possible implications of this result are
discussed.

Einstein, Langevin and others, turned out to be powerful theoretical tools for
quantitative analysis of models of these traffic-like collective phenomena as

(enzymes) during gene expression. Our rod model can simulate the nonlinear
dynamics of loop and supercoil formation in DNA on long length scales. The
formulation accounts for the structural stiffness of the DNA strand, its
intrinsic curvature, chiral (right-handed helical) construction and its
physical interactions with the surrounding medium. The simulations of
protein-mediated DNA looping illustrate how the mechanical properties of DNA
may affect the chemical kinetics of DNA-protein interactions and thereby

development. Formation of a sharp boundary between high and low expression
domains requires a genetic mechanism which is both sensitive and robust to
fluctuations, a demand that may not be easily achieved by morphogens alone.
Recently it has been demonstrated that small RNAs (and, in particular,
microRNAs) play many roles in embryonic development. While some RNAs are
essential for embryogenesis, others are limited to fine-tuning a predetermined
gene expression pattern. Here we explore the possibility that small RNAs
participate in sharpening a gene expression profile that was crudely
established by a morphogen. To this end we study a model where small RNAs
interact with a target gene and diffusively move from cell to cell. Though
diffusion generally smears spatial expression patterns, we find that
intercellular mobility of small RNAs is actually critical in sharpening the
interface between target expression domains in a robust manner. We discuss the
applicability of our results, as examples, to the case of leaf polarity
establishment in maize and Hox patterning in the early {\it Drosophila} embryo.
Our findings point out the functional significance of some mechanistic
properties, such as mobility of small RNAs and the irreversibility of their
interactions. These properties are yet to be established directly for most
classes of small RNAs. An indirect yet simple experimental test of the proposed
mechanism is suggested in some detail.

Path erasure techniques allow one to entangle multiple qubits by determining
only global properties of the qubits. Here, this powerful approach is extended
by demonstrating that even imperfect path erasure can produce the required
graph states with high efficiency. By characterizing the degree of error in
each path erasure attempt, one can subsume the resulting imperfect entanglement
into an extended graph state formalism. The subsequent growth of the improper
graph state can be guided, through a series of strategic decisions, in such a
way as to bound the growth of the error and eventually yield a high-fidelity
