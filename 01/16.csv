  detection","submitted to MNRAS, 26 pages",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12280.x",,"astro-ph",,"  Constraining cosmological parameters from measurements of the Integrated
Sachs-Wolfe effect requires developing robust and accurate methods for
computing statistical errors in the cross-correlation between maps. This paper
presents a detailed comparison of such error estimation applied to the case of
cross-correlation of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and large-scale
structure data. We compare theoretical models for error estimation with
montecarlo simulations where both the galaxy and the CMB maps vary around a
fiducial auto-correlation and cross-correlation model which agrees well with
the current concordance LCDM cosmology. Our analysis compares estimators both
in harmonic and configuration (or real) space, quantifies the accuracy of the
error analysis and discuss the impact of partial sky survey area and the choice
of input fiducial model on dark-energy constraints. We show that purely
analytic approaches yield accurate errors even in surveys that cover only 10%
of the sky and that parameter constraints strongly depend on the fiducial model
employed. Alternatively, we discuss the advantages and limitations of error
estimators that can be directly applied to data. In particular, we show that
errors and covariances from the Jack-Knife method agree well with the
theoretical approaches and simulations. We also introduce a novel method in
real space that is computationally efficient and can be applied to real data
and realistic survey geometries. Finally, we present a number of new findings
and prescriptions that can be useful for analysis of real data and forecasts,
and present a critical summary of the analyses done to date.

stars in which an anticorrelation of X-ray activity and rotation period has
been observed. We have used XMM-Newton's European Photon Imaging Cameras to
perform the most sensitive survey to date of X-ray emission (0.3-10 keV) from
young stars in Taurus-Auriga and investigate the dependences of X-ray activity
measures -- X-ray luminosity, Lx, its ratio with the stellar luminosity,
Lx/Lstar, and the surface-averaged X-ray flux, Fxs -- on rotation period. We
tested for differences in the distributions of Lx/Lstar of fast and slow
rotators, accretors and non-accretors, and compared the dependence of Lx/Lstar
on the ratio of the rotation period and the convective turnover timescale, the
Rossby number, with that of late-type main-sequence stars. We found significant
anticorrelations of Lx and Fxs with rotation period, but these could be
explained by the typically higher stellar luminosity and effective temperature
of fast-rotators in Taurus-Auriga and a near-linear dependence of Lx on Lstar.
We found no evidence for a dependence of Lx/Lstar on rotation period, but for
accretors to have lower Lx/Lstar than non-accretors at all rotation periods.
The Rossby numbers of accretors and non-accretors were found to be the same as
those of late-type main-sequence stars showing saturated X-ray emission. We
conclude that non-accreting T Tauri stars show X-ray activity entirely
consistent with the saturated activity of late-type main-sequence stars.
Accreting T Tauri stars show lower X-ray activity, which cannot be attributed
to their slower rotation.

show that early-type and late-type galaxies, from dwarfs to giants, trace
different yet approximately parallel TFRs. Surprisingly, early-type and
late-type galaxies trace a single yet curved sTFR over a range of 3.5 orders of
magnitude in stellar mass. Moreover, all galaxies trace a single, linear gsTFR,
over 3.5 orders of magnitude in HI gas+stellar mass. Dwarf ellipticals,
however, lie slightly below the gsTFR. This may indicate that early-type
dwarfs, contrary to the late-types, have lost their gas, e.g. by galactic winds

shaping these relations, making them a rather ``clean'' cosmological tool. LCDM
simulations predict roughly the correct slopes for these relations.

morphology and clustering properties. Three dE subclasses are shaped like thick
disks and show no central clustering: (1) dEs with disk features like spiral
arms or bars, (2) dEs with central star formation, and (3) ordinary, bright dEs
that have no or only a weak nucleus. These populations probably formed from
infalling progenitor galaxies. In contrast, ordinary nucleated dEs follow the
picture of classical dwarf elliptical galaxies in that they are spheroidal
objects and are centrally clustered like E and S0 galaxies, indicating that
they have resided in the cluster since a long time, or were formed along with
it. These results define a morphology-density relation within the dE class. We
find that the difference in the clustering properties of nucleated dEs and dEs
with no or only a weak nucleus is not caused by selection biases, as opposed to
previously reported suggestions. The correlation between surface brightness and
observed axial ratio favors oblate shapes for all subclasses, but our
derivation of intrinsic axial ratios indicates the presence of at least some
triaxiality. We discuss possible interrelations and formation mechanisms
(ram-pressure stripping, tidally induced star formation, harassment) of these

with simple steady state models of dust creation in red giant stars and

relatively hot dust is largely circumstellar. But fluxes at 70 and 160 microns
do not correlate with optical fluxes. Elliptical galaxies with similar L_B have
luminosities at 70 and 160 microns (L_70 and L_160) that vary over a factor ~
100, implying an additional source of dust unrelated to that produced by
ongoing local stellar mass loss. Neither L_70/L_B nor L_160/L_B correlate with
the stellar age or metallicity. Optical line fluxes from warm gas at T ~ 10^4 K
correlate weakly with L_70 and L_160, suggesting that the dust may be
responsible for cooling this gas. Many normal elliptical galaxies have emission
at 70 microns that is extended to 5-10 kpc. Extended far-infrared emission with
sputtering lifetimes of ~10^8 yrs is difficult to maintain by mergers with
gas-rich galaxies. Instead, we propose that this cold dust is buoyantly
transported from reservoirs of dust in the galactic cores which is supplied by
mass loss from stars in the core. Intermittent energy outbursts from AGNs can
drive the buoyant outflow.

are related through a simple transformation of the slow roll parameter $\eta$

case where the inflaton field is described by both branches simultaneously and
find that the mode equation can be solved exactly at all times. Even though the
slow roll parameter $\eta$ is evolving rapidly during the transition from the
transient solution to the late-time attractor solution, the resultant power
spectrum is an exact power-law spectrum. Such solutions may be useful for

relevant for Gamma Ray Bursts, and we demonstrate that, thanks to the AMR
strategy, we resolve the internal structure of the shocked shell-ISM matter,
which will leave its imprint on the GRB afterglow. We determine the
deceleration from an initial Lorentz factor $\gamma=100$ up to the almost
Newtonian $\gamma\sim{\cal O}(2)$ phase of the flow. We present axisymmetric 2D
shell evolutions, with the 2D extent characterized by their initial opening
angle. In such jetlike GRB models, we discuss the differences with the 1D
isotropic GRB equivalents. These are mainly due to thermally induced sideways
expansions of both the shocked shell and shocked ISM regions. We found that the
propagating 2D ultrarelativistic shell does not accrete all the surrounding
medium located within its initial opening angle. Part of this ISM matter gets
pushed away laterally and forms a wide bow-shock configuration with swirling
flow patterns trailing the thin shell. The resulting shell deceleration is
quite different from that found in isotropic GRB models. As long as the lateral
shell expansion is merely due to ballistic spreading of the shell, isotropic
and 2D models agree perfectly. As thermally induced expansions eventually lead
to significantly higher lateral speeds, the 2D shell interacts with comparably
more ISM matter and decelerates earlier than its isotropic counterpart.

predominately neutral atomic medium... Far-UV continuum fluorescence of H_2 is
not detected, but Lyman alpha (Lya) fluorescence is present. The diffuse
nebular medium is inhospitable to molecules and dust. Maintaining the modest
equilibrium abundance of H_2 (N(H_2)/N(HI) << 1) in the diffuse nebular medium
requires a source of H_2, mostly likely the clumpy nebular medium. The stellar
SED shows no signs of reddening (E(B-V) < 0.01), but paradoxically measurements
of Ha/Hb ... indicate E(B-V) ~ 0.1. ...the apparent enhancement of Ha/Hb in the
absence of dust may result from a two step process of H_2 ionization by Lyman
continuum (Lyc) photons followed by dissociative recombination (H_2 + gamma ->
H_2^+ + e -> H(1s) + H (nl)), which ultimately produces fluorescence of Ha and
Lya. In the optically thin limit at the inferred radius of the velocity
transition we find dissociation of H_2 by stellar Lyc photons is an order of
magnitude more efficient than spontaneous dissociation by far-UV photons. We
suggest that the importance of this H_2 destruction process in HII regions has
been overlooked.

gravitational radiation or magnetic multipolar radiation. We discuss the
arguments for and against the hypothesis that accretion induced collapse may
constitute the main route to the formation of the MSPs, pointing out that on
the AIC scenario the low magnetic fields of the MSPs may simply reflect the
field distribution in isolated magnetic white dwarfs which has recently been

detailed nucleosynthesis of a series of AGB models to estimate the surface
enrichment of Ge near the end of the AGB. A partial mixing zone of constant
mass is included at the deepest extent of each dredge-up episode, resulting in
the formation of a 13C pocket in the top ~1/10th of the He-rich intershell. All
of the models show surface increases of [Ge/Fe] less than about 0.5, except the
2.5Msun, Z=0.004 case which produced a factor of 6 enhancement of Ge. Near the
tip of the TP-AGB, a couple of extra TPs could occur to account for the
composition of the most Ge-enriched PNe. Uncertainties in the theoretical
modeling of AGB stellar evolution might account for larger Ge enhancements than
we predict here. Alternatively, a possible solution could be provided by the
occurrence of a late TP during the post-AGB phase. Difficulties related to
spectroscopic abundance estimates also need to be taken into consideration.
Further study is required to better assess how the model uncertainties affect
the predictions and, consequently, if a late TP should be invoked.

model proposed by Rees and Meszaros in 1994. Furthermore the Delta(t)/t ratio
and the decay-time to rise-time ratio have mean values that are in good
agreement with the values observed in the prompt emission pulses that are
believed to originate from internal shocks. The conclusion is that the flare
analysis favors the internal shock as due to shells that have been ejected by
the central engine after the prompt emission. The central engine seems to
remain active and capable of generating large amounts of energy also at later
times. More data are needed to establish whether or not some of the flares

  http://www.roe.ac.uk/~rji/ivison-sintra.pdf",,,,"astro-ph",,"  At a conference devoted to ever deeper surveys hunting for ever more distant
galaxies, I posed a question for which a concensus view has been difficult to
reach: `Is there evidence for, or can we rule out, a significant population of
dust-obscured starbursts at z > 3?' If, as seems likely, submm-selected
galaxies are proto-ellipticals, one of the biggest unanswered questions is
whether a significant fraction form at very high redshift - perhaps by the
collapse of single gas clouds - or whether the entire population forms over a
range of redshifts, primarily via merging. The latter scenario is favoured
strongly by existing data for the majority of bright submm galaxies - mergers
are common; typical spectroscopic redshifts are in the range 1 to 3. However,
our reliance on radio imaging to pinpoint submm galaxies leaves open the
possibility of a significant population of very distant, massive starbursts. To
rule out such a scenario requires a completely unbiased redshift distribution
for submm-selected galaxies and this is unlikely to be forthcoming using
conventional optical/infrared spectroscopic techniques. Here, I summarise
recent attempts to close that door, or pass through to an early Universe
inhabited by a significant population of collosal, dust-obscured starbursts. I
conclude that the door is only barely ajar; however, the idea of galaxies
forming, near instantaneously, on a collosal scale is not dead: I show an SMG
imaged by MERLIN+VLA for >1Ms - the deepest high-resolution radio image so far
obtained. The data reveal a galaxy-wide starburst covering >=10kpc. Thus
interpreting SMGs in terms of compact ULIRG-like events may not always be
appropriate, as one might expect when considering the Eddington limit for
>~1000M(sun)/yr starbursts.

Taylor-Couette differential rotation flows. For current-free magnetic fields a
nonaxisymmetric m=1 magnetorotational instability arises when the magnetic
Reynolds number exceeds O (100). We then consider how this `azimuthal
magnetorotational instability' (AMRI) is modified if the magnetic field is not
current-free, but also has an associated electric current throughout the fluid.
This gives rise to current-driven Tayler instabilities (TI) that exist even
without any differential rotation at all. The interaction of the AMRI and the
TI is then considered when both electric currents and differential rotation are
present simultaneously. The magnetic Prandtl number Pm turns out to be crucial
in this case. Large Pm have a destabilizing influence, and lead to a smooth
transition between the AMRI and the TI. In contrast, small Pm have a
stabilizing influence, with a broad stable zone separating the AMRI and the TI.
In this region the differential rotation is acting to stabilize the Tayler
instabilities, with possible astrophysical applications (Ap stars). The growth
rates of both the AMRI and the TI are largely independent of Pm, with the TI
acting on the timescale of a single rotation period, and the AMRI slightly
slower, but still on the basic rotational timescale. The azimuthal drift
timescale is ~20 rotations, and may thus be a (flip-flop) timescale of stellar
activity between the rotation period and the diffusion time.

of the two lobes. The small widths and velocity dispersion in the gas forming
the lobe walls confirm that the acceleration responsible for the nebular shape
could not last more than 100-120 yr. The present kinematics of the molecular
gas can be explained as the result of a single brief acceleration event, after
which the nebula reached an expansion velocity field with axial symmetry. In

This is a relatively low-power FR II radio galaxy, and so we expect, {\it a

from the hot spots. We detect X-ray emission coincident with the two knots of
polarized optical emission from the southern hot spot (SHS), as well as along
the northwest arm of this hot spot. We also detect X-ray emission from two
compact regions of the northern hot spot (NHS), as well as diffuse emission
behind the radio peak. The X-ray flux density of the region at the tip of the
southern hot spot, the most compact radio feature of the southern lobe, is
consistent with the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) process. The X-ray flux
densities of the other three regions of the SHS and the two compact regions of
the NHS are an order of magnitude or more above the predictions from either the
SSC and inverse-Compton scattering of the CMB (IC/CMB) mechanisms, thus
strongly disfavoring these scenarios unless they are far from equipartition
($B$ $\sim$4-14 times smaller than the equipartition values). The X-ray flux
from the diffuse region behind the NHS is consistent with the IC/CMB prediction
assuming a small departure from equipartition. We conclude that the X-ray
emission is synchrotron emission from multiple populations of ultrarelativistic
electrons unless these regions are far from equipartition. There must therefore
be unresolved substructure within each knot, similar to that which is found in
Chandra observations of nearby FR I jets such as Centaurus A and 3C 66B.

an analytic equation that couples E_|| to the transverse electric field of the
driving ion cyclotron wave. In this simplified model, the generated E_||
amplitude e.g. for plausible solar coronal parameters attains values of 90 V/m
for the mass ratio m_i/m_e=262, within a time corresponding to 3 periods of the
driving ion cyclotron wave. By considering the numerical solutions we also show
that the cause of E_|| generation is electron and ion flow separation (which is
not the same as electrostatic charge separation) induced by the transverse
density inhomogeneity. The model also correctly reproduces the previous kinetic
results in that only electrons are accelerated (along the background magnetic
field), while ions do not accelerate substantially. We also investigate how
E_|| generation is affected by the mass ratio and found that amplitude attained
by E_|| decreases linearly as inverse of the mass ratio m_i/m_e, i.e. E_||
\propto 1/m_i. This result contradicts to the earlier suggestion by Genot et al

the accretion model. These emission lines are emitted by material in the nebula
around the binary system that is being ionized by radiation from the hot
secondary star. The emission lines suffer three months long deep fading every
5.54 year, assumed to be the orbital period of the binary system. In the
accretion model, for ~70 day the less massive secondary star is accreting mass
from the primary wind instead of blowing its fast wind. The accretion event has
two effects that substantially reduce the high-energy ionizing radiation flux
from the secondary star. (1) The accreted mass absorbs a larger fraction of the
ionizing flux. (2) The accreted mass forms a temporarily blanked around the
secondary star that increases its effective radius, hence lowering its
effective temperature and the flux of high energy photons. This explanation is
compatible with the fading of the emission lines at the same time the X-ray is
declining to its minimum, and with the fading being less pronounced in the
polar directions.

silicon nanostructures using first-principles calculations for the first time.
In \{111\} and \{110\} biaxially strained Si, it is found that longitudinal
effective mass is extraordinarily enhanced for both thin films and crystals.
This mass enhancement is caused by the change of the band structure with double
minima into that with a single minimum due to strain and confinement. At the
transition point, it is analytically shown that the effective mass diverges.
The dependences of the confinement thickness on the anomalies are qualitatively
explained by an extension of the effective mass approximation.

  revised 29 March 2007 to improve readability",,,,"cs.LO cs.DM",,"  Basic results in combinatorial mathematics provide the foundation for a
theory and calculus for reasoning about sequential behavior. A key concept of
the theory is a generalization of Boolean implicant which deals with statements
of the form:
  A sequence of Boolean expressions alpha is an implicant of a set of sequences
of Boolean expressions A
  This notion of a generalized implicant takes on special significance when
each of the sequences in the set A describes a disallowed pattern of behavior.
That is because a disallowed sequence of Boolean expressions represents a
logical/temporal dependency, and because the implicants of a set of disallowed
Boolean sequences A are themselves disallowed and represent precisely those
dependencies that follow as a logical consequence from the dependencies
represented by A. The main result of the theory is a necessary and sufficient
condition for a sequence of Boolean expressions to be an implicant of a regular
set of sequences of Boolean expressions. This result is the foundation for two
new proof methods. Sequential resolution is a generalization of Boolean
resolution which allows new logical/temporal dependencies to be inferred from
existing dependencies. Normalization starts with a model (system) and a set of
logical/temporal dependencies and determines which of those dependencies are
satisfied by the model.

The X-channel has sparked recent interest in the context of cooperative
networks and it encompasses the interference, multiple access, and broadcast
channels as special cases. Here, we consider the case with partially
cooperative transmitters in which only partial and asymmetric side-information
is available at one of the transmitters. It is proved that when there are M
antennas at all four nodes, the sum-rate scales like 2Mlog(SNR) which is in
sharp contrast to [\lfloor 4M/3 \rfloor,4M/3]log(SNR) for non-cooperative
X-channels \cite{maddah-ali,jafar_degrees}. This further proves that, in terms
of sum-rate scaling at high SNR, partial side-information at one of the
transmitters and full side-information at both transmitters are equivalent in
the MIMO X-channel.

Fading is
assumed to be the dominant factor affecting the strength of the channels
between nodes. The objective is to analyze the achievable throughput of the
network when power allocation is allowed. By proposing a decentralized on-off
power allocation strategy, a lower bound on the achievable throughput is
obtained for a general fading model. In particular, under Rayleigh fading
conditions the achieved sum-rate is of order $\log n$, which is, by a constant
factor, larger than what is obtained with a centralized scheme in the work of
Gowaikar et al. Similar to most of previous works on large networks, the
proposed scheme assigns a vanishingly small rate for each link. However, it is
shown that by allowing the sum-rate to decrease by a factor $\alpha<1$, this
scheme is capable of providing non-zero rate-per-links of order $\Theta(1)$. To
obtain larger non-zero rate-per-links, the proposed scheme is modified to a
centralized version. It turns out that for the same number of active links the
centralized scheme achieves a much larger rate-per-link. Moreover, at large
values of rate-per-link, it achieves a sum-rate close to $\log n$, i.e., the
maximum achieved by the decentralized scheme.

broadcast requirements are fundamentally different and cannot be derived from

be efficient under realistic assumptions. In this paper, we study the
well-known multipoint relay protocol (MPR). In the latter, each node has to
choose a set of neighbors to act as relays in order to cover the whole 2-hop
neighborhood. We give experimental results showing that the original method
provided to select the set of relays does not give good results with the
realistic model. We also provide three new heuristics in replacement and their
performances which demonstrate that they better suit to the considered model.
The first one maximizes the probability of correct reception between the node
and the considered relays multiplied by their coverage in the 2-hop
neighborhood. The second one replaces the coverage by the average of the
probabilities of correct reception between the considered neighbor and the
2-hop neighbors it covers. Finally, the third heuristic keeps the same concept
as the second one, but tries to maximize the coverage level of the 2-hop
neighborhood: 2-hop neighbors are still being considered as uncovered while
their coverage level is not higher than a given coverage threshold, many
neighbors may thus be selected to cover the same 2-hop neighbors.

mass $\mu$, set in a circular geodesic orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole.
Our calculation is done in the Lorenz gauge: For given orbital radius, we first
solve directly for the Lorenz-gauge metric perturbation using numerical
evolution in the time domain; We then compute the (finite) back-reaction force
from each of the multipole modes of the perturbation; Finally, we apply the
``mode sum'' method to obtain the total, physical self force. The {\em
temporal} component of the self force (which is gauge invariant) describes the
dissipation of orbital energy through gravitational radiation. Our results for
this component are consistent, to within the computational accuracy, with the
total flux of gravitational-wave energy radiated to infinity and through the
event horizon. The {\em radial} component of the self force (which is gauge
dependent) is calculated here for the first time. It describes a conservative
shift in the orbital parameters away from their geodesic values. We thus obtain
the $O(\mu)$ correction to the specific energy and angular momentum parameters
(in the Lorenz gauge), as well as the $O(\mu)$ shift in the orbital frequency
(which is gauge invariant).

idea that we accidentally happen to live in an epoch where the CC contributes
an energy density value right in the ballpark of the rapidly diluting matter
density. It should perhaps be more plausible to conceive that the vacuum
energy, is actually a dynamical quantity as the Universe itself. More
generally, we could even entertain the possibility that the total DE is in fact
a mixture of vacuum energy and other dynamical components (e.g. fields, higher
order terms in the effective action etc) which can be represented collectively
by an effective entity X (dubbed the ``cosmon''). The ``cosmon'', therefore,
acts as a dynamical DE component different from the vacuum energy. While it can
actually behave phantom-like by itself, the overall DE fluid may effectively
appear as standard quintessence, or even mimic at present an almost exact CC
behavior. Thanks to the versatility of such cosmic fluid we can show that a
composite DE system of this sort (``LXCDM'') may have a key to resolving the

desirable feature to accommodate leptogenesis. We explore this possibility in

doublet Higgs scalars and also (b) by triplets. In both scenarios gauge
coupling unification requires the scale of left-right symmetry breaking ($M_R$)
to be close to the unification scale. This will entail unnaturally small
neutrino Yukawa couplings to avoid the gravitino problem and allow successful
leptogenesis. We point out that any one of three options -- threshold
corrections due to the mass spectrum near the unification scale, gravity
induced non-renormalizable operators near the Planck scale, or presence of
additional light Higgs multiplets -- can permit unification along with much
lower values of $M_R$ as required for leptogenesis. In the triplet model,
independent of these corrections, we find a lower bound on the intermediate
scale,
  $M_R > 10^9$ GeV, arising from the requirement that the theory must remain
perturbative at least upto the GUT scale. We show that in the doublet model
$M_R$ can even be in the TeV region which, apart from permitting resonant
leptogenesis, can be tested at LHC and ILC.

investigated basing on the polarization operator in the field. The total
probability of the process is found in a relatively simple form. The
probability exhibits a ""saw-tooth"" pattern because of divergences arising when
the electron and positron are created at threshold of the Landau energy levels.
The pattern will be washed out at averaging over any smooth photon energy
distribution. The new results are obtained in the scope of the quasiclassical
approach: 1) in the case when the magnetic field $B \ll B_0, (B_0$ is the
critical field) the new formulation extends the photon energy interval to the
case when the created particles are not ultrarelativistic; 2) the correction to
the standard quasiclassical approximation is found showing the range of
applicability of the approach at high photon energy as well. The very important
conclusion is that for both cases $B \ll B_0$ and $B \geq B_0$ the results of
the quasiclassical calculation are very close to averaged probabilities of
exact theory in a very wide range of photon energies. The quasiclassical
approximation is valid also for the energy distribution if the electron and
positron are created on enough high levels.

dimensional maximally supersymmetric plane wave background, a contraction of
AdS(5)xS(5) where tensionless strings are of great interest due to their
proposed relation to higher spin gauge theory via the AdS/CFT correspondence.
  For a sigma model, the amount of supersymmetry on its worldsheet restricts
the geometry of the target space. For N=(2,2) supersymmetry, for example, the
target space has to be bi-hermitian. Recently, with generalized complex
geometry, a new mathematical framework was developed that is especially suited
to discuss the target space geometry of sigma models in a Hamiltonian
formulation. Bi-hermitian geometry is so-called generalized Kaehler geometry
but the relation is involved. We discuss various amounts of supersymmetry in
phase space and show that this relation can be established by considering the
equivalence between the Hamilton and Lagrange formulation of the sigma model.
In the study of generalized supersymmetric sigma models, we find objects that
favor a geometrical interpretation beyond generalized complex geometry.

plasma waves in laser wakefield accelerators is studied both experimentally and
with particle-in-cell simulations. For short focal length ($w_0 < \lambda_p$)
interactions, beam break-up prevents stable propagation of the pulse. High
field gradients lead to non-localized phase injection of electrons, and thus
broad energy spread beams. However for long focal length geometries ($w_0 >
\lambda_p$), a single optical filament can capture the majority of the laser
energy, and self-guide over distances comparable to the dephasing length, even
for these short-pulses ($c\tau \approx \lambda_p$). This allows the wakefield
to evolve to the correct shape for the production of the monoenergetic electron
bunches, as measured in the experiment.

dopamine function which enhances input to D1 receptor units and attenuates
input to D2 receptor units. There is evidence that this model is unsatisfactory
because (a) there are not sufficient dopaminergic synapses to gate all input
and (b) dopamine's main effect is likely to be on the ion-channels contributing
to the neuron's membrane potential. Thus, an alternative output function-based
model of dopamine's effect is proposed which accounts for the dopamine-mediated
changes in ion-channel based currents. Simulation results show that the
selection and switching properties of the intrinsic and extended models are
retained with the new models. The parameter regimes under which this occurs
leads us to predict that an L-type Ca2+ current is likely to be the major
determinant of striatal neuron output if the basal ganglia is indeed an action
selection mechanism. In addition, the results provide evidence that increasing
dopamine can improve a neuron's signal-to-noise ratio.

simulable despite the fact that they generate highly entangled states; this is
the content of the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Here we isolate the ingredients of
the theorem and provide generalisations of some of them with the aim of
identifying new classes of simulable quantum computations. In the usual
construction, Clifford operations arise as projective normalisers of the first
and second tensor powers of the Pauli group. We consider replacing the Pauli
group by an arbitrary finite subgroup G of U(d). In particular we seek G such
that G tensor G has an entangling normaliser. Via a generalisation of the
Gottesman-Knill theorem the resulting normalisers lead to classes of quantum
circuits that can be classically efficiently simulated. For the qubit case d=2
we exhaustively treat all finite subgroups of U(2) and find that the only ones
(up to unitary equivalence and trivial phase extensions) with entangling
normalisers are the groups G_n generated by X and the n^th root of Z.
