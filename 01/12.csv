characterizing the growth of density perturbations in the linear regime

restricted to a very narrow range for models of dark energy obeying the laws of
general relativity but takes on distinctly different values in models of
beyond-Einstein gravity. In analogy to the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN)
formalism for testing gravity, we extend and motivate the gravitational growth

Some of them exhibit
properties quite different from the planets in our solar system and they have
eluded attempts to explain their formation. One such case is HD 149026 b. It
was discovered by Sato et al. (2005) . A transit-determined orbital inclination
results in a total mass of 114 earth masses. The unusually small radius can be
explained by a condensible element core with an inferred mass of 67 earth
masses for the best fitting theoretical model.
  In the core accretion model, giant planets are assumed to form around a
growing core of condensible materials. With increasing core mass, the amount of
gravitationally bound envelope mass increases. This continues up to the
so-called critical core mass -- the largest core allowing a hydrostatic
envelope. For larger cores, the lack of static solutions forces a dynamic
evolution of the protoplanet in the process accreting large amounts of gas or
ejecting the envelope. This would prevent the formation of HD 149026 b.
  By studying all possible hydrostatic equilibria we could show that HD 149026
b can remain hydrostatic up to the inferred heavy core. This is possible if it
is formed in-situ in a relatively low-pressure nebula. This formation process
is confirmed by fluid-dynamic calculations using the environmental conditions
as determined by the hydrostatic models.
  We present a quantitative in-situ formation scenario for the massive core
planet HD 149026 b. Furthermore we predict a wide range of possible core masses
for close-in planets like HD 149026 b. This is different from migration where
typical critical core masses should be expected.

in our sample, we use the color-color diagram of J - [3.6] vs. Ks - [4.5]. The
Spitzer images of our sample show that the groups around HAEBEs, spectral types
earlier than B8, are usually associated with bright infrared nebulosity. Within
this, there are normally 10 - 50 young stars distributed close to the HAEBEs
($<$ 1 pc). Not only are there young stars around the HAEBEs, there are also
young stellar populations throughout the whole cloud, some are distributed and
some are clumped. The groups around the HAEBEs are sub-structures of the large
young population within the molecular cloud. The sizes of groups are also
comparable with those sub-structures seen in massive clusters. Young stars in
groups around HAEBEs have generally larger SED slopes compared to those
outside, which suggests that the young stars in groups are probably younger
than the distributed systems. This might imply that there is usually a higher
and more continuous star forming rate in groups, that the formation of groups
initiates later, or that low mass stars in groups form slower than those
outside. Finally, there is no obvious trend between the SED slopes and the
distance to the HAEBEs for those young stars within the groups. This suggests
that the clustering of young stars dominates over the effect of massive stars
on the low-mass young stars at the scale of our study.

and back to closed again because, following the eruption, the moss reforms
around the active region in almost exactly its pre-event configuration. As a

densities of the order of $10^4$~cm$^{-3}$) mainly in atomic form; the grain

M_bulge^(0.54+-0.17)*sigma^(2.2+-0.5), similar to relations found

roughly as a tilted intrinsic correlation between BH mass and spheroid binding
energy, or the condition for feedback coupling to power a pressure-driven
outflow. While changes in halo circular velocity, merger orbital parameters,
progenitor disk redshifts and gas fractions, ISM gas pressurization, and other
parameters can drive changes in e.g. sigma at fixed M_bulge, and therefore
changes in the M_BH-sigma or M_BH-M_bulge relations, the BHFP is robust. Given
the empirical trend of decreasing R_e for a given M_bulge at high redshift, the
BHFP predicts that BHs will be more massive at fixed M_bulge, in good agreement
with recent observations. This evolution in the structural properties of merger
remnants, to smaller R_e and larger sigma (and therefore larger M_BH,
conserving the BHFP) at a given M_bulge, is driven by the fact that bulge
progenitors have characteristically larger gas fractions at high redshifts.
Adopting the observed evolution of disk gas fractions with redshift, our
simulations predict the observed trends in both R_e(M_bulge) and M_BH(M_bulge).

SEDs and images of the outflow cavities, we are able to model geometric

physical parameters. The opening angle may be an important indicator of the
evolutionary state of a source. We compare our results for Class 0 sources to
similar studies of Class I sources. There may be a transition phase from Class
0 to Class I when a source has an opening angle between 20$^o$ to 30$^o$. It is

transforms gravitational potential energy into kinetic energies of the baryonic

transformed eventually into internal thermal energy through shocks and viscous

assumed to occur instantaneously allowing an estimate of the gas temperature to
be derived from the the virial temperature defined from the embedding dark

halo grows. Mass accretion hence can be translated into a heating term. We
derive this heating rate from the extended Press Schechter formalism and
demonstrate its usefulness in semi-analytical models of galaxy formation. Our
method explicitly conserves energy unlike the previous impulsive heating

discussed utilizing a multi-wavelength data set. The very first signature of
pre-flare coronal activity is observed in radio wavelengths as type III burst
that occurred several minutes prior to the flare signature in H$\alpha$. This
type III is followed by the appearance of a looptop source in hard X-ray (HXR)
images obtained from RHESSI. During the main phase of the event, H$\alpha$
images observed from the solar tower telescope at ARIES, Nainital, reveal
well-defined footpoint (FP) and looptop (LT) sources. As the flare evolves, the
LT source moves upward and the separation between the two FP sources increases.
The co-alignment of H$\alpha$ with HXR images shows spatial correlation between
H$\alpha$ and HXR footpoints, while the rising LT source in HXR is always
located above the LT source seen in H$\alpha$. The evolution of LT and FP
sources is consistent with the reconnection models of solar flares. The EUV
images at 195 {\AA} taken by SOHO/EIT reveal intense emission on the disk at
the flaring region during the impulsive phase. Further, slow drifting type IV
bursts, observed at low coronal heights at two time intervals along the flare
period, indicate rising plasmoids or loop systems. The intense type II radio
burst at time in between these type IV bursts, but at a relatively larger
height indicates the onset of CME and its associated coronal shock wave. The
study supports the standard CSHKP model of flares, which is consistent with
nearly all eruptive flare models. More important, the results also contain
evidence for breakout reconnection before the flare phase.

we present a new framework that self-consistently unifies gravitational lensing
and stellar dynamics. This approach breaks some of classical degeneracies that
have limited their individual usage, in particular in the study of
high-redshift galaxies. The methodology is based on the premise that, for any
given galaxy potential, the mapping of both the unknown lensed source
brightness distribution and the stellar phase-space distribution function on to
the photometric and kinematic observables, can be cast as a single set of
coupled linear equations. This set of linear equations is solved, maximizing
the likelihood penalty function. The evidence penalty function, as derived from
Bayesian statistics, subsequently allows the best potential-model parameters to
be found and potential-model families, or other model assumptions (e.g. PSF),
to be quantitatively ranked. We have implemented a fast algorithm that solves
for the maximum-likelihood pixelized lensed source brightness distribution and
the two-integral stellar phase-space distribution function f(E, L_z), assuming
axisymmetric potentials. To make the method practical, we have devised a new
Monte-Carlo approach to Schwarzschild's orbital superposition method, based on
the superposition of two-integral (E and L_z) toroidal components, to find the
maximum-likelihood two-integral distribution function in a matter of seconds in

subsequently found through a hybrid MCMC and Simplex optimization of the

tachocline region, i.e. if the field is confined within the core. This
particular field geometry is shown to result from a shallow (<~1Mm) penetration
of the meridional flow existing in the convection zone into the radiative core.
I.e., two conditions are crucial for a magnetic tachocline theory: (i) the
presence of meridional flow of a few meters per second at the base of the
convection zone, and (ii) a magnetic diffusivity inside the tachocline smaller
than 10^8 cm^2s^-1. Numerical solutions for both confined poloidal fields and
the resulting tachocline structures are presented. We find that the tachocline
thickness runs as <I>B</I>_p^-1/2 with the poloidal field amplitude falling
below 5% of the solar radius for <I>B</I>^p > 5 mG. The resulting toroidal
field amplitude inside the tachocline of about 100 G does not depend on the

request for the evolution of the Universe after recombination to be close to
the evolution of the flat FRW model with cold dark matter and reasonable age of
the Universe defines the value of the coefficient $\beta$. Such a model
corresponding to the evolution of the Universe with the dynamical
$\Lambda$-term describes well enough the observational data.

currently known. The previous Chandra image shows twin giant X-ray cavities
(~200 kpc diameter) filled with radio emission and surrounded by a weak shock
front. XMM data are consistent with these findings. The total energy in
cavities and shock (~6 \times 10^{61} erg) is enough to quench the cooling flow
and, since most of the energy is deposited outside the cooling region (~100
kpc), to heat the gas within 1 Mpc by ~1/4 keV per particle. The cluster
exhibits an upward departure (factor ~2) from the mean L-T relation. The boost
in emissivity produced by the ICM compression in the bright shells due to the
cavity expansion may contribute to explain the high luminosity and high central
gas mass fraction that we measure. The scaled temperature and metallicity
profiles are in general agreement with those observed in relaxed clusters.
Also, the quantities we measure are consistent with the observed M-T relation.
We conclude that violent outbursts such as the one in MS0735+7421 do not cause
dramatic instantaneous departures from cluster scaling relations (other than
the L-T relation). However, if they are relatively common they may play a role
in creating the global cluster properties.

can likely be found at the pre-main sequence (PMS) evolutionary stage. With
this work, we perform the largest and most sensitive search for magnetic fields
in pre-main sequence Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars. Sixty-eight observations of 50
HAeBe stars have been obtained in circularly polarised light using the FORS1
spectropolarimeter at the ESO VLT. An analysis of both Balmer and metallic
lines reveals the possible presence of weak longitudinal magnetic fields in
photospheric lines of two HAeBe stars, HD 101412 and BF Ori. The intensity of
the longitudinal fields detected in HD 101412 and BF Ori suggest that they
correspond to globally-ordered magnetic fields with surface intensities of
order 1 kG. Monte Carlo simulations of the longitudinal field measurements of
the undetected stars allow us to place an upper limits of about 300 G on the
general presence of aligned magnetic dipole magnetic fields, and of about 500 G
on perpendicular dipole fields. We find that the observed bulk incidence of
magnetic HAeBe stars in our sample is 8-12%, in good agreement with that of
magnetic main sequence stars of similar masses. We also find that the rms
longitudinal field intensity of magnetically-detected HAeBe stars is similar to
that of Ap stars and consistent with magnetic flux conservation during stellar
evolution. These results are all in agreement with the hypothesis that the
magnetic fields of main sequence Ap/Bp stars are fossils, which already exist
within the stars at the pre-main sequence stage. Finally, we explore the
ability of our new magnetic data to constrain magnetospheric accretion in
Herbig Ae/Be stars.

considered in detail. The simplest examples possess m states per site (m\geq2),
with nearest-neighbor interactions with U(m) symmetry, under which the sites
transform alternately along the chain in the fundamental m and its conjugate
representation \bar{m}. We find that these spin chains, even with {\em
arbitrary} coefficients of these interactions, have a symmetry algebra A_m much
larger than U(m), which implies that the energy eigenstates fall into sectors
that for open chains (i.e., free boundary conditions) can be labeled by j=0, 1,
>..., L, for the 2L-site chain, such that the degeneracies of all eigenvalues
in the jth sector are generically the same and increase rapidly with j. For
large j, these degeneracies are much larger than those that would be expected
from the U(m) symmetry alone. The enlarged symmetry algebra A_m(2L) consists of
operators that commute in this space of states with the Temperley-Lieb algebra
that is generated by the set of nearest-neighbor interaction terms; A_m(2L) is
not a Yangian. There are similar results for supersymmetric chains with
gl(m+n|n) symmetry of nearest-neighbor interactions, and a richer
representation structure for closed chains (i.e., periodic boundary
conditions). The symmetries also apply to the loop models that can be obtained
from the spin chains in a spacetime or transfer matrix picture. In the loop
language, the symmetries arise because the loops cannot cross. We further
define tensor products of representations (for the open chains) by joining
chains end to end. The fusion rules for decomposing the tensor product of
representations labeled j_1 and j_2 take the same form as the Clebsch-Gordan
series for SU(2). This and other structures turn the symmetry algebra \cA_m
into a ribbon Hopf algebra, and we show that this is ``Morita equivalent'' to
the quantum group U_q(sl_2) for m=q+q^{-1}. The open-chain results are extended
to the cases |m|< 2 for which the algebras are no longer semisimple; these
possess continuum limits that are critical (conformal) field theories, or
massive perturbations thereof. Such models, for open and closed boundary
conditions, arise in connection with disordered fermions, percolation, and
polymers (self-avoiding walks), and certain non-linear sigma models, all in two
dimensions. A product operation is defined in a related way for the
Temperley-Lieb representations also, and the fusion rules for this are related
to those for A_m or U_q(sl_2) representations; this is useful for the continuum
limits also, as we discuss in a companion paper.

times is only apparent; it does not imply distinct mechanisms, but stems from
the intrinsic barrier distribution for $\alpha$-relaxation in supercooled

exceed four orders in magnitude, for known glassformers. We explain the origin
of the discrepancy between the stretching exponent $\beta$, as extracted from
$\epsilon(\omega)$ and the dielectric modulus data. The actual width of the
barrier distribution always grows with lowering the temperature. The contrary
is an artifact of the large contribution of the dc-conductivity component to
the modulus data. The methodology allows one to single out other contributions
to the conductivity, as in ``superionic'' liquids or when charge carriers are
delocalized, implying that in those systems, charge transfer does not require

expansion to access the phase diagram of the Bose-Einstein transition. The
dependence of the critical temperature on the interaction parameter is
calculated. This is discussed with the help of a new condition for
Bose-Einstein condensation in interacting systems which follows from the pole
of the T-matrix in the same way as from the divergence of the medium-dependent
scattering length. A many-body approximation consisting of screened ladder
diagrams is proposed which describes the Monte Carlo data more appropriately.
The specific results are that a non-selfconsistent T-matrix leads to a linear
coefficient in leading order of 4.7, the screened ladder approximation to 2.3,
and the selfconsistent T-matrix due to the effective mass to a coefficient of
1.3 close to the Monte Carlo data.

searchlight scheduling algorithms for multiple robotic agents in nonconvex
polygonal environments. A searchlight is a ray emitted by an agent which cannot
penetrate the boundary of the environment. A point is detected by a searchlight
if and only if the point is on the ray at some instant. Targets are points
which can move continuously with unbounded speed. The objective of the proposed
algorithms is for the agents to coordinate the slewing (rotation about a point)
of their searchlights in a distributed manner, i.e., using only local sensing
and limited communication, such that any target will necessarily be detected in
finite time. The first algorithm we develop, called the DOWSS (Distributed One
Way Sweep Strategy), is a distributed version of a known algorithm described
originally in 1990 by Sugihara et al \cite{KS-IS-MY:90}, but it can be very
slow in clearing the entire environment because only one searchlight may slew
at a time. In an effort to reduce the time to clear the environment, we develop
a second algorithm, called the PTSS (Parallel Tree Sweep Strategy), in which
searchlights sweep in parallel if guards are placed according to an environment
partition belonging to a class we call PTSS partitions. Finally, we discuss how
DOWSS and PTSS could be combined with with deployment, or extended to
environments with holes.

  figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  A common problem on sequential-type decoding is that at the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) below the one corresponding to the cutoff rate, the average
decoding complexity per information bit and the required stack size grow
rapidly with the information length. In order to alleviate the problem in the
maximum-likelihood sequential decoding algorithm (MLSDA), we propose to
directly eliminate the top path whose end node is $\Delta$-trellis-level prior
to the farthest one among all nodes that have been expanded thus far by the
sequential search. Following random coding argument, we analyze the
early-elimination window $\Delta$ that results in negligible performance
degradation for the MLSDA. Our analytical results indicate that the required
early elimination window for negligible performance degradation is just twice
of the constraint length for rate one-half convolutional codes. For rate
one-third convolutional codes, the required early-elimination window even
reduces to the constraint length. The suggestive theoretical level thresholds
almost coincide with the simulation results. As a consequence of the small
early-elimination window required for near maximum-likelihood performance, the
MLSDA with early-elimination modification rules out considerable computational
burdens, as well as memory requirement, by directly eliminating a big number of
the top paths, which makes the MLSDA with early elimination very suitable for
applications that dictate a low-complexity software implementation with near
maximum-likelihood performance.

Gu\'eron and Letelier [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{66}, 046611 (2002)] reported the
existence of chaotic behavior for the geodesics of the test particles orbiting
compact objects like black holes induced by specific values of the quadrupolar
deformation of the source using as models the Erez--Rosen solution and the Kerr
black hole deformed by an internal multipole term. In this work, we are
interesting in the study of the dynamic behavior of geodesics around
astrophysical objects with intrinsic quadrupolar deformation or nonisotropic
stresses, which induces nonvanishing quadrupolar deformation for the
nonrotating limit. For our purpose, we use the Tomimatsu-Sato spacetime [Phys.

obtained as the particular vacuum case of the five parametric solution of Manko
et al [Phys. Rev. D 62, 044048 (2000)], characterizing the geodesic dynamics
throughout the Poincar\'e sections method. In contrast to the results by
Gu\'eron and Letelier we find chaotic motion for oblate deformations instead of
prolate deformations. It opens the possibility that the particles forming the
accretion disk around a large variety of different astrophysical bodies
(nonprolate, e.g., neutron stars) could exhibit chaotic dynamics. We also
conjecture that the existence of an arbitrary deformation parameter is
necessary for the existence of chaotic dynamics.

functions on the 5d light cone. We introduce the corresponding five-dimensional

relativistic particle. The formalism is naturally subject to divergences and we
show that DSR arises as a natural regularization: the 5d light cone is
regularized as the de Sitter space. We interpret the fifth coordinate as the
particle's proper time while the fifth moment can be understood as the mass.
Finally, we show how to formulate the Feynman propagator and the Feynman

observables. This provides new insights for the construction of observables and

spin chains with supersymmetry algebras gl($n|n$) and gl($n+1|n$),

theories can also be viewed as vertex models, or as loop models. Their
continuum limits are boundary conformal field theories (CFTs) with central
charge $c=-2$ and $c=0$ respectively, and in the loop interpretation they
describe dense polymers and the boundaries of critical percolation clusters,
respectively. We also discuss the case of dilute (critical) polymers as another
boundary CFT with $c=0$. Within the supersymmetric formulations, these boundary
CFTs describe the fixed points of certain nonlinear sigma models that have a
supercoset space as the target manifold, and of Landau-Ginzburg field theories.
The submodule structures of indecomposable representations of the Virasoro

practical problems in quantum control--and vice versa, how an understanding of
these structures helps to tackle hot topics in quantum information.
  We start out with an overview on the role of C-numerical ranges in current
research problems in quantum theory: the quantum mechanical task of maximising
the projection of a point on the unitary orbit of an initial state onto a
target state C relates to the C-numerical radius of A via maximising the trace
function |\tr \{C^\dagger UAU^\dagger\}|. In quantum control of n qubits one
may be interested (i) in having U\in SU(2^n) for the entire dynamics, or (ii)
in restricting the dynamics to {\em local} operations on each qubit, i.e. to
the n-fold tensor product SU(2)\otimes SU(2)\otimes >...\otimes SU(2).
Interestingly, the latter then leads to a novel entity, the {\em local}
C-numerical range W_{\rm loc}(C,A), whose intricate geometry is neither
star-shaped nor simply connected in contrast to the conventional C-numerical
range. This is shown in the accompanying paper (math-ph/0702005).
  We present novel applications of the C-numerical range in quantum control
assisted by gradient flows on the local unitary group: (1) they serve as
powerful tools for deciding whether a quantum interaction can be inverted in
time (in a sense generalising Hahn's famous spin echo); (2) they allow for
optimising witnesses of quantum entanglement. We conclude by relating the
relative C-numerical range to problems of constrained quantum optimisation, for
which we also give Lagrange-type gradient flow algorithms.

version of the Henstock-Kurzweil integral, and a new Hilbert space that allows
us to construct the elementary path integral in the manner originally
envisioned by Feynman. After developing our time-ordered operator theory we
extend a few of the important theorems of semigroup theory, including the
Hille-Yosida theorem. As an application, we unify and extend the theory of
time-dependent parabolic and hyperbolic evolution equations. We then develop a
general perturbation theory and use it to prove that all theories generated by
semigroups are asympotic in the operator-valued sense of Poincare. This allows
us to provide a general theory for the interaction representation of
relativistic quantum theory. We then show that our theory can be reformulated
as a physically motivated sum over paths, and use this version to extend the
Feynman path integral to include more general interactions. Our approach is
independent of the space of continuous functions and thus makes the question of
the existence of a measure more of a natural expectation than a death blow to
the foundations for the Feynman integral.

accuracy. Increasing the accuracy of a simulation based on a Leray
regularization requires cutting the averaging radius, i.e., remeshing and
resolving on finer meshes. This report analyzes a family of Leray type models

the basic theory of the entire family including limiting behavior as the
averaging radius decreases to zero, (a simple extension of results known for
the Leray model). We also give a more technically interesting result on the

decreasing the averaging radius (or meshwidth) and high order models are doubly

C*-algebra A such that contains 1 and A=C*(S) is generated by S. A boundary
representation for S is an irreducible representation \pi of C*(S) on a Hilbert
space with the property that $\pi\restriction_S$ has a unique completely
positive extension to C*(S). The set $\partial_S$ of all (unitary equivalence
classes of) boundary representations is the noncommutative counterpart of the
Choquet boundary of a function system $S\subseteq C(X)$ that separates points
of X.
  It is known that the closure of the Choquet boundary of a function system S
is the Silov boundary of X relative to S. The corresponding noncommutative
problem of whether every operator system has ""sufficiently many"" boundary
representations was formulated in 1969, but has remained unsolved despite
progress on related issues. In particular, it was unknown if $\partial_S$ is
nonempty for generic S. In this paper we show that every separable operator
system has sufficiently many boundary representations. Our methods use
separability in an essential way.

computing nearly singular solutions of fluid dynamics equations. We consider
two different ways of removing the aliasing errors in a pseudo-spectral method.
The first one is the traditional 2/3 dealiasing rule. The second one is a high
(36th) order Fourier smoothing which keeps a significant portion of the Fourier
modes beyond the 2/3 cut-off point in the Fourier spectrum for the 2/3
dealiasing method. Both the 1D Burgers equation and the 3D incompressible Euler
equations are considered. We demonstrate that the pseudo-spectral method with
the high order Fourier smoothing gives a much better performance than the
pseudo-spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing rule. Moreover, we show that the
high order Fourier smoothing method captures about $12 \sim 15%$ more effective
Fourier modes in each dimension than the 2/3 dealiasing method. For the 3D
Euler equations, the gain in the effective Fourier codes for the high order
Fourier smoothing method can be as large as 20% over the 2/3 dealiasing method.
Another interesting observation is that the error produced by the high order
Fourier smoothing method is highly localized near the region where the solution
is most singular, while the 2/3 dealiasing method tends to produce oscillations
in the entire domain. The high order Fourier smoothing method is also found be
very stable dynamically. No high frequency instability has been observed.

  This requires introducing `disorientations' in the category of smoothings and
abstract cobordisms between them used in Bar-Natan's definition.
Disorientations have `seams' separating oppositely oriented regions, coming
with a preferred normal direction. The seams satisfy certain relations (just as
the underlying cobordisms satisfy relations such as the neck cutting relation).

organisms whose brains have a sufficiently integrated, complex ability for
associative learning and memory. Continual sensory input of information related
to the organism causes the organism's brain to learn the physical
characteristics of the organism, in the sense that neural pathways are produced
that are reinforced by, and therefore recognize, various features associated
with the organism. This results in the formation of a set of associations that
may be termed an organismal self-image, which provides a mechanistic basis for
the emergence of various behaviors that are associated with self-awareness,
such as self-recognition. In humans, self-awareness includes additional
behaviors such as recognition of self-awareness, the concept of I, and various
existential and religious questions. This paper shows how associative memory
and learning, combined with an organismal self-image and, in the case of
humans, language, leads to the emergence of these various behaviors. This paper
also discusses various tautologies that invariably emerge when discussing
self-awareness, that ultimately prevent an unambiguous resolution to the
various existential issues that arise. We continue with various speculations on
manipulating self-awareness, and discuss how concepts from set and logic may
provide a highly useful set of tools in computational neuroscience for
understanding the emergence of higher cognitive functions in complex organisms.
The existence of other types of awareness, and the role of mirror neurons in
the emergence of self-awareness, are also briefly discussed.

efficiencies of different `strategies', i.e. in what order should the
non-deterministic gates be applied, in order to maximize the size of the
resulting cluster states? In this paper we consider this issue in the context
of `large' cluster states. Specifically, we assume an unlimited resource of
qubits and ask what the steady state rate at which `large' clusters are
prepared from this resource is, given an entangling gate with particular
characteristics. We measure this rate in terms of the number of entangling gate
operations that are applied. Our approach works for a variety of different
entangling gate types, with arbitrary failure probability. Our results indicate
that strategies whereby one preferentially bonds together identical qubits are
considerably more efficient than those in which one does not. Additionally,
compared to earlier analytic results, our numerical study offers substantially
improved resource scaling.
