HST-ACS effective (half-light) radii for 36 lens galaxies from the Sloan Lens
ACS (SLACS) Survey to study the mass dependence of mass-dynamical structure in
early-type galaxies. We find that over a 180--390 km/s range in velocity
dispersion, structure is independent of lensing mass to within 5%. This result
suggests a systematic variation in the total (i.e., luminous plus dark matter)
mass-to-light ratio as the origin of the tilt of the fundamental plane (FP)
scaling relationship between galaxy size, velocity dispersion, and surface
brightness. We construct the FP of the lens sample, which we find to be
consistent with the FP of the parent SDSS early-type galaxy population, and
present the first observational correlation between mass-to-light ratio and
residuals about the FP. Finally, we re-formulate the FP in terms of surface
mass density rather than surface brightness. By removing the complexities of
stellar-population effects, this mass-plane formulation will facilitate
comparison to numerical simulations and possible use as a cosmological distance
indicator.

between the sites of optical and X-ray variability, and thereby to elucidate
the origins of X-ray production in PMS stars. In a previous paper we showed
that optical and X-ray variability in PMS stars are very rarely
time-correlated. Here, using time-averaged variability indicators to examine
the joint occurrences of optical and X-ray variability, we confirm that the two
forms of variability are not directly causally related. However, a strong and
highly statistically significant correlation is found between optical
variability and X-ray luminosity. As this correlation is found to be
independent of accretion activity, we argue that X-ray production in PMS stars
must instead be intimately connected with the presence and strength of
optically variable, magnetically active surface regions (i.e. spots) on these
stars. Moreover, because X-ray variability and optical variability are rarely
time-correlated, we conclude that the sites of X-ray production are not
exclusively co-spatial with these regions. We argue that solar-analog coronae,
heated by topologically complex fields, can explain these findings.

with a rather shallow slope of alpha=0.6. Our late R-band images reveal the
host galaxy with a rest-frame B-band luminosity corresponding to roughly 0.5
Lstar. The star-formation rate as determined from the [O II] emission line
luminosity is about 1.8 Msun per year. When accounting for the host
contribution, the slope is alpha=0.65+-0.01 and a break in the lightcurve is
also suggested. A potential lightcurve bump at 2 weeks can be interpreted as a
supernova only if this is a supernova with a fast rise and a fast decay.
However, the overall fit still show excess scatter in the lightcurve due to
wiggles and bumps. The flat lightcurves in the optical and X-rays could be
explained by a continuous energy injection scenario with an on-axis viewing
angle and a wide jet opening angle (theta_j>10 deg). If the energy injections
are episodic, this could potentially help explain the bumps and wiggles.
Spectroscopy of the afterglow give a redshift of z=0.828+-0.005 from both
absorption and emission lines. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of the
afterglow has a power-law shape with slope beta=0.56+-0.04. This can be
compared to the X-ray spectral index which is betaX=1.0+-0.1. The curvature of
the SED constrain the dust reddening towards the burst to Av<0.5 mag.

In this case we argue that the plasma heating will be primarily through

be important throughout a region considerably larger than that of the neutrino
annihilation process. In simple solutions a relatively gentle anisotropy in the
heating through this process can create an approximately conical sonic surface,
aligned with the system's axis. Inside this cone the fluid accelerates upwards

closely packed orbits spaced ~5 Hill radii apart. Such oligarchies are
ultimately unstable. Once the parent disk of planetesimals is sufficiently
depleted, oligarchs perturb one another onto crossing orbits. We explore both
the onset and the outcome of the instability through numerical integrations,
including dynamical friction cooling of planets by a planetesimal disk whose
properties are held fixed. To trigger instability and the ejection of the first
ice giant in systems having an original surface density in oligarchs of Sigma ~
1 g/cm^2, the disk surface density s must fall below 0.1 g/cm^2. Ejections are
predominantly by Jupiter and occur within 10 Myr. To eject more than 1 oligarch

to Jupiter and Saturn can readily yield solar-system-like outcomes in which 2
surviving ice giants lie inside 30 AU and have their orbits circularized by
dynamical friction. Our numerical simulations support the idea that planetary
systems begin in more crowded and compact configurations, like those of
shear-dominated oligarchies. In contrast to previous studies, we identify s <

function of the early-type galaxies (ETGs) in ~0.7 deg^2 in the COSMOS field.
In order to identify ALL progenitors of local ETGs we construct the sample of
high-z galaxies using two complementary criteria: (i) A morphological selection
based on the Zurich Estimator of Structural Types, and (ii) A photometric
selection based on the galaxy properties in the (U-V)-M_V color-magnitude
diagram. We furthermore constrain both samples so as to ensure that the
selected progenitors of ETGs are compatible with evolving into systems which
obey the mu_B-r_{hl} Kormendy relation. Assuming the luminosity evolution
derived from studies of the fundamental plane for high-z ETGs, our analysis
shows no evidence for a decrease in the number density of the most massive ETGs
out to z~ 0.7: Both the morphologically- and the photometrically-selected
sub-samples show no evolution in the number density of bright (~L>2.5L*) ETGs.
Allowing for different star formation histories, and cosmic variance, we
estimate a maximum decrease in the number density of massive galaxies at that
redshift of ~30%. We observe, however, in both the photometrical and
morphological samples, a deficit of up to ~2-3 of fainter ETGs over the same
cosmic period. Our results argue against a significant contribution of recent
dissipationless ``dry'' mergers to the formation of the most massive ETGs. We
suggest that the mass growth in low luminosity ETGs can be explained with a
conversion from z~0.7 to z=0 of blue, irregular and disk galaxies into low- and
intermediate-mass ``red'' ETGs, possibly also through gas rich mergers.

photometry. The first method, parameter space proximity (PSP), calculates the
distance of a single-line galaxy to galaxies of known redshift in (B-R), (R-I),
R, observed wavelength parameter space. The second method is an artificial
neural network (ANN). Prior information, such as allowable line widths and
ratios, rules out one or more of the four lines for some galaxies in both
methods. Based on analyses of evaluation sets, both methods are nearly perfect
at identifying blended [OII] doublets. Of the lines identified as Halpha in the

methods are not this accurate at discriminating between [OIII] and Hbeta, they

the identification of SHB host galaxies and measurement of their redshifts.
These observations established that SHBs are cosmological relativistic sources

and therefore constitute a distinct physical phenomenon. One viable model for
SHB origin is the coalescence of compact binary systems (double neutron stars
or a neutron star and a black hole), in which case SHBs are the electromagnetic
counterparts of strong gravitational-wave sources. The theoretical and
observational study of SHBs following the recent pivotal discoveries is
reviewed, along with new theoretical results that are presented here for the

disks. We represent the stars with collisionless particles and follow their
orbits using a PM method, and treat the gas as an isothermal, unmagnetized
fluid. The two components interact through a combined gravity. Using stellar
parameters typical of mid-disk conditions, we find that models with gaseous
Toomre parameter Q_g < Q_c ~ 1.4 experience gravitational runaway and
eventually form bound condensations. This Q_c value is nearly the same as
previously found for razor-thin, gas-only models, indicating that the
destabilizing effect of live stars is offsets the reduced self-gravity of thick
disks. This result is also consistent with empirical studies showing that star
formation is suppressed when Q_g > 1-2. The bound gaseous clouds that form have
mass 6x10^7 Msun each; these represent superclouds that would subsequently
fragment into GMCs. Self-gravity and sheared rotation also interact to drive
turbulence in the gas when Q_g > Q_c. This turbulence is anisotropic, with more
power in sheared than compressive motions. The gaseous velocity dispersion is ~
0.6 times the thermal speed when Q_g ~ Q_c. This suggests that gravity is
important in driving ISM turbulence in many spiral galaxies, since the low

takes place in stellar ensembles or clusters rather than in isolation. Bound,
long lived stellar groups are known as open clusters. They gradually lose stars
and in their final evolutionary stages they are severely disrupted leaving an
open cluster remnant made of a few stars. In this paper, we study in detail the
stellar content and kinematics of the poorly populated star cluster NGC1901.
This object appears projected against the Large Magellanic Cloud. The aim of
the present work is to derive the current evolutionary status, binary fraction,
age and mass of this stellar group. These are fundamental quantities to compare
with those from N-body models in order to study the most general topic of star
cluster evolution and dissolution.The analysis is performed using wide-field
photometry in the UBVI pass-band, proper motions from the UCAC.2 catalog, and 3
epochs of high resolution spectroscopy, as well as results from extensive
N-body calculations.The star group NGC1901 is found to be an ensemble of solar
metallicity stars, 400+/-100 Myr old, with a core radius of 0.23 pc, a tidal
radius of 1.0 pc, and located at 400+/-50 pc from the Sun. Out of 13 confirmed
members, only 5 single stars have been found. Its estimated present-day binary
fraction is at least 62%. The calculated heliocentric space motion of the
cluster is not compatible with possible membership in the Hyades stream.Our
results show that NGC1901 is a clear prototype of open cluster remnant
characterized by a large value of the binary fraction and a significant
depletion of low-mass stars. In the light of numerical simulations, this is
compatible with NGC1901 being what remains of a larger system initially made of
500-750 stars.

successfully resolved the major structures, i.e., the nuclear starburst region,
bar, and inner spiral arms in CO(J=3-2) emission at a resolution of 22'' (or
480 pc), showing a good spatial coincidence between CO(J=3-2) and 6 cm

molecular gas and the massive stars are enhanced when compared with other disk
regions, whereas there is no excess of R_3-2/1-0 and SFE in that region. This
means that a simple summation of the star forming regions at the bar-end and
the disk cannot reproduce the nuclear starburst of M 83, implying that the
spatial variation of the dense gas fraction traced by R_3-2/1-0 governs the

have been responsible for the transport of all metals that end up in the
intergalactic medium (IGM). When the clouds reach pressure equilibrium with the
general, photo-ionized IGM, the metals will still be concentrated in small
high-metallicity patches, but they will look like ordinary, low-metallicity

the SFR. When compared to the overall galaxy population, they have colors much
bluer than the high-mass star-forming galaxy population. Although their SFRs
span a range of values, the specific rates of the numerical counterparts are

rate (SFR) and quantities known to reflect the star formation history of

The far-infrared properties of dust are based on large-scale 100um and 200um
maps. Extinction through the cloud has been derived by using the star count
method at B- and I-bands, and color excess method at J, H and Ks bands.
Radiative transfer calculations have been used to study the effects of
increasing absorption cross-section on the far-infrared emission and dust
temperature. Dust emissivity, measured by the ratio of far-infrared optical
depth to visual extinction, tau(far-IR)/A(V), increases with decreasing dust
temperature in L1642. There is about two-fold increase of emissivity over the
dust temperature range of 19K-14K. Radiative transfer calculations show that in
order to explain the observed decrease of dust temperature towards the centre
of L1642 an increase of absorption cross-section of dust at far-IR is
necessary.This temperature decrease cannot be explained solely by the
attenuation of interstellar radiation field. Increased absorption cross-section
manifests itself also as an increased emissivity. We find that, due to
temperature effects, the apparent value of optical depth tau(far-IR), derived

additional constraint on the donor star, by assuming the mass transfer is
driven by the stellar nuclear evolution. We find that in general the donors are

growing group of Be stars with X-ray properties similar to gamma Cas. These
stars exhibit hard-thermal X-ray emissions (kT ~> 7 keV) that are variable on
all measurable timescales. In this work we present X-ray spectral and timing
properties of HD 110432 from three XMM-Newton observations in addition to new
optical spectroscopic observations. Its X-ray spectrum, complex and timing
dependent, is well described in each observation by three thermal plasmas with
temperatures ranging between 0.4-0.7, 3-6, and 21-37 keV. Thus, HD 110432 has
the hottest thermal plasma of any known Be star. A sub-solar iron abundance (~
0.3-0.5 x ZFe_sun) is derived for the hottest plasma. The star has a moderate
0.2-12 keV luminosity of ~ 5 x 10^32 erg/s. Recurrent flare-like events on time
scales as short as ~ 10 seconds are superimposed over a slowly ~ 5-10 x 10^3
seconds varying basal flux, followed by similarly rapid hardness variabilities.
There is no evidence for coherent oscillations, and an upper limit of ~ 2.5% is
derived on the pulsed fraction for short pulsations from 0.005 to 2.5 Hz. In
the optical region the strong and quasi-symmetrical profile of the Halpha line
(EW \~ -60 Angs.) as well as the detection of several metallic lines in
emission strongly suggest a dense and/or large circumstellar disk. HD 110432
has several properties reminiscence of the cataclysmic variables such as a very
hot X-ray temperature and its detailed spectral features. This suggests that it
might be a Be star harbouring an accreting white dwarf. On the other hand,
accumulating evidence of magnetic activities in the literature supports the
surface-disk of the star as being the X-ray site.

M4 I (December 2005) and back to K0-1 I (September 2006). An archival spectrum
from the Very Large Telescope reveals that the star was even cooler (M4.5-M5 I)
in December 2001. By contrast, the star was observed to be an M0 I in both
October 1978 and October 1979. The M4-5 I spectral types is by far the latest
type seen for an SMC supergiant, and its temperature in that state places it
well beyond the Hayashi limit into a region of the H-R diagram where the star
should not be in hydrostatic equilibrium. The star is variable by nearly 2 mag
in V, but essentially constant in K. Our modeling of its spectral energy
distribution shows that the visual extinction has varied during this time, but
that the star has remained essentially constant in bolometric luminosity. We
suggest that the star is currently undergoing a period of intense instability,
with its effective temperature changing from 4300 K to 3300 K on the time-scale
of months. It has one of the highest 12-micron fluxes of any RSG in the SMC,
and we suggest that the variability at V is due primarily to changes in
effective temperature, and secondly, due to changes in the local extinction due
to creation and dissipation of circumstellar dust. We speculate that the star
may be nearing the end of its life.

not valid anymore due to strong temporal correlations between the iterates.

that a similar phenomenon should be observed in the compensated

originates from the long-range magnetoelastic forces is analogous to
demagnetization energy in ferromagnetic materials and is responsible for the
formation of equilibrium domain structure and anisotropy of macroscopic
magnetic properties. In particular, crystal shape may be a source of additional
uniaxial magnetic anisotropy which removes degeneracy of antiferromagnetic
vector or artificial 4th order anisotropy in the case of a square cross-section
sample. In a special case of antiferromagnetic nanopillars shape-induced
anisotropy can be substantially enhanced due to lattice mismatch with the
substrate. These effects can be detected by the magnetic rotational torque and
antiferromagnetic resonance measurements.

order, which breaks both time reversal symmetry and translational symmetry; the
""superfluid"" (ferromagnetic) phase with an in-plane global U(1) symmetry
broken, when $J_{xy} < 0$; the $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ order when $J_{xy} >
0$; the nematic phase when $D < 0$ and large; and a phase with resonating
dimers on each hexagon. We obtain all of these phases and partial information
about their quantum phase transitions in a single framework by studying
condensation of defects in the six-fold plaquette phases. The transition
between nematic phase and the six-fold degenerate plaquette phase is
potentially an unconventional second-order critical point. In the case of a
nonzero magnetic field along $\hat{z}$, another ordered phase with translation
symmetry broken is opened up in the nematic phase. Due to the breaking of
time-reversal symmetry by the field, a supersolid phase emerges between the
six-fold plaquette order and the superfluid phase. This phase diagram might be
accessible in nickel compounds, BF$_4$ salts, or optical lattices of atoms with
three degenerate states on every site.

point of algebra and logic. Since the work of Buchi, regular languages have
been classified according to their descriptive complexity, i.e. the type of
logical formalism required to define them. The algebraic point of view on
automata is an essential complement of this classification: by providing
alternative, algebraic characterizations for the classes, it often yields the
only opportunity for the design of algorithms that decide expressibility in
some logical fragment.
  We survey the existing results relating the expressibility of regular
languages in logical fragments of MSO[S] with algebraic properties of their
minimal automata. In particular, we show that many of the best known results in
this area share the same underlying mechanics and rely on a very strong
relation between logical substitutions and block-products of pseudovarieties of
monoid. We also explain the impact of these connections on circuit complexity
theory.

  Cross-Tab, and Sub-Totals",,"Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 1(1): 29-53 (1997)",,,"cs.DB",,"  Data analysis applications typically aggregate data across many dimensions
looking for anomalies or unusual patterns. The SQL aggregate functions and the
GROUP BY operator produce zero-dimensional or one-dimensional aggregates.
Applications need the N-dimensional generalization of these operators. This
paper defines that operator, called the data cube or simply cube. The cube
operator generalizes the histogram, cross-tabulation, roll-up, drill-down, and
sub-total constructs found in most report writers. The novelty is that cubes
are relations. Consequently, the cube operator can be imbedded in more complex
non-procedural data analysis programs. The cube operator treats each of the N
aggregation attributes as a dimension of N-space. The aggregate of a particular
set of attribute values is a point in this space. The set of points forms an
N-dimensional cube. Super-aggregates are computed by aggregating the N-cube to
lower dimensional spaces. This paper (1) explains the cube and roll-up
operators, (2) shows how they fit in SQL, (3) explains how users can define new
aggregate functions for cubes, and (4) discusses efficient techniques to
compute the cube. Many of these features are being added to the SQL Standard.

queued transaction processing as an advance over pure client-server transaction

general than direct transaction processing. Queued systems are built on top of
direct systems. You cannot build a direct system atop a queued system. It is
difficult to build direct, conversational, or distributed transactions atop a
queued system. Queues are interesting databases with interesting concurrency
control. It is best to build these mechanisms into a standard database system
so other applications can use these interesting features. Queue systems need
DBMS functionality. Queues need security, configuration, performance
monitoring, recovery, and reorganization utilities. Database systems already
have these features. A full-function MOM system duplicates these database
features. Queue managers are simple TP-monitors managing server pools driven by
queues. Database systems are encompassing many server pool features as they

For Schur-convex objectives, the optimal design results in data streams with

the optimal DFE design results in linear equalization and the optimal THP

edge - when the object was near the edge of the observational field. This
classification and a spatial library to represent and manipulate observational

that are qualitatively different from those of phenomenological studies. In
particular, geometric scaling around the saturation scale is only obtained at
asymptotic rapidities. We find that in this limit, the anomalous dimension
\gamma(r,x) of phenomenological models approaches a limiting function that is
universal for a large range of initial conditions. At the saturation scale,
this function equals approximately 0.44, in contrast to the value 0.628
commonly used in the models. We further investigate the dependence of these
results on the starting distribution, the small-r limit of the anomalous
dimension for fixed rapidities and the x-dependence of the saturation scale.

regime, small-scale inflaton fluctuations are strongly coupled to metric
perturbations in the bulk and gravitational back-reaction has a dramatic effect
on the behaviour of inflaton perturbations on sub-horizon scales. This is in
contrast to the standard four-dimensional result where gravitational
back-reaction can be neglected on small scales. Nevertheless, this does not
give rise to significant particle production, and the correction to the power
spectrum of the curvature perturbations on super-horizon scales is shown to be
suppressed by a slow-roll parameter. We calculate the complete first order
slow-roll corrections to the spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations.

each E8 via a Spin(16)/Z2 subgroup, typically realized as a current algebra by

Spin(16)/Z2 gauge fields are directly realizable in standard constructions.
However, there exist perturbatively consistent E8 gauge fields which can not be
reduced to Spin(16)/Z2, and so cannot be described within standard heterotic
worldsheet constructions. A natural question to then ask is whether there
exists any (0,2) SCFT that can describe such E8 gauge fields. To answer this
question, we first show how each ten-dimensional E8 partition function can be
built up using other subgroups than Spin(16)/Z2, then construct ``fibered WZW
models'' which allow us to explicitly couple current algebras for general
groups and general levels to heterotic strings. This technology gives us a very
general approach to handling heterotic compactifications with arbitrary

among others, (1+d)-dimensional models of pinning of directed polymers on a

varying the average of the reward, the system undergoes a transition from a
localized phase where \tau occupies a finite fraction of N to a delocalized
phase where the density of \tau vanishes. In absence of disorder the transition
is of first order for \alpha>1 and of higher order for \alpha<1. Moreover, for
\alpha ranging from 1 to 0, the transition ranges from first to infinite order.
Presence of even an arbitrarily small amount of disorder is known to modify the
order of transition as soon as \alpha>1/2. In physical terms, disorder is
relevant in this situation, in agreement with the heuristic Harris criterion.
On the other hand, for 0<\alpha<1/2 it has been proven recently by K. Alexander
that, if disorder is sufficiently weak, critical exponents are not modified by
randomness: disorder is irrelevant. In this work, generalizing techniques which
in the framework of spin glasses are known as replica coupling and
interpolation, we give a new, simpler proof of the main results of [2].

analogous ""local to global convexity"" theorem when the inclusion map of X to

  We say that a map from a topological space to R^n is convex if every two

is a weakly monotone parametrization of a straight line segment. Let X be a
connected Hausdorff topological space, let T be a convex subset of R^n, and let
Psi: X \to T be a continuous proper map. Suppose that every point in X is
contained in an open set U such that the map Psi|_U: U \to Psi(U) is convex and
open. Then the map Psi: X \to \Psi(X) is convex and open. Consequently, its
image is convex and its level sets are connected.

relationship with oscillating tableaux is obtained. More specifically, the
paths being considered have fixed start and end points on respectively the
lower and right boundaries of a rectangle in the square lattice, each path can
take only unit steps rightwards or upwards, and two different paths are
permitted to share lattice points, but not to cross or share lattice edges.
Such paths correspond to configurations of the six-vertex model of statistical
mechanics with appropriate boundary conditions, and they include cases which
correspond to alternating sign matrices and various subclasses thereof.
Referring to points of the rectangle through which no or two paths pass as
vacancies or osculations respectively, the case of primary interest is tuples
of paths with a fixed number $l$ of vacancies and osculations. It is then shown
that there exist natural bijections which map each such path tuple $P$ to a
pair $(t,\eta)$, where $\eta$ is an oscillating tableau of length $l$ (i.e., a
sequence of $l+1$ partitions, starting with the empty partition, in which the
Young diagrams of successive partitions differ by a single square), and $t$ is
a certain, compatible sequence of $l$ weakly increasing positive integers.
Furthermore, each vacancy or osculation of $P$ corresponds to a partition in
$\eta$ whose Young diagram is obtained from that of its predecessor by
respectively the addition or deletion of a square. These bijections lead to
enumeration formulae for osculating paths involving sums over oscillating
tableaux.

"math/0701762","Hongbo Li","Hongbo Li","A Recipe for Symbolic Geometric Computing: Long Geometric Product,
  BREEFS and Clifford Factorization",,,,,"math.MG",,"  In symbolic computing, a major bottleneck is middle expression swell.
Symbolic geometric computing based on invariant algebras can alleviate this
difficulty. For example, the size of projective geometric computing based on
bracket algebra can often be restrained to two terms, using final polynomials,
area method, Cayley expansion, etc. This is the ""binomial"" feature of
projective geometric computing in the language of bracket algebra.
  In this paper we report a stunning discovery in Euclidean geometric
computing: the term preservation phenomenon. Input an expression in the
language of Null Bracket Algebra (NBA), by the recipe we are to propose in this
paper, the computing procedure can often be controlled to within the same
number of terms as the input, through to the end. In particular, the
conclusions of most Euclidean geometric theorems can be expressed by monomials
in NBA, and the expression size in the proving procedure can often be
controlled to within one term! Euclidean geometric computing can now be
announced as having a ""monomial"" feature in the language of NBA.
  The recipe is composed of three parts: use long geometric product to
represent and compute multiplicatively, use ""BREEFS"" to control the expression
size locally, and use Clifford factorization for term reduction and transition
from algebra to geometry.
  By the time this paper is being written, the recipe has been tested by 70+
examples from \cite{chou}, among which 30+ have monomial proofs. Among those
outside the scope, the famous Miquel's five-circle theorem \cite{chou2}, whose
analytic proof is straightforward but very difficult symbolic computing, is
discovered to have a 3-termed elegant proof with the recipe.

roots in this ring, provided d-th roots of coefficients can be taken in k. This
was proved true in a preceding paper of the second author; in this article we
generalize this result to more general equations, monic in Y, where the former

ratio around 30 A GeV in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is discussed in the
framework of the Statistical Model. In this model, the freeze-out of an ideal
hadron gas changes from a situation where baryons dominate to one with mainly
mesons. This transition occurs at a temperature T = 140 MeV and baryon chemical
potential mu(B) = 410 MeV corresponding to an energy of sqrt(s) = 8.2 GeV. The
calculated maximum in the K+/pi+ ratio is, however, much less pronounced than
the one observed by the NA49 Collaboration. The smooth increase of the K-/pi-
ratio with incident energy and the shape of the excitation functions of the
Lambda/pi+, Xi-/pi+ and Omega/pi ratios all exhibiting maxima at different
incident energies, is consistent with the presently available experimental
data. The measured K+/pi+ ratio exceeds the calculated one just at the incident
energy when the freeze-out condition is changing.
  We speculate that at this point freeze-out might occur in a modified way. We
discuss a scenario of an early freeze-out which indeed increases K+/pi+ ratio
while most other particle ratios remain essentially unchanged. Such an early
freeze-out is supported by results from HBT studies.

using a beam of atoms with random arrival times, which acts as a reservoir for
the field. The scheme is based on four-wave mixing processes leading to
emission into two cavity modes, which are resonant with the Rabi sidebands of
the atomic dipole transition, driven by a saturating classical field. At steady
state the cavity modes are in an Einstein-Podolski-Rosen (EPR) state, whose
degree of entanglement is controlled by the intensity and the frequency of the
transverse field. This scheme is robust against stochastic fluctuations in the
atomic beam, does not require atomic detection nor velocity selection, and can
be realized by presently available experimental setups with microwave
resonators.

A (2007) Inpress","10.1016/j.physleta.2007.01.031",,"quant-ph",,"  A clear physical meaning of the Carruthers-Nieto symmetric quantum phase
fluctuation parameter (U) has been provided in Susskind Glogower and Barnett
Pegg formalism of quantum phase and it is shown that the reduction of phase
fluctuation parameter U with respect to its coherent state value corresponds to
an antibunched state. Thus nonclassicality of a state may be manifested through
the phase fluctuation parameters. As examples, quantum phase fluctuations in
different optical processes, such as four wave mixing, six wave mixing and
second harmonic generation have been studied by using Carruthers-Nieto quantum
phase fluctuation parameters. The operators required for the calculation of
quantum phase fluctuations are expressed in closed analytical forms (up to
second order in coupling constant). It is also found that the reduction of
phase fluctuations compared to their initial values are possible in all three
cases which means nonclassical (antibunched) state exists in all these cases.

creation operators of a multi-mode boson system are discussed. The modes are
assumed to be coupled since otherwise the problem of normal ordering is reduced
to the corresponding problem of the single-mode case. To describe the normal
ordering in the multi-mode case for each mode a colour is introduced and
coloured contractions are considered. A depiction for coloured contractions via
coloured linear representations is given. In analogy to the single-mode case
associated coloured Stirling numbers are defined as coefficients appearing in
the process of normal ordering powers of the number operators. Several
properties of these coloured Stirling numbers are discussed.

harmonic oscillator on the classical histories phase space, comparing and
contrasting the Q, P and Wigner representations; we conclude that a
representation based on coherent states is the most appropriate. Second, we
demonstrate a generic method for implementing a perturbative approach for
interacting theories in the histories formalism, using the quartic anharmonic
oscillator. We make use of the identification of the closed-time path (CTP)
generating functional with the decoherence functional to develop a perturbative
expansion for the latter up to second order in the coupling constant. We
consider both configuration space and phase space histories.

were introduced by Ambainis and Watrous. Though this computing model is more
restricted than the usual {\it two-way quantum finite automata} (2qfa's) first
proposed by Kondacs and Watrous, it is still more powerful than the classical
counterpart. In this note, we focus on dealing with the operation properties of
2qcfa's. We prove that the Boolean operations (intersection, union, and
complement) and the reversal operation of the class of languages recognized by
2qcfa's with error probabilities are closed; as well, we verify that the
catenation operation of such class of languages is closed under certain
restricted condition. The numbers of states of these 2qcfa's for the above
operations are presented. Some examples are included, and $\{xx^{R}|x\in
\{a,b\}^{*},#_{x}(a)=#_{x}(b)\}$ is shown to be recognized by 2qcfa with
one-sided error probability, where $x^{R}$ is the reversal of $x$, and
$#_{x}(a)$ denotes the $a$'s number in string $x$.

explore the possibilities of geometrical formulations of quantum mechanics
beyond the quantum state space and Kahler manifold. The metric of quantum
states in the classical configuration space with the pseudo-Riemannian
signature and its possible applications are explored. On contrary to the common
perception that a metric for quantum state can yield a natural metric in the
configuration space with the limit when Planck constant vanishes, we obtain the
metric of quantum states in the configuration space without imposing this
limiting condition. Here, Planck constant is absorbed in the quantity like Bohr
radii. While exploring the metric structure associated with Hydrogen like atom,
we witness another interesting finding that the invariant lengths appear in the
multiple of Bohr radii.
