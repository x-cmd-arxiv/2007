probe of dark-energy and gravity on the largest physical scales. We introduce a
novel estimator, the CMB-velocity correlation, that has most of his power on
large scales and that, at low redshift, delivers up to factor of two higher
signal-to-noise ratio than the recently detected CMB-dark matter density
correlation expected from the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We propose to use
a combination of peculiar velocities measured from supernovae type Ia and
kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich cluster surveys to reveal this signal and forecast
dark-energy constraints that can be achieved with future surveys. We stress
that low redshift peculiar velocity measurements should be exploited with
complementary deeper large-scale structure surveys for precision cosmology.

regulated by the dark halo gravity and regulated the growth of the central
supermassive black hole. Assuming the angular momentum is low, we suggest that
bulges form in a runaway collapse due to the ""gravothermal"" instability once
the central gas density or pressure exceeds certain threshold (Xu & Zhao 2007).
We emphasize that the threshold is nearly universal, set by the background NFW
dark matter gravity $g_{DM} \sim 1.2 \times 10^{-8}{\rm cm} {\rm sec}^{-2}$ in
the central cusps of halos. Unlike known thresholds for gradual formation of
galaxy disks, we show that the universal ""halo-regulated"" star formation
threshold for spheroids matches the very high star formation rate and star
formation efficiency shown in high-redshift observations of central starburst
regions. The starburst feedback also builds up a pressure shortly after the
collapse. This large pressure could both act outward to halt further infall of
gas from larger scale, and act inward to counter the Compton-thick wind
launched from the central black hole in an Eddington accretion. Assuming the
feedback balancing inward and outward forces, our scenario naturally gives rise
to the black hole-bulge relationships observed in the local universe.

Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and singular-isothermal-sphere profiles to constrain
the total mass. The projected mass distribution shows a pronounced asymmetry,
with an elongated structure extending from the SE to the NW. This is in general
agreement with the optical distribution previously found by other authors. A
similar elongation was previously detected in the X-ray emission map, and in
the distribution of galaxy colours. The circular NFW mass profile fit gives a
total mass of M_{200} = 7.7^{+4.3}_{-2.7} 10^{14} solar masses inside the

passing through the envelope amplifies magnetosonic disturbances, with growth
rates in our local numerical radiation MHD calculations that are consistent

scale height grow by more than two orders of magnitude in a thousand years,
reaching non-linear amplitudes within the envelope lifetime. If the magnetic
pressure in the envelope exceeds the gas pressure, the instability develops
into trains of propagating shocks. Radiation escapes readily through the
low-density material between the shocks, enabling accretion to continue despite
the Eddington limit imposed by the dust opacity. The supersonic motions arising
from the photon bubble instability can help explain the large velocity
dispersions of hot molecular cores, while conditions in the shocked gas are
suitable for maser emission. We conclude that the photon bubble instability may
play a key role in the formation of massive stars.

(inner disk) and a gap around r=0.6"" in the both images. Thermal emission of
the eastern side is much brighter than that of the western side in the MIR. We
estimate the dust size as a few micron from the observed color of the extended
emission and the distance from the star. The dust temperature T and the optical
depth tau of the MIR emitting dust are also derived from the two images as
T=82+/-1K, tau=0.052+/-0.001 for the eastern side and T=85+/-3K,

in the eatern side is exposed directly to us. The proposed model can
successfully account for the MIR observations as well as near-infrared (NIR)

much larger diversity than those of Galactic sources, a fact we attribute to
the diversity of their masses. When we take into account this effect and
combine our results with those from Cyg X-1, it seems reasonable to conclude
that, at high frequencies, the slope of the Fourier-resolved spectra in
accreting black hole systems decreases with increasing frequency as
proportional to f^{-0.25}, irrespective of whether the system is in its High or
Low state. This result implies that the flux variations in AGN are accompanied
by complex spectral slope variations as well. We also find that the Fe Ka line
in Mrk 766, NGC 3783 and NGC 4051 is variable on time scales ~day - 1 hour. The
iron fluorescence line is absent in the spectra of the highest frequencies,and

compact accretor at rates lower than in wider X-ray binaries. This may be
understood by the smaller accretion disks in UCXBs: a lower X-ray luminosity
suffices to keep a disk completely ionized through irradiation and, thus, keep
the viscosity at a sufficiently high level to allow effective transport of
matter to the compact object. We employ this distinguishing factor on data from
RXTE and BeppoSAX to identify six new candidate UCXBs, thus increasing the
population by one quarter. The candidates are drawn from the population of
persistently accreting and type-I X-ray bursting low-mass X-ray binaries. The
X-ray bursts establish the low-mass X-ray binary nature and provide a handle on
the accretion rate. We find that the low accretion rates are supported by the
long burst recurrence times and the hard X-ray spectra of the persistent

discuss the peculiar light curves of some new UCXB candidates.

behaviour of the X-ray light curve and propose a classification scheme for GRBs
based on this behaviour. As found for previous smaller samples, the earliest
X-ray light curve can be well described by an exponential which relaxes into a
power law, often with flares superimposed. The later emission is well fit using
a similar functional form and we find that these two functions provide a good
description of the entire X-ray light curve. For the prompt emission, the
transition time between the exponential and the power law gives a well-defined
timescale, T_p, for the burst duration. We use T_p, the spectral index of the
prompt emission, beta_p, and the prompt power law decay index, alpha_p to
define four classes of burst: short, slow, fast and soft. Bursts with slowly
declining emission have spectral and temporal properties similar to the short
bursts despite having longer durations. Some of these GRBs may therefore arise
from similar progenitors including several types of binary system. Short bursts
tend to decline more gradually than longer duration bursts and hence emit a
significant fraction of their total energy at times greater than T_p. This may
be due to differences in the environment or the progenitor for long, fast
bursts.

stars binaries allows us to calculate the position and size of the flares. This
information cannot be derived by analyzing the decay of the flares, a
frequently used approach in the literature that requires the assumption of a
physical model. We make use of the eclipsing light curve to constrain the set
of possible solutions, from the geometrical point of view, in two flares of
Algol, and one flare in VW Cep. We make use of a technique developed with the
system SV Cam (i~90 deg) and generalize it to binary systems with arbitrary
inclination. The method simulates all possible geometrical situations that can
produce the times of the four contacts of the eclipse. As an approximation we
assume that the emitting region has a spherical shape that remains unchanged
during the eclipse. We however show that this is a good approximation for the
problem. The solutions observed indicate that in two of the three cases the
flare cannot be polar (lat<55 deg) and in a third one the flare can be placed
either near the pole or at other latitudes. The emitting regions must have a
small size (0.002-0.5 R_*), but if interpreted as the apex of coronal loops,
their length could actually be up to 3.1 R_* for one of the Algol flares. These
measurements imply a lower limit to the electron density in the emitting region
between log n_e(cm^-3) 10.4 and 14.0, and a magnetic field between 70 and 3500
G. Similar results are found if the emitting region is assumed to be
loop-shaped.

(including Compton-thick ones). We obtain mid-infrared spectroscopic redshifts
for all nine sources detected with IRS. For three of them the redshifts were
previously unknown. The median value of the redshift distribution is z~2.8 if
we assume that the four IRS non-detections are at high redshift. The median for
the IRS detections alone is z~2.7. Placing the IRS non-detections at similar
redshift would require rest frame mid-IR obscuration larger than is seen in
local ULIRGs. The rest frame mid-infrared spectra and mid- to far-infrared
spectral energy distributions are consistent with those of local ultraluminous
infrared galaxies, but scaled-up further in luminosity. The mid-infrared
spectra support the scenario that submillimeter galaxies are sites of extreme
star formation, rather than X-ray-obscured AGN, and represent a critical phase
in the formation of massive galaxies.

ram-pressure stripping and galactic winds of cluster galaxies, on the chemical
enrichment of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). We combine N-body and
hydrodynamic simulations with a semi-numerical galaxy formation model. By
including simultaneously different enrichment processes, namely ram-pressure
stripping and galactic winds, in galaxy-cluster simulations, we are able to
reproduce the observed metal distribution in the ICM. We find that the mass
loss by galactic winds in the redshift regime z>2 is ~10% to 20% of the total
galactic wind mass loss, whereas the mass loss by ram-pressure stripping in the
same epoch is up to 5% of the total ram-pressure stripping mass loss over the
whole simulation time. In the cluster formation epochs z<2 ram-pressure
stripping becomes more dominant than galactic winds. We discuss the
non-correlation between the evolution of the mean metallicity of galaxy
clusters and the galactic mass losses. For comparison with observations we
present two dimensional maps of the ICM quantities and radial metallicity
profiles. The shape of the observed profiles is well reproduced by the
simulations in the case of merging systems. In the case of cool-core clusters
the slope of the observed profiles are reproduced by the simulation at radii
below ~300 kpc, whereas at larger radii the observed profiles are shallower. We
confirm the inhomogeneous metal distribution in the ICM found in observations.
To study the robustness of our results, we investigate two different
descriptions for the enrichment process interaction.

observations performed with MOIRCS at the Subaru Telescope. The correlation
amplitude strongly depends on the K-band flux, color, and stellar mass of the
galaxies. We find that K-band luminous galaxies have a larger correlation
length than K-band faint galaxies. For color selected samples at 2<z<4, distant
red galaxies with J-K>1.3 show a large bias of b~7.2+-1.3 on scales up to
\theta~100"" or 3.1 comoving Mpc, while blue galaxies with 0.5<J-K<1.3, in which
most Lyman break galaxies are populated, have a weak clustering signal on large
scales, but a possible strong small scale excess at \theta<10"". For massive
galaxies with M_*>~10^{10} Msun, we estimate a correlation length and bias to
be r_0~4.5 h^{-1} Mpc and b=1.9-3.5, which are much larger than those of low
mass (M_*~10^9-10^{10} Msun) galaxies. The comparison of our measurements with
analytic CDM models constrains the properties of hosting dark halos, and
indicates that the low mass galaxies would be progenitors of galaxies with a
typical luminosity of L<~L_* in the local Universe. The blue galaxies in low
mass samples are more strongly clustered in more massive halos with higher
occupation numbers than low mass red galaxies. This fact suggests an
environment effect due to the halo mass on star formation activity at high-z.

formation in spiral galaxies by including a multi-phase medium. The addition of
a hot phase of gas enhances the structure in the cold gas, and significantly
increases the fraction of molecular hydrogen that is formed when the cold gas
passes through a spiral shock. The difference in structure is reflected in the
mass power spectrum of the molecular clouds, which is steeper for the
multi-phase calculations. The increase in molecular gas occurs as the addition
of a hot phase leads to higher densities in the cold gas. In particular, cold
gas is confined in clumps between the spiral arms and retains a higher
molecular fraction. Unlike the single phase results, molecular clouds are
present in the inter-arm regions for the multi-phase medium. However the
density of the inter-arm molecular hydrogen is generally below that which can
be reliably determined from CO measurements. We therefore predict that for a
multi-phase medium, there will be low density clouds containing cold atomic and
molecular hydrogen, which are potentially entering the spiral arms.

their usefulness as a probe of physical conditions in PSCs. Methods. We have
developed a non-LTE (NLTE) Monte-Carlo code treating the 1D radiative transfer

coefficients with He between individual hyperfine levels. The code includes
line overlap between hyperfine transitions. An extensive set of core models is

thermalized with dust, ii) depletion of N2H+ does occur, starting at densities
5-7E5 cm&#8722;3 and reaching a factor of 6 (+13/&#8722;3) in abundance, iii)
deuterium fractionation reaches &#8764;70% at the core center, and iv) the

soft cut-off power law and a hard power law. No improvement of the fit is
achieved if one replaces the soft cut-off power law by either a blackbody, or a
disk reflection model. During the observation period the source has reached the
historically softest state in the hard X-ray domain with a photon index
$\Gamma=1.82\pm 0.01$. Comparing our data with available archived X-ray data
from previous years, we find a secular evolution of the source toward softer
X-ray emission (the photon index has increased by $\Delta\Gamma\simeq 0.3-0.4$

shows a large intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) which is compatible
with typical experimental values in ferromagnets [100-1000 [1/\Omega cm]],
without necessity to assume a special band structure at the Fermi level. In
good metals where resistivity \rho is small, the intrinsic AHC is constant
(dissipation-less) as found by Karplus and Luttinger. In bad metals, however,
we find that the AHC is proportional to \rho^{-2} when \hbar/2\tau is larger

different to those of the traditional devices. Currently, two types of
molecules are being studied for potential application in nanostorage. One is
molecular electronic elements including molecular wires, rectifiers, switches,

nanotubes, nanowires, and nanoparticles. The challenges for nanostorage are not
only the materials, ultrahigh data-densities, fabrication-costs, device
operating temperatures and large-scale integration, but also the development of
the physical principles and models. There are already some breakthroughs
obtained, but it is still unclear what kind of nanostorage systems can
ultimately replace the current silicon based transistors. A promising candidate
may be a molecular-nanostructure hybrid device with sub-5 nm dimensions.

parallel magnetic field is presented. A spin-orbital interaction of the Rashba
type is known to produce at a high magnetic field $h$ (and in the absence of
impurities) an inhomogeneous superconductive phase similar to the
Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrel (LOFF) state with an order parameter $\Delta(r)
\propto \cos(Qr)$. We consider the case of a strong Rashba interaction with the
spin-orbital splitting much larger than the superconductive gap $\Delta$, and
show that at low temperatures $T\leq 0.4 T_{c0}$ the LOFF-type state is
separated from the usual homogeneous state by a first-order phase transition
line. At higher temperatures another inhomogeneous state with $\Delta(r)
\propto \exp(i Qr)$ intervenes between the uniform BCS state and the LOFF-like
state at $g\mu_B h \approx 1.5 T_{c0}$. The modulation vector $Q$ in both
phases is of the order of $g\mu_B h/v_F$. The superfluid density $n_s^{yy}$
vanishes in the region around the second-order transition line between the BCS
state and the new ``helical'' state. Non-magnetic impurities suppress both
inhomogeneous states, and eliminate them completely at $T_{c0}\tau \leq 0.11$.
However, once an account is made of the next-order term over the small
parameter $\alpha/v_F \ll 1$, a relatively long-wave helical modulation with $Q
\sim g\mu_B h\alpha/v_F^2$ is found to develop from the BCS state. This
long-wave modulation is stable with respect to disorder. In addition, we
predict that unusual vortex defects with a continuous core exist near the phase
boundary between the helical and the LOFF-like states. In particular, in the
LOFF-like state these defects may carry a half-integer flux.

structure with a simple numeric parameter called AsymRatio, ranging between 0
and 1. We run experiments in 10 benchmark domains from the International
Planning Competitions since 2000; we show that AsymRatio is a good indicator of
SAT solver performance in 8 of these domains. We then examine carefully crafted
synthetic planning domains that allow control of the amount of structure, and
that are clean enough for a rigorous analysis of the combinatorial search
space. The domains are parameterized by size, and by the amount of structure.
The CNFs we examine are unsatisfiable, encoding one planning step less than the
length of the optimal plan. We prove upper and lower bounds on the size of the
best possible DPLL refutations, under different settings of the amount of
structure, as a function of size. We also identify the best possible sets of
branching variables (backdoors). With minimum AsymRatio, we prove exponential
lower bounds, and identify minimal backdoors of size linear in the number of
variables. With maximum AsymRatio, we identify logarithmic DPLL refutations

that involve rounded as well as exact operators. Gappa generates a theorem with
its proof for each bound treated. The proof can be checked with a higher order
logic automatic proof checker, either Coq or HOL Light, and we have developed a
large companion library of verified facts for Coq dealing with the addition,
multiplication, division, and square root, in fixed- and floating-point
arithmetics. Gappa uses multiple-precision dyadic fractions for the endpoints
of intervals and performs forward error analysis on rounded operators when
necessary. When asked, Gappa reports the best bounds it is able to reach for a
given expression in a given context. This feature is used to quickly obtain
coarse bounds. It can also be used to identify where the set of facts and
automatic techniques implemented in Gappa becomes insufficient. Gappa handles
seamlessly additional properties expressed as interval properties or rewriting
rules in order to establish more intricate bounds. Recent work showed that
Gappa is perfectly suited to the proof of correctness of small pieces of
software. Proof obligations can be written by designers, produced by
third-party tools or obtained by overloading arithmetic operators.

the relativistic physical vacuum medium as the ground state of the background
field is a super fluid medium, and the rest mass of a relativistic particle is
like the energy gap of a quasi-particle. This conjecture is strongly supported
by the results of our following investigation: a particle moving through the
vacuum medium at a speed less than the speed of light in vacuum, though
interacting with the vacuum medium, never feels friction force and thus
undergoes a frictionless and inertial motion. The profound and intrinsic
relationship between the super fluid property of the relativistic physical
vacuum medium and the energy-momentum conservation law as well as the

the concept of a fundamental spin-2 field. A linear spin-2 field encounters
insurmountable inconsistencies when coupled to gravity. After discussing the
inconsistencies of any coupling of the linear spin-2 field to gravity, I
exhibit the origin of the fact that a gauge invariant field has the variational
metric stress tensor which is gauge dependent. I give a general theorem
explaining under what conditions a symmetry of a field Lagrangian becomes also
the symmetry of the stress tensor. It is a conclusion of the theorem that any
attempt to define gravitational energy density in the framework of a field
theory of gravity must fail. Finally I make a very brief introduction to basic
concepts of how a certain kind of a necessarily nonlinear spin-2 field arises
in a natural way from vacuum higher derivative gravity theories. This specific

probability of moving from state $i$ to state $j\neq i$ at time $n$ is
$G(i,j)/n^\zeta$ for a ``generator'' matrix $G$ and strength parameter
$\zeta>0$. In these chains, as time grows, the positions are less and less
likely to change, and so form simple models of age-dependent time-reinforcing
behaviors. These chains, however, exhibit some different, perhaps unexpected,
asymptotic occupation laws depending on parameters.
  Although on the one hand it is shown that the asymptotic position converges
to a point-mixture for all $\zeta>0$, on the other hand, the average position,
when variously $0<\zeta<1$, $\zeta>1$ or $\zeta=1$, is shown to converges to a
constant, a point-mixture, or a distribution $\mu_G$ with no atoms and full
support on a certain simplex respectively. The last type of limit can be seen
as a sort of ``spreading'' between the cases $0<\zeta<1$ and $\zeta>1$.
  In particular, when $G$ is appropriately chosen, $\mu_G$ is a Dirichlet
distribution with certain parameters, reminiscent of results in Polya urns.

the problem of finding the optimal boundary becomes a non-linear optimization

  Prisoner's Dilemma","Submitted to EPL",,"10.1016/j.physleta.2007.09.044",,"physics.soc-ph",,"  We study the evolutionary Prisoner's Dilemma game on scale-free networks for
different initial distributions. We consider three types of initial
distributions for cooperators and defectors: initially random distribution with
different frequencies of defectors; intentional organization with defectors
initially occupying the most connected nodes with different fractions of
defectors; intentional assignment for cooperators occupying the most connected
nodes with different proportions of defectors at the beginning. It is shown
that initial configurations for cooperators and defectors can influence the
stationary level of cooperation and the evolution speed of cooperation.
Organizations with the vertices with highest connectivity representing
individuals cooperators could exhibit the most robust cooperation and drive
evolutionary process to converge fastest to the high steady cooperation in the
three situations of initial distributions. Otherwise, we determine the critical
initial frequencies of defectors above which the extinction of cooperators
occurs for the respective initial distributions, and find that the presence of
network loops and clusters for cooperators can favor the emergence of
cooperation.

Min-proteins in vivo are not known. It has therefore been difficult to compare
the models quantitatively with experiments. Here, we present in vivo
measurements of the mobility of MinD and MinE using fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy. Two distinct time-scales are clearly visible in the correlation
curves. While the faster time-scale can be attributed to cytoplasmic diffusion,
the slower time-scale could result from diffusion of membrane-bound proteins or
from protein exchange between the cytoplasm and the membrane. We determine the
diffusion constant of cytoplasmic MinD to be approximately 16\mu^{2}/s, while
for MinE we find about 10\mu^{2}/s, independently of the processes responsible
for the slower time-scale. Implications of the measured values for the

Persistent activity arises for a small fraction of `short-cuts', while a
transition to failure occurs at a critical value of the `short-cut' density.
The persistent activity consists of multi-stable periodic attractors, the
number of which is at least on the order of the number of neurons in the
network. For long enough delays, network activity at high `short-cut' densities
is shown to exhibit exceedingly long chaotic transients whose failure-times
averaged over many network configurations follow a stretched exponential. We
show how this functional form arises in the ensemble-averaged activity if each

partitionings of the corresponding Pauli graph are embodied in the geometry of
the generalized quadrangle of order two. Here, one identifies the operators
with the points of the quadrangle and groups of maximally commuting subsets of
the operators with the lines of the quadrangle. The three basic partitionings
are (a) a pencil of lines and a cube, (b) a Mermin's array and a bipartite-part
and (c) a maximum independent set and the Petersen graph. These factorizations
stem naturally from the existence of three distinct geometric hyperplanes of
the quadrangle, namely a set of points collinear with a given point, a grid and
an ovoid, which answer to three distinguished subsets of the Pauli graph,
namely a set of six operators commuting with a given one, a Mermin's square,
and set of five mutually non-commuting operators, respectively. The generalized
Pauli graph for multiple qubits is found to follow from symplectic polar spaces
of order two, where maximal totally isotropic subspaces stand for maximal
subsets of mutually commuting operators. The substructure of the (strongly
regular) N-qubit Pauli graph is shown to be pseudo-geometric, i. e., isomorphic
to a graph of a partial geometry. Finally, the (not strongly regular) Pauli
graph of a two-qutrit system is introduced; here it turns out more convenient
to deal with its dual in order to see all the parallels with the two-qubit case
and its surmised relation with the generalized quadrangle Q(4, 3), the dual
