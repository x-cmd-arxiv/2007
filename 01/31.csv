  Of vital importance is the study of cyclotron lines as they provide the only

cyclotron lines which are extremely stable with time and with pulse phase, in

the mass density of the Universe and the power spectrum of mass clustering.
However, the 2dF QSO survey suggested that a strong anticorrelation effect at
g<21 was seen for both galaxies and clusters which implied that galaxies are
anti-biased (b~0.1) on small scales at a higher level than predicted by the
standard cosmology (Myers et al., 2003, 2005) whereas results from SDSS
suggested that the effect was much smaller (b~0.6) and in line with standard
expectations (Scranton et al., 2005). We first cross-correlate the SDSS
photo-z, g<21, 1.0<z_p<2.2 QSOs with g<21 galaxies and clusters in the same
areas. These results are somewhat less negative than the results based on the
2QZ QSOs found by Myers et al. But contamination of the QSOs by low-z NELGs and
QSOs can cause underestimation of the anticorrelation lensing signal. When a
correction is applied to the photo-z QSO sample of Scranton et al. the
anticorrelation increases and the agreement with the results of Myers et al. is
improved. When we also take into account the fainter r<21 galaxy limit of
Scranton et al. as opposed to g<21 for Myers et al., the two observational
results appear to be in very good agreement. This therefore leaves open the
question of why the theoretical interpretations are so different for these
analyses. We note that the results of Guimaraes, Myers & Shanks based on mock
catalogues from the LCDM Hubble Volume strongly suggest that QSO lensing at the
levels detected by both Myers et al. and now Scranton et al. is incompatible
with a galaxy bias of b~1 in the standard cosmological model. If the QSO
lensing results are correct then the consequences for cosmology may be
significant (see Shanks 2006).

short loops. As a consequence we predict that the scaling of the heating rate
with axial magnetic field intensity $B_0$, which depends on the spectral index
of total energy for given loop parameters, must vary from $B_0^{3/2}$ for weak

There is now general agreement that SGRBs can produce directed outflows of
relativistic matter with a kinetic luminosity exceeding by many millions that
of AGN. The requirements of energy and compactness indicate that SGRB activity
can be ascribed to a modest fraction of a solar mass of gas accreting onto a
stellar mass BH or to a precursor stage leading inevitably to such an object.
Scenarios involving the birth of a rapidly rotating NS, or an accreting BH in a
merging binary driven by gravitational waves are reviewed, along with possible
alternatives (collisions or collapse of compact objects). If a BH lies at the
center of this activity, the fundamental pathways through which mass, angular
momentum and energy can flow around and away from it play a key role in
understanding how these prime movers can form collimated relativistic outflows.
Hypercritical flows near BHs, where photons cannot supply the cooling, but
neutrinos do so efficiently, are discussed in detail, and we believe that they
offer the best hope of understanding the central engine. On the other hand,
statistical investigations of SGRB niches provide valuable information on their
nature and evolutionary behavior. In addition, compelling evidence now points
to the continuous fueling of SGRB sources. We suggest that the observed late
flaring activity could be due to a secondary accretion episode induced by the
fall back of material stripped from a compact object during a merger or
collision. Important open questions are identified, along with the types of
observation that would discriminate among various models. SGRB jets may be one
of the few observable consequences of how flows near nuclear density behave
under the influence of strong gravitational fields. (abridged)

which the conversion of cooling gas to stars in the multiphase interstellar
medium is governed by the rate at which molecular clouds are formed and
destroyed. In the model, clouds form from thermally unstable ambient gas and
get destroyed by feedback from massive stars and thermal conduction. Feedback
in the ambient phase cycles gas into a hot galactic fountain or wind. We model
the ambient gas hydrodynamically using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH).
However, we cannot resolve the Jeans mass in the cold and dense molecular gas
and, therefore, represent the cloud phase with ballistic particles that
coagulate when colliding. We show that this naturally produces a multiphase
medium with cold clouds, a warm disk, hot supernova bubbles and a hot, tenuous
halo. Our implementation of this model is based on the Gadget N-Body code. We
illustrate the model by evolving an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy and study
the properties of a disk formed in a rotating spherical collapse. Many observed
properties of disk galaxies are reproduced well, including the molecular cloud
mass spectrum, the molecular fraction as a function of radius, the Schmidt law,
the stellar density profile and the appearance of a galactic fountain.

spectrum (along with the mean $y$ parameter) does not provide a complete
description of the SZ effect. Therefore, SZ-based constraints on cosmological
parameters and on cluster gastrophysics which assume Gaussianity will be
biased.
  We derive an analytic expression for the $n$-point joint PDF of the SZ power
spectrum. Our derivation, which is based on the halo model, has several
advantages: it is expressed in an integral form which allows quick computation;
it is applicable to any given survey and any given angular scale; it is
straightforward to incorporate many of the complexities which arise when
modeling the SZ signal. To illustrate, we use our expression to estimate
$p(C_\ell)$, the one-point PDF of the SZ power spectrum. For small sky coverage
(applicable to BIMA/CBI and the Sunyaev Zel'dovich Array experiments), our
analysis shows that $p(C_\ell)$ on the several arc-minute scale is expected to
be strongly skewed, peaking at a value well below the mean and with a long tail
which extends to tail high $C_\ell$ values. In the limit of large sky coverage
(applicable to the South Pole Telescope and Planck), $p(C_\ell)$ approaches a
Gaussian form. However, even in this limit, the variance of the power spectrum
is very different from the naive Gaussian-based estimate. This is because
different $\ell$ models are strongly correlated, making the cosmic variance of
the SZ band-power much larger than the naive estimate. Our analysis should also
be useful for modeling the PDF of the power spectrum induced by gravitational
lensing at large $\ell$.

major advances in broadband all-sky surveys that are set to continue across

larger-scale modes cross out the horizon earlier and do not have enough time to
grow, thus resulting in a suppression of the density perturbation. This may
explain the observed low quadrupole in the CMB anisotropy data and and
potentially unveil the initial time of inflation. We also discuss the

sub-pulses (mode A, B and C). It has recently been shown that in a
multifrequency observation, consisting of 2700 pulses, all driftmodes were
visible at low frequencies, while at 4.85 GHz only mode-A drift or non-drifting
emission was detected. This suggests that modes A and B are emitted in
sub-beams, rotating at a fixed distance from the magnetic axis, with the mode-B
sub-beams being closer to the magnetic axis than the mode-A sub-beams. Diffuse
emission between the sub-beams can account for the non-drifting emission. Using
the results of an analysis of simultaneous multifrequency observations of PSR
B0031-07, we set out to construct a geometrical model that includes emission
from both sub-beams and diffuse emission and describes the regions of the radio
emission of PSR B0031-07 at each emission frequency for driftmodes A and B.
Based on the vertical spacing between driftbands, we have determined the
driftmode of each sequence of drift. To restrict the model, we calculated
average polarisation and intensity characteristics for each driftmode and at
each frequency. The model reproduces the observed polarisation and intensity
characteristics, suggesting that diffuse emission plays an important role in
the emission properties of PSR B0031-07. The model further suggests that the
emission heights of this pulsar range from a few kilometers to a little over 10
kilometers above the pulsar surface. We also find that the relationships
between height and frequency of emission that follow from curvature radiation
and from plasma-frequency emission could not be used to reproduce the observed
frequency dependence of the width of the average intensity profiles.

H-index is the integrated emission in a 0.1 nm band around the Ca core. We
separate a non-magnetically, H_non, and a magnetically, H_mag, heated component
from a non-heated component, H_co in the H-index. The average network and
inter-network H-indices are equal to 12 and 10 pm, respectively. The emission
in the network is correlated with the magnetic flux density, approaching a
value of H 10 pm for vanishing flux. The inter-network magnetic field is
dominated by weak field strengths with values down to 200 G and its mean
absolute flux density is 11 Mx cm$^{-2}$. We find that a dominant fraction of
the calcium emission caused by the heated atmosphere in the magnetic network,
has non-magnetic origin (H_mag = 2pm, H_non = 3pm). Considering the effect of
straylight, the contribution from an atmosphere with no temperature rise to the

inter-network. The H-index in the inter-network is not correlated to any
property of the photospheric magnetic field, suggesting that magnetic flux
concentrations have a negligible role in the chromospheric heating in this
region. The height range of the thermal coupling between the photosphere and
low/mid chromosphere increases in presence of magnetic field. In addition, we
demonstrate that a poor signal-to-noise level in the Stokes profiles leads to a
significant over-estimation of the magnetic field strength.

scale of the 70$\mu$m emission is larger than that of the 24$\mu$m emission,
while the 160$\mu$m emission shows a smooth wavelet spectrum. The radio and
H$\alpha$ maps are well correlated with all 3 MIPS maps, although their
correlations with the 160$\mu$m map are weaker. After subtracting the bright
HII regions, the 24 and 70$\mu$m maps show weaker correlations with the 20cm
map than with the 3.6cm map at most scales. We also find a strong correlation
between the 3.6cm and H$\alpha$ emission at all scales. Comparing the results
with and without the bright HII regions, we conclude that the IR emission is
influenced by young, massive stars increasingly with decreasing wavelength from
160 to 24$\mu$m. The radio-IR correlations indicate that the warm dust-thermal
radio correlation is stronger than the cold dust-nonthermal radio correlation
at scales smaller than 4kpc. A perfect 3.6cm-H$\alpha$ correlation implies that
extinction has no significant effect on H$\alpha$ emitting structures.

magnetic field magnitude was estimated to be of order 90 uG. According to

evidence that the associated dark cloud has an elongation parallel to the

SH, LH, and LL modules of IRS. The aim of this program is to study the physical
links in a young massive star between accretion disk, outflows and jets, and sh
ocks in the associated HH object. Our preliminary analysis reveals that several
knots of HH 39 are clearly detected in most IRAC bands. In IRAC4 (8 $\mu$m),
diffuse emission, probably from PAHs, appears as foreground emission covering
the HH 39 emission. The HH 39 knots are detected at 24 microns, despite the
fact that dust continuum emission covers the knots and shows the same structure
as observed with IRAC4. The IRS spectra of HH 39 show weak evidence of [Ne II]
12.8 $\mu$m and 0--0 S(1) H$_2$ 17.0 $\mu$m lines. A more detailed analysis is,
however, required due to the faintness of the Herbig-Haro knots. Finally, we
obtained the SH and MIPS SED spectra of R Mon. A PAH emission feature at 11.3
$\mu$m is detected on top of the strong continuum; although no strong emission
or absorption lines are observed, we will seek to detect faint lines. The
combined IRAC, IRS, and MIPS data of the R Mon/HH 39 system will help us to
understand circumstellar disk processing, and the connection between jets,

in the solar corona. It is concluded that the sharp increase of the plasma
temperature by two orders of magnitude is related to a self-induced opacity
with respect to Alfven waves. The maximal frequency for propagation of Alfven
waves is determined by the strongly temperature dependent kinematic viscosity.
In such a way the temperature jump is due to absorption of high frequency
Alfven waves in a narrow layer above the solar surface. It is calculated that
the power per unit area dissipated in this layer due to damping of Alfven waves
blows up the plasma and gives birth to the solar wind. A model short
wave-length (WKB) evaluation takes into account the 1/f^2 frequency dependance
of the transversal magnetic field and velocity spectral densities. Such
spectral densities agree with old magnetometric data taken by Voyager 1 and
recent theoretical calculations in the framework of Langevin-Burgers MHD. The
present theory predicts existence of intensive high frequency MHD Alfven waves
in the cold layer beneath the corona. It is briefly discussed how this
statement can be checked experimentally. It is demonstrated that the magnitude
of the Alfven waves generating random noise and the solar wind velocity can be
expressed only in terms of satellite experimental data. It is advocated that
investigation of properties of the solar surface as a random driver by optical
methods is an important task for future solar physics. Jets of accretion disks
are speculated as a special case of the wind from magnetized turbulent plasma.

lengths are adjusted so as to keep the number of neighbours, ${\cal N}$, in the
range ${\cal N}_{_{\rm NEIB}}\pm\Delta{\cal N}_{_{\rm NEIB}}$, the tolerance,
$\Delta{\cal N}_{_{\rm NEIB}}$, should be set to zero, as first noted by Nelson
& Papaloizou. We point out that this is a very straightforward and
computationally inexpensive constraint to implement. Methods: We demonstrate
this by simulating acoustic oscillations of a self-gravitating isentropic
monatomic gas-sphere (cf. Lucy), using ${\cal N}_{_{\rm TOT}}\sim6,000$
particles and ${\cal N}_{_{\rm NEIB}}=50$. Results: We show that there is a
marked reduction in the rates of numerical dissipation and diffusion as
$\Delta{\cal N}_{_{\rm NEIB}}$ is reduced from 10 to zero. Moreover this
reduction incurs a very small computational overhead. Conclusions: We propose
that this should become a standard test for codes used in simulating star
formation. It is a highly relevant test, because pressure waves generated by
the switch from approximate isothermality to approximate adiabaticity play a
critical role in the fragmentation of collapsing prestellar cores. Since many
SPH simulations in the literature use ${\cal N}_{_{\rm NEIB}}=50$ and
$\Delta{\cal N}_{_{\rm NEIB}}\geq10$, their results must be viewed with
caution.

fermion exchanges of scalar products of $N$-composite-boson (``coboson'')
states can be obtained in a practical way. The hard algebra on which this
expansion is based, will be given in an independent publication.
  Due to the composite nature of the particles, the scalar products of
$N$-coboson states do not reduce to a set of Kronecker symbols, as for
elementary bosons, but contain subtle exchange terms between two or more
cobosons. These terms originate from Pauli exclusion between the fermionic
components of the particles. While our many-body theory for composite bosons
leads to write these scalar products as complicated sums of products of ``Pauli
scatterings'' between \emph{two} cobosons, they in fact correspond to fermion
exchanges between any number P of quantum particles, with $2 \leq P\leq N$.
These $P$-body exchanges are nicely represented by the so-called ``Shiva
diagrams'', which are topologically different from Feynman diagrams, due to the
intrinsic many-body nature of Pauli exclusion from which they originate. These
Shiva diagrams in fact constitute the novel part of our composite-exciton
many-body theory which was up to now missing to get its full diagrammatic
representation. Using them, we can now ``see'' through diagrams the physics of
any quantity in which enters $N$ interacting excitons -- or more generally $N$
composite bosons --, with fermion exchanges included in an \emph{exact} -- and
transparent -- way.

electron-electron scattering explicitly included. For identical strengths of
the Rashba and the Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings, the spin diffusion length
shows strong anisotropy not only for the spin polarization direction but also
for the spin diffusion direction. Two special directions are used seeking for
the large diffusion length: ($\bar{1}$10) and (110). Without the cubic term of
the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling and with the identical Dresselhaus and
Rashba strengths, infinite diffusion lengths can be obtained {\em either} for
the spin diffusion/injection direction along $(\bar110)$, regardless of the

finite spin diffusion length which decreases with the temperature and the

and spin polarization direction is maintained. For the spin diffusion/injection

fix the other electrons in conditional single-particle wave functions affect
the display of the vortex structures and behaviors. Then the vortex transitions
in magnetic fields for the lowest states with different spins are studied. When
the field is not very strong, with the increase of the field, the vortex number
is monotone non-decreasing, and there are absent states although their angular
momenta are in accordance with transition rules given by the theory of electron
molecules. Different behaviors of the vortices with the change of interaction
range reveal the respective analogies to the vortices of electrons and
quasi-particles in fractional quantum Hall system. The separated vortices keep
apart from the electrons even when the interaction is screened and such
behavior can give an understanding of the absences of the angular momenta in
the transition sequences.

Chemical doping yielded a severe inhomogeneity in a statistical distribution of

inhomogeneity effects; Monte Carlo simulation technique for the
\textit{n}-doped films, and the fluctuation theory for the \textit{p}-ZnO. The
broadening of PL band of \textit{n}-ZnO was significantly larger than predicted
by theoretical results in which the linewidths of each individual emissions
have been determined mainly from the concentration fluctuation of donor-type
dopants by the simulation. Moreover, the rather asymmetrical line shape was
observed. To explain these features, a vibronic model was developed accounting
for contributions from a series of phonon replicas. In case of \textit{p}-type
ZnO:N, analysis of excitation-intensity dependence of the peak shift of
donor-acceptor luminescence with a fluctuation model has also proven the
importance of the inhomogeneity effect of charged impurity distribution, as in
the case of ZnO:Ga. We extracted the inhomogeneity in the sample and acceptor
activation energy prepared under the various growth conditions. It is shown
that the theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental 5-K
time-resolved luminescence for the systems in a fluctuation field. Finally,
localized-state distributions have been studied in N-doped ZnO thin films by

quantum phase transition. We investigate its behavior during a quench from a
paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase caused by a gradual turning off of the
transverse field at a fixed rate characterized by the quench time $\tau_Q$. In
agreement with Kibble-Zurek mechanism, quantum state of the system after the
transition exhibits a characteristic correlation length $\hat\xi$ proportional
to the square root of the quench time $\tau_Q$. The inverse of this correlation
length determines average density of defects after the transition. In this
paper, we show that $\hat\xi$ also controls the entropy of entanglement of a
block of $L$ spins with the rest of the system. For large $L$, this entropy
saturates at $\frac16\log_2\hat\xi$, as might have been expected from the
Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Close to the critical point, the entropy saturates when
the block size $L\approx\hat\xi$, but -- in the subsequent evolution in the
ferromagnetic phase -- a somewhat larger length scale
$l=\sqrt{\tau_Q}\ln\tau_Q$ develops as a result of quantum dephasing, and the
entropy saturates when $L\approx l$. We also study the spin-spin correlation.
We find that close to the critical point ferromagnetic correlations decay
exponentially with the dynamical correlation length $\hat\xi$, but in the
following evolution this correlation function becomes oscillatory at distances
less than this scale. However, both the wavelength and the correlation length
of these oscillations are still determined by $\hat\xi$. We also derive
probability distribution for the number of kinks in a finite spin chain after
the transition.

sufficiently smooth interactions, the Wigner-Kirkwood formalism provides a
semiclassical expansion of the Boltzmann density in configuration space in even

to generate an analogous $\lambda$-expansion for the bulk free energy and
many-body densities. The present paper brings a technically nontrivial
generalization of the Wigner-Kirkwood technique to semi-infinite quantum
fluids, constrained by a plane hard wall impenetrable to particles. In contrast
to the bulk case, the resulting Boltzmann density involves also
position-dependent terms of type $\exp(-2x^2/\lambda^2)$ ($x$ denotes the
distance from the wall boundary) which are non-analytic in $\lambda$. Under
some condition, the analyticity in $\lambda$ is restored by integrating the
Boltzmann density over configuration space; however, in contrast to the bulk
free energy, the semiclassical expansion of the surface part of the free energy
(surface tension) contains odd powers of $\lambda$, too. Explicit expressions
for the leading quantum corrections in the presence of the boundary are given
for the one-body and two-body densities. As model systems for explicit

disappears and only the Hall voltage is measurable (i.e. the transverse even

requirements, it is possible to drive the MSE to zero with increasing sensor
density at points of field continuity while ensuring that the per-sensor
bitrate and sensing-related network overhead rate simultaneously go to zero.
The proposed scheme achieves the order-optimal MSE versus sensor density
scaling behavior for the class of spatially constant spatio-temporal fields.

"cs/0701197","Nan Ma","Nan Ma, Ye Wang, and Prakash Ishwar","On Delayed Sequential Coding of Correlated Sources","35 pages, 7 figures. This work has been submitted to the IEEE for
  possible publication. Parts of this work were presented at 2007 Information
  Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA'07) and 2007 IEEE International
  Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT'07)",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by video coding applications, the problem of sequential coding of
correlated sources with encoding and/or decoding frame-delays is studied. The
fundamental tradeoffs between individual frame rates, individual frame
distortions, and encoding/decoding frame-delays are derived in terms of a
single-letter information-theoretic characterization of the rate-distortion
region for general inter-frame source correlations and certain types of
potentially frame specific and coupled single-letter fidelity criteria. The
sum-rate-distortion region is characterized in terms of generalized directed
information measures highlighting their role in delayed sequential source
coding problems. For video sources which are spatially stationary memoryless
and temporally Gauss-Markov, MSE frame distortions, and a sum-rate constraint,
our results expose the optimality of idealized differential predictive coding
among all causal sequential coders, when the encoder uses a positive rate to
describe each frame. Somewhat surprisingly, causal sequential encoding with
one-frame-delayed noncausal sequential decoding can exactly match the
sum-rate-MSE performance of joint coding for all nontrivial MSE-tuples
satisfying certain positive semi-definiteness conditions. Thus, even a single
frame-delay holds potential for yielding significant performance improvements.
Generalizations to higher order Markov sources are also presented and
discussed. A rate-distortion performance equivalence between, causal sequential
encoding with delayed noncausal sequential decoding, and, delayed noncausal
sequential encoding with causal sequential decoding, is also established.

fraction $z$ in the application of gluon to heavy quarkonium fragmentation
function. We numerically calculate the initial $g \to J / \psi$ fragmentation
functions by using the non-covariant definitions of $z$ with finite gluon
momentum and find that these fragmentation functions have strong dependence on
the gluon momentum $\vec{k}$. As $| \vec{k} | \to \infty$, these fragmentation
functions approach to the fragmentation function in the light-cone definition.
Our numerical results show that large uncertainties remains while the
non-covariant definitions of $z$ are employed in the application of the
fragmentation functions. We present for the first time the polarized gluon to
$J/\psi$ fragmentation functions, which are fitted by the scheme exploited in
this work.

sets is extremely simple. More precisely, under a coprimality condition on the
sides of the rectangle, the number of independent sets of even and odd
cardinality always differ by 1. In physics terms, this means looking at the
hard-particle model on these grids at activity -1. This conjecture was recently
proved by Jonsson. Here we produce other families of grid graphs, with open or
cylindric boundary conditions, for which similar properties hold without any
size restriction: the number of independent sets of even and odd cardinality
always differ by 0, 1,-1, or, in the cylindric case, by some power of 2. We
show that these results reflect a stronger property of the independence
complexes of our graphs. We determine the homotopy type of these complexes
using Forman's discrete Morse theory. We find that these complexes are either
contractible, or homotopic to a sphere, or, in the cylindric case, to a wedge

"math/0701904","Jason Teutsch","Jason Teutsch","Noncomputable Spectral Sets","PhD thesis, 101 pages",,,,"math.LO cs.LO",,"  It is possible to enumerate all computer programs. In particular, for every
partial computable function, there is a shortest program which computes that
function. f-MIN is the set of indices for shortest programs. In 1972, Meyer
showed that f-MIN is Turing equivalent to 0'', the halting set with halting set
oracle.
  This paper generalizes the notion of shortest programs, and we use various
measures from computability theory to describe the complexity of the resulting
""spectral sets."" We show that under certain Godel numberings, the spectral sets
are exactly the canonical sets 0', 0'', 0''', ... up to Turing equivalence.
This is probably not true in general, however we show that spectral sets always
contain some useful information. We show that immunity, or ""thinness"" is a
useful characteristic for distinguishing between spectral sets.
  In the final chapter, we construct a set which neither contains nor is
disjoint from any infinite arithmetic set, yet it is 0-majorized and contains a
natural spectral set. Thus a pathological set becomes a bit more friendly.
Finally, a number of interesting open problems are left for the inspired
reader.

(i.e., in the valley of stability). All calculations agree in predicting a
strong tendency for triaxial shapes in the Ge isotopes with only a few
exceptions due to neutron (sub-)shell closures. The frequent occurrence of
energetically very close shape isomers indicates that the underlying
deformation energy landscape is very soft. The general triaxial softness of the
Ge isotopes is demonstrated in the fully triaxial potential energy surface. The
differences between the forces play an increasing role with increasing neutron

has a visible effect on the trend of binding energies towards the drip line.
Different effective mass plays an important role in predicting the quadrupole

adjustments of individual functional blocks and their joint performance in

setup, the performances of the numerical PLL and of the amplitude controller
were ascertained to be satisfactory compared to those of the real components.
Attention is also focused on the issue of apparent dissipation, that is, of
spurious variations in the driving amplitude caused by the nonlinear
interaction occurring between the tip and the surface and by the finite
response times of the various controllers. To do so, an estimate of the minimum
dissipated energy that is detectable by the instrument upon operating
conditions is given. This allows us to discuss the relevance of apparent
dissipation that can be conditionally generated with the simulator in
comparison to values reported experimentally. The analysis emphasizes that
apparent dissipation can contribute to the measured dissipation up to 15% of
the intrinsic dissipated energy of the cantilever interacting with the surface,
but can be made negligible when properly adjusting the controllers, the PLL
gains and the scan speed. It is inferred that the experimental values of
dissipation usually reported in the literature cannot only originate in
apparent dissipation, which favors the hypothesis of ""physical"" channels of
