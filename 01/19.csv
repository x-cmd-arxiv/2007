rare and that instead the systems spread outward. This always leads to a

(LLRGs) for comparison. In both Seyfert and LLRGs samples, X-ray and radio
luminosities are significantly correlated over 8 orders of magnitude,
indicating that the X-ray and radio emission sources are strongly coupled.
Moreover, both samples show a similar regression slope, L(X)$\propto$
L(R)^(0.97), but Seyfert galaxies are three orders of magnitude less luminous
in the radio band than LLRGs. This suggests that either similar physical
mechanisms are responsible for the observed emission or a combination of
different mechanisms ends up producing a similar correlation slope. Indeed, the
common belief for LLRG is that both the X-ray and radio emission are likely
dominated by a relativistic jet component, while in Seyfert galaxies the X-ray
emission probably arises from a disk-corona system and the radio emission is
attributed to a jet/outflow component. We investigate the radio loudness issue
in the two samples and find that the Seyfert galaxies and the LLRGs show a
different distribution of the radio loudness parameters. No correlation is
found between the luminosity and the radio loudness, however the latter is
related to the black hole mass and anti-correlated with the Eddington ratio.
The dichotomy in the radio loudness between Seyfert and LLRG observed down to
low Eddington ratios, L(2-10)/L(Edd) $\sim$ 10^(-8), does not support the idea
that the origin of the radio loudness is due to a switch in the accretion mode.

explaining the metals in white dwarf photospheres by accretion from the
interstellar medium (ISM). We use the observed interstellar column densities
toward stars in close angular proximity and similar distance as DAZ white
dwarfs to constrain the contribution of accretion from the ISM. We find no
correlation between the accretion density required to supply metals observed in
DAZs with the densities observed in their interstellar environment, indicating
that ISM accretion alone cannot explain the presence of metals in nearby DAZ
white dwarfs. Although ISM accretion will certainly contribute, our analysis
indicates that it is not the dominant source of metals for most DAZ white

suggests that circumstellar material may play a more dominant role in polluting

highlights the existence of a new discrepancy (or a new aspect of an old
discrepancy) between the density profiles predicted by the Lambda Cold Dark
Matter (LambdaCDM) theory and the actual distribution of dark matter in
galaxies.
  Methods. We compare the predicted face-value density vs. enclosed mass
relationship, at large distances, to the observational data at the last
measured radii of the rotation curves and in two whole rotation curves of high
quality. A further analysis is performed by studying a relation, inbuilt in
LambdaCDM, that links at radius R, the enclosed halo mass M(R) and its density
rho(R) in a way that is independent of the mass of the virialised object.
  Results. We find that the predicted density vs. enclosed mass relationship
has a systematic offset with respect to the observational data. In test case
extended rotation curves, at their last measured point, the predicted NFW
densities are up to a factor 3 lower than those derived from the kinematics.
Moreover, the abovementioned relation, inbuilt in LambdaCDM, does not hold for
the objects of our sample. Such a new outer discrepancy is different and maybe
complementary with respect to the core/cusp issue, for which the NFW densities
turn out to be higher than those observed and it seems to imply a global mass
rearrangement of a pristine NFW-LambdaCDM halo.

repository of metals produced by supernovae. We aim to accurately measure the
abundances in the ICM of many clusters and compare these data with metal yields
produced by supernovae. Using the data archive of the XMM-Newton X-ray
observatory, we compile a sample of 22 clusters. We fit spectra extracted from
the core regions and determine the abundances of silicon, sulfur, argon,
alcium, iron, and nickel. The abundances from the spectral fits are
subsequently fitted to supernova yields determined from several supernova type
Ia and core-collapse supernova models. We find that the argon and calcium
abundances cannot be fitted with currently favoured supernova type Ia models.
We obtain a major improvement of the fit, when we use an empirically modified
delayed-detonation model that is calibrated on the Tycho supernova remnant. The
two modified parameters are the density where the sound wave in the supernova
turns into a shock and the ratio of the specific internal energies of ions and
electrons at the shock. Our fits also suggest that the core-collapse supernovae
that contributed to the enrichment of the ICM had progenitors which were
already enriched. The Ar/Ca ratio in clusters is a good touchstone for
determining the quality of type Ia models. The core-collapse contribution,
which is about 50% and not strongly dependent on the IMF or progenitor
metallicity, does not have a significant impact on the Ar/Ca ratio. The number
ratio between supernova type Ia and core-collapse supernovae suggests that
binary systems in the appropriate mass range are very efficient (~ 5-16%) in

shearing perturbations lead to 3D-localised current sheets focused at the null

parallel to the spine, driving rotational flows and a type of rotational
reconnection. Shears, on the other hand, cause a current through the null which

constraining different models of black hole cosmic evolution using future
gravitational wave space--borne missions, such as LISA. We consider two main
scenarios for black hole formation, namely, one where seeds are light (~10^2
\msun, remnant of Population III stars), and one where seeds are heavy (>~10^4
\msun, direct collapse). In all the models we have investigated, massive black
hole binary coalescences do not produce a stochastic GW background, but rather,
a set of individual resolved events. Detection of several hundreds merging
events in 3 year LISA mission will be the sign of a heavy seed scenario with
efficient formation of black hole seeds in a large fraction of high redshift
halos. On the other extreme, a low event rate, about few tens in 3 years, is
peculiar of scenarios where either the seeds are light, and many coalescences
do not fall into the LISA band, or seeds are massive, but rare. In this case a
decisive diagnostic is provided by the shape of the mass distribution of
detected events. Light binaries (m<10^4\msun) are predicted in a fairly large
number in Population III remnants models, but are totally absent in direct
collapse models. Finally, a further, helpful diagnostic of black hole formation
models lies in the distribution of the mass ratios in binary coalescences.
While heavy seed models predict that most of the detected events involve equal
mass binaries, in the case of light seeds, mass ratios are equally distributed
in the range 0.1-1.

stellar population accounts for the Br_gamma emission and most of the IR
luminosity, and about one-third of the stellar mass of the ring. The much less
obscured intermediate-age population has properties similar to those of the
majority of the (older) 1.1um-selected star clusters. These two populations are
spatially anti-correlated. The UV-optical-NIR continuum (including the majority
of the clusters) of the ring traces mostly the mildly obscured intermediate-age
population, while the MIR and radio peaks mark the location of the youngest and
obscured star-forming regions. This study emphasizes the need for
multi-wavelength, high-angular resolution observations to characterize the star
formation in the dust-obscured regions commonly present in LIRGs.

common-envelope phase during their evolution. DE CVn is a detached white dwarf
- red dwarf binary with a relatively short (~8.7 hours) orbital period. Its
brightness and the presence of eclipses makes this system ideal for a more
detailed study. From a study of photometric and spectroscopic observations of
DE CVn we derive the system parameters which we discuss in the frame work of
common-envelope evolution. Photometric observations of the eclipses are used to
determine an accurate ephemeris. From a model fit to an average low-resolution
spectrum of DE CVn we constrain the temperature of the white dwarf and the
spectral type of the red dwarf. The eclipse light curve is analysed and
combined with the radial velocity curve of the red dwarf determined from
time-resolved spectroscopy to derive constraints on the inclination and the
masses of the components in the system. The derived ephemeris is HJD_min =
2452784.5533(1) + 0.3641394(2) x E. The red dwarf in DE CVn has a spectral type
of M3V and the white dwarf has an effective temperature of 8000 K. The
inclination of the system is 86 (+3, -2) deg and the mass and radius of the red
dwarf are 0.41 +/- 0.06 M_sun and 0.37 (+0.06, -0.007) R_sun, respectively, and
the mass and radius of the white dwarf are 0.51 (+0.06, -0.02) M_sun and 0.0136
(+0.0008, -0.0002) R_sun, respectively. We found that the white dwarf has a
hydrogen-rich atmosphere (DA-type). Given that DE CVn has experienced a
common-envelope phase, we can reconstruct its evolution and we find that the
progenitor of the white dwarf was a relatively low-mass star (M <= 1.6M_sun).
The current age of this system is 3.3-7.3 x 10^9 years, while it will take
longer than the Hubble time for DE CVn to evolve into a semi-detached system.

Traditional spectroscopic and radio continuum techniques are sensitive to mass

relatively feeble wind. Much has been done with these methods to probe the more
massive outflows of younger (T Tauri) and older (giant, AGB, supergiant) cool
stars, but the main sequence remains terra incognita. This presentation reviews
the limits on traditional diagnostics and outlines more recent ideas such as
Lyman alpha astrospheres and charge-exchange X-ray emission. In addition, there
are hybrid constraints on mass loss rates that combine existing observables and
theoretical models. The Sackmann/Boothroyd conjecture of a more massive young
Sun (and thus a much stronger ZAMS wind) is one such idea that needs to be
tested further. Another set of ideas involves a strong proposed coupling
between coronal heating and stellar mass loss rates, where the former is easier
to measure in stars down to solar-like values. The combined modeling of stellar
coronae and stellar winds is developing rapidly, and it seems to be approaching
a level of development where the only remaining ``free parameters'' involve the
sub-photospheric convection. This talk will also summarize these theoretical
efforts to predict the properties of solar-type main-sequence winds.

January. WPVS 007 has been an unusual source. While being X-ray bright during
the ROSAT All-Sky Survey it has been extremely faint in all following X-ray
observations. Swift also finds this NLS1 to be X-ray faint and not detected in
the Swift X-Ray Telescope at an 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $2.6\times 10^{-17}$ W
m$^{-2}$ in the 0.3-10.0 keV band and confirms that the AGN is still in a low
state. During the 2006 July and December observations with \swift's UV-Optical
Telescope (UVOT) the AGN became fainter by about 0.2 mag in the UV filters and
by about 0.1 mag in V, B, and U compared with the 2005 October to 2006 January
and 2006 September/October observations followed by a rebrightening in the 2007
January observation. This variability can be caused either by a change in the
absorption column density and therefore the reddening in the UV, or by flux
variations of the central engine. We also noticed that the flux in the UVOT
filters agree with earlier measurements by the International Ultraviolet
Explorer taken between 1993-1995, but spectra taken by the Hubble Space
Telescope Faint Object Spectrograph show that WPVS 007 was fainter in the UV by
a factor of at least 2 in 1996. The flat optical/UV spectrum suggests that some
UV extinction is present in the spectrum, but that alone cannot at all account
for the dramatic fading in the X-ray flux. Most likely we see a partial
covering absorber in X-rays. Alternatively, the current X-ray emission seen
from WPVS 007 may also be the emission from the host galaxy.

is investigated by modelling the maximum expected thermal and nonthermal mass
loss rates over several Gyr. Depending on an exosphere formation time and the
evolution of the stellar X-ray and EUV flux we expect that thermal evaporation
at orbital distances less than 0.05 AU may be an efficient loss process for
hydrogen-rich exoplanets with masses less than 0.25 MJup. Our results indicate
that nonthermal mass loss induced by Coronal Mass Ejections of the host star

less than 0.05 AU (orbital periods less than days) weakly magnetized or highly
irradiated gas giants may loose a large fraction of their initial mass and
completely loose their gas envelopes. (2) Observed planetary mass spectra at
these periods that resemble the initial ones would indicate a major effect of
magnetic field protection and so far unknown thermospheric cooling processes.
(3) At distances larger than 0.05 AU the impact of loss processes is minor and
the observed mass spectra should be close to the initial ones.

been well described with a two-component model consisting of a variable power
law and a much less variable reflection component, containing a broad
relativistic iron line from the accretion disc around a rapidly rotating Kerr
black hole. The lack of variability of the reflection component has been
interpreted as an effect of strong gravitational light bending very close to
the central black hole. Using an improved reflection model, we fit the
two-component model to time-resolved spectra of both observations. Assuming
that the photon index of the power law is constant we reconfirm the old result

for the magnetic field intensity 170 muG in spot A, and 270 muG in spot D. We
also find that the energy density of the emitting electrons is most likely
larger by a factor of a few than the energy density of the hotspots' magnetic
field. We construct energy spectra of the radiating ultrarelativistic
electrons. We find that for both hotspots A and D these spectra are consistent
with a broken power-law extending from at least 100 MeV up to 100 GeV, and that
the spectral break corresponds almost exactly to the proton rest energy of 1
GeV. We argue that the shape of the electron continuum reflects two different
regimes of the electron acceleration process at mildly relativistic shocks,
rather than resulting from radiative cooling and/or absorption effects. In this
picture the protons' inertia defines the critical energy for the hotspot
electrons above which Fermi-type acceleration processes may play a major role,
but below which the operating acceleration mechanism has to be of a different
type. At energies >100 GeV, the electron spectra cut-off/steepen again, most
likely as a result of spectral aging due to radiative loss effects. We discuss
several implications of the presented analysis for the physics of extragalactic
jets.

should avoid superoutbursts according to the thermal tidal instability model,
the prototypical dwarf nova U Gem experienced in 1985 an extraordinary long
outburst resembling very much superoutbursts observed in SU UMa systems.
Recently, the situation for the model became even worse as superhump detections
have been reported for the 1985 outburst of U Gem. The superhump signal is
noisy and the evidence provided by simple periodograms seems to be weak.
Therefore and because of the importance for our understanding of superoutbursts
and superhumps, we determine the statistical significance of the recently
published detection of superhumps in the AAVSO light curve of the famous long
1985 outburst of U Gem. Using Lomb-Scargle periodograms, analysis of variance
(AoV), and Monte-Carlo methods we analyse the 160 visual magnitudes obtained by
the AAVSO during the outburst and relate our analyse to previous superhump
detections. The 160 data points of the outburst alone do not contain a
statistically significant period. However, using additionally the
characteristics of superhumps detected previously in other SU UMa systems and
searching only for signals that are consistent with these, we derive a
$2\sigma$ significance for the superhump signal. The alleged appearance of an
additional superhump at the end of the outbursts appears to be statistically
insignificant. Although of weak statistical significance, the superhump signal
of the long 1985 outburst of U Gem can be interpreted as further indication for
the SU UMa nature of this outburst. This further contradicts the tidal
instability model as the explanation for the superhump phenomenon.

two puzzling cosmological observations that are still discussed subject : a
bulk flow and a foam like structure in the distribution of galaxies. For the
first one, we model the motions describing all planar distortions from Hubble
flow, in addition of two classes of planar-axial distortions with or without
rotation, when spatial distribution of gravitational sources is homogenous.
This provides us with an alternative to models which assume the presence of
gravitational structures similar to Great Attractor as origin of a bulk flow.
For the second one, the model accounts for an isotropic universe constituted by
a spherical void surrounded by a uniform distribution of dust. It does not
correspond to the usual embedding of a void solution into a cosmological
background solution, but to a global solution of fluid mechanics. The general
behavior of the void expansion shows a huge initial burst, which freezes
asymptotically up to match Hubble expansion. While the corrective factor to
Hubble law on the shell depends weakly on cosmological constant at early
stages, it enables us to disentangle significantly cosmological models around
redshift z ~ 1.7. The magnification of spherical voids increases with the
density parameter and with the cosmological constant. An interesting feature is
that for spatially closed Friedmann models, the empty regions are swept out,
what provides us with a stability criterion.

for solutions of Einstein equations and discover the basic role of the
relativistic analog of the Newton gravitational potential. For the relativistic
potential we introduce a simple quasi-linear superposition principle as a new
physical requirement for the initial conditions for Einstein equations, thus
justifying the instant gravistatic case for N particle system.
  This superposition principle allows us to sketch a new theory of the
gravitational mass defect. In it a specific Mach-like principle for the
Keplerian mass $m$ is valid, i.e. it depends on the mass distribution in the
universe, in contrast to the bare mass $M$, which remains a true constant.
Several basic examples both of discrete and of continuous mass distributions

calculate several differential and integrated cross sections, including pion
angular distributions, induced by neutrinos and antineutrinos and driven both
by charged and neutral currents. In all cases we find that the background terms
produce quite significant effects and that they lead to an overall improved
description of the data, as compared to the case where only the Delta pole
mechanism is considered. We also show that the interference between the Delta
pole and the background terms produces parity-violating contributions to the
pion angular differential cross section, which are intimately linked to $T-$odd

the normal and inverted neutrino mass spectra. In this paper, we give a

retardation of atmospheric-scale neutrino oscillation is detectable after 20 or
more oscillations if the source and the target are made sufficiently compact in

should occur because of drastic changes of matter composition in Universe: the
latest such event is rather recent (redshift $z\sim 0.5$), from matter to dark

structure of interactions. In addition, the degree distributions associated
with the two guilds involved in such networks (e.g. plants & pollinators or
plants & seed dispersers) approximately follow a truncated power law. We show
that nestedness and truncated power law distributions are intimately linked,
and that any biological reasons for such truncation are superimposed to finite
size effects . We further explore the internal organization of bipartite
networks by developing a self-organizing network model (SNM) that reproduces
empirical observations of pollination systems of widely different sizes. Since
the only inputs to the SNM are numbers of plant and animal species, and their
interactions (i.e., no data on local abundance of the interacting species are
needed), we suggest that the well-known association between species frequency
of interaction and species degree is a consequence rather than a cause, of the
observed network structure.

regulatory networks of the cell. Recent advances uncovered that chaperones act
as genetic buffers stabilizing the phenotype of various cells and organisms and
may serve as potential regulators of evolvability. Chaperones have weak links,
connect hubs, are in the overlaps of network modules and may uncouple these
modules during stress, which gives an additional protection for the cell at the
network-level. Moreover, after stress chaperones are essential to re-build
inter-modular contacts by their low affinity sampling of the potential
interaction partners in different modules. This opens the way to the
chaperone-regulated modular evolution of cellular networks, and helps us to
design novel therapeutic and anti-aging strategies.

encoding quantum operations. Particular attention is devoted to the case of
many senders, and it is shown that restrictions on the possible operations on
the senders' side may make some quantum state useless for dense-coding. It is
shown, e.g., that some states are useful for dense coding if the senders can
communicate classically (but not quantumly), yet they cannot be used for dense
coding, if classical communication is not allowed. These no-go results are
actually independent of the particular quantification of the quantum advantage,
being valid for any reasonable choice. It is further shown that the quantum
advantage of dense coding satisfies a monogamy relation with the so-called
entanglement of purification.
