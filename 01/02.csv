are clearly lensed images of a single background source) and the elongated
region C are each divided into components. Our new high-resolution maps reveal
more components in images A and B, clearly demonstrating their expected
opposite parities. According to the scenario of Koopmans et al. (2002), the
arc-like region C consists of two merging, partial images (``C1-C2'') of just a
small region of the same background source, seen with high lens magnification.
We have determined the spectra and relative positions of the components within
all four images in order to test this scenario. We find that the outer
north-west components in images A and B do indeed have radio spectra similar to
the components seen in C1 and C2.

the stirring of turbulent motions by protostellar outflows, building on an

generalize this model to account for a diversity of outflow strengths, and for
outflow collimation, both of which enhance turbulence. For a single value of
its coupling coefficient the model is consistent with turbulence simulations by
Li & Nakamura and, plausibly, with observations of the NGC 1333 cluster-forming

cluster-forming regions for several crossing times, relieving the mismatch
between star formation and turbulent decay rates. The predicted line-width-size

accurately the spectral variability patterns in the source.
  We use standard cross-correlation methods to investigate the correlations
between the soft and hard energy band light curves. We also generated 200
energy spectra from data stretches of 500 s duration each and fitted each one
of them with a power law plus a bremsstrahlung component (for the soft excess)
and we investigated the correlations between the various best fit model
parameter values. The ``power law plus bremsstrahlung'' model describes the
spectrum well at all times. The iron line and the absorption features, which
are found in the time-averaged spectrum of the source are too weak to effect
the results of the time resolved spectral fits. We find that the power law and
the soft excess flux are variable, on all measured time scales. The power law
slope is also variable, and leads the flux variations of both the power law and
the bremsstrahlung components. Our results can be explained in the framework of
time-dependent Comptonization models. They are consistent with a picture where
instabilities propagate through an extended X-ray source, affecting first the
soft and then the hard photons producing regions. The soft excess could
correspond to ionized disc reflection emission, in which case it responds fast
to the primary continuum variations. The time scales are such that light travel
times might additionally influence the observed variability structure.

assumptions and the observational uncertainties for individual objects, only a
large, homogeneous sample, as the one used here, can enable a conclusive study

(~0.07 Z_sun), placing it among the most metal deficient subset of

GRB host from an emission-line analysis. Given the stellar mass of the galaxy
of ~10^7 M_sun and the SFR (H alpha) = 0.065 +/- 0.005 M_sun/yr, the high
specific star formation rate indicates an age for the galaxy of less than ~200
Myr. The brightest emission lines are clearly asymmetric and are well fit by
two Gaussian components separated by ~22$ km/s. We detect two discrete Na I and

confirm this.

applicable to ultra-compact X-ray binaries, AM CVn stars and very short period

reference frame is found to be quite different from that expected at higher
mass ratios. For q ~ 0.1, the disc takes on the usual elliptical shape, with
the major axis aligned perpendicular to the line of centres of the two stars.
However, at smaller mass ratios the elliptical gaseous orbits in the outer
regions of the disc are rotated in the binary plane. The angle of rotation
increases with gas temperature, but is found to vary inversely with q. At q =
0.01, the major axis of these orbits is aligned almost parallel to the line of
centres of the two stars. These effects may be responsible for the similar disc
structure inferred from Doppler tomography of the AM CVn star GP Com

low mass ratios is not predicted by an inviscid, restricted three-body model of
gaseous orbits; it is related to the effects of tidal-viscous truncation of the
disc near the Roche lobe boundary. Since the disc geometry can be inferred
observationally for some systems, it is proposed that this may offer a useful
diagnostic for the determination of mass ratios in ultra-compact binaries.

multiple relay nodes each of which assists the transmission of a predefined
subset of source nodes to their respective destinations. Considering the sum
capacity as the performance metric, we solve the problem of optimally
allocating the total power of each relay node between the transmissions it is
assisting. We consider four different relay transmission strategies, namely
regenerative decode-and-forward (RDF), nonregenerative decode-and-forward
(NDF), amplify-and-forward (AF) and compress-and-forward (CF). We first obtain
the optimum power allocation policies for the relay nodes that employ a uniform
relaying strategy for all nodes. We show that the optimum power allocation for
the RDF and NDF cases are modified water-filling solutions. We observe that for
a given relay transmit power, NDF always outperforms RDF whereas CF always
provides higher sum capacity than AF. When CF and NDF are compared, it is
observed that either of CF or NDF may outperform the other in different
scenarios. This observation suggests that the sum capacity can be further
improved by having each relay adopt its relaying strategy in helping different
source nodes. We investigate this problem next and determine the optimum power
allocation and relaying strategy for each source node that relay nodes assist.
We observe that optimum power allocation for relay nodes with hybrid relaying
strategies provides higher sum capacity than pure RDF, NDF, AF or CF relaying
strategies.

an approximation algorithm. As an application, we investigate the

by LeFloch and Shelukhin in the non-relativistic setting. We establish the
existence of globally defined, bounded measurable, entropy solutions with
arbitrary large amplitude. An earlier result by Smoller and Temple for the same
system covered solutions with bounded variation that avoid the vacuum state.
The new framework proposed here provides entropy solutions in a larger function
space and allows for the mass density to vanish and the velocity field to
approach the speed of light. The relativistic Euler equations become strongly
degenerate in both regimes, as the conservative or the flux variables vanish or
blow-up. Our proof is based on the method of compensated compactness for
nonlinear systems of conservation laws (Tartar, DiPerna) and takes advantage of
a scaling invariance property of the isothermal fluid equations. We also rely
on properties of the fundamental kernel that generates the mathematical entropy
and entropy flux pairs. This kernel exhibits certain singularities on the
boundary of its support and we are led to analyze certain nonconservative
products (after Dal Maso, LeFloch, and Murat) consisting of functions of
bounded variation by measures.

form building blocks in our scheme and allow us to take into account naturally
the effects of the flux and source terms. To establish the nonlinear stability
of these approximations, we investigate nonlinear interactions between
generalized wave patterns. This analysis leads us to a global existence result
for quasilinear hyperbolic systems with source-term, and applies, for instance,
to the compressible Euler equations in general geometries and to hyperbolic
systems posed on a Lorentzian manifold.

corings,bialgebroids and Hopf algebroids (over a non-commutative base algebra)
are systematically recalled and compared.
  In the first version of this paper, the journal version of [15, Theorem 2.6]
was heavily used, in two respects. First, it was applied to establish an
isomorphism between the comodule categories of two constituent bialgebroids in
a Hopf algebroid. Second, it was used to construct a Morita context for any
bicomodule for a coring extension. Regrettably, it turned out that the proof of
[15, Theorem 2.6] contains an unjustified step. Therefore, our derived results
are not expected to hold at the stated level of generality either. In the
revised version we make the necessary corrections in both respects. In doing
so, we obtain a corrected version of \cite[5, Theorem 4.2] as well, whose
original proof contains a very similar error to [15, Theorem 2.6].

commonly attributed to frequent velocity-changing collisions, known to narrow
