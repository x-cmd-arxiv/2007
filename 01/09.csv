  extremely metal-poor stars","8 pages, 9 figures; accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20066232",,"astro-ph",,"  Abundance ratios in extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars are a good indication of
the chemical composition of the gas in the earliest phases of the Galaxy
evolution. It had been found from an LTE analysis that at low metallicity, and
in contrast with most of the other elements, the scatter of [Na/Fe] versus
[Fe/H] was surprisingly large and that, in giants, [Na/Fe] decreased with
metallicity.
  Since it is well known that the formation of sodium lines is very sensitive
to non-LTE effects, to firmly establish the behaviour of the sodium abundance
in the early Galaxy, we have used high quality observations of a sample of EMP
stars obtained with UVES at the VLT, and we have taken into account the non-LTE
line formation of sodium.
  The profiles of the two resonant sodium D lines (only these sodium lines are
detectable in the spectra of EMP stars) have been computed in a sample of 54
EMP giants and turn-off stars (33 of them with [Fe/H]< -3.0) with a modified
version of the code MULTI, and compared to the observed spectra.
  With these new determinations in the range -4 <[Fe/H]< -2.5, both [Na/Fe] and
[Na/Mg] are almost constant with a low scatter. In the turn-off stars and
""unmixed"" giants (located in the low RGB): [Na/Fe] = -0.21 +/- 0.13 or [Na/Mg]
= -0.45 +/- 0.16. These values are in good agreement with the recent
determinations of [Na/Fe] and [Na/Mg] in nearby metal-poor stars. Moreover we
confirm that all the sodium-rich stars are ""mixed"" stars (i.e., giants located
after the bump, which have undergone an extra mixing). None of the turn-off
stars is sodium-rich. As a consequence it is probable that the sodium
enhancement observed in some mixed giants is the result of a deep mixing.

hampered by the difficulty of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for these faint
galaxies. Our ''Gemini Lyman-Alpha at Reionisation Era'' (GLARE) project has
been designed to undertake spectroscopic follow up of faint (z'<28.5) i'-drop
galaxies at z~6 in the HUDF. In a previous paper we presented preliminary
results from the first 7.5 hours of data from GLARE. In this paper we detail
the complete survey. We have now obtained 36 hours of spectroscopy on a single
GMOS slitmask from Gemini-South, with a spectral resolution of
lambda/Delta(lambda) ~ 1000. We identify five strong Lyman-alpha emitters at
z>5.5, and a further nine possible line emitters with detections at lower
significance. We also place tight constraints on the equivalent width of
Lyman-alpha emission for a further ten i'-drop galaxies and examine the
equivalent width distribution of this faint spectroscopic sample of z~6
galaxies. We find that the fraction of galaxies with little or no emission is
similar to that at z~3, but that the z~6 population has a tail of sources with
high rest frame equivalent widths. Possible explanations for this effect
include a tendency towards stronger line emission in faint sources, which may
arise from extreme youth or low metallicity in the Lyman-break population at
high redshift, or possibly a top-heavy initial mass function.

based on well known quantum physics and cosmology. We show that the observed DE
originates from the cosmological quantum vacuum of light particles which
provides a continuous energy distribution able to reproduce the data. Bosons
give positive contributions to the DE while fermions yield negative
contributions. As usual in field theory, ultraviolet divergences are subtracted
from the physical quantities. The subtractions respect the symmetries of the
theory and we normalize the physical quantities to be zero for the Minkowski
vacuum. The resulting finite contributions to the energy density and the
pressure from the quantum vacuum grow as log a(t) where a(t) is the scale
factor, while the particle contributions dilute as 1/a^3(t), as it must be for
massive particles. The DE equation of state P = w(z)H turns to be w(z)<-1 with
w(z) asymptotically reaching the value -1 from below.A scalar particle can
produce the observed DE through its quantum cosmological vacuum provided:(i)its
mass is of the order of 10^{-3} eV = 1 meV,(ii) it is very weakly coupled and
(iii) it is stable on the time scale of the age of the universe. The axion
vacuum thus appears as a natural candidate. The neutrino vacuum (especially the
lightest mass eigenstate) can give negative contributions to the DE. We find
that w(z=0) is slightly below -1 by an amount ranging from [-1.5 10^{-3}] to
[-8 10^{-3}] and we predict the axion mass to be in the range between 4 and 5
meV. We find that the universe will expand in the future faster than the de
Sitter universe, as an exponential in the square of the cosmic time. DE arises
from the quantum vacua of light particles in FRW cosmological space time in an
analogous way to the Casimir effect in Minkowski spacetime with non trivial
boundaries.

problem by allowing dark matter and dark energy to evolve in a similar fashion.
At a fundamental level, these models are specified by choosing a functional
form for the scalar potential and for the interaction term. However, in order
to compare to observational data it is usually more convenient to use
parameterizations of the dark energy equation of state and the evolution of the
dark matter energy density. Once the relevant parameters are fitted it is
important to obtain the shape of the fundamental functions. In this paper I
show how to reconstruct the scalar potential and the scalar interaction with
dark matter from general parameterizations. I give a few examples and show that
it is possible for the effective equation of state for the scalar field to
cross the phantom barrier when interactions are allowed. I analyze the

there is an unusual ``arc''-like structure, which is comprised of a broadband

connected with the intensity dependence of the core component: the stronger
emission arrives earlier and its linear polarization is displaced farther along
the ``kink''. Moreover, at high intensities, the circular polarization is --/+
antisymmetric; the nearly complete positive circular is characteristic of the
weaker, later core subpulses. We find that the ``kink'' emission is associated
with the extraordinary (X) propagation mode, and hence propagation effects do
not appear capable of producing the core component's broadband,
intensity-dependent emission. Rather, the overall evidence points to a largely
geometric interpretation in which the ``kink'' provides a rare glimpse of the
accelerating cascade or height-dependent amplifier responsible for the core
radiation.

interpenetrating fluids in which the gas is treated as a Boussinesq fluid while
the dust is treated as pressureless. The only coupling between both fluid
states is kinematic drag. The channel gas experiences a temperature gradient in
the spanwise direction and it is adverse the constant force of gravity. The
latter effects only the gas and not the dust component which is considered to
free float in the fluid. The channel is also considered on an f-plane so that
the background vorticity gradient can cause any emerging vortex structure to
drift like a Rossby wave. A linear theory analysis is explored and a nonlinear
amplitude theory is developed for disturbances of this arrangement. It is found
that the presence of the dust can help generate and shape emerging convection
patterns and dynamics in the gas so long as the state of the gas exceeds a
suitably defined Rayleigh number appropriate for describing drag effects. In
the linear stage the dust particles collect quickly onto sites in the gas where
the vorticity is minimal, i.e. where the disturbance vorticity is anticylonic
which is consistent with previous studies. The nonlinear theory shows that, in
turn, the local enhancement of dust concentration in the gas effects the vigor
of the emerging convective roll by modifying the effective local Rayleigh
number of the fluid. It is also found that without the f-plane approximation
built into the model the dynamics there is an algebraic runaway caused by
unrestrained growth in the dust concentration. The background vorticity
gradient forces the convective roll to drift like a Rossby wave and this causes
the dust concentration enhancements to not runaway.

Release Four (DR4). The mock surveys are based on two sets of semi-analytic
catalogues presented by Croton et al. and Kang et al. From the mock catalogues,
we measure the redshift-space projected two-point correlation function, the
power spectrum, and the pairwise velocity dispersion (PVD) in Fourier space and
in configuration space, for galaxies in different luminosity intervals. We then
compare these theoretical predictions with the measurements derived from the
SDSS DR4. On large scales and for galaxies brighter than L*, both sets of mock
catalogues agree well with the data. For fainter galaxies, however, both models
predict stronger clustering and higher pairwise velocities than observed. We
demonstrate that this problem can be resolved if the fraction of faint
satellite galaxies in massive haloes is reduced by ~30% compared to the model
predictions. A direct look into the model galaxy catalogues reveals that a
signifcant fraction (15%) of faint galaxies ($-18<M_{^{0.1}r}<-17$) reside in
haloes with $M_{vir}>10^{13}\msun$, and this population is predominantly red in
colour. These faint red galaxies are responsible for the high PVD values of
low-luminosity galaxies on small scales.

the nature of this system. The model for local starburst galaxies suggested by
Mass-Hesse et al. (2003) provides a good description of our data, and suggests
that the galaxy is surrounded by a galactic-scale bi-polar outflow which has
recently burst out of the system. The outflow, which appears to be currently
located >30kpc from the galaxy, is escaping at a speed of upto ~500km/s.
Although the mass of the outflow is uncertain, the geometry and velocity of the
outflow suggests that the ejected material is travelling far faster than escape
velocity and will travel more than 1Mpc (comoving) before eventually stalling.

disks through the asymmetric removal of linear momentum from the star-disk
system. We show that as a result of this interaction, the disk's state of least
energy is not made up of orbits that lie in a plane containing the star's
equator as in a disk without a jet. The disk's profile has the shape of a
sombrero curved in the direction of acceleration. For this novel state of
minimum energy, we derive the temperature profile of thin disks. The flaring
geometry caused by the sombrero profile increases the disk temperature
especially in its outer regions. The jet-induced acceleration disturbs the
vertical equilibrium of the disk leading to mass loss in the form of a
secondary wind emanating from the upper face of the disk. Jet time variability
causes the disk to radially expand or contract depending on whether the induced
acceleration increases or decreases. Jet time variability also excites vertical
motion and eccentric distortions in the disk and affects the sombrero profile's
curvature. These perturbations lead to the heating of the disk through its
viscous stresses as it tries to settle into the varying state of minimum
energy. The jet-disk interaction studied here will help estimate the duration
of the jet episode in star-disk systems and may explain the origin of the
recently observed one-sided molecular outflow of the HH 30 disk-jet system.

Disordered Charge Distribution, as well as the effect of absorption by

free parameters, the shape of the emission spectrum will exhibit very broad
structures which shape will change with the temperature of dust grains in a non
trivial way. The spectral shape also depends upon the parameters describing the

redshift ~4. We show that the BzK-PE criterion is not optimal to select early

contaminated by passively evolving galaxies at red z-Ks colours. We find that

examining how long time it takes a given number of space probes to explore
40,000 stars in a box from -300 to 300 pc above the Galactic thin disk, as a
function of Galactic radius. I then model the Galaxy to consist of
$\sim{}260,000$ of these 40,000 stellar systems all located in a defined
Galactic Habitable Zone and show how long time it takes to explore this zone.
The result is that with 8 probes, each with 8 subprobes $\sim{}4%$ of the

burning of a neutron star into a quark star likely proceeds as a deflagration
and not as a detonation. In that way no strong baryon contamination is produced
near the surface of the star. It is tempting to associate the temporal
structures observed in the light curves with specific processes taking place
inside the compact star. The so-called quiescent times, during which no signal
is emitted in the highest energy band, correspond to pauses during the
processes of readjustment. If the quark (or hybrid) star formed after these
transformations is strongly magnetized and rotates rapidly, a prolonged gamma
emission can be produced, as proposed by Usov years ago. This can explain the
quasi-plateau observed by Swift in several GRBs.

well as fresh Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope observations of HD135344, LkCa 15

young proto-planetary disks to old debris disks. The models self-consistently
calculate the gas chemistry (H/H2 balance) and the thermal structure of UV
irradiated disks. Atomic hydrogen production is dominated by UV irradiation in
transition phase objects as well as debris disks, but for very young disks, HI
production by stellar X-rays (which we do not account for) is important. We use
a simple radiative transfer approach to convert the model disk parameters into
predicted HI 21 cm line maps and spectral profiles. This allows a direct
comparison of the observations to the model. We find that the HI traces the
disk surface layers, and that the Hi emission, if detected, could be used to
study the e ects of irradiation and evaporation, in addition to the kinematics
of the disk. Our models cover massive protoplanetary disks, transition phase
disks and dusty debris disks. In massive protoplanetary disks, UV produced HI
constitutes less than 0.5% of the total disk mass, while X-rays clearly
dominate the chemistry and thus the HI production. For the two such disks that

the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of Taurus BDs. Results: We use Spitzer
color indices, Halpha as an accretion indicator, and models fit to the SEDs in
order to estimate physical parameters of the disks around these BDs. We study
the spatial distribution of BDs with and without disks across the Taurus
aggregates, and we find that BDs with and without disks are not distributed
regularly across the Taurus cloud. Conclusions: We find that 48%+/- 14% of
Taurus BDs have a circumstellar disk signature, a ratio similar to recent
results from previous authors in other regions. We fit the SEDs and find that
none of the disks around BDs in Taurus can be fitted convincingly with a
flaring index beta = 0, indicating that heating by the central object is
efficient and that the disks we observe retain a significant amount of gas. We
find that BDs with disks are proportionally more numerous in the northern
Taurus filament, possibly the youngest filament. We do not find such a clear
segregation for classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) and weak-lined T Tauri stars
(WTTS), suggesting that, in addition to the effects of evolution, any
segregation effects could be related to the mass of the object. A by-product of
our study is to propose a recalibration of the Barrado y Navascues & Martin

fits our data points if it is raised by a factor 1.25-1.30.

extension of the SU(2) gauge theory of the Heisenberg model to the case of the
Hubbard model. Furthermore, we propose the honeycomb lattice Hubbard model (at
half-filling) as a candidate for a spin liquid ground state near the Mott
transition; this is an appealing possibility, as this model can be studied via
quantum Monte Carlo simulation without a sign problem. The pseudospin symmetry
of Hubbard models on bipartite lattices turns out to play a crucial role in our
analysis, and we develop our formalism primarily for the case of a bipartite
lattice. We also sketch its development for a general Hubbard model. We develop
a mean-field theory and apply it to the honeycomb lattice. On the insulating
side of the Mott transition, we find an SU(2) algebraic spin liquid (ASL),
described by gapless S = 1/2 Dirac fermions (spinons) coupled to a fluctuating
SU(2) gauge field. We construct a low-energy effective theory describing the
ASL phase, the conducting semimetal phase and the Mott transition between them.
This physics can be detected in numerical simulations via the simultaneous
presence of substantial antiferromagnetic and valence-bond solid correlations.
Our analysis suggests that both a third-neighbor electron hopping, and/or
pseudospin-breaking terms such as a nearest-neighbor density interaction, may
help to stabilize a spin liquid phase.

sensors engaged in single-hop communication with a base-station. In a
data-gathering network, the spatio-temporal correlation in sensor data induces
data-redundancy. Also, the interaction between two communicating parties is
well-known to reduce the communication complexity. This paper proposes a
formalism that exploits these two opportunities to reduce the number of bits
transmitted by a sensor node in a cluster, hence enhancing its lifetime. We
argue that our approach has several inherent advantages in scenarios where the
sensor nodes are acutely energy and computing-power constrained, but the
base-station is not so. This provides us an opportunity to develop
communication protocols, where most of the computing and communication is done
by the base-station.
  The proposed framework casts the sensor nodes and base-station communication
problem as the problem of multiple informants with correlated information
communicating with a recipient and attempts to extend extant work on
interactive communication between an informant-recipient pair to such
scenarios. Our work makes four major contributions. Firstly, we explicitly show
that in such scenarios interaction can help in reducing the communication
complexity. Secondly, we show that the order in which the informants
communicate with the recipient may determine the communication complexity.
Thirdly, we provide the framework to compute the $m$-message communication
complexity in such scenarios. Lastly, we prove that in a typical sensor network
scenario, the proposed formalism significantly reduces the communication and

sensors that need to transmit data periodically to a base-station. We are
interested in maximizing the lifetime of this network. Even though the setting
of our problem is very simple, it turns out that the solution is far from easy.
The complexity arises from several competing system-level opportunities
available to reduce the energy consumed in radio transmission. First, sensor
data is spatially and temporally correlated. Recent advances in distributed
source-coding allow us to take advantage of these correlations to reduce the
number of transmitted bits, with concomitant savings in energy. Second, it is
also well-known that channel-coding can be used to reduce transmission energy
by increasing transmission time. Finally, sensor nodes are cooperative, unlike
nodes in an ad hoc network that are often modeled as competitive, allowing us
to take full advantage of the first two opportunities for the purpose of
maximizing cluster lifetime. In this paper, we pose the problem of maximizing
lifetime as a max-min optimization problem subject to the constraint of
successful data collection and limited energy supply at each node. By
introducing the notion of instantaneous decoding, we are able to simplify this
optimization problem into a joint scheduling and time allocation problem. We
show that even with our ample simplification, the problem remains NP-hard. We
provide some algorithms, heuristics and insight for various scenarios. Our
chief contribution is to illustrate both the challenges and gains provided by
joint source-channel coding and scheduling.

model, special care must be taken to ensure that messages do not accidentally
overtake one another in the composed program. We show that barriers do not
exist in this model. Indeed, no program that sends or receives messages can
automatically be composed with arbitrary programs without jeopardizing their
intended behavior. Safety of composition becomes context-sensitive and new
tools are needed for ensuring it. A notion of \emph{sealing} is defined, where
if a program $P$ is immediately followed by a program $Q$ that seals $P$ then
$P$ will be communication-closed--it will execute as if it runs in isolation.
The investigation of sealing in this model reveals a novel connection between
Lamport causality and safe composition. A characterization of sealable programs
is given, as well as efficient algorithms for testing if $Q$ seals $P$ and for
constructing a seal for a significant class of programs. It is shown that every

corrections to both the T parameter and the Z b_L \bar{b}_L coupling are
calculable. In general, these corrections are correlated, can be sizable, and
should be considered to determine the allowed parameter space region in models
with warped extra dimensions and custodial symmetry, including Randall-Sundrum
models with a fundamental Higgs, models of gauge-Higgs unification and
Higgsless models. As an example, we derive the constraints that arise on a
representative model of gauge-Higgs unification from a global fit to the
precision electroweak observables. A scan over the parameter space typically
leads to a lower bound on the Kaluza-Klein excitations of the gauge bosons of
about 2-3 TeV, depending on the configuration. In the fermionic sector one can
have Kaluza-Klein excitations with masses of a few hundred GeV. We present the
constraints on these light fermions from recent Tevatron searches, and explore

future galactic core-collapse supernova (SN) may be used to discriminate
between different neutrino mixing scenarios. Most SN neutrinos are emitted in
the accretion and cooling phase, during which the flavor-dependent differences
of the emitted neutrino spectra are small and rather uncertain. Therefore the
discrimination between neutrino mixing scenarios using these neutrinos should
rely on observables independent of the SN neutrino spectra. We discuss two
complementary methods that allow for the positive identification of the mass
hierarchy without knowledge of the emitted neutrino fluxes, provided that the
13-mixing angle is large, $\sin^2\theta_{13}\gg 10^{-5}$. These two approaches
are the observation of modulations in the neutrino spectra by Earth matter
effects or by the passage of shock waves through the SN envelope. If the value
of the 13-mixing angle is unknown, using additionally the information encoded
in the prompt neutronization $\nu_e$ burst--a robust feature found in all
modern SN simulations--can be sufficient to fix both the neutrino hierarchy and
to decide whether $\theta_{13}$ is ``small'' or ``large.''

$1/N_c$ expansion. The standard tool to study baryon properties is the
constituent quark model. The results are naturally model dependent. The $1/N_c$
expansion generates a new perturbative approach to QCD, convenient for low
momentum transfer. It provides a new theoretical method that is quantitative,
systematic and predictive.
  In the first part of the thesis, the $1/N_c$ expansion is introduced as well
as the baryon structure at large $N_c$. A summary of important results for
ground-state baryons is provided.
  The second part of the thesis is devoted to excited baryon states. The
symmetric orbital states are treated by analogy to the ground state. For mixed
symmetric states, two approaches are presented. The traditional one starts from
the decoupling of the wave function into an excited quark and a symmetric core.
To make the problem tractable the wave function is treated approximately,
justified by a Hartree scheme. This approach is applied to the study of the
$[{\bf 70},\ell^+] (\ell=0,2)$ multiplets (nonstrange and strange cases) and of
the $[{\bf 56},4^+]$ multiplet. An important physical result is the dependence
of the spin dependent terms of the mass operator on the excitation energy.
  Recently we suggested a new approach based on a rigorous group theoretical
treatment of the matrix elements of SU(4). No decoupling and no approximations
are necessary. When applied to the $[{\bf 70},1^-]$ nonstrange multiplet, it is
found that the leading corrections to the mass operator are of order $1/N_c$
instead of $N_c^0$, as predicted by the decoupling procedure.

the dual string description in which the corresponding string is on the curved

on along the brane worldvolume the Wilson loop always shows a Coulomb phase, as
studied in the previous literature. We extend the examination to the theory
with a non-constant B field, which duals to the gauge theory with non-constant
non-commutativity, and re-examine the theory in the presence of a nonzero B
field with one leg along the brane worldvolume and other transverse to it,

modify the Coulomb type potential in IR it may produce a strong repulsive force
between the quark and anti-quark if they are close enough. In particular, we
find that there presents a minimum distance between the quarks and that the
distance is proportional to the value of the non-commutativity, exhibiting the

$Spin(2,{\mathbb H})$, in which the charge conjugation transformation becomes
linear in the quaternionic Dirac spinor, it is shown that the Hermiticity
requirement of the Dirac Lagrangian, together with the persistent presence of
the Pauli-G\""ursey SU(2) group, requires an additional imaginary unit (taken to
be the ordinary one, $i$) that commutes with Hamilton's units, in the theory. A
second quantization is performed with this $i$ incorporated into the theory,
and we recover the conventional Dirac theory with an automatic
`anti-symmetrization' of the field operators. It is also pointed out that we
are naturally led to the scheme of complex quaternions, ${\mathbb H}^c$, in
which a space-time point is represented by a Hermitian quaternion, and that the
isomorphism $SL(1,{\mathbb H}^c)/Z_2\cong L_+^\uparrow$ is a direct consequence
of the fact $Spin(2,{\mathbb H})/Z_2\cong L_+^\uparrow$. Using $SL(1,{\mathbb

equations over a division ring has properties similar to properties of a system
of linear equations over a field. However, noncommutativity of a product
creates a new picture.
  Matrices allow two products linked by transpose. Biring is algebra which
defines on the set two correlated structures of the ring.
  As in the commutative case, solutions of a system of linear equations build
up right or left vector space depending on type of system. We study vector
spaces together with the system of linear equations because their properties
have a close relationship. As in a commutative case, the group of automorphisms
of a vector space has a single transitive representation on a frame manifold.
This gives us an opportunity to introduce passive and active representations.

relationship between passive and active transformations, makes this picture

homotopically unique provided that we consider unital operads which come
equipped with a distinguished 0-ary operation that represents the natural unit
of the bar complex. Our constructions rely on a Reedy model category for unital
Hopf operads. For our purpose we define a unital Hopf endomorphism operad which
operates functorially on the bar complex and which is universal with this

properties. To conclude this memoir we hint how to make our constructions

yield some of the most interesting theoretic and applied scientific results
along the forthcoming decades. The present work addresses a particularly
important related aspect, namely the quantification of how well separated can
the attractors be in dynamic systems underlined by four types of complex
networks (Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, Barab\'asi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz and as well as a
geographic model). Attention is focused on grandmother dynamic systems, where
each state variable (associated to each node) is used to represent a specific
prototype pattern (attractor). By assuming that the attractors spread their
influence among its neighboring nodes through a diffusive process, it is
possible to overlook the specific details of specific dynamics and focus
attention on the separability among such attractors. This property is defined
in terms of two separation indices (one individual to each prototype and the
other considering also the immediate neighborhood) reflecting the balance and
proximity to attractors revealed by the activation of the network after a
diffusive process. The separation index considering also the neighborhood was
found to be much more informative, while the best separability was observed for
the Watts-Strogatz and the geographic models. The effects of the involved
parameters on the separability were investigated by correlation and path
analyses. The obtained results suggest the special importance of some
measurements in underlying the relationship between topology and dynamics.

gas or plasma at ultra-low pressure can be strongly reduced by applying an
Extra Low-Frequency (ELF) electromagnetic field across the gas or the plasma.
This Gravitational Shielding Effect is related to recent discovery of quantum
correlation between gravitational mass and inertial mass. According to the
theory samples hung above the gas or the plasma should exhibit a weight
decrease when the frequency of the electromagnetic field is decreased or when
the intensity of the electromagnetic field is increased. This Gravitational
Shielding Effect is unprecedented in the literature and can not be understood
in the framework of the General Relativity. From the technical point of view,
there are several applications for this discovery; possibly it will change the
paradigms of energy generation, transportation and telecommunications.

sedimentation, condensation/evaporation, and stochastic coalescence. The
methodology to couple super-droplets and a non-hydrostatic model is also

stochastic coalescence of super-droplets agrees fairly well with the solutions
of the stochastic coalescence equation. The behavior of the model is evaluated
using a simple test problem, that of a shallow maritime cumulus formation
initiated by a warm bubble. Possible extensions of SDM are briefly discussed. A
theoretical analysis suggests that the computational cost of SDM becomes lower
than the spectral (bin) method when the number of attributes - the variables
that identify the state of each super-droplet - becomes larger than some
critical value, which we estimate to be in the range $2\sim4$.

gravitation: A continuous warped space, wave-like, and a discrete quantum gas,
particle-like, both coexistent and producing an equilibrium state in the
Universe. The result is a static, non expanding, spherical, unlimited and
finite Universe, with no cosmological constant and no dark energy. The
Principle of Mach is reproduced here by the convergence of the two cosmological
equations of Einstein. From this a Mass Boom concept is born given by M = t, M
the mass of the Universe and t its age. Also a decreasing speed of light is the
consequence of the Mass Boom, c = 1/t, which explains the Supernovae Type Ia
observations without the need of expansion (nor, of course, accelerated
expansion). Our Mass Boom model completely wipes out the problems and paradoxes
built in the Big Bang model, like the horizon, monopole, entropy, flatness,
fine tuning, etc. It also eliminates the need for inflation. Finally the
relation proposed by Weinberg in 1972 is here explained in terms of a
gravitational cross section for all gravitational masses.

particularly useful for studying social systems. The first one concerns the
discovery of some basic dynamical laws that enable the emergence of the
fundamental features observed in social networks, namely the nontrivial
clustering properties, the existence of positive degree correlations and the
subdivision into communities. To reproduce all these features we describe a
simple model of mobile colliding agents, whose collisions define the
connections between the agents which are the nodes in the underlying network,
and develop some analytical considerations. The second point addresses the
particular feature of clustering and its relationship with global network
measures, namely with the distribution of the size of cycles in the network.
Since in social bipartite networks it is not possible to measure the clustering
from standard procedures, we propose an alternative clustering coefficient that
can be used to extract an improved normalized cycle distribution in any
network. Finally, the third point addresses dynamical processes occurring on
networks, namely when studying the propagation of information in them. In
particular, we focus on the particular features of gossip propagation which
impose some restrictions in the propagation rules. To this end we introduce a
quantity, the spread factor, which measures the average maximal fraction of
nearest neighbors which get in contact with the gossip, and find the striking
result that there is an optimal non-trivial number of friends for which the
spread factor is minimized, decreasing the danger of being gossiped.

termed latency or lysogeny. When in a latent state, the virus is unable to
replicate, and its gene expression program is largely shut down. This facility
for lying dormant typically ensures lifelong persistence of the virus in the
host; it is also a particularly problematic obstacle in the treatment of HIV.
For most viruses, the molecular regulation of entry into latency is not
completely understood, but it is believed that viral gene expression must be
deactivated in some way. In this study, we introduce a new regulatory motif,
the feedback resistor, that enables a genetic circuit to shut off without the
need for an active repressor molecule. We first show that many animal viruses
might encode feedback resistors in their regulatory circuits. Then, by using a
combination of mathematical theory and single-cell real-time imaging
experiments, we show that a feedback resistor in the HIV Tat transcriptional
circuit likely allows the HIV virus to enter into latency. We postulate that
feedback resistors may give increased stability and control in the complex
noisy signaling environment of the cell.

nondissipative optical lattice is developed. Using the basic equations of
motion for the Bloch and translational atomic variables, we derive a stochastic
map for the synchronized component of the atomic dipole moment that determines
the center-of-mass motion. We find the analytical relations between the atomic
and lattice parameters under which atoms typically alternate between flying
through the lattice and being trapped in the wells of the optical potential. We
use the stochastic map to derive formulas for the probability density functions
(PDFs) for the flight and trapping events. Statistical properties of chaotic
atomic transport strongly depend on the relations between the atomic and
lattice parameters. We show that there is a good quantitative agreement between
the analytical PDFs and those computed with the stochastic map and the basic
equations of motion for different ranges of the parameters. Typical flight and
trapping PDFs are shown to be broad distributions with power law ``heads'' with
the slope -1.5 and exponential ``tails''. The lengths of the power law and
exponential parts of the PDFs depend on the values of the parameters and can be
varied continuously. We find analytical conditions, under which deterministic
atomic transport has fractal properties, and explain a hierarchical structure
of the dynamical fractals.

interesting questions of interpretation. Coherent laser light is passed through
a converging lens and then through a dual pinhole producing two beams crossing
over at the focal point of the lens, and fully separating further downstream
providing which-way information. A thin wire is then placed at a minimum of the
interference pattern formed at the cross-over region. No significant reduction
in the total flux or resolution of the separated beams is found, providing
evidence for coexistence of perfect interference and which-way information in
the same experiment, contrary to the common readings of Bohr's principle of
complementarity. This result further supports the conclusions of the original
experiment by the author in which an imaging lens was employed to obtain
which-way information. Finally, a short discussion of the novel
non-perturbative measurement technique for ensemble properties is offered.

Comments are welcome","JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS 49, 012105 (2008)","10.1063/1.2830978",,"quant-ph",,"  We settle the so-called degree conjecture for the separability of
multipartite quantum states, which are normalized graph Laplacians, first given
by Braunstein {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{73}, 012320 (2006)]. The
conjecture states that a multipartite quantum state is separable if and only if
the degree matrix of the graph associated with the state is equal to the degree
matrix of the partial transpose of this graph. We call this statement to be the
strong form of the conjecture. In its weak version, the conjecture requires
only the necessity, that is, if the state is separable, the corresponding
degree matrices match. We prove the strong form of the conjecture for {\it
pure} multipartite quantum states, using the modified tensor product of graphs
defined in [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. \textbf{40}, 10251 (2007)], as both
necessary and sufficient condition for separability. Based on this proof, we
give a polynomial-time algorithm for completely factorizing any pure
multipartite quantum state. By polynomial-time algorithm we mean that the
execution time of this algorithm increases as a polynomial in $m,$ where $m$ is
the number of parts of the quantum system. We give a counter-example to show
that the conjecture fails, in general, even in its weak form, for multipartite
mixed states. Finally, we prove this conjecture, in its weak form, for a class
of multipartite mixed states, giving only a necessary condition for
separability.

distance on error-correction encoded states of logical qubits, such as the
transfer of qubits via teleportation. We evaluate the performance of several
quantum error correction codes, and find that teleportation failure rates of
one percent or more are tolerable when two levels of the [[23,1,7]] code are
used. We present an analysis of performing quantum error correction (QEC) on
QEC-encoded states that span two quantum computers, including the creation of
distributed logical zeroes. The transfer of the individual qubits of a logical
state may be multiplexed in time or space, moving serially across a single
link, or in parallel across multiple links. We show that the performance and
reliability penalty for using serial links is small for a broad range of
physical parameters, making serial links preferable for a large, distributed
quantum multicomputer when engineering difficulties are considered. Such a
multicomputer will be able to factor a 1,024-bit number using Shor's algorithm
with a high probability of success.
