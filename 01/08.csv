interact very weakly with matter. The detection of neutrinos emitted by the Sun

evolution and led to modifications of the standard model describing the
properties of elementary particles. At present, several very large neutrino
detectors are being constructed, aiming at the detection of the most powerful
sources of energy and particles in the universe. The hope is that the detection
of neutrinos from these sources, which are extra-Galactic and are most likely
powered by mass accretion onto black-holes, will not only allow study of the

interferometer (correlations between antennas) are indirectly related to a sky
brightness image. In a real sense, algorithms and computers are the lenses of a
radio interferometer. In the last 20 years, whereas interferometer hardware
advances have resulted in improvements of a factor of a few, algorithm and
computer advances have resulted in orders of magnitude improvement in image
quality. Developing these algorithms has been a fruitful and comparatively
inexpensive method of improving the performance of existing telescopes, and has
made some newer telescopes possible. In this paper, we review recent
developments in the algorithms used in the imaging part of the reduction
process. What constitutes an `imaging algorithm'? Whereas once there was a
steady `forward' progression in the reduction process of editing, calibrating,
transforming and, finally, deconvolving, this is no longer true. The
introduction of techniques such as self-calibration, and algorithms that go
directly from visibilities to final images, have made the dividing lines less
clear. Although we briefly consider self-calibration, for the purposes of this
paper calibration issues are generally excluded. Most attention will be
directed to the steps which form final images from the calibrated visibilities.

this paper, we focus our attention on the effects by photodissociative

perform three dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations on this issue as
well as analytic estimates, paying special attention on the self-shielding
effect and dynamics of the star-forming cloud. As a result, we find that the
ignition timing of the source star is crucial. If the ignition is later than
the epoch when the central density of the collapsing cloud exceeds $\sim
10^3-10^4{\rm cm^{-3}}$, the collapse cannot be reverted, even if the source
star is located at $\la$ 100pc. The uncertainty of the critical density comes
from the variety of initial conditions of the collapsing cloud. We also find
the analytic criteria for a cloud to collapse with given central density,
temperature and the Lyman-Werner(LW) band flux which irradiates the cloud.
  Although we focus on the radiation from neighbor stars, this result can also
be applied to the effects of diffuse LW radiation field, that is expected to be
built up prior to the reionization of the universe. We find that
self-gravitating clouds can easily self-shield from diffuse LW radiation and
continue their collapse for densities larger than $\sim 10^3 {\rm cm^{-3}}$.

searched for in the deep X-ray images and 14 additional galaxies are detected

modelling their SEDs based on the available multi-wavelength photometry,
including X-ray, UV, optical, near-IR, MIR and radio fluxes, and optical
spectroscopy. The amount of dust derived from the IR emission observed by
Spitzer appears in excess of that expected by mass loss from evolved stars. Our
analysis of the X-ray and MIR properties leads us to conclude that at least 8

undetected sources are more likely dominated by star formation. [abridged] We
conclude that ~30 objects (~20%) of the original flux-limited sample of 168
spheroidal galaxies in the GOODS-North are detected during phases of prominent
activity, of both stellar and quasar origin. Due to the short expected
lifetimes of the IR and X-ray emissions, this fraction might imply a
significant level of activity in this class of galaxies during the relatively
recent cosmic epochs, z~0.3 to z~1, under investigation.

members among the about 130 stars observed. Combined with the UVES data
obtained with the same observations, high dispersion abundance analyses are now
available for a total of 30 stars in NGC 6441, 29 of them having data for both

was taken to minimize the impact of the differential interstellar reddening
throughout the cluster, and to extract reliable information from crowded, and
moderately high S/N (30-70), moderately high resolution (R ~ 23,000) spectra.
NGC 6441 is very metal-rich ([Fe/H]=$-0.34\pm 0.02\pm0.04$ dex). There is no
clear sign of star-to-star scatter in the Fe-peak elements. The alpha-elements
Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti are overabundant by rather large factors, suggesting that
the cluster formed from material enriched by massive core collapse SNe. The

data from the High Energy Transmission Gratings (HETGs) onboard Chandra. UV and
optical data from the Optical Monitor (OM) onboard XMM-Newton are also included
in the analysis. The broad band spectrum is well described by an unabsorbed
power law and three unresolved Fe~K lines in the 6-7 keV range. The presence of
a Compton reflection component and a narrow Fe K line at 6.4 keV is consistent
with an origin via torus reflection. The ionised Fe lines at ~6.7 and 7 keV are
instead most likely originated by scattering on a warm and ionised gas. The
soft X-ray spectrum appears to be almost featureless due to the very bright
continuum emission, except for one emission line identified as OVIII Ly alpha
detected at ~19 Angstrom by both RGS and Chandra-MEG. The emerging picture
consists of an active nucleus seen directly on a ""clean"" line of sight without
intervening material, surrounded by photoionised circumnuclear gas at a high
ionisation level.
  We also study three serendipitous sources in the field of view of Chandra and
XMM-Newton. One of these sources may be identified with an ULX of L_{0.3-10
keV}~10^{40} ergs/s.

periods, projected equatorial velocities and distance-dependent radius
estimates are used to form an observational sin i distribution (where i is the
axial inclination), which is modelled to obtain the distance estimate. A
distance of 440+/-34 pc is found from a sample of 74 PMS stars with spectral
types between G6 and M2, but this falls to 392+/-32 pc when PMS stars with
accretion discs are excluded on the basis of their near-infrared excess. Since
the radii of accreting stars are more uncertain and probably systematically
underestimated, then this closer distance is preferred. The quoted
uncertainties include statistical errors and uncertainties due to a number of
systematic effects including binarity and inclination bias. This method is
geometric and independent of stellar evolution models, though does rely on the
assumption of random axial orientations and the Cohen & Kuhi (1979) effective
temperature scale for PMS stars. The new distance is consistent with, although
lower and more precise, than most previous ONC distance estimates. A closer ONC
distance implies smaller luminosities and an increased age based on the
positions of PMS stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.

morphologies and tidal features provides us with a more confident assessment of
galaxy interactions from this sample. We notice that, at a given luminosity or
stellar mass content, the fraction of AGNs is larger for pair galaxies
exhibiting evidence for strong interaction and tidal features which also show
sings of strong star formation activity. Nevertheless, this process accounts
only for a $\sim 10%$ increase of the fraction of AGNs. As in previous works,
we find AGN hosts to be redder and with a larger concentration morphological
index than non-AGN galaxies. This effect does not depend whether AGN hosts are
in pairs or in isolation. The OIII luminosity of AGNs with strong interaction
features is found to be significantly larger than that of other AGNs, either in
pairs or in isolation. Estimations of the accretion rate, $L[OIII]/M_{BH}$,
show that AGNs in merging pairs are actively feeding their black holes,
regardless of their stellar masses. We also find that the luminosity of the
companion galaxy seems to be a key parameter in the determination of the black
hole activity. At a given host luminosity, both the OIII luminosity and the

observed redshift distributions is only partially explained by the different
thresholds of the detectors and it may indicate strong selection effects. After
trying different forms of the star formation rate (SFR) we find that the
observed Swift redshift distribution, with more observed high redshift bursts
than expected, is inconsistent with a GRB rate that simply follows current
models for the SFR. We show that this can be explained by GRB evolution beyond

luminosity function evolves and earlier bursts were more luminous or if strong

$8.81\times10^{-5}pc^{-3}$ and the formation rate is $2.579\times
10^{-13}pc^{-3}yr^{-1}$. The statistical properties of the SDSS DA WD sample
are generally in good agreement with previous observational and theoretical
studies, and provide us information on the formation and evolution of WDs.
However, a larger and more complete all-sky WD sample is still needed to
explain some subtle disagreements and unresolved issues.

synthetic-spectrum code SYNOW are compared to spectra of the unusual Type Ib
supernova 2005bf. We confirm the discovery by Folatelli et al. (2006) that very
early spectra (about 30 days before maximum light) contain both
photospheric-velocity (8000 km/s) features of He I, Ca II, and Fe II, and
detached high-velocity (14,000 km/s) features of H-alpha, Ca II, and Fe II. An
early spectrum of SN 2005bf is an almost perfect match to a near-maximum-light
spectrum of the Type Ib SN 1999ex. Although these two spectra were at very
different times with respect to maximum light (20 days before maximum for SN
2005bf and five days after for SN 1999ex), they were for similar times after
explosion - about 20 days for SN 2005bf and 24 days for SN 1999ex. The almost
perfect match clinches the previously suggested identification of H-alpha in SN
1999ex and supports the proposition that many if not all Type Ib supernovae
eject a small amount of hydrogen. The earliest available spectrum of SN 2005bf
resembles a near-maximum-light spectrum of the Type Ic SN 1994I. These two
spectra also were at different times with respect to maximum light (32 days
before maximum for SN 2005bf and four days before for SN 1994I) but at similar
times after explosion - about eight days for SN 2005bf and 10 days for SN
1994I. The resemblance motivates us to consider a reinterpretation of the
spectra of Type Ic supernovae, involving coexisting photospheric-velocity and
high-velocity features. The implications of our results for the geometry of the
SN 2005bf ejecta, which has been suggested to be grossly asymmetric, are
briefly discussed.

  Methods: We carried out new photometric and spectroscopic observations of
five bright (V<10.5 mag) close eclipsing binaries, predominantly in the
southern skies. We obtained full Johnson BV light curves, which were modelled
with the Wilson-Devinney code. Radial velocities were measured with the
cross-correlation method using IAU radial velocity standards as spectral
templates. Period changes were studied with the O-C method, utilising published
epochs of minimum light (XY Leo) and ASAS photometry (VZ Lib).
  Results: For three objects (DX Tuc, QY Hya, V870 Ara), absolute parameters
have been determined for the first time. We detect spectroscopically the
tertiary components in XY Leo, VZ Lib and discover one in QY Hya. For XY Leo we
update the light-time effect parameters and detect a secondary periodicity of
about 5100 d in the O$-$C diagram that may hint about the existence of
short-period magnetic cycles. A combination of recent photometric data shows
that the orbital period of the tertiary star in VZ Lib is likely to be over
1500 d. QY Hya is a semi-detached X-ray active binary in a triple system with K
and M-type components, while V870 Ara is a contact binary with the third
smallest spectroscopic mass-ratio for a W UMa star to date (q=0.082+/-0.030).
This small mass-ratio, being close to the theoretical minimum for contact
binaries, suggests that V870 Ara has the potential of constraining evolutionary
scenarios of binary mergers. The inferred distances to these systems are
compatible with the Hipparcos parallaxes.

extension of both the blind source deconvolution (BSD) and the independent
subspace analysis (ISA) tasks. We examine the case of the undercomplete BSSD
(uBSSD). Applying temporal concatenation we reduce this problem to ISA. The
associated `high dimensional' ISA problem can be handled by a recent technique
called joint f-decorrelation (JFD). Similar decorrelation methods have been
used previously for kernel independent component analysis (kernel-ICA). More
precisely, the kernel canonical correlation (KCCA) technique is a member of
this family, and, as is shown in this paper, the kernel generalized variance
(KGV) method can also be seen as a decorrelation method in the feature space.

game where the players located on a square lattice can either cooperate with
their nearest neighbors or defect. In every generation, each player updates its
strategy by firstly choosing one of the neighbors with a probability
proportional to $\mathcal{A}^\alpha$ denoting the attractiveness of the
neighbor, where $\mathcal{A}$ is the payoff collected by it and $\alpha$
($\geq$0) is a free parameter characterizing the extent of the nonlinear
effect; and then adopting its strategy with a probability dependent on their
payoff difference. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the density
$\rho_C$ of cooperators in the stationary state for different values of
$\alpha$. It is shown that the introduction of such attractive effect
remarkably promotes the emergence and persistence of cooperation over a wide
range of the temptation to defect. In particular, for large values of $\alpha$,
i.e., strong nonlinear attractive effects, the system exhibits two absorbing
states (all cooperators or all defectors) separated by an active state
(coexistence of cooperators and defectors) when varying the temptation to
defect. In the critical region where $\rho_C$ goes to zero, the extinction
behavior is power law-like $\rho_C$ $\sim$ $(b_c-b)^{\beta}$, where the
exponent $\beta$ accords approximatively with the critical exponent

identification in mammograms has been developed in the framework of the
EU-founded MammoGrid project. The CADe software is mainly based on wavelet
transforms and artificial neural networks. It is able to identify
microcalcifications in different datasets of mammograms (i.e. acquired with
different machines and settings, digitized with different pitch and bit depth
or direct digital ones). The CADe can be remotely run from GRID-connected
acquisition and annotation stations, supporting clinicians from geographically
distant locations in the interpretation of mammographic data. We report and
discuss the system performances on different datasets of mammograms and the
status of the GRID-enabled CADe analysis.

show fluctuations which decrease in amplitude when approaching the
double-ionisation threshold. Based on semiclassical closed orbit theory, we
show that the algebraic decay of the fluctuations can be characterised in terms
of a threshold law $\sigma \propto |E|^{\mu}$ as $E \to 0_-$ with exponent
$\mu$ obtained as a combination of stability exponents of the triple-collision
singularity. It differs from Wannier's exponent dominating double ionisation
processes. The details of the fluctuations are linked to a set of infinitely
unstable classical orbits starting and ending in the non-regularisable triple
collision. The findings are compared with quantum calculations for a model
system, namely collinear helium.

(linguistic agents) on a scale-free network, using Monte Carlo simulations and
assumptions from evolutionary game theory. It is known that when the agents are
arranged in a two-dimensional lattice structure and interact by diffusion and
encounter, then their final vocabulary size is the maximum possible. Knowing
all available words is essential in order to increase the probability to
``survive'' by effective reproduction. On scale-free networks we find a
different result. It is not necessary to learn the entire vocabulary available.
Survival chances are increased by using the vocabulary of the ``hubs'' (nodes
with high degree). The existence of the ``hubs'' in a scale-free network is the
source of an additional important fitness generating mechanism.

source periodically emits an entangled state of three particles whose
properties are analyzed by three distant observers and used to prove Bell's
nonlocality theorem. This paper analyzes a somewhat different gedanken
experiment involving only two observers that nevertheless makes indirect use of
the GHZ states to prove Bell's theorem. The relationship of the GHZM proof to
the present one is discussed, and it is pointed out that the latter provides an
interesting new view of the connection between the ""two theorems of John Bell"".

characteristic phase space patterns of the WF found in the absence of disorder.
