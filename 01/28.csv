  between Counter-Helical Fluxes?","Solar Physics, 2007, in press",,"10.1007/s11207-006-0316-x",,"astro-ph",,"  Vector magnetograms taken at Huairou Solar Observing Station (HSOS) and Mees
Solar Observatory (MSO) reveal that the super active region (AR) NOAA 10486 was
a complex region containing current helicity flux of opposite signs. The main
positive sunspots were dominated by negative helicity fields, while positive
helicity patches persisted both inside and around the main positive sunspots.
Based on a comparison of two days of deduced current helicity density,
pronounced changes were noticed which were associated with the occurrence of an
X10 flare that peaked at 20:49 UT, 2003 October 29. The average current
helicity density (negative) of the main sunspots decreased significantly by
about 50. Accordingly, the helicity densities of counter-helical patches
(positive) were also found to decay by the same proportion or more. In
addition, two hard X-ray (HXR) `footpoints' were observed by the Reuven Ramaty
High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI} during the flare in the 50-100
keV energy range. The cores of these two HXR footpoints were adjacent to the
positions of two patches with positive current helicity which disappeared after
the flare. This strongly suggested that the X10 flare on 2003 Oct. 29 resulted
from reconnection between magnetic flux tubes having opposite current helicity.
Finally, the global decrease of current helicity in AR 10486 by ~50% can be
understood as the helicity launched away by the halo coronal mass ejection
(CME) associated with the X10 flare.

derived from low order statistics of supersonic turbulence, neglecting gravity
(e.g. gravitational fragmentation, accretion and merging). In this work the
predictions of that model are tested using the largest numerical experiments of
supersonic hydrodynamic (HD) and magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence to date
(~1000^3 computational zones) and three different codes (Enzo, Zeus and the
Stagger Code). The model predicts a power law distribution for large masses,
related to the turbulence energy power spectrum slope, and the shock jump
conditions. This power law mass distribution is confirmed by the numerical
experiments. The model also predicts a sharp difference between the HD and MHD
regimes, which is recovered in the experiments as well, implying that the
magnetic field, even below energy equipartition on the large scale, is a
crucial component of the process of turbulent fragmentation. These results
suggest that the stellar IMF of primordial stars may differ from that in later
epochs of star formation, due to differences in both gas temperature and
magnetic field strength. In particular, we find that the IMF of primordial
stars born in turbulent clouds may be narrowly peaked around a mass of order 10
solar masses, as long as the column density of such clouds is not much in
excess of 10^22 cm^-2.

Twist is computed from a formula recently derived by Berger and Prior [J. Phys.

helicity is proportional to the sum of twist and writhe. The writhe number is
proportional to the total torsion and to integrals of the vector potential. The
magnetic energy is computed in terms of the integral of the torsion squared
which allows us to place a bound to energy in in the case of helical filaments
due to a theorem by Fukumoto [J. Phys. Soc. Japan,(1987)] in fluid vortex
filaments. It is also shown that filament torsion coincides with the magnetic
twist in the case under consideration, where a small orthogonal magnetic field
exist along the thin filament. A new Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase term is obtained
in the writhe number expression which is not present in the Moffatt-Ricca (Proc

at higher redshift, mimicking LSBs due to the ''Tolman Dimming'' effect, we
placed a lower diameter limit of 10.8 arcsec and compared the colors of our
candidate galaxies with the redshift tracks of 5 ''standard'' HSB galaxy types.
We report the detection of 37 galaxies with low apparent central surface

derive a subsample of 9 LSB galaxy candidates with intrinsic central surface
brightnesses below mu_(0,BW)=22.5 magarcsec^-2 and diameters larger than the
preselected size limit of 10.8 arcsec. We selected three additional LSB

  This allows the formation of four intermediate states enclosed by two
outermost fast discontinuities and separated by two rotational waves and an
entropy mode.
  In the present work, a corresponding derivation for the isothermal

a power law distribution. It is shown that the statistics of eigenvalues of the

the frequency of the peak decreases and the width increases. Furthermore, the

function of the frequency. The extrema diverge at the Vogel-Fulcher temperature
$T_0$. The temperature dependence of the extrema changes significantly near

stop masses in production/decay processes which requires knowledge of masses
and mixing angles of other superparticles, the strategy depends little on
supersymmetric parameters other than those in the stop sector in a large region
of parameter space. We show that measurements of the Higgs mass and the
production rate in the gluon fusion channel, the dominant channel at the LHC,
allow for determination of two parameters in the stop mass-squared matrix,
including the off-diagonal mixing term. This proposal is very effective when
stops are light and their mixing is large, which coincides with the region
where the electroweak symmetry breaking is minimally fine tuned. We also argue
that a lightest CP-even Higgs mass in the upper range of allowed values and a
production rate significantly smaller than in the standard model would be
difficult to reconcile within the MSSM, except in extreme corners of the
