absorption and corresponding Si IV, C IV, and N V in a Very Large
Telescope/Ultraviolet-Visible Echelle Spectrograph (VLT/UVES) sample of 35 DLA
systems with data covering O VI at S/N>10. We report twelve DLAs (nine
intervening and three at <5000 km/s from the QSO redshift) with detections of O
VI absorption. There are no clear O VI non-detections, so the incidence of O VI
in DLAs is between 34% (12/35) and 100%. Analysis of the line widths together
with photoionization modelling suggests that two phases of DLA plasma exist: a
hot, collisionally ionized phase (seen in broad O VI components), and a warm,
photoionized phase (seen just in narrow C IV and Si IV components). We find
tentative evidence (98% confidence) for correlations between the DLA
metallicity (measured in the neutral gas) and high-ion column density, and
between the DLA metallicity and high-ion line width, as would be expected if
supernova-driven galactic outflows rather than accretion produced the high
ions. Using conservative ionization corrections, we find lower limits to the
total hydrogen column densities in the hot (O VI-bearing) and warm (C
IV-bearing) phases in the range log N(Hot H II) >19.5 to >21.1, and log N(Warm
H II) >19.4 to >20.9. On average, the hot and warm phases thus contain >40% and
>20% of the baryonic mass of the neutral phase in DLAs, respectively. If the
temperature in the O VI phase is ~10^6 K and so f(O VI)=O VI/O<<0.2 the plasma
can make a significant contribution to the metal budget at high redshift.

empirically-motivated recipes for feedback in galaxy formation. Model results
are in good agreement with the observed luminosity functions and stellar mass
function for galaxies in the local Universe. In particular, the new scheme
predicts a number density of dwarfs that is lower than in previous models. This
is a consequence of a new feature of the model, that allows an estimate of the
amount of mass and metals that haloes can permanently deposit into the IGM.
This loss of material leads to the suppression of star formation in small
haloes and therefore to the decrease in the number density of dwarf galaxies.
The model is able to reproduce the observed mass-stellar metallicity and
luminosity-gas metallicity relationships. This demonstrates that our scheme
provides a significant improvement in the treatment of the feedback in dwarf
galaxies. Despite these successes, our model does not reproduce the observed
bimodality in galaxy colours and predicts a larger number of bright galaxies
than observed. Finally, we investigate the efficiency of metal injection in
winds and in the intergalactic medium. We find that galaxies that reside in
haloes with M_vir < 10^12 M_sun/h may deposit most of their metal mass into the
intergalactic medium, while groups and clusters at z=0 have lost at most a few
percent of their metals before the bulk of the halo mass was accreted.

material moving at relativistic speeds close to the black hole. There are
currently two potential geometries for this material, one where it is out of
the line of sight, seen via reflection, e.g. the accretion disc, the other
where it is in the line of sight, seen in absorption e.g. a wind above the
disc. Both models require apparent fine tuning of the ionization parameter of
this material in order to produce the large jump in opacity at $\sim 0.7$ keV
associated with OVII/VIII, as required to make the soft excess. However,
Chevalier et al (2006) show that these states rather naturally dominate the
absorption spectrum for soft X-ray spectra if the illuminated material is (at
least approximately) in pressure balance. Here we explore whether hydrostatic
pressure equilibrium in a disc can likewise naturally select the required
ionization states in reflection. We find the opposite. The soft excess X-ray
excess is much weaker in the hydrostatic models than it is in the constant
density models. Since even the constant density models cannot fit the largest
soft excesses seen without the intrinsic continuum being hidden from view, this
means that reflection from a hydrostatic disc cannot realistically match the
data. Even if the disc structure is instead more like a constant density
atmosphere, the required fine--tuning of the ionization parameter still remains
a problem for reflection models.

be in excess of ~10^5 Msun, in the range spanned by young extragalactic star

of its stellar population feasible. It is therefore the ultimate template for a
young, massive star cluster, permitting direct comparison of its properties
with measurements of velocity dispersion and dynamical mass for spatially
unresolved extragalactic clusters.
  To this end, we used the long slit near-infrared spectrograph VLT/ISAAC to
observe the CO bandhead region near 2.29 micron scanning the slit across the
cluster centre during the integration. Spatially collapsing the spectra along
the slit results in a single co-added spectrum of the cluster, comparable to
what one would obtain in the extragalactic cluster context.
  This spectrum was analysed the same way as the spectra of almost point-like
extragalactic clusters, using red superiant cluster members as velocity
templates.
  We detected four red supergiants which are included in the integrated

cluster size of 0.86 pc, derived from archival near-infrared SOFI-NTT images,
this yields a dynamical mass of 6.3x10^4 Msun. While this value is not to be

by distributed burning provided that a deflagration to detonation transition
does not set in. Apart from the two-dimensional study by Roepke & Hillebrandt
(2005), very little attention has been payed so far to the correct treatment of
this burning regime in numerical simulations. In this article, the physics of
distributed burning is reviewed from the literature on terrestrial combustion
and differences which arise from the very small Prandtl numbers encountered in
degenerate matter are pointed out. Then it is shown that the level set method
continues to be applicable beyond the flamelet regime as long as the width of
the flame brush does not become smaller than the numerical cutoff length.
Implementing this constraint with a simple parameterisation of the effect of
turbulence onto the energy generation rate, the production of intermediate mass
elements increases substantially compared to previous simulations, in which the
burning process was stopped once the mass density dropped below 10^7 g/cm^3.
Although these results depend on the chosen numerical resolution, an
improvement of the constraints on the the total mass of burning products in the
pure deflagration scenario can be achieved.

evolution of the host galaxies of high luminosity quasars (Falomo et al. 2004).
The new sample includes 15 low luminosity quasars, nine radio-loud (RLQ) and
six radio-quiet (RQQ). They have similar distribution of redshift and optical
luminosity, and together with the high luminosity quasars they cover a large
range (~4 mag) of the quasar luminosity function. The host galaxies of both
types of quasars are in the range of massive inactive ellipticals between L*
and 10 L*. RLQ hosts are systematically more luminous than RQQ hosts by a
factor of ~2. This difference is similar to that found for the high luminosity
quasars. This luminosity gap appears to be independent of the rest-frame U-band
luminosity but clearly correlated with the rest-frame R-band luminosity. The
color difference between the RQQs and the RLQs is likely a combination of an
intrinsic difference in the strength of the thermal and nonthermal components
in the SEDs of RLQs and RQQs, and a selection effect due to internal dust
extinction. For the combined set of quasars, we find a reasonable correlation
between the nuclear and the host luminosities. This correlation is less
apparent for RQQs than for RLQs. If the R-band luminosity is representative of
the bolometric luminosity, and assuming that the host luminosity is
proportional to the black hole mass, as observed in nearby massive spheroids,
quasars emit with a relatively narrow range of power with respect to their
Eddington luminosity and with the same distribution for RLQs and RQQs.

transitory nature. On the other hand the possible pseudo-cyclical or
multi-component modulations at long times could be more stable, recurrent and
correlated to the bimodal radio flux behaviour and the twisted radio structure
observed by many years in this blazar.

evidence for amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), also known as mirrorless
lasing (i.e., wherein some of the spontaneously emitted photons are amplified
by stimulated emission during their propagation) in DC-driven small molecular
organic light-emitting diodes (SMOLEDs). The evidence includes a dramatic
spectral line narrowing, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of only 5 -
10 nm, and optical gain, of the edge-emission from SMOLEDs at room temperature.

(PCPD). PCPD is a stochastic reaction-diffusion model which evolves by the
competition of two binary reactions, $2A \to 3A$ and $2A \to 0$. In addition,
each particle diffuses isotropically, which leads to the bidirectional coupling
between solitary particles and pairs. The coupling from pairs to solitary
particles is linear, while the opposite coupling is quadratic. The spreading
domain formed from localized activities in vacuum consists of two regions, the
coupled region of size $R_p$ where pairs and solitary particles coexist and the
uncoupled region of size $R_U$ where only solitary particles exist
respectively. As the size of the whole domain $R$ is given as $R=R_p + R_U$,
$R_p$ and $R_U$ are the basic length scales of PCPD. At criticality, $R_p$ and
$R_U$ scale as $R_p \sim t^{1/Z_p}$ and $R_U \sim t^{1/Z_U}$ with $Z_U > Z_p$.
We estimate $Z_p =1.61(1)$ and $Z_U =1.768(8)$. Hence, the correction to the
scaling of $R$, $Q=R_U /R_p$ extremely slowly decays, which makes it
practically impossible to identify the asymptotic scaling behavior of $R$. In
addition to the generic feature of the bidirectional coupling, the double
domain structure is another reason for the extremely slow approach to the
asymptotic scaling regime of PCPD.

harmonic trap, interacting via a short range (contact potential) or a long
range (Coulomb) interaction, is studied via an exact diagonalization in the
lowest Landau level. Our analysis shows that, for both low and high fractional
fillings, the bosons localize and form rotating boson molecules (RBMs)
consisting of concentric polygonal rings. Focusing on systems with the number
of trapped atoms sufficiently large to form multi-ring bosonic molecules, we
find that, as a function of the rotational frequency and regardless of the type
of repulsive interaction, the ground-state angular momenta grow in specific
steps that coincide with the number of localized bosons on each concentric
ring. Comparison of the conditional probability distributions (CPDs) for both
interactions suggests that the degree of crystalline correlations appears to
depend more on the fractional filling nu than on the range of the interaction.
The RBMs behave as nonrigid rotors, i.e., the concentric rings rotate
independently of each other. At filling fractions nu < 1/2, we observe well
developed crystallinity in the CPDs (two-point correlation functions). For
larger filling fractions nu > 1/2, observation of similar molecular patterns
requires consideration of even higher-order correlation functions.

dim_P(S) is Turing equivalent to a sequence R with dim_H(R) <= (dim_H(S) /
dim_P(S)) - epsilon, for arbitrary epsilon > 0. Furthermore, if dim_P(S) > 0,
then dim_P(R) >= 1 - epsilon. The reduction thus serves as a *randomness
extractor* that increases the algorithmic randomness of S, as measured by
constructive dimension.
  A number of applications of this result shed new light on the constructive
dimensions of Turing degrees. A lower bound of dim_H(S) / dim_P(S) is shown to
hold for the Turing degree of any sequence S. A new proof is given of a
previously-known zero-one law for the constructive packing dimension of Turing
degrees. It is also shown that, for any regular sequence S (that is, dim_H(S) =
dim_P(S)) such that dim_H(S) > 0, the Turing degree of S has constructive
Hausdorff and packing dimension equal to 1.
  Finally, it is shown that no single Turing reduction can be a universal

cannot extract constructive Hausdorff dimension. We also exhibit sequences on
which weak truth-table and bounded Turing reductions differ in their ability to
extract dimension.

ground for quantum chromodynamics (QCD), because QCD calculations are expected
to be reliable if a hard scale is present in the process. In heavy quarks
production a hard scale is provided by the quark mass. Moreover heavy quarks
production can give direct access to the gluon density in the proton due to the
fact that it proceeds, in QCD, almost exclusively via photon-gluon fusion,
where a photon from the incoming electron interacts with a gluon in the proton
giving an heavy quark-anti-quark pair. Results will be shown both for
deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), where the virtuality of the exchanged boson
Q**2 is large, and photo-production, where the Q**2 is equal to zero. Various
experimental techniques are used in order to select charm and beauty events,
ranging from the measurement of D* cross section to impact parameter analyses.

QCD. A brief summary of the open charm analyses done by the COMPASS

predicts an infrared vanishing (transverse) gluon propagator in Landau-like
gauges, implying violation of reflection positivity and gluon confinement.
Finite-volume effects make it very difficult to observe (in the minimal Landau
gauge) an infrared suppressed gluon propagator in lattice simulations of the
four-dimensional case. Here we report results for the SU(2) gluon propagator in
a gauge that interpolates between the minimal Landau gauge (for gauge parameter
lambda equal to 1) and the minimal Coulomb gauge (corresponding to lambda = 0).
For small values of lambda we find that the spatially-transverse gluon
propagator D^tr(0,|\vec p|), considered as a function of the spatial momenta
|\vec p|, is clearly infrared suppressed. This result is in agreement with the
Gribov-Zwanziger scenario and with previous numerical results in the minimal
Coulomb gauge. We also discuss the nature of the limit lambda -> 0 (complete
Coulomb gauge) and its relation to the standard Coulomb gauge (lambda = 0). Our
findings are corroborated by similar results in the three-dimensional case,
where the infrared suppression is observed for all considered values of lambda.

milli-charged dark matter candidate with a viable relic density. Existing
terrestrial and astrophysical searches on milli-charged particles do not place
severe constraints on this hidden fermion. We calculate the flux of
monochromatic photons coming from the Galactic center due to pair annihilation
of these milli-charged particles and show that it is within reach of the next
generation $\gamma$-ray experiments. The characteristic signature of this
theoretical endeavor is that the Stueckelberg $Z'$ boson has a large invisible
width decaying into the hidden fermion-antifermion pair. We show that existing
Drell-Yan data do not constrain this model yet. Various channels of singly
production of this $Z'$ boson at the LHC and ILC are explored.

In the extreme limits of small cosmological scale factor the wave function of
the universe can also be obtained by applying the methods developed by
Hartle-Hawking(H-H) and Vilenkin. H-H wave function predicts that most Probable
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ equals to $\frac{1}{\eta}$($\frac{1}{2\eta}$
equals to the maximum of the kinetic energy of scalar field). It is different
from the original results($\Lambda=0$) in cosmological constant obtained by
Hartle-Hawking. The Vilenkin wave function predicts a nucleating unverse with
largest possible cosmological constant and it is larger than $1/\eta$. The
conclusions have been nicely to reconcile with cosmic inflation. We investigate
the inflation model with B-I type scalar field, and find that $\eta$ depends on
the amplitude of tensor perturbation $\delta_h$, with the form
$\frac{1}{\eta}\simeq \frac{m^2}{12\pi[(\frac{9\delta_{\Phi}^2}{N
\delta_h^2})^2-1]}.$ The vacuum energy in inflation epoch depends on the
tensor-to-scalar ratio $\frac{\delta_h}{\delta_{\Phi}}$. The amplitude of the
tensor perturbation ${\delta_{h}}$ can, in principle, be large enough to be
discovered. However, it is only on the border of detectability in future
experiments. If it has been observed in future, this is very interesting to
determine the vacuum energy in inflation epoch.

by investigating the thermodynamics of a non-conformal system, namely the N=2^*
theory, which is obtained as a mass deformation of the conformal N=4 gauge
theory. We find that at temperatures of order the mass scale, the
thermodynamics of the mass deformed plasma is surprisingly close to that of the
conformal gauge theory plasma. This suggests that many properties of the quark
gluon plasma at RHIC may in fact be well described by even relatively simple
models such as that of the conformal N=4 plasma.

L-skewness and L-kurtosis that can be achieved by the GLD is provided. The
boundaries of L-skewness and L-kurtosis are derived analytically for the
symmetric GLD and calculated numerically for the GLD in general. Additionally,
the contours of L-skewness and L-kurtosis are presented as functions of the GLD
parameters. It is found that with an exception of the smallest values of
L-kurtosis, the GLD covers all possible pairs of L-skewness and L-kurtosis and
often there are two or more distributions that share the same L-skewness and

estimation of the GLD parameters is studied in a simulation example where
method of L-moments compares favorably to more complicated estimation methods.

close to a weakly unstable saddle-focus and perform a detailed asymptotic
analysis of the trajectories in the vicinity of the saddle-focus. Our analysis
covers both cases of sub- and supercritical AHB. For the supercritical case, we
find that the periodic orbits born from the AHB are bimodal when viewed in the
frame of coordinates generated by the linearization about the bifurcating
equilibrium. If the AHB is subcritical, it is accompanied by the appearance of
multimodal orbits, which consist of long series of nearly harmonic oscillations
separated by large amplitude spikes. We analyze the dependence of the
interspike intervals (which can be extremely long) on the control parameters.
In particular, we show that the interspike intervals grow logarithmically as
the boundary between regions of sub- and supercritical AHB is approached in the
parameter space. We also identify a window of complex and possibly chaotic
oscillations near the boundary between the regions of sub- and supercritical
AHB and explain the mechanism generating these oscillations. This work is

on boosting, to enable feature selection from the high-dimensional search space
of candidate binding sequences while avoiding overfitting. At each iteration of
the algorithm, MEDUSA builds a motif model whose presence in the promoter
region of a gene, coupled with activity of a regulator in an experiment, is
predictive of differential expression. In this way, we learn motifs that are
functional and predictive of regulatory response rather than motifs that are
simply overrepresented in promoter sequences. Moreover, MEDUSA produces a model
of the transcriptional control logic that can predict the expression of any
gene in the organism, given the sequence of the promoter region of the target
gene and the expression state of a set of known or putative transcription
factors and signaling molecules. Each motif model is either a $k$-length
sequence, a dimer, or a PSSM that is built by agglomerative probabilistic
clustering of sequences with similar boosting loss. By applying MEDUSA to a set
of environmental stress response expression data in yeast, we learn motifs
whose ability to predict differential expression of target genes outperforms
motifs from the TRANSFAC dataset and from a previously published candidate set
of PSSMs. We also show that MEDUSA retrieves many experimentally confirmed

particular the large-N limit will be considered. Three kinds of prior knowledge
are used: one represented by a plausibility distribution constant in respect of
the convex structure of the set of statistical operators; another one
represented by a prior studied by Slater, which has been proposed as the
natural measure on the set of statistical operators; the last prior is
represented by a Gaussian-like distribution centred on a pure statistical
operator, and thus reflecting a situation in which one has useful prior
knowledge about the likely preparation of the system. The assigned statistical
operators obtained with the first two kinds of priors are compared with the one
obtained by Jaynes' maximum entropy method for the same measurement situation.
In the companion paper the case of measurement data consisting in absolute
frequencies is considered.

Dynamics","Open Syst. & Inf. Dyn. 14, 149 (2007)",,,"quant-ph",,"  Cloning of observables, unlike standard cloning of states, aims at copying
the information encoded in the statistics of a class of observables rather then
on quantum states themselves. In such a process the emphasis is on the quantum
operation (evolution plus measurement) necessary to retrieve the original
information. We analyze, for qubit systems, the cloning of a class generated by
two noncommuting observables, elucidating the relationship between such a
process and joint measurements. This helps in establishing an optimality
criterion for cloning of observables. We see that, even if the cloning machine
is designed to act on the whole class generated by two noncommuting
observables, the same optimal performances of a joint measurement can be
attained. Finally, the connection with state dependent cloning is enlightened.

discussions concerning hidden variables in quantum mechanics. In this paper we
argue that ""free will"" can be defined in different ways. The definition usually
employed is clearly invalid in strictly deterministic theories. A different,
more precise formulation is proposed here, defining a condition that may well
be a more suitable one to impose on theoretical constructions and models. Our
axiom, to be referred to as the `unconstrained initial state' condition, has
consequences similar to ""free will"", but does not clash with determinism, and
appears to lead to different conclusions concerning causality and locality in
quantum mechanics. Models proposed earlier by this author fall in this
category. Imposing our `unconstrained initial state' condition on a
deterministic theory underlying Quantum Mechanics, appears to lead to a
restricted free-will condition in the quantum system: an observer has the free
will to modify the setting of a measuring device, but has no control over the
phase of its wave function. The dismissal of the usual ""free will"" concept does
not have any consequences for our views and interpretations of human activities
in daily life, and the way our minds function, but it requires a more careful
discussion on what, in practice, free will actually amounts to.

micronmeter width slits if their principal quantum number is rather large(n >

function calculated after the slits is not. This experiment is in contradiction
with the Born interpretation (the square of the wave function is proportional
to the probability density for the particle to be found at each point in
space). The classical interpretation of this experiment, which removes the
contradiction, is to suppose that if the particles do not pass, the wave
function does not pass either (classical assumption).
  An alternative interpretation of this experiment is to suppose that the wave
function passes through the slits, but that the Born interpretation is not
valid any more in this case (alternative assumption).
