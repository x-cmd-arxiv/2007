limit of small magnetic and fluid Reynolds numbers, using the first order
smoothing approximation (FOSA) to solve both the induction and momentum
equations. Both steady and time dependent forcings are considered. In the low
Reynolds number limit, the velocity and magnetic fields can be expressed
explicitly in terms of the forcing function. The nonlinear alpha-effect is then
shown to be expressible in several equivalent forms in agreement with
formalisms that are used in various closure schemes. On the one hand, one can
express alpha completely in terms of the helical properties of the velocity
field as in traditional FOSA, or, alternatively, as the sum of two terms, a
so-called kinetic alpha-effect and an oppositely signed term proportional to
the helical part of the small scale magnetic field. These results hold for both
steady and time dependent forcing at arbitary strength of the mean field

continue to grow by exchanging angular momentum with the halo. The bar pattern
speed evolves quite differently in the two models: there is no dynamical
friction on the MOND bars so they keep a constant pattern speed while the DM
bars slow down significantly. This affects the position of resonance like the
corotation and the peanut. The peanut lobes in the DM model move radially
outward while they keep the same position in MOND. Simulations of (only

(3.0+/-1.6) h^-1 x 10^12 Msun, as inferred by Croom et al. from clustering in
the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey, we show that estimates of the ionizing background
(Gamma^bkg) from proximity effect measurements could be biased high by a factor
of ~2.5 at z=3 owing to neglecting these effects alone. The clustering of
galaxies and other active galactic nuclei around the proximity effect quasars
enhances the local background, but is not expected to skew measurements by more
than a few percent. Assuming the measurements of Gamma^bkg based on the mean
flux decrement in the Ly-alpha forest to be free of bias, we demonstrate how
the proximity effect analysis can be inverted to measure the mass of the dark
matter halos hosting quasars. In ideal conditions, such a measurement could be
made with a precision comparable to the best clustering constraints to date
from a modest sample of only about 100 spectra. We discuss observational
difficulties, including continuum flux estimation, quasar systematic redshift
determination, and quasar variability, which make accurate proximity effect
measurements challenging in practice. These are also likely to contribute to
the discrepancies between existing proximity effect and flux decrement

moving mean motion resonances accretes into ""hot Earths"", but survival of these

amount of material scattered outward by the giant planet survives in highly
excited orbits; the orbits of these scattered bodies are then damped by gas
drag and dynamical friction over the remaining accretion time. In all
simulations Earth-mass planets accrete on approximately 100 Myr timescales,
often with orbits in the Habitable Zone. These planets range in mass and water
content, with both quantities increasing with the presence of a gas disk and
decreasing with the presence of an outer giant planet. We use scaling arguments

several pronounced observational manifestations: 1) morphological structures
such as nonthermal radio filaments (NTFs) -- magnetic flux tubes illuminated by
synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons -- and a remarkable,
large-scale, helically wound structure, 2) relatively strong polarization of
thermal dust emission from molecular clouds, presumably resulting from magnetic
alignment of the rotating dust grains, and 3) synchrotron emission from cosmic
rays. Because most of the NTFs are roughly perpendicular to the Galactic plane,
the implied large-scale geometry of the magnetic field is dipolar. Estimates of
the mean field strength vary from tens of microgauss to ~ a milligauss. The
merits and weaknesses of the various estimations are discussed here. If the
field strength is comparable to a milligauss, then the magnetic field is able
to exert a strong influence on the dynamics of molecular clouds, on the
collimation of a Galactic wind, and on the lifetimes and bulk motions of
relativistic particles. Related to the question of field strength is the
question of whether the field is pervasive throughout the central zone of the
Galaxy, or whether its manifestations are predominantly localized phenomena.
Current evidence favors the pervasive model.

a LINER character of the nucleus. The large H_2 gas mass deduced from the

four sources (NGC 7027, NGC 6537 and NGC 6302) present a well-defined toroidal
magnetic field oriented along their equatorial torus or disk. NGC 6302 may also
show field lines along the bipolar outflow. CRL 2688 shows a complex field
structure, where part of the field aligns with the torus, whilst an other part
approximately aligns with the polar outflow. It also presents marked
asymmetries in its magnetic structure. NGC 7027 shows evidence for a
disorganized field in the south-west corner, where the SCUBA shows an
indication for an outflow. The findings show a clear correlation between field

pc) sample of 152 late-M and L dwarfs (M7--L8) photometrically selected from

spectrophotometric distance estimates, we calculate tangential velocities. The
sample has a mean tangential velocity of <V_tan> = 31.5 km/s, a velocity
dispersion of sigma_tan = 20.7 km/s, and a maximum tangential velocity of V_tan
= 138.8 km/s. These kinematic results are in excellent agreement with previous
studies of ultracool dwarfs in the local solar neighborhood. H_alpha emission,
an indicator of chromospheric activity, was detected in 63 of 81 late-M dwarfs
and 16 of 69 L dwarfs examined. We find a lack of correlation between activity
strength, measured by log(F_H_alpha/F_bol), and V_tan, though velocity
distributions suggest that the active dwarfs in our sample are slightly younger
than the inactive dwarfs. Consistent with previous studies of activity in
ultracool dwarfs, we find that the fraction of H$\alpha$ emitting objects per
spectral type peaks at spectral type M7 and declines through mid-L dwarfs.
Activity strength is similarly correlated with spectral type for spectral types
later than M7. Eleven dwarfs out of 150 show evidence of variability, ranging
from small fluctuations to large flare events. We estimate a flare cycle of ~5%
for late-M dwarfs and ~2% for L dwarfs. Observations of strong, variable
activity on the L1 dwarf 2MASS J10224821+5825453 and an amazing flare event on

to plain bulk motions, a favorite mechanism involves magnetic helicity flux
along lines of constant rotation. We also know that the sun does shed the
required amount of magnetic helicity mostly in the form of coronal mass
ejections. Solar-like stars without cycles do not face such strong constraints
imposed by magnetic helicity evolution and may not display coronal activity to
that same extent. I discuss the evidence leading to this line of argument. In

toroidal fields provided the outer boundary condition is left open so as to
allow magnetic helicity to escape. Control experiments with closed boundaries

upon continuum descriptions, we find experimental evidence for secondary,
azimuthal circulation in response to perturbation of the symmetry with respect
to gravity by tilting. For small perturbations we can discriminate between

secondary circulation can be suppressed as wall friction is varied, also in

useful for many practical applications, is one such variant, in which codes are
restricted to the set of codes in which none of the $n$ codewords is longer
than a given length, $l_{\max}$. Binary length-limited coding can be done in
$O(n l_{\max})$ time and O(n) space via the widely used Package-Merge
algorithm. In this paper the Package-Merge approach is generalized without
increasing complexity in order to introduce a minimum codeword length,
$l_{\min}$, to allow for objective functions other than the minimization of
expected codeword length, and to be applicable to both binary and nonbinary
codes; nonbinary codes were previously addressed using a slower dynamic
programming approach. These extensions have various applications -- including
faster decompression -- and can be used to solve the problem of finding an
optimal code with limited fringe, that is, finding the best code among codes
with a maximum difference between the longest and shortest codewords. The
previously proposed method for solving this problem was nonpolynomial time,
whereas solving this using the novel algorithm requires only $O(n (l_{\max}-
l_{\min})^2)$ time and O(n) space.

dependent on the radial coordinate, i.e., $\omega(r)=p(r)/\rho(r)$. We shall
impose that phantom energy is concentrated in the neighborhood of the throat,
to ensure the flaring out condition, and several models are analyzed. We shall
also consider the possibility that these phantom wormholes be sustained by
their own quantum fluctuations. The energy density of the graviton one loop
contribution to a classical energy in a phantom wormhole background and the
finite one loop energy density are considered as a self-consistent source for
these wormhole geometries. The latter semi-classical approach prohibits
solutions with a constant equation of state parameter, which further motivates
the imposition of a radial dependent parameter, $\omega(r)$, and only permits
solutions with a steep positive slope proportional to the radial derivative of
the equation of state parameter, evaluated at the throat. The size of the
wormhole throat as a function of the relevant parameters is also explored.

propagating in nuclei, using Drell-Yan (DY) transverse momentum distributions
measured in the experiment E866 at FermiLab with beams of 800 GeV protons. Our
theoretical analysis is based on the color dipole approach in the target rest
frame, which has provided a successful phenomenological description of a
variety of hadronic reactions. The present application is relevant to the
regime of short coherence length (SCL), where the spatial extent of the
fluctuations of the projectile responsible for the Drell-Yan reaction is short
compared to the internucleon spacing. In this limit, momentum broadening comes
from initial state interactions and is described as color filtering, i.e.
absorption of large-size dipoles leading to diminished transverse separation
and hence enhanced transverse momentum. The predictions we present are in good
agreement with the E866 data. The interactions leading to the acquisition of
transverse momentum arise from the color-dipole cross section determined
previously from deep-inelastic scattering on proton targets. Aside from the
determination of the color-dipole cross section, no other phenomenological
input is needed to explain the experimental results. The mean-square momentum
broadening of dileptons determined in a recent separate analysis of the data is
likewise well described by our theory. These results confirm that the origin of
momentum broadening in DY is the color dipole cross section mediating soft
initial state interactions between the parton of the projectile that initiates
the reaction and the nucleons of the nucleus, as provided by the color dipole
description. Predictions for broadening observables at RHIC are presented.

structure as $H_{ext}$ (higher stage constraints enter into the Hamiltonian in
the manifest form), but, in contrast to $H_{ext}$, it arises as the complete
Hamiltonian for some Lagrangian $\tilde L$, called the extended Lagrangian.
This implies, in particular, that all the quantities appearing in the improved
Hamiltonian have a clear meaning in the Dirac framework. $\tilde L$ is obtained
in a closed form in terms of quantities of the initial formulation $L$. The
formulations with $L$ and $\tilde L$ turn out to be equivalent. As an
application of the formalism, we found local symmetries of $\tilde L$ in a
closed form. All the constraints of $L$ turn out to be gauge symmetry
generators for $\tilde L$. The procedure is illustrated with an example of a
model with fourth-stage constraints.

higher dimensional gravity. The uniform black string is part of a larger phase
diagram of Kaluza-Klein black holes which will be discussed thoroughly. This
phase diagram exhibits many interesting features including new phases,
non-uniqueness and horizon-topology changing transitions. In the second part,
we turn to charged black branes in supergravity and show how the
Gregory-Laflamme instability of the neutral black string implies via a
boost/U-duality map similar instabilities for non- and near-extremal smeared
branes in string theory. We also comment on instabilities of D-brane bound
states. The connection between classical and thermodynamic stability, known as
the correlated stability conjecture, is also reviewed and illustrated with
examples. Finally, we examine the holographic implications of the
Gregory-Laflamme instability for a number of non-gravitational theories
including Yang-Mills theories and Little String Theory.

fractal distribution of their positions. The source of fractal behavior is the
lack of a length scale in the two body gravitational interaction. However, even
with new, larger, sample sizes from recent surveys, it is difficult to extract
information concerning fractal properties with confidence. Similarly,
simulations with a billion particles only provide a thousand particles per
dimension, far too small for accurate conclusions. With one dimensional models
these limitations can be overcome by carrying out simulations with on the order
of a quarter of a million particles without compromising the computation of the
gravitational force. Here the multifractal properties of a group of these
models that incorporate different features of the dynamical equations governing
the evolution of a matter dominated universe are compared. The results share
important similarities with galaxy observations, such as hierarchical
clustering and apparent bifractal geometry. They also provide insights
concerning possible constraints on length and time scales for fractal
structure. They clearly demonstrate that fractal geometry evolves in the $\mu$
(position, velocity) space. The observed properties are simply a shadow
(projection) of higher dimensional structure.

(2) $\max \{x^* C x \mid x^* A_k x \le 1, x\in\mathbb{F}^n, k=0,1,...,m\}$. If
\emph{one} of $A_k$'s is indefinite while others and $C$ are positive

SDP relaxation is upper bounded by $O(m^2)$ when $\mathbb{F}$ is the real line
$\mathbb{R}$, and by $O(m)$ when $\mathbb{F}$ is the complex plane

about quartiles, that is, the central information displayed in a pair of
boxplots. In particular, we contrast a suggestion of John Tukey--that the
validity of inferences should not depend on assumptions, but assumptions have a
role in efficiency--with a competing suggestion that is an aspect of Hansen's
generalized method of moments--that methods should achieve maximum asymptotic
efficiency with fewer assumptions. In our case study, the practical performance
of these two suggestions is strikingly different. An aspect of this comparison
concerns the unification or separation of the tasks of estimation assuming a
model and testing the fit of that model. We also look at a method (MERT) that
aims not at best performance, but rather at achieving reasonable performance
across a set of plausible models.

for a GLM is a very important task in the development and building of an
adequate model. However, one major problem that handicaps the construction of a
GLM design is its dependence on the unknown parameters of the fitted model.
Several approaches have been proposed in the past 25 years to solve this
problem. These approaches, however, have provided only partial solutions that
apply in only some special cases, and the problem, in general, remains largely
unresolved. The purpose of this article is to focus attention on the
aforementioned dependence problem. We provide a survey of various existing
techniques dealing with the dependence problem. This survey includes
discussions concerning locally optimal designs, sequential designs, Bayesian
designs and the quantile dispersion graph approach for comparing designs for

probability that two countries are connected depends on their GDP values,
supporting recent theoretical models relating network topology to the presence
of a `hidden' variable (or fitness). On the other hand, the topology is shown
to determine the GDP values due to the exchange between countries. This leads
us to a new framework where the fitness value is a dynamical variable

ionization reaction, we introduce a reaction matrix containing reaction rates
that depend on the electron velocities. Via a Chapman--Enskog expansion, one is
able to find only a rough approximation for a macroscopic evolution law that
describes the traveling wave solution. We propose to compute these solutions
with the help of a coarse-grained time-stepper, which is an effective evolution
law for the macroscopic fields that only uses appropriately initialized
simulations of the lattice Boltzmann model over short time intervals. The
traveling wave solution is found as a fixed point of the sequential application
of the coarse-grained time-stepper and a shift-back operator. The fixed point
is then computed with a Newton-Krylov Solver. We compare the resulting

Increasing the external input amplitude, the softening behaviour induced by

confined in a narrow frequency range. Jump discontinuities are identified for

harmonics because of nonlinear Hertzian restoring force. Numerical simulations
show a very good agreement with experimental results. For higher input
amplitude, system exhibits vibro-impacts. Loss of contact non-linearity clearly

reasonable agreement with experimental ones, that justify the modelling and the
numerical methods described in this paper. The contact loss non linearity
appears to be rather strong compared to the Hertzian non linearity. It actually
induces a large broadening of the spectral contents of the response. This
result is of great importance in noise generation for a lot of systems such as
mechanisms using contacts to transform motions and forces (gears,
ball-bearings, cam systems, to name a few). It is also of great importance for
tribologists preoccupied to prevent surface dammage.

based on closely located periodical grids of loaded wires. An explicit
analytical method based on the local field approach is used to study the
reflection and transmission properties of such superstrates. It is shown that
as a result of proper impedance loading there exists a rather wide frequency
band over which currents induced to the grids cancel each other, leading to a
wide transmission maximum. In this regime radiation is produced by the magnetic
dipole moments created by circulating out-of-phase currents flowing in the
grids. An impedance matrix representation is derived for the superstrates, and
the analytical results are validated using full-wave simulations. As a
practical application example we study numerically the radiation
characteristics of dipole antennas illuminating finite-size superstrates.

characteristics of the set of components on the critical rotational speeds of a
gearbox. The case of a gearbox fitted out with a helical gear pair was
considered. The shafts and the casing were discretised using the finite element
method. The elastic coupling between the toothed wheels was characterised by a
12 x12 stiffness matrix. The bearings were modelled using radial, axial and
rotational stiffness elements. The calculation of the vibration response
induced by the static transmission error showed that the highest dynamic mesh
forces correspond to a resonant excitation of modes which have a high potential
energy associated with the mesh stiffness. The numerical simulations performed
showed that a realistic prediction of the critical rotational speeds should
take account of all the components of the gearbox.

reaction directions, which are constrained by mass balance and thermodynamics,
for genome-scale networks. In addition, it is shown that the nonconvex solution
space constrained by physicochemical constraints can be approximated by a set
of linearized subspaces in which mass and thermodynamic balance are guaranteed.
The developed methodology can be used to {\it ab initio} predict reaction
directions of genome-scale networks based solely on the network stoichoimetry.
