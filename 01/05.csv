frequency from the far-infrared through hard X-rays; emission at different
frequencies emerges from physical scales ranging from AUs to parsecs. Each
wavelength regime thus offers a different line of sight into the central engine
and a separate probe of outflowing material. Therefore, obtaining a complete
accounting of the physical characteristics and kinetic power of quasar winds
requires a panchromatic approach. X-ray and infrared studies are particularly
powerful for covering the range of interesting physical scales and ionization
states of the outflow. We present a stratified wind picture based on a
synthesis of multiwavelength research programs designed to constrain the nature
of mass ejection from radio-quiet quasars. This wind comprises three zones: the
highly ionized shielding gas, the UV broad absorption line wind, and the cold
dusty outflow. The primary launching mechanism for the wind likely varies in
each zone. While radiative acceleration on resonance lines dominates for the UV
absorbing wind, the shielding gas may instead be driven by magnetic forces.
Ultraviolet continuum radiative pressure, perhaps coupled with magnetic
launching, accelerates a dusty outflow that obscures the inner broad line
region in unification schemes.

data, adopting a previously introduced modulation framework. Computing both
frequentist probabilities and Bayesian evidences, we find that the model
consisiting of an isotropic CMB sky modulated by a dipole field, gives a
substantially better fit to the observations than the purely isotropic model,
even when accounting for the larger prior volume. For the ILC map, the Bayesian
log-evidence difference is ~1.8 in favour of the modulated model, and the raw
improvement in maximum log-likelihood is 6.1. The best-fit modulation dipole
axis points toward (l,b) = (225 deg,-27 deg), and the modulation amplitude is
0.114, in excellent agreement with the results from the first-year analyses.
The frequentist probability of obtaining such a high modulation amplitude in an
isotropic universe is ~1%. These results are not sensitive to data set or sky
cut. Thus, the statistical evidence for a power asymmetry anomaly is both
substantial and robust, although not decisive, for the currently available
data. Increased sky coverage through better foreground handling and full-sky
and high-sensitivity polarization maps may shed further light on this issue.

directly observed angular motions, u, of features ejected in the innermost
regions of their jets are plotted on logarithmic scales versus the directly
observed 15 GHz flux density, S, of their central engines: an abrupt upper
envelope cut-off with a slope of 0.5 is obtained. This upper envelope and slope
can be explained in a simple non-relativistic ejection model if (a), radio-loud
quasars are radio standard candles and (b), for the sources defining the
cut-off, the features are all ejected with similar speeds. The upper envelope
is then due to the maximum projected velocity seen when the accretion disk is
edge-on, and ejections are in the plane of the sky. In our simple ejection
model, where S is a good measure of relative distance, the observed
distribution of angular motions can be explained if the radio luminosity of the
source is a function of viewing angle, increasing towards face-on. Here we show
that when u is plotted versus redshift, z, the same upper envelope cut-off is
seen. It is not as sharply defined, since, in this simple model, the u upper
envelope will be smeared out by sources lying at different cosmological
distances, z_(c). Normalizing all sources to the same distance (1 Jy) using the
flux density, S, removes this smearing and improves the sharpness of the upper
envelope, supporting our assumption that S is a measure of relative distance.
In this model the redshift of quasars cannot be a reliable indication of their

axisymmetric MHD solution for the solar wind at minimum including rotation and
the initial flaring of the solar wind in the low corona. This model has some
problems in reproducing the values of magnetic field at 1 AU despite the
correct values of the velocity. Here, we intend to extend the previous analysis
to another type of solutions and to improve our modelling of the wind from the
solar surface to 1 AU. We compare the previous results to those obtained with a
fully helicoidal model and construct a hybrid model combining both previous
solutions, keeping the flexibility of the parent models in the appropriate
domain. From the solar surface to the Alfven, point, a three component solution
for velocity and magnetic field is used, reproducing the complex wind geometry
and the well-known flaring of the field lines observed in coronal holes. From
the Alfven radius to 1 AU and further, the hybrid model keeps the latitudinal
dependences as flexible as possible, in order to deal with the sharp variations
near the equator and we use the helicoidal solution, turning the poloidal
streamlines into radial ones. Despite the absence of the initial flaring, the
helicoidal model and the first hybrid solution suffer from the same low values
of the magnetic field at 1 AU. However, by adjusting the parameters with a
second hybrid solution, we are able to reproduce both the velocity and magnetic
profiles observed by Ulysses and a reasonable description of the low corona,
provided that a certain amount of energy deposit exists along the flow. The
present paper shows that analytical axisymmetric solutions can be constructed
to reproduce the solar structure and dynamics from 1 solar radius up to 1 AU.

reveals an optical and NIR counterpart that brightened from R~23 to R~17 and
from K=19 to K~16. Spectral analysis of the RIJHK broadband photometry shows
excess in the NIR bands that may be due to synchrotron emission. The Halpha
emission line profile suggests the orbital inclination is ~22-32 degrees. The
preferred range for the reddening towards the source is 0.7 < E(B-V) < 0.9,
which is equivalent to 4.06E21 cm^-2 < NH < 5.22E21 cm^-2. The Chandra

galaxies are statistically drawn from the same distribution as other cluster
galaxies or are ""special"", using the new non-parametric, empirically based
model presented in Vale&Ostriker (2006) for associating galaxy luminosity with
halo/subhalo masses. We introduce scatter in galaxy luminosity at fixed halo
mass into this model, building a conditional luminosity function (CLF) by
considering two possible models: a simple lognormal and a model based on the
distribution of concentration in haloes of a given mass. We show that this
model naturally allows an identification of halo/subhalo systems with groups
and clusters of galaxies, giving rise to a clear central/satellite galaxy
distinction.
  We then use these results to build up the dependence of brightest cluster
galaxy (BCG) magnitudes on cluster luminosity, focusing on two statistical
indicators, the dispersion in BCG magnitude and the magnitude difference
between first and second brightest galaxies. We compare our results with two
simple models for BCGs: a statistical hypothesis that the BCGs are drawn from a
universal distribution, and a cannibalism scenario merging two galaxies from
this distribution. The statistical model is known to fail from work as far back
as Tremaine&Richstone (1977). We show that neither the statistical model nor
the simplest possibility of cannibalism provide a good match for observations.
Our CLF models both give similar results, in good agreement with observations.
Specifically, we find <m_1> between -25 and -25.5 in the K-band,
sigma(m_1)~0.25 and <Delta_12> between 0.6 and 0.8, for cluster luminosities in
the range of 10^12 to 10^13 h^-2 L_sun.

low-luminosity, wide-separation (480 AU) companion to the K0V exoplanet host
star HD 3651A. We find a spectral type of T7.5+/-0.5, a temperature of 780-840
K, and a mass of 40-72 Mjup; its bolometric luminosity and effective
temperature are among the lowest measured for any brown dwarf. We estimate an
age of 3-12 Gyr for the primary star HD 3651A and find that it is ~3x older
than the K4V star Gl 570A (1-5 Gyr), the host star of the T7.5 dwarf Gl 570D.
HD 3651B belongs to the rare class of substellar objects that are companions to
main-sequence stars and thus provides a new benchmark for studying very
low-temperature objects. Given their similar temperatures (within ~30 K) and
metallicities (within ~0.1 dex) but different ages, a comparison of HD 3651B
and GL 570D allows us to examine gravity-sensitive diagnostics in ultracool
spectra. We find that the expected signature of HD 3651B's higher surface
gravity due to its older age, namely a suppressed K-band flux relative to GL
570D, is not seen. Instead, the K-band flux of HD 3651B is enhanced compared to
GL 570D, indicative of a younger age. Thus, the relative ages derived from
interpretation of T dwarf spectra and from stellar activity indicators appear
to be in discord. One likely explanation is that the K-band fluxes are also
very sensitive to metallicity differences. Metallicity variations may be as
important as surface gravity variations in causing spectral differences among
field late-T dwarfs.

response, based on timescales and our photoionization code TITAN. We show that
the ionization and recombination timescales are much shorter than the dynamical
timescale. Clouds very close to the central black hole will maintain their
equilibrium since the characteristic variability timescales of the nuclear
source are longer than cloud timescales. For more distant clouds, the density
structure has no time to vary, in response to the variations of the temperature
or ionization structure, and such clouds will show the departure from the
constant pressure equilibrium. We explore the impact of this departure on the
observed properties of the transmitted spectrum and soft X-ray variability: (i)
non uniform velocities, of the order of sound speed, appear due to pressure
gradients, up to typical values of 100 km/s. These velocities lead to the
broadening of lines. This broadening is usually observed and very difficult to
explain otherwise. (ii) Energy-dependent fractional variability amplitude in
soft X-ray range has a broader hump around ~ 1-2 keV, and (iv) the plot of the
equivalent hydrogen column density vs. ionization parameter is steeper than for
equilibrium clouds. The results have the character of a preliminary study and
should be supplemented in the future with full time-dependent radiation
transfer and dynamical computations.

source was observed in high excitation lines of some of the most common
molecular species, CO, HCO+, CS, SO, H2CO, CH3OH and SiO. Line emission from 11
species originating from warm and dense gas have been imaged at high angular
resolution (1-3""; typically 200-600 AU) together with continuum emission at 230
GHz (1.3 mm) and 345 GHz (0.8 mm). Compact continuum emission is observed for
all sources which likely originates in marginally optically thick circumstellar
disks, with typical lower limits to their masses of 0.1 M_sun (1-10% of the
masses of their envelopes) and having a dust opacity law with beta
approximately 1. Prominent outflows are present in CO 2-1 observations in all
sources: the most diffuse outflows are found in the sources with the lowest
ratios of disk-to-envelope mass, and it is suggested that these sources are in
a phase where accretion of matter from the envelope has almost finished and the
remainder of the envelope material is being dispersed by the outflows. Other
characteristic dynamical signatures are found with inverse P Cygni profiles
indicative of infalling motions seen in the 13CO 2-1 lines toward
NGC1333-IRAS4A and -IRAS4B. Outflow-induced shocks are present on all scales in
the protostellar environments and are most clearly traced by the emission of
CH3OH in NGC1333-IRAS4A and -IRAS4B. These observations suggest that the
emission of CH3OH and H2CO from these proposed ""hot corinos"" are related to the
shocks caused by the protostellar outflows. Only one source, NGC1333-IRAS2A,
has evidence for hot, compact CH3OH emission coincident with the embedded

distributions and by performing the 2-dimensional spectral analysis, we
identify a remarkable high-abundance arc region at about 2^{\prime}
(33.6h_{70}^{-1} kpc) from the X-ray peak that spans over a vast region from
south to northwest, a part of which roughly coinciding with the outer edge of
the southwest X-ray cavity. The measured average abundance in this arc is
higher than that in its neighboring regions by a factor of about 2, and the
abundance ratios therein are nicely consistent with the dominance of the SN Ia

(r < 9 parsec) nuclear star cluster as well as a low-luminosity active galactic
nucleus (AGN). It has been suggested both that the nuclear stellar cluster is
associated with a dusty torus, and that low-luminosity AGN like NGC 1097 do not
have the torus predicted by the unified model of AGN. To investigate these
contradictory possibilities we have acquired Gemini/T-ReCS 11.7 micron and 18.3
micron images of the central few hundred parsecs of this galaxy at < 45 parsec
angular resolution, in which the nucleus and spectacular, kiloparsec-scale
star-forming ring are detected in both bands. The small-scale mid-infrared
(mid-IR) luminosity implies thermal emission from warm dust close to the
central engine of this galaxy. Fitting of torus models shows that the observed
mid-IR emission cannot be accounted for by dust heated by the central engine.
Rather, the principal source heating the dust in this object is the nuclear
star cluster itself, suggesting that the dust that we detect is not the torus
of AGN unified schemes (although it is also possible that the dusty starburst
itself could provide the obscuration invoked by the unified model). Comparison
of Spitzer/IRS and Gemini/GNIRS spectra shows that, although polyaromatic
hydrocarbon emission (PAH) bands are strong in the immediate circumnuclear
region of the galaxy, PAH emission is weak or absent in the central 19 parsecs.
The lack of PAH emission can probably be explained largely by
destruction/ionization of PAH molecules by hard photons from the nuclear star
cluster. If NGC 1097 is typical, PAH emission bands may not be a useful tool
with which to find very compact nuclear starbursts even in low-luminosity AGN.

carrying out the spectral fittings we calculated the 0.3--10.0 keV luminosities
of all the detected X-ray point sources and found that they span a wide range
from a few 10^{37} erg s^{-1} to over 10^{39} erg s^{-1}. After compensating
for the incompleteness at the low luminosity end, we find that the corrected
XLF of the bulge population is well fitted with a broken power-law model with a

the disk population's XLF agrees with a single power-law distribution with a
slope of 0.93^{+0.07}_{-0.06}. The disk population is significantly richer at

that the disk may have undergone relatively recent, strong starbursts that
significantly increased the HMXB population, although ongoing starbursts are
also observed in the nuclear region. Similar XLF profiles of the bulge and disk
populations were found in M81. However, in most other spiral galaxies different
patterns of the spatial variation of the XLF profiles from the bulge to the

as strongly magnetic (typically $10^{12}$G) rapidly rotating ($\sim 10^{2}-0.1$
Hz) neutron stars. However, the mechanism of particle acceleration in the
pulsar magnetosphere has been a longstanding problem. The central problem is
why the rotation power manifests itself in both gamma-ray beams and a highly
relativistic wind of electron-positron plasmas, which excites surrounding
nebulae observed in X-ray. Here we show with a three dimensional particle
simulation for the global axisymmetric magnetosphere that a steady outflow of
electron-positron pairs is formed with associated pair sources, which are the
gamma-ray emitting regions within the light cylinder. The magnetic field is
assumed to be dipole, and to be consistent, pair creation rate is taken to be
small, so that the model might be applicable to old pulsars such as Geminga.
The pair sources are charge-deficient regions around the null surface, and we
identify them as the outer gap. The wind mechanism is the electromagnetic
induction which brings about fast azimuthal motion and eventually trans-field
drift by radiation drag in close vicinity of the light cylinder and beyond. The
wind causes loss of particles from the system. This maintains charge deficiency
in the outer gap and pair creation. The model is thus in a steady state,
balancing loss and supply of particles. Our simulation implies how the wind
coexists with the gamma-ray emitting regions in the pulsar magnetosphere.

preferentially aligned with the major axis of their central galaxy. The
strength of this alignment has been found to depend strongly on the colours of
the satellite and central galaxies, and only weakly on the mass of the halo in
which the galaxies reside. In this paper we study whether these alignment
signals, and their dependence on galaxy and halo properties, can be reproduced
in a hierarchical structure formation model of a $\Lambda$CDM concordance
cosmology. To that extent we use a large $N$-body simulation which we populate
with galaxies following a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation. We find
that if the orientation of the central galaxy is perfectly aligned with that of
its dark matter halo, then the predicted central-satellite alignment signal is
much stronger than observed. If, however, the minor axis of a central galaxy is
perfectly aligned with the angular momentum vector of its dark matter halo, we
can accurately reproduce the observed alignment strength as function of halo
mass and galaxy color. Although this suggests that the orientation of central
galaxies is governed by the angular momentum of their dark matter haloes, we
emphasize that any other scenario in which the minor axes of central galaxy and
halo are misaligned by $\sim 40^{\circ}$ (on average) will match the data
equally well. Finally, we show that dependence of the alignment strength on the
color of the central galaxy is most likely an artefact due to interlopers in
the group catalogue. The dependence on the color of the satellite galaxies, on
the other hand, is real and owes to the fact that red satellites are associated
with subhaloes that were more massive at their time of accretion.

structures. The model parameters can be constrained using the observations of
protoclusters associated with Ly-$\alpha$ emitters at high redshift ($2 \leq z
\leq 4$), assuming the galaxy velocity bias can be modelled properly. High
redshift structure formation potentially provides a more powerful test of
possible primordial non-Gaussianity than does the CMB, albeit on smaller
scales. Another constraint is given by the local galaxy density probability
distribution function (PDF), as mapped by the 2 degree Field Galaxy Redshift
Survey (2dFGRS). The PDF of 2dFGRS \lstar galaxies is substantially higher than
the standard model predictions and requires either a non-negligible bias
between galaxy and dark matter on $\sim 12$~\hmpc scales or a stronger
non-Gaussianity than allowed by the WMAP year one data. The latter
interpretation is preferred since second-order bias corrections are negative.
With a lower normalisation of the power spectrum fluctuations, sigma_8=0.74, as
favoured by the WMAP 3 year data, the discrepancy between the Gaussian model
and the data is even larger.

CDM. Those two assumptions allow one to derive the typical density profile of
halos of a given mass from the accretion rate characteristic of the particular
cosmology. This profile was shown by Manrique and coworkers to recover the
results of numerical simulations. In the present paper, we investigate its
behavior beyond the ranges covered by present-day N-body simulations. We find
that the central asymptotic logarithmic slope depends crucially on the shape of
the power spectrum of density perturbations: it is equal to a constant negative
value for power-law spectra and has central cores for the standard CDM power
spectrum. The predicted density profile in the CDM case is well fitted by the
3D S\'ersic profile over at least 10 decades in halo mass. The values of the
S\'ersic parameters depend on the mass of the structure considered. A practical
procedure is provided that allows one to infer the typical values of the best

on planar and circular orbits around the centres of galaxies. Individual
passages with different relative velocity (V_drift) and arm width are studied
using N-body simulations. When the ratio of the time it takes the cluster to
cross the density wave to the crossing time of stars in the cluster is much
smaller than one, the energy gain of stars can be predicted accurately in the
impulsive approximation. When this ratio is much larger than one, the cluster
is heated adiabatically and the net effect of heating is largely damped. For a
given duration of the perturbation, this ratio is smaller for stars in the
outer parts of the cluster compared to stars in the inner part. The cluster
energy gain due to perturbations of various duration as obtained from our
N-body simulations is in good agreement with theoretical predictions taking
into account the effect of adiabatic damping. Perturbations by the broad
stellar component of the spiral arms on a cluster are in the adiabatic regime
and, therefore, hardly contribute to the energy gain and mass loss of the
cluster. We consider the effect of crossings through the high density shocked
gas in the spiral arms, which result in a more impulsive compression of the
cluster. The time scale of disruption is shortest at ~0.8-0.9 R_CR since there
V_drift is low. This location can be applicable to the solar neighbourhood. In
addition, the four-armed spiral pattern of the Milky Way makes spiral arms
contribute more to the disruption of clusters than in a similar but two-armed
galaxy. Still, the disruption time due to spiral arm perturbations there is
about an order of magnitude higher than what is observed for the solar
neighbourhood.[ABRIDGED]

  Results: For large temperature differences, the values of t2 required to
account for the observed difference between T([O III]) and T(H I) are much
lower than those deduced using the classical formulae that assume random and
small amplitude temperature fluctuations. One should therefore be cautious when
using a two-phase model to account for empirically derived $t^2$ values. We

find [Fe/H]~-1.0, a distance of ~7.5 kpc and a line-of-sight depth sigma_los of
1.5+-0.2 kpc and a characteristic age range of 3-6 Gyrs. However, the spread in
ages and the possible presence of a ~10 Gyr old population cannot be
constrained. The young main-sequence is found to have an age spread; ages must
range from a few hundred Myr to 2 Gyr. Because of the degeneracy between
distance and metallicity in CMDs the estimates of these parameters are strongly
correlated and two scenarios are consistent with the data: if the young stars
have a similar metallicity to the old stars, they are equidistant and therefore
co-spatial with the old stars; if the young stars have close to solar
metallicity they are more distant (~9 kpc). The relatively low metallicity of
the old main-sequence favors the interpretation that CMa is the remnant of an
accreted dwarf galaxy. Spectroscopic metallicity measurements are needed to
determine whether the young main-sequence is co-spatial.

cooling times just short enough to induce disc fragmentation, stars form with a
top-heavy Initial Mass Function (IMF), as observed in the Galactic Centre (GC).
For shorter cooling times, the disc fragments much more vigorously, leading to
lower average stellar masses. Thermal feedback associated with gas accretion
onto protostars slows down disc fragmentation, as predicted by some analytical
models. We also simulate the fragmentation of a gas stream on an eccentric
orbit in a combined Sgr A* plus stellar cusp gravitational potential. The
stream precesses, self-collides and forms stars with a top-heavy IMF. None of
our models produces large enough co-moving groups of stars that could account
for the observed ``mini star cluster'' IRS13E in the GC. In all of the
gravitationally unstable disc models that we explored, star formation takes
place too fast to allow any gas accretion onto the central super-massive black

ferromagnetic (Curie) transition temperature, Tc = 150 K and the ferromagnetic
insulating state is realized for temperatures, T <~ 130 K. The colossal
electroresistance, arising from a strongly nonlinear dependence of resistivity
($\rho$) on current density (j), attains a large value ($\approx 100%$) in the

resistivity at high current densities is progressively enhanced with decreasing
temperature, resulting ultimately, in a regime of negative differential
resistivity (NDR, d$\rho$/dj < 0) for temperatures <~ 25 K. Concomitant with
the build-up of the ER however, is a collapse of the MR to a small value (<

This phenomena originates from the formation of an air cavity resulting from
the complex transient dynamics of the free interface during the impact. The
classical picture of impacts on free surfaces relies solely on fluid inertia,
arguing that surface properties and viscous effects are negligible at
sufficiently large velocities. In strong contrast to this large-scale
hydrodynamic viewpoint, we demonstrate in this study that the wettability of
the impacting body is a key factor in determining the degree of splashing. This
unexpected result is illustrated in Fig.1: a large cavity is evident for an
impacting hydrophobic sphere (1.b), contrasting with the hydrophilic sphere's
impact under the very same conditions (1.a). This unforeseen fact is
furthermore embodied in the dependence of the threshold velocity for air
entrainment on the contact angle of the impacting body, as well as on the ratio
between the surface tension and fluid viscosity, thereby defining a critical
capillary velocity. As a paradigm, we show that superhydrophobic impacters make
a big 'splash' for any impact velocity. This novel understanding provides a new
perspective for impacts on free surfaces, and reveals that modifications of the
detailed nature of the surface -- involving physico-chemical aspects at the
nanometric scales -- provide an efficient and versatile strategy for
controlling the water entry of solid bodies at high velocity.

renormalized by the boson-induced interaction between fermions and its value is
crucial to determine the phase diagram of the system. For the mixture in a box
and a positive Bose-Fermi scattering length, we show that there are three
possibilities: a single uniform mixed phase, a purely fermionic phase
coexisting with a mixed phase, and a purely fermionic phase coexisting with a
purely bosonic one. As $1/a_F$ is increased from a negative value to the
Feshbach resonance ($1/a_F=0$) the region of pure separation increases and the
other two regions are strongly reduced. Above the Feshbach resonance
($1/a_F>0$), pairs of Fermi atoms become Bose-condensed molecules. We find that
these molecules are fully spatially separated from the bosonic atoms when
$1/a_F$ exceedes a critical value. For a negative Bose-Fermi scattering length

dynamical instability of the fully mixed phase. We consider also the mixture in

demixing and collapse. The experimental implications of our results are

of the resonant levels to the Fermi energy due to the enhanced screening. Our
results represent a significant departure from a conventional picture where a
variation of external parameters (such as a gate voltage, magnetic field, etc.)
causes the successive dot states to sweep past the Fermi level in a linear
fashion. We instead demonstrate highly nonlinear behavior of the resonant
levels in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. The pinning of the resonant levels
in open quantum dots leads to the broadening of the conduction oscillations in
comparison to the one electron picture. The effect of pinning becomes much more
pronounced in the presence of the perpendicular magnetic field. This can be
attributed to the enhanced screening efficiency because of the increased
localization of the wave function. The strong pinning of the resonant energy
levels in the presence of magnetic field can have a profound effect on
transport properties of various devices operating in the edge state transport
regime. We also critically examine an approximation often used in transport

(MLSDA). Empirically investigating codes of small blocklength reveals that the
theoretical upper bound for the simplified GDA almost matches the simulation
results as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per information bit ($\gamma_b$) is
greater than or equal to 8 dB. However, the theoretical bound may become
markedly higher than the simulated average complexity when $\gamma_b$ is small.
For the MLSDA, the theoretical upper bound is quite close to the simulation
results for both high SNR ($\gamma_b\geq 6$ dB) and low SNR ($\gamma_b\leq 2$
dB). Even for moderate SNR, the simulation results and the theoretical bound
differ by at most \makeblue{0.8} on a $\log_{10}$ scale.

called the `switcher', was allowed only causal access to the source
realizations and the rate-distortion function was obtained through the use of a
type covering lemma. In this paper, the rate-distortion function of the
adversarial source is described, under the assumption that the switcher has

covering lemma and simple conditional, random `switching' rules. The
rate-distortion function is once again the maximization of the R(D) function
for a region of attainable IID distributions.

self-gravitating collisionless matter, evolving from surface-symmetric compact
initial data. The global dynamics exhibit qualitatively different features
according to the sign of the curvature $k$ of the symmetric surfaces and the
cosmological constant $\Lambda$. With a suitable formulation, the question of
strong cosmic censorship is settled in the affirmative if $\Lambda=0$ or
$k\le0$, $\Lambda>0$. In the case $\Lambda>0$, $k=1$, we give a detailed
geometric characterization of possible ""boundary"" components of spacetime; the
remaining obstruction to showing strong cosmic censorship in this case has to
do with the possible formation of extremal Schwarzschild-de Sitter-type black
holes. In the special case that the initial symmetric surfaces are all
expanding, strong cosmic censorship is shown in the past for all $k,\Lambda$.
Finally, our results also lead to a geometric characterization of the future
boundary of black hole interiors for the collapse of asymptotically flat data:
in particular, in the case of small perturbations of Schwarzschild data, it is
shown that these solutions do not exhibit Cauchy horizons emanating from $i^+$
with strictly positive limiting area radius.

allowed as a finite energy state, which yields to a contribution of wraparound

the free quark case and quenched QCD at finite temperature. The ``scattering''
contribution causes a constant mode in meson correlators with zero spatial
momentum and degenerate quark masses, which can dominate the correlators in the
region of large imaginary times. In the free spectral function, the
contribution yields a term proportional to $\omega\delta(\omega)$. Therefore
this contribution is related to transport phenomena in the quark gluon plasma.
It is possible to distinguish the constant contribution from the other part
using several analysis methods proposed in this paper. As a result of the
analyses, we find that drastic changes in charmonium correlators for $\chi_c$
states just above the deconfinement transition are due to the constant
contribution. The other differences in the $\chi_c$ states are small. It may
indicate the survival of $\chi_c$ states after the deconfinement transition

analytical and does not depend on an expansion in terms of local operators. We

we have found that arbitrarily precise results are obtained, simply increasing
the number of grid points. More difficult problems have also been considered,
observing in all cases the convergence of the numerical results. Using these
results we have also derived a new representation for the quantum mechanical

representation for a free particle in a box, recovering the exact result after
taking the proper limits, and we have also found that the application of the
Feynman--Kac formula to our Green's function yields the correct ground state
energy. Our path integral representation allows to treat hamiltonians
containing non--local operators and it could provide to the community a new
tool to deal with such class of problems.

always awkward problem, when the data come from real-world contexts. In
applications, we are very often in front of observations for which all the
values are not available, and this can occur for many reasons: typing errors,
fields left unanswered in surveys, etc. Most of the statistical software (as
SAS for example) simply suppresses incomplete observations. It has no practical
consequence when the data are very numerous. But if the number of remaining
data is too small, it can remove all significance to the results. To avoid
suppressing data in that way, it is possible to replace a missing value with
the mean value of the corresponding variable, but this approximation can be
very bad when the variable has a large variance. So it is very worthwhile
seeing that the Kohonen algorithm (as well as the Forgy algorithm) perfectly
deals with data with missing values, without having to estimate them
beforehand. We are particularly interested in the Kohonen algorithm for its
visualization properties.

gearbox, two approaches are tested, one is a numerical method, the other is
experimental. For the numerical method, the vibration response of the gearbox
can be evaluated with use of a finite element analysis and a spectral and
iterative method. It's confirmed that applying the generalized forces
transmitted through the bearings on the empty housing allows to rebuild the
housing response (reciprocity principle). The simulation on the time- and
space-averaged mean square vibration velocity shows the vibration response of
the housing is induced principally by the axial exciting forces, and
secondarily by the moments Mx and My. transmitted on the free side (the 6 mm
thick face). Realistic estimation of these excitation forces needs a modelling
of the whole gearbox taking into account the mechanical properties of the
housing. For the experimental approach, an inverse method based upon the FRF
measurement and characterisation of gearbox vibration response is developed.
Beginning from the equivalent forces obtained by this inverse method, a
resulting force and a moment are derived for representing the distributed force
acting on each bearing. The comparison between the results obtained by these
two methods shows the effectiveness of this indirect force determination
methodology.

frequency-response curves. To this end, a third order Taylor series of the
elastic Hertzian contact force is introduced over the displacement interval
where the system remains in contact. A classical time integration method is
also used in conjunction with a shooting method to take into account losses of

constitutes a precursor of dynamic responses characterised by loss of contact,
and consequently, the resonance establishes over a wide frequency range.

analogous to associative learning can occur in a biochemical network.
Associative learning is a form of learning whereby a system ""learns"" to
associate two stimuli with one another. In our model, two types of replicating
molecules, denoted A and B, are present in some initial concentration in the
chemostat. Molecules A and B are stimulated to replicate by some growth
factors, denoted GA and GB, respectively. It is also assumed that A and B can
covalently link, and that the conjugated molecule can be stimulated by either
the GA or GB growth factors (and can be degraded). We show that, if the
chemostat is stimulated by both growth factors for a certain time, followed by
a time gap during which the chemostat is not stimulated at all, and if the
chemostat is then stimulated again by only one of the growth factors, then
there will be a transient increase in the number of molecules activated by the
other growth factor. Therefore, the chemostat bears the imprint of earlier,
simultaneous stimulation with both growth factors, which is indicative of
associative learning. It is interesting to note that the dynamics of our model
is consistent with various aspects of Pavlov's original series of associative
learning experiments in dogs. We discuss how associative learning can
potentially be performed in vitro within RNA, DNA, or peptide networks. We also
highlight how such a mechanism could potentially be involved in genomic
evolution, and suggest bioinformatics studies that could be used to find
evidence for associative learning processes at work inside living cells.

to remember transient biological signals received in the past. Moreover, it may
be desirable to remember or ignore these transient signals conditioned upon
other signals that are active at specific points in time or in unique
environments. Here, we propose a simple genetic circuit in bacteria that is
capable of conditionally memorizing a signal in the form of a transcription
factor concentration. The circuit behaves similarly to a ""data latch"" in an
electronic circuit, i.e. it reads and stores an input signal only when
conditioned to do so by a ""read command"". Our circuit is of the same size as
the well-known genetic toggle switch (an unconditional latch) which consists of
two mutually repressing genes, but is complemented with a ""regulatory front
end"" involving protein heterodimerization as a simple way to implement
conditional control. Deterministic and stochastic analysis of the circuit
dynamics indicate that an experimental implementation is feasible based on
well-characterized genes and proteins. It is not known, to which extent
molecular networks are able to conditionally store information in natural
contexts for bacteria. However, our results suggest that such sequential logic
elements may be readily implemented by cells through the combination of
existing protein-protein interactions and simple transcriptional regulation.

nonlinearity by measurements resulting in probabilistic gate operations. In
one-way quantum computation, the random quantum measurement error can be
overcome by applying a feed-forward technique, such that the future measurement
basis depends on earlier measurement results. This technique is crucial for
achieving deterministic quantum computation once a cluster state (the highly
entangled multiparticle state on which one-way quantum computation is based) is
prepared. Here we realize a concatenated scheme of measurement and active
feed-forward in a one-way quantum computing experiment. We demonstrate that,
for a perfect cluster state and no photon loss, our quantum computation scheme
would operate with good fidelity and that our feed-forward components function
with very high speed and low error for detected photons. With present
technology, the individual computational step (in our case the individual
feed-forward cycle) can be operated in less than 150 ns using electro-optical
modulators. This is an important result for the future development of one-way

gravity are relevant. In general relativity, causal structure is non-fixed. In
quantum theory non-fixed quantities are subject to quantum uncertainty. It is
therefore likely that, in a theory of quantum gravity, we will have indefinite
causal structure. This means that there will be no matter of fact as to whether
a particular interval is timelike or not. We study the implications of this for
the theory of computation. Classical and quantum computations consist in
ivolving the state of the computer through a sequence of time steps. This will,
most likely, not be possible for a quantum gravity computer because the notion
of a time step makes no sense if we have indefinite causal structure. We show
that it is possible to set up a model for computation even in the absence of
definite causal structure by using a certain framework (the causaloid
formalism) that was developed for the purpose of correlating data taken in this
type of situation. Corresponding to a physical theory is a causaloid, Lambda
(this is a mathematical object containing information about the causal
connections between different spacetime regions). A computer is given by the
pair {Lambda, S} where S is a set of gates. Working within the causaloid
formalism, we explore the question of whether universal quantum gravity
computers are possible. We also examine whether a quantum gravity computer
might be more powerful than a quantum (or classical) computer. In particular,
we ask whether indefinite causal structure can be used as a computational
resource.
