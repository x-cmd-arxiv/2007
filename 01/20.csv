archival {\it Chandra} and {\it XMM-Newton} observations. The {\it XMM-Newton}
spectra of the nuclear region are well described by two power-law components, a
soft (0.57 keV) thermal component, and an Fe K$\alpha$ line with EW = 40 $\pm$
33 eV. The properties of the second, weaker power-law component are similar to
those of an off-nuclear source $2.5\arcsec$ SW of the nucleus. The spectrum of
the extended emission of the entire galaxy is well described by two thermal
components (MEKAL) models with temperatures $\simeq 0.60$ and 0.22 keV. The
{\it Chandra} and {\it XMM-Newton} spectra along the anomalous arms show that
the absorbing column density to the SE anomalous arm is consistent with
absorption by gas in our Galaxy, while the absorbing column to the NW anomalous
arm is higher, indicating that the NW arm is partially on the far side of the
galactic disk. The combined {\it Chandra} data clearly detect the X-ray
emission from the hot spots at the end of the approximately N-S radio jets. By
assuming the hot spots represent shocked thermal gas at the ends of the jets,
we estimate shock powers of $\simeq 3 \times 10^{39} f^{-1/2}$ \ergps ($f $ is
the filling factor), similar to the radiative power in the inner anomalous
arms, consistent with the notion that the jets could be responsible for heating
the gas in the anomalous arms.

the surface of accreting neutron stars. The wait time between consecutive
bursts is set by the time required to accumulate the fuel needed to trigger a
new burst; this is at least one hour. Sometimes secondary bursts are observed,
approximately 10 min after the main burst. These short wait-time bursts are not
yet understood. We observed the low-mass X-ray binary and X-ray burster EXO
0748-676 with XMM-Newton for 158 h, during 7 uninterrupted observations lasting
up to 30 h each. We detect 76 X-ray bursts. Most remarkably, 15 of these bursts
occur in burst triplets, with wait times of 12 min between the three components
of the triplet. We also detect 14 doublets with similar wait times between the
two components of the doublet. The characteristics of the bursts indicate that
possibly all bursts in this system are hydrogen-ignited, in contrast with most
other frequent X-ray bursters in which bursts are helium-ignited, but
consistent with the low mass accretion rate in EXO 0748-676. Possibly the
hydrogen ignition is the determining factor for the occurrence of short

minimal mass of the halo able to collapse. Hence, we conclude that X-rays from
the decays of dark matter in the form of sterile neutrinos can help the early
collapse of gas clouds and the subsequent star formation.

global X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) observables for systems of merging
relaxed X-ray clusters. In all of the scaling relations generated from the
properties we have studied, we observe a generic evolution (in good qualitative
agreement with previous authors): a rapid transient roughly along the mass
scaling relations, a subsequent slow drift across the scatter until
virialization, followed by a slow evolution along and up the mass scaling
relations as cooling recovers in the cluster cores. However, this drift is not
sufficient to account for the observed scatter in the scaling relations. We
also study the effects of mergers on several theoretical temperature measures
of the intracluster medium: emission weighted measures (T_ew), the
spectroscopic-like measure proposed by Mazzotta et al (2004; T_sl) and plasma
model fits to the integrated spectrum of the system (T_spec). We find that T_sl
tracks T_spec for the entire duration of our mergers, illustrating that it
remains a good tool for observational comparison even for highly disturbed
systems. Furthermore, the transient temperature increases produced during first
and second pericentric passage are 15-40% larger for T_ew than for T_sl or
T_spec. This suggests that the effects of transient temperature increases on
sigma_8 and Omega_M derived by Randall et al (2002) are over estimated. Lastly,
we examine the X-ray SZ proxy proposed by Kravtsov et al (2006) and find that
the tight mass scaling relation they predict remains secure through the entire
duration of a merger event, independent of projection effects.

unresolved spectrally, so the observations produce emission-line images for
each line in the spectrum. This rich dataset shows how physical conditions in
the jet vary with distance and time, produces precise proper motions of knots
within the jet, resolves the jet width close to the star, and gives a spectrum
of the reflected light from the disk over a large wavelength range at several
positions. We introduce a new method for analyzing a set of line ratios based
on minimizing a quadratic form between models and data. The method generates
images of the density, temperature and ionization fraction computed using all
the possible line ratios appropriately weighted. In HH 30, the density declines
with distance from the source in a manner consistent with an expanding flow,
and is larger by a factor of two along the axis of the jet than it is at the
periphery. Ionization in the jet ranges from ~ 5% to 40%, and high
ionization/excitation knots form at about 100 AU from the star and propagate
outward with the flow. These high-excitation knots are not accompanied by
corresponding increases in the density, so if formed by velocity variations the
knots must have a strong internal magnetic pressure to smooth out density
increases while lengthening recombination times.

telescopes to conduct a high cadence pixel-lensing survey of the bulge of the

based on detailed simulation of events and application of realistic
observational conditions. Under the conservative detection criteria that only
high signal-to-noise caustic-crossing events with long enough durations between
caustic crossings can be firmly identified as binary lens events, we estimate
that the rate would be $\Gamma_{\rm b}\sim (7-15)f_{\rm b}(N/50)$ per season,
where $f_{\rm b}$ is the fraction of binaries with projected separations of
$10^{-3} {\rm AU}<\tilde{d}<10^3 {\rm AU}$ out of all lenses and $N$ is the

detect weak lensing signal out to 300 kpc/h. We analyze blank control fields

are embedded. IMBHs, when passing through dense gas regions, can accrete gas
and switch on as X-ray sources. We derive the luminosity distribution of
simulated IMBHs, by assuming that they accrete at the Bondi-Hoyle rate. The
X-ray distribution of simulated IMBHs has been compared with that of observed
sources in the dwarf galaxy Holmberg II, chosen for its richness in gas, its
small mass (compared to spiral galaxies), and the accuracy of the available
X-ray measurements. Holmberg II also hosts one of the strongest IMBH

to synchrotron, namely either a single power law or a broken power law with a
slope change by 0.5. We confirm a low dust-to-metal ratio, smaller than in the
SMC, even from the analysis of data taken significantly earlier than previously
possible. Our analysis does not support the existence of ``grey'' dust. We also
find that the synchrotron spectrum works remarkably well to explain afterglow
SEDs. We clearly see, however, that during the X-ray steep decay phases and the
flares, the X-ray radiation cannot be due only to afterglow emission.

We calculate the decay of nuclear spin quantum memory in the context of Hahn
and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) refocused spin echoes using a formally
exact cluster expansion technique which has previously been successful in
dealing with electron spin dephasing in a solid state nuclear spin bath. With
decoherence dominated by transverse dephasing (T2), we find it feasible to
maintain high fidelity (losses of less than 10^{-6}) quantum memory on nuclear
spins for times of the order of 100 microseconds (GaAs:P) and 1 to 2
milliseconds (natural Si:P) using CPMG pulse sequences of just a few (~2-4)
applied pulses. We also consider the complementary situation of a central
flipped intrinsic nuclear spin in a bath of completely polarized nuclear spins
where decoherence is caused by the direct flip-flop of the central spin with
spins in the bath. Exact numerical calculations that include a sufficiently
large neighborhood of surrounding nuclei show lifetimes on the order of 1-5 ms
for both GaAs and natural Si. Our calculated nuclear spin coherence times may
have significance for solid state quantum computer architectures using
localized electron spins in semiconductors where nuclear spins have been

phenomena have been hypothesized to be related to restructuring of the hydrogen
bond network of water around small nonpolar solutes or hydrophobic amino acid
side chains. However, an underlying physical mechanism has yet to be
identified. We assume the solute particles and the monomers of a polymer
interact via a hard sphere potential. We further assume that the solvent
molecules interact via the two-scale spherically symmetric Jagla potential,
which qualitatively reproduces the anomalies of water, such as expansion on
cooling. We find that this model correctly predicts the increase in solubility
of nonpolar compounds and the swelling of polymers on cooling. Our findings are
consistent with the possibility that the presence of two length scales in the
Jagla potential--a rigid hard core and a more flexible soft core--is
responsible for both phenomena. At low temperatures, the solvent particles
prefer to remain at the soft core distance, leaving enough space for small
nonpolar solutes to enter the solvent thus increasing solubility. We support
this hypothesized mechanism by molecular dynamic simulations.

behavior determines macroscopic properties such as flow and mechanical
strength. A comprehensive theory of the properties of granular matter,
therefore, requires a statistical framework. In molecular matter, equilibrium
statistical mechanics, which is founded on the principle of conservation of
energy, provides this framework. Grains, however, are small but macroscopic
objects whose interactions are dissipative since energy can be lost through
excitations of the internal degrees of freedom. In this work, we construct a
statistical framework for static, mechanically stable packings of grains, which
parallels that of equilibrium statistical mechanics but with conservation of
energy replaced by the conservation of a function related to the mechanical
stress tensor. Our analysis demonstrates the existence of a state function that
has all the attributes of entropy. In particular, maximizing this state
function leads to a well-defined granular temperature for these systems.
Predictions of the ensemble are verified against simulated packings of
frictionless, deformable disks. Our demonstration that a statistical ensemble
can be constructed through the identification of conserved quantities other
than energy is a new approach that is expected to open up avenues for
statistical descriptions of other non-equilibrium systems.

M_{irr}^{BH}/M_{ADM,0}^{NS} = 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10. We consider neutron stars of
baryon rest mass M_B^{NS}/M_B^{max} = 83% and 56%, where M_B^{max} is the
maximum allowed rest mass of a spherical star in isolation for our equation of
state. For these sequences, we locate the onset of tidal disruption and, in
cases with sufficiently large mass ratios and neutron star compactions, the
innermost stable circular orbit. We compare with previous results for black
hole-neutron star binaries and find excellent agreement with third-order
post-Newtonian results, especially for large binary separations. We also use
our results to estimate the energy spectrum of the outgoing gravitational
radiation emitted during the inspiral phase for these binaries.

The calculations of the isotropic and homogeneous cosmological models are
undertaken in the Jordan frame and at both the background and the perturbation
levels. For the former, we also discuss the connection to the Einstein frame in
which the extra degree of freedom in the theory is associated with a scalar
field sharing some of the properties of a 'chameleon' field. For the latter, we
derive the cosmological perturbation equations in general theories of f(R)
gravity in covariant form and implement them numerically to calculate the
cosmic-microwave-background temperature and matter-power spectra of the
cosmological model. The CMB power is shown to reduce at low l's, and the matter
power spectrum is almost scale-independent at small scales, thus having a
similar shape to that in standard general relativity. These are in stark
contrast with what was found in the Palatini f(R) gravity, where the CMB power
is largely amplified at low l's and the matter spectrum is strongly
scale-dependent at small scales. These features make the present model more
adaptable than that arising from the Palatini f(R) field equations, and none of
the data on background evolution, CMB power spectrum, or matter power spectrum
currently rule it out.

Identification of highly energetic tops is crucial for this analysis. We show
that conventional identification methods relying on well separated decay
products will not work for heavy resonances but suggest alternative methods for
top identification for energetic tops. We find, conservatively, that resonances
with masses less than 5 TeV can be discovered if the algorithm to identify high
$p_T$ tops can reject the QCD background by a factor of 10. We also find that
for similar or lighter masses the spin can be determined and for lighter masses
the chirality of the coupling to $t\bar t$ can be measured. Since the energetic
top pair final state is a generic signature for a large class of new physics as
the top quark presumably couples most strongly to the electroweak symmetry
breaking sector, the methods we have outlined to study the properties of the
KK-gluon should also be important in other scenarios.

fundamental axioms of local quantum field theory or string theory may impose
positivity constraints on the couplings of the leading irrelevant operators in
a low-energy effective field theory is critically discussed. Violation of these
constraints implies superluminal propagation, in the sense that the
low-frequency limit of the phase velocity $v_{\rm ph}(0)$ exceeds $c$. It is
explained why causality is related not to $v_{\rm ph}(0)$ but to the
high-frequency limit $v_{\rm ph}(\infty)$ and how these are related by the
Kramers-Kronig dispersion relation, depending on the sign of the imaginary part
of the refractive index $\Ima n(\w)$ which is normally assumed positive.
Superluminal propagation and its relation to UV completion is investigated in
detail in three theories: QED in a background electromagnetic field, where the
full dispersion relation for $n(\w)$ is evaluated numerically for the first
time and the role of the null energy condition $T_{\m\n}k^\m k^\n \ge 0$ is
highlighted; QED in a background gravitational field, where examples of
superluminal low-frequency phase velocities arise in violation of the
positivity constraints; and light propagation in coupled laser-atom
$\L$-systems exhibiting Raman gain lines with $\Ima n(\w) < 0$. The possibility
that a negative $\Ima n(\w)$ must occur in quantum field theories involving
gravity to avoid causality violation, and the implications for the relation of
IR effective field theories to their UV completion, are carefully analysed.

optimal control of regulators in various applications. Some examples include
correcting the trajectory of rocket and air vehicles, vibration suppression of
flexible structures, and airplane stability. In all these cases, the focus is
in suppressing/decreasing system deviations rapidly. However, if one compares
the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) solution with optimal solutions (minimum
time), it is seen that the LQR solution is less than optimal in some cases
indeed (3-6) times that obtained using a minimum time solution. Moreover, the
LQR solution is sometimes unacceptable in practice due to the fact that values
of control extend beyond admissible limits and thus the designer must choose
coefficients in the linear quadratic form, which are unknown.
  The authors suggest methods which allow finding a quasi-optimal LQR solution
with bounded control which is closed to the minimum time solution. They also
remand the process of the minimum time decision. Keywords: Optimal regulator,
minimum time controller, Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). -- This paper is

  set partition theory","Ph.D. thesis, 177 pages",,,,"math.CO",,"  The main focus of this thesis is a generalization of covering arrays,
covering arrays on graphs. Two vectors v,w in Z_k^n are qualitatively
independent if for all ordered pairs (a,b) in Z_k x Z_k there is a position i
in the vectors where (a,b) = (v_i,w_i). A covering array is an array with the
property that any pair of rows are qualitatively independent. A covering array
on a graph is an array with a row for each vertex of the graph with the
property that any two rows which correspond to adjacent vertices are
qualitatively independent. The addition of a graph structure to covering arrays
makes it possible to use methods from graph theory to study these designs. In
this thesis, we define a family of graphs called the qualitative independence
graphs. A graph has a covering array, with given parameters, if and only if
there is a homomorphism from the graph to a particular qualitative independence
graph. Cliques in qualitative independence graphs relate to covering arrays and
independent sets are connected to intersecting partition systems. It is known
that the exact size of an optimal binary covering array can be determined using
Sperner's Theorem and the Erdos-Ko-Rado Theorem. Since the rows of general
covering arrays correspond to set partitions, we give extensions of Sperner's
Theorem and the Erdos-Ko-Rado Theorem to set-partition systems. We also
consider a subgraph of a general qualitative independence graph called the
uniform qualitative independence graph. We give the spectra for several of
these graphs and conjecture that they are graphs in an association scheme. We
also give a new construction for covering arrays which yields many new upper
bounds on the size of optimal covering arrays.

nonequilibrium simulations can fail to provide a proper flow of heat. All the
Hamiltonian formulations considered here are applied to the same prototypical
two-temperature ""phi-4"" model of a heat-conducting chain. This model
incorporates nearest-neighbor Hooke's-Law interactions plus a quartic tethering
potential. Physically correct results, obtained with the isokinetic Gaussian
and Nose-Hoover thermostats, are compared with two other Hamiltonian results.
The latter results, based on constrained Hamiltonian thermostats, fail
correctly to model the flow of heat.

determines the phase difference between the periodic activities of the two

delay much larger than the delay for the positive coupling, the system
approaches in-phase synchrony between the two components. Employing variational
perturbation theory (VPT), we achieve an approximate analytical evaluation of
the phase shift, in good agreement with numerical results.

numerically. This pattern is statistically steady, is oriented obliquely to the
streamwise direction, and has a very large wavelength relative to the gap. The
mean flow, averaged in time and in the homogeneous direction, is analysed. The
flow in the quasi-laminar region is not the linear Couette profile, but results
from a non-trivial balance between advection and diffusion. This force balance
yields a first approximation to the relationship between the Reynolds number,
angle, and wavelength of the pattern. Remarkably, the variation of the mean
flow along the pattern wavevector is found to be almost exactly harmonic: the
flow can be represented via only three cross-channel profiles as U(x,y,z) =
U_0(y) + U_c(y) cos(kz) + U_s(y) sin(kz). A model is formulated which relates
the cross-channel profiles of the mean flow and of the Reynolds stress. Regimes
computed for a full range of angle and Reynolds number in a tilted rectangular
periodic computational domain are presented. Observations of regular
turbulent-laminar patterns in other shear flows -- Taylor-Couette,
