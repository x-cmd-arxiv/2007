at the centers of low-mass (M>5e5 solar masses) dark matter ``minihalos'', and
produced hard radiation by accretion. FUV/X-ray photons from such

radiation, reduced gas clumping, and changed the chemistry of primordial gas.
The role of accreting seed black holes in determining the thermal and

We derive simple estimates of the maximum efficiency with which matter
can be ejected by the propeller mechanism in disk-fed, rotating magnetic
neutron stars. Some binary evolution scenarios envisage that this mechanism is
responsible for expelling to infinity the mass inflowing at a low rate from the
companion star, therefore limiting the total amount of mass that can be
accreted by the neutron star. Methods. We demonstrate that, for typical neutron
star parameters, a maximum of \eta_{pro} < 5.7 (P_{-3})^{1/3} times more matter
than accreted can be expelled through the propeller mechanism at the expenses
of the neutron star rotational energy (P_{-3} is the NS spin period in unit of
10E-3 s). Approaching this value, however, would require a great deal of fine
tuning in the system parameters and the properties of the interaction of matter

some other mechanism must be invoked in order to prevent that too much mass
accretes onto the neutron stars of some low mass X-ray binaries.

increase in umbral core brightness from the early to the late phase of solar
cycle from the analysis of 13 sunspots which cover solar cycles 20 and 21. Here
we revisit this topic by analysing continuum images of more than 160 sunspots
observed by the MDI instrument on board the SOHO spacecraft for the period
between 1998 March to 2004 March, i.e. a sizable part of solar cycle 23. The
advantage of this data set is its homogeneity, with no seeing fluctuations. A
careful stray light correction, which is validated using the Mercury transit of
7th May, 2003, is carried out before the umbral and penumbral intensities are
determined. The influence of the Zeeman splitting of the nearby NiI spectral
line on the measured 'continuum' intensity is also taken into account. We did
not observe any significant variation in umbral core, mean umbral and mean
penumbral intensities with solar cycle, which is in contrast to earlier
findings for the umbral core intensity. We do find a strong and clear
dependence of the umbral brightness on sunspot size, however. The penumbral
brightness also displays a weak dependence. The brightness-radius relationship
has numerous implications, some of which, such as those for the energy
transport in umbrae, are pointed out.

$\sigma_{\mu\nu}^{s0}$ and the spin torque dipole correction $\sigma_{\mu\nu

use of which we study the conserved spin Hall conductivity in the two
dimensional hole gas modeled by a combined Luttinger and SIA Rashba spin-orbit
coupling. It is shown that the two components in spin Hall conductivity usually
have the opposite contributions. While in the absence of Rashba spin splitting,
the spin Hall transport is dominated by the conventional contribution, the
presence of Rashba spin splitting stirs up a large enhancement of the spin
torque dipole correction, leading to an overall sign change for the total spin
Hall conductivity. Furthermore, an approximate two-band calculation and the
subsequent comparison with the exact four-band results are given, which reveals
that the coupling between the heavy hole and light hole bands should be taken

by a rapidly varying environment. The transitions of the environment are
determined by the empirical distribution of the particles. We prove the
propagation of chaos on the path space of the particles and establish that the
limiting trajectory of the empirical measure of the states of the particles
satisfies a deterministic differential equation. This deterministic
differential equation involves the time averages of the environment process.

  general results obtained",,,,"math.AC math.AP",,"  For linear operators which factor with suitable assumptions concerning
commutativity of the factors, we introduce several notions of a decomposition.
When any of these hold then questions of null space and range are subordinated
to the same questions for the factors, or certain compositions thereof. When
the factors are polynomial in other commuting operators then we show that, in a
suitable sense, generically factorisations algebraically yield decompositions.
In the case of operators on a space over an algebraically closed field this
boils down to elementary algebraic geometry arising from the polynomial formula
for the orginal operator. Applied to operators P polynomial in single other
operator D this shows that the solution space for P decomposes directly into a
sum of generalised eigenspaces for D. We give universal formulae for the
projectors administering the decomposition. In the generic setting the
inhomogenous problems for P reduce to an equivalent inhomogeneous problem for
an operator linear in D. These results are independent of the operator D, and
so provide a route to progressing such questions when functional calculus is
unavailable. Related generalising results are obtained as well as a treatment
for operators on vector spaces over arbitrary fields. We introduce and discuss
symmetry algebras for such operators. As a motivating example application we
treat, on Einstein manifolds, the conformal Laplacian operators of
