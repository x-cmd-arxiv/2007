detected in the GALEX near-ultraviolet band down to a limiting magnitude of
25.5 (AB). We make use of the UV to estimate star formation rates, correcting
for the effect of dust using the UV-slope, and compute, from the ACS F814W
images, the C,A,S,G,M20 morphological parameters for all objects in our sample.
We observe a morphological bimodality in the galaxy population and show that it
has a strong correspondence with the FUV - g color bimodality. We conclude that
UV-optical color predominantly evolves concurrently with morphology. We observe
many of the most star-forming galaxies to have morphologies approaching that of
early-type galaxies, and interpret this as evidence that strong starburst
events are linked to bulge growth and constitute a process through which
galaxies can be brought from the blue to the red sequence while simultaneously
modifying their morphology accordingly. We conclude that the red sequence has
continued growing at z~<0.7. We also observe z~0.7 galaxies to have physical
properties similar to that of local galaxies, except for higher star formation
rates. Whence we infer that the dimming of star-forming galaxies is responsible
for most of the evolution in the star formation rate density of the Universe
since that redshift, although our data are also consistent with a mild number
evolution. [abridged]

coherently described by the distribution of galaxy photometric redshifts, an
ACS weak-lensing convergence map and the distribution of extended X-ray sources
in a mosaic of XMM observations. The main peak seen in these maps corresponds
to a rich cluster with Tx= 3.51+0.60/-0.46 keV and Lx=(1.56+/-0.04) x 10^{44}
erg/s ([0.1-2.4] keV band). We estimate an X-ray mass within $r500$
corresponding to M500~1.6 x 10^{14} Msun and a total lensing mass (extrapolated
by fitting a NFW profile) M(NFW)=(6+/-3) x 10^15 Msun. We use an automated
morphological classification of all galaxies brighter than I_AB=24 over the
structure area to measure the fraction of early-type objects as a function of
local projected density Sigma_10, based on photometric redshifts derived from
ground-based deep multi-band photometry. We recover a robust morphology-density
relation at this redshift, indicating, for comparable local densities, a
smaller fraction of early-type galaxies than today. Interestingly, this
difference is less strong at the highest densities and becomes more severe in
intermediate environments. We also find, however, local ""inversions'' of the
observed global relation, possibly driven by the large-scale environment. In
particular, we find direct correspondence of a large concentration of disk
galaxies to (the colder side of) a possible shock region detected in the X-ray
temperature map and surface brightness distribution of the dominant cluster. We
interpret this as potential evidence of shock-induced star formation in
existing galaxy disks, during the ongoing merger between two sub-clusters.

the percentage of objects populating the two sequences is a function of
environment, with a clear morphology/color-density relation, their
normalization and slope are independent of local density. We identify and study
a number of objects with ""anomalous'' colors, given their morphology. Red
late-type galaxies are found to be mostly highly-inclined spiral galaxies, with
colors dominated by internal reddening (33% contamination with respect to truly
passive spheroidals). Conversely, the population of blue early-type galaxies is
composed by objects of moderate luminosity and mass, concurring to only ~5% of
the mass in spheroidal galaxies. The majority of them (~70%) occupy a position
in the surface-brightness/effective-radius plane not consistent with them being
precursors of current epoch elliptical galaxies. In a color-mass diagram, color
sequences are even better defined, with red galaxies covering in general a
wider range of masses at nearly constant color, and blue galaxies showing a
more pronounced dependence of color on mass. While the red sequence is
adequately reproduced by models of passive evolution, the blue sequence is
better interpreted as a specific star-formation sequence. Its substantial
invariance with respect to local density suggests that the overall, ""secular''
star formation is driven more by galaxy mass than by environment. [...]

correcting the line-of-sight velocities for the recent accurate measurement of

flat rotation curve with similar shape but different amplitude for each tracer:
61 km/s for the carbon stars, 80 km/s for the HI, and 107 km/s for the red
supergiants. Previously identified tidal HI features are seen to harbor
numerous carbon stars, with the tidally disturbed stars comprising 7-15% of the

sample alone to construct a reliable model of the LMC's gravitational
potential. We also find red supergiants with peculiar kinematics, but their
association with tidal features is unclear, and may instead be interacting with
supergiant HI shell SGS4. In addition, although the local velocity dispersion
of the red supergiants is small, ~8 km/s, their velocity dispersion about the

is to establish relations between the IR colors, the effective temperature
$T_{eff}$, the luminosity $L$ and the mass loss rate $\dot M$, for improving
the effectiveness of AGB modelling. Bolometric (absolute) magnitudes are
obtained through distance compilations, and by applying previously-derived
bolometric corrections; the variability is also studied, using data accumulated
since the IRAS epoch. The main results are: i) Values of $L$ and $\dot M$ for C
stars fit relations previously established by us, with Miras being on average
more evolved and mass losing than Semiregulars. ii) Moderate IR excesses (as
compared to evolutionary tracks) are found for S and M stars in our sample:
they are confirmed to originate from the dusty circumstellar environment. iii)
A larger reddening characterizes C-rich Miras and post-AGBs. In this case, part
of the excess is due to AGB models overestimating $T_{eff}$ for C-stars, as a
consequence of the lack of suitable molecular opacities. This has a large
effect on the colors of C-rich sources and sometimes disentangling the
photospheric and circumstellar contributions is difficult; better model
atmospheres should be used in stellar evolutionary codes for C stars. iv) The
presence of a long-term variability at mid-IR wavelengths seems to be limited
to sources with maximum emission in the 8 -- 20 $\mu$m region, usually Mira
variables (1/3 of our sample). Most Semiregular and post-AGB stars studied here
remained remarkably constant in mid-IR over the last twenty years.

different clouds, a main cloud to the east of the UCHII region, of 0.5 pc and
250 Msun, and a western cloud, of 0.15 pc and 30 Msun. The dust emission
reveals two strong components in the northern side of the main cloud,
associated with Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) driving molecular outflows, and
two fainter components in the southern side, with no signs of star forming
activity. Regarding the CH3OH, we found strong emission in a fork-like
structure associated with outflow B, as well as emission associated with
outflow A. The rotational temperature is higher in the northern side of the
main cloud, around 22 K, where there are most of the YSOs, than in the southern
side, around 16 K. There is strong chemical differentiation in the region,
since we determined low values of the NH3/N2H+ ratio, around 50, associated
with YSOs in the north of the main cloud, and high values, up to 300,
associated with cores with no detected YSOs, in the south of the main cloud.
Such a chemical differentiation is likely due to abundance/depletion effects.
Finally, interaction between the different sources in the region is important,
mainly through their UV radiation and outflows (abridged).

standard star catalog constructed using repeated SDSS imaging observations. The
SDSS catalog includes over 700,000 candidate standard stars from the equatorial
stripe 82 (|Dec|<1.266 deg) in the RA range 20h 34' to 4h 00', and with the $r$
band magnitudes in the range 14--21. The distributions of measurements for
individual sources demonstrate that the SDSS photometric pipeline correctly
estimates random photometric errors, which are below 0.01 mag for stars
brighter than (19.5, 20.5, 20.5, 20, 18.5) in ugriz, respectively (about twice
as good as for individual SDSS runs). We derive mean photometric
transformations between the SDSS gri and the BVRI system using 1165 Stetson
stars found in the equatorial stripe 82, and then study the spatial variation
of the difference in zeropoints between the two catalogs. Using third order
polynomials to describe the color terms, we find that photometric measurements
for main-sequence stars can be transformed between the two systems with
systematic errors smaller than a few millimagnitudes. The spatial variation of
photometric zeropoints in the two catalogs typically does not exceed 0.01
magnitude. Consequently, the SDSS Standard Star Catalog for Stripe 82 can be
used to calibrate new data in both the SDSS ugriz and the BVRI systems with a
similar accuracy.

potential for photometric parameter estimation methods. Using Beers et al.
parameters, we find that the metallicity distribution of the Milky Way stars at
a few kpc from the galactic plane is bimodal with a local minimum at [Z/Zo]~
-1.3. The median metallicity for the low-metallicity [Z/Zo]<-1.3 subsample is
nearly independent of Galactic cylindrical coordinates R and z, while it
decreases with z for the high-metallicity [Z/Zo]> -1.3 sample. We also find
that the low-metallicity sample has ~2.5 times larger velocity dispersion and
that it does not rotate (at the ~10 km/s level), while the rotational velocity
of the high-metallicity sample decreases smoothly with the height above the

flatter than the bright-end slope of \beta'~ -3.2. We also show that X-ray deep

Chandra deep fields, hints towards an higher normalization for the total AGN
luminosity function, if these sources lie at 5<z <6.5. We then discuss simple
theoretical models of AGN formation and evolution in the context of cold dark

a redshift-dependent relation between black hole and dark matter halo masses of

to the envelope of horizontal branch (HB) stars. This scenario differs from
previous ones in that the mixing occurs after the star has left the red giant
branch (RGB). We follow the evolution of a low metallicity star from the RGB to
the HB, and examine the density profile and radius in the core-envelope
boundary region. In the transition from the RGB to the HB the envelope shrinks
by two orders of magnitude in size and the core swells, such that any
non-negligible rotation on the RGB will result in a strong rotational shear at
the core-envelope boundary. For a non-negligible rotation to exist on the RGB
the star has to be spun up by a companion spiraling inside its envelope (a
common envelope evolution). We speculate that shear instabilities on the HB
might mix helium-rich core material to the envelope. The shallow density
profile on the HB is less likely to prevent mixing. As previously shown, extra
helium mixing can account for the overluminous blue HB stars found in some
globular clusters. Although being speculative, this study supports the idea
that the presence of low mass companions, from planets to low mass main
sequence stars, influence the evolution of stars, and can explain some
properties of the color-magnitude (Herzsprung-Russel) diagram of globular
clusters. Namely, low mass companions can be an ingredient in the so called
`second parameter' of globular clusters.

mass for the total binary mass. It is currently believed that cool contact
binaries are formed from detached binaries losing angular momentum (AM) via a
magnetized wind. Orbital evolution of detached binaries with various component
masses was followed until the primary component reached the critical Roche
surface and the Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) began. It was assumed that the
minimum initial, i.e. ZAMS, orbital period of such binaries is equal to 2 d and
that the components lose AM just as single stars. According to the
mass-dependent formula for AM loss rate of single stars, derived in this paper,
the AM loss time scale increases substantially with decreasing stellar mass.
The formula was applied to binaries with the initial primary component masses
between 1.0 and 0.6 solar mass and two values of mass ratio q=1 and 0.5.
  Detailed calculations show that the time needed to reach RLOF by a 1 solar
mass primary is of the order of 7.5 Gyr, but it increases to more than 13 Gyr
for a binary with an initial primary mass of 0.7 solar mass. Binaries with less
massive primaries have not yet had time to reach RLOF even within the age of
the Universe. This sets a lower mass limit for the presently existing contact
binaries

best statistical fits to the data in a majority of cases, while the Milgrom
relation generally provides good fits as well. We also find that Milgrom models
give mass-to-light ratios that roughly correlate with galaxy color, as
predicted by stellar population models. A subsample of galaxies in the Hydra

is significantly different from relations found in previous studies. Ruling out

radio-loud QSO at low redshifts. It also has two unusual optical features
within the radius of the radio jet (~1""): (1) an anomalous, high-velocity
narrow-line component, having several times as much flux as does the
narrow-line component coinciding with the broad-line redshift; and (2) a bright
continuum peak (3C48A) ~1"" northeast of the quasar. Both of these optical
features have been conjectured to be related to the radio jet. Here we explore
these suggestions. We have obtained Gemini North GMOS integral-field-unit (IFU)
spectroscopy of the central region around 3C48. We use the unique features of
the IFU data to remove unresolved emission at the position of the quasar. The
resolved emission at the wavelength of the high-velocity component is peaked
<~0.25"" north of the quasar, at virtually the same position angle as the base
of the radio jet. These observations appear to confirm that this high-velocity
gas is connected with the radio jet. However, most of the emission comes from a
region where the jet is still well collimated, rather than from the regions
where the radio maps indicate strong interaction with an external medium. We
also present the results of HST STIS spectroscopy of 3C48A. We show that 3C48A
is dominated by stars with a luminosity-weighted age of ~1.4 X 10^8 years,
substantially older than any reasonable estimate for the age of the radio
source. Our IFU data indicate a similar age. Thus, 3C48A almost certainly
cannot be attributed to jet-induced star formation. The host galaxy of 3C48 is
clearly the result of a merger, and 3C48A seems much more likely to be the
distorted nucleus of the merging partner, in which star formation was induced
during the previous close passage.

conditions for exotic states of matter. Such competition often causes multiple
phase transitions as a function of temperature and can lead to magnetic
structures that break inversion symmetry, thereby inducing ferroelectricity
[1-4]. Although this phenomenon is understood phenomenologically [3-4], it is
of great interest to have a conceptually simpler system in which
ferroelectricity appears coincident with a single magnetic phase transition.
Here we report the first such direct transition from a paramagnetic and
paraelectric phase to an incommensurate multiferroic in the triangular lattice
antiferromagnet RbFe(MoO4)2 (RFMO). A magnetic field extinguishes the electric
polarization when the symmetry of the magnetic order changes and
ferroelectricity is only observed when the magnetic structure has chirality and
breaks inversion symmetry. Multiferroic behaviour in RFMO provides a
theoretically tractable example of ferroelectricity from competing spin
interactions. A Landau expansion of symmetry-allowed terms in the free energy
demonstrates that the chiral magnetic order of the triangular lattice
antiferromagnet gives rise to a pseudoelectric field, whose temperature
dependence agrees with that observed experimentally.

rather generic for a class of two-dimensional lattices that interpolate between
square and $\pi$-flux lattices. Persistence of the peculiar QHE is interpreted
as a topological stability. (ii) While we have the massless Dirac dispersion
only around E=0, the anomalous QHE associated with the Dirac cone unexpectedly
persists for a wide range of the chemical potential. The range is bounded by
van Hove singularities, at which we predict a transition to the ordinary
fermion behavior acompanied by huge jumps in the QHE with a sign change. (iii)

anisotropy energies of small FeCo clusters of varying composition on top of a
Cu(100) substrate. Three different cluster layouts have been considered, namely
2x2, 3x3 and cross-like pentamer clusters. The ratio of Co atoms with respect
to the total number in a chosen cluster (``concentration'') was varied and all
possible arrangements of the atomic species were taken into account.
Calculations have been performed fully relativistically using the embedded
cluster technique in conjunction with the screened Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker
method and the magnetocrysergy depend on the position they occupy in a
particular cluster and on the type and the number of nearest-neighbors. The MAE
for the 2x2 and 3x3 clusters varies with respect to the ``concentration'' of Co
atoms in the same manner as the corresponding monolayer case, whereas the
pentamer clusters show a slightly different behavior. Furthermore, for the
clusters with an easy axis along a direction in the surface plane, the MAE
shows a significant angular dependence.

delta-correlated noise. Surprisingly, the fluctuations persist when increasing

cooperation outperforms receiver cooperation, whereas the opposite is true when
power is optimally allocated among the cooperating nodes but only CSI at the
receiver (CSIR) is available. When the nodes have equal power with CSIR only,
cooperative schemes are shown to offer no capacity improvement over
non-cooperation under the same network power constraint. When the system is
under optimal power allocation with full CSI, the decode-and-forward
transmitter cooperation rate is close to its cut-set capacity upper bound, and
outperforms compress-and-forward receiver cooperation. Under fast Rayleigh
fading in the high SNR regime, similar conclusions follow. Cooperative systems
provide resilience to fading in channel magnitudes; however, capacity becomes
more sensitive to power allocation, and the cooperating nodes need to be closer
together for the decode-and-forward scheme to be capacity-achieving. Moreover,
to realize capacity improvement, full CSI is necessary in transmitter

one of the phases (the product $|\Psi_0|\cdot |\Psi_4|$ and the {\em sum} of
the phases are determined by the so-called BB radiation scalar). The residual
symmetry (""spin/boost"") can be removed by gauge fixing of spin coefficients in
two steps: First, we break the boost symmetry by requiring that $\rho$
corresponds to a global constant mass parameter that equals the ADM mass (or,
equivalently in perturbation theory, that $\rho$ or $\mu$ equal their values in
the no-radiation limits), thus determining the two moduli of the Weyl scalars
$|\Psi_0|, |\Psi_4|$, while leaving their phases as yet undetermined. Second,
we break the spin symmetry by requiring that the ratio $\pi/\tau$ gives the
expected polarization state for the gravitational waves, thus determining the
phases. Our method of gauge fixing--specifically its second step--is
appropriate for cases for which the Weyl curvature is purely electric. Applying
this method to Misner and Brill--Lindquist data, we explicitly find the Weyl

at large distances is parametrized by a Yukawa potential, which arises mainly
from theories with compactified extra dimensions. In many other models however,
the extra dimensions are infinite. These approaches lead to a large distance
power-law deformation of the gravitational newtonian potential $V_N(r)$, namely
$V(r)=(1+k_b/r^b)V_N(r)$, which is less studied in the literature. We
investigate here the dynamics of a particle in a gravitational quantum well
with such a power-law deformation. The effects of the deformation on the energy
spectrum are discussed. We also compare our modified spectrum to the results
obtained with the GRANIT experiment, where the effects of the Earth's
gravitational field on quantum states of ultra cold neutrons moving above a
mirror are studied. This comparison leads to upper bounds on $b$ and $k_b$.

this asymmetry is sourced by the fields which are active during inflation, it

expansion point. This difference is substantial because it leads to new gauge
and diff anomalies, which are necessary to combine background independence with
locality. Physically, the new ingredient is that the observer's trajectory is
explicitly introduced and quantized together with the fields. In this paper the
harmonic oscillator and free fields are treated within QJT, correcting previous
flaws. The standard Hilbert space is recovered for the harmonic oscillator, but
there are interesting modifications already for the free scalar field, due to
quantization of the observer's trajectory. Only free fields are treated in

integrating of the motion equations. It consists of two steps. First, an
analytic form of polynomials in some formal parameter $\lambda$ (we put
$\lambda=1$ after all) is derived, which approximate the solution of the system
of differential equations under consideration. Next, the numerical values of
the derived polynomials in the interval, in which the difference between them
and their truncated part of smaller degree does not exceed a given accuracy
$\epsilon$, become the numerical solution. The particular examples, which we
have considered, represent the forced linear and nonlinear oscillator and the
2D Lennard-Jones fluid. In the latter case we have restricted to the
polynomials of the first degree in formal parameter $\lambda$.
  The computer simulations play very important role in modeling materials with
unusual properties being contradictictory to our intuition. The particular
example could be the auxetic materials. In this case, the accuracy of the
applied numerical algorithms as well as various side-effects, which might
change the physical reality, could become important for the properties of the

of energy. Consequently, the suppression factor of such high-$p_T$ hadron pairs
is found to be more sensitive to the initial gluon density than the single
hadron spectra that are dominated by surface emission. A simultaneous
$\chi^2$-fit to both the single and dihadron spectra can be achieved within a
narrow range of the energy loss parameters $\epsilon_0=1.6-2.1$ GeV/fm. Because
of the flattening of the initial jet production spectra, high $p_T$ dihadrons
at the LHC energy are found to be more robust as probes of the dense medium.

correlation coefficient being r2=0.88 with P(t) < 0.001 for 18 degrees of

mean residence time of 137Cs in potatoes was estimated by fitting the measured
activity concentrations to the exponential curve. The mean residence time was
found to be 6.8 +/- 1.1 years, the standard deviation being estimated by the
Monte Carlo simulations. The initial observed 134Cs:137Cs activity ratio in
potatoes has been found to be quite variable, but slightly lesser than
theoretically predicted value of 0.5, calculated by applying the known
inventory of these radionuclides in the Chernobyl reactor to the equation for
the differential radioactive decay. This can be explained by presence of the
pre-Chernobyl 137Cs in soil that originated from nuclear fallout. The annual
effective doses received by 134Cs and 137Cs intake due to consumption of
potatoes estimated for an adult member of Croatian population were found to be
very small, as the per caput dose for the entire 1986 - 2005 period was

formalism provides a natural framework to investigate the relationships between
thermodynamical and kinetic aspects of the folding. For example, it is possible
to show that, in order to have a large probability to remain unchanged under
Langevin diffusion, the native state has to be characterized by a small
conformational entropy. We discuss how to determine the most probable folding
pathway, to identify configurations representative of the transition state and
to compute the most probable transition time. We perform an illustrative
application of these ideas, studying the conformational evolution of alanine
di-peptide, within an all-atom model based on the empiric GROMOS96 force field.

only evaluates to zero if the bases are mutually unbiased. As a result we find
strong evidence that (as has been conjectured elsewhere) there are no more than
three mutually unbiased bases in dimension six.

  Proceedings of the Boston Colloquium for Philosophy of Science on
  ``Foundations of Quantum Information and Entanglement'', Boston, March
  23--24, 2006",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Entanglement plays a pervasive role nowadays throughout quantum information
science, and at the same time provides a bridging notion between quantum
information science and fields as diverse as condensed-matter theory, quantum
gravity, and quantum foundations. In recent years, a notion of ''Generalized
Entanglement'' (GE) has emerged, based on the idea that entanglement may be
directly defined through expectation values of preferred observables -- without
reference to a preferred subsystem decomposition. Preferred observables capture
the physically relevant point of view, as defined by dynamical, operational, or
fundamental constraints. While reducing to the standard entanglement notion
when preferred observables are restricted to arbitrary local observables acting
on individual subsystems, GE substantially expands subsystem-based entanglement
theories, in terms of both conceptual foundations and range of applicability.
Remarkably, the GE framework allows for non-trivial entanglement to exist
within a single, indecomposable quantum system, demands in general a
distinction between quantum separability and absence of entanglement, and
naturally extends to situations where existing approaches may not be directly
useful -- such as entanglement in arbitrary convex-cones settings and
entanglement for indistinguishable quantum particles. In this paper, we revisit
the main motivations leading to GE, and summarize the accomplishments and
prospects of the GE program to date, with an eye toward conceptual developments
and implications. In particular, we explain how the GE approach both shares
strong points of contact with abstract operational quantum theories and,
ultimately, calls for an observer-dependent redefinition of concepts like
locality, completeness, and reality in quantum theory.

Theor. 40 (2007) 8081-8108","10.1088/1751-8113/40/28/S16",,"quant-ph",,"  We investigate the entanglement within a system undergoing a random, local
process. We find that there is initially a phase of very fast generation and
spread of entanglement. At the end of this phase the entanglement is typically
maximal. In previous work we proved that the maximal entanglement is reached to
a fixed arbitrary accuracy within $O(N^3)$ steps, where $N$ is the total number
of qubits. Here we provide a detailed and more pedagogical proof. We
demonstrate that one can use the so-called stabilizer gates to simulate this
process efficiently on a classical computer. Furthermore, we discuss three ways
of identifying the transition from the phase of rapid spread of entanglement to
the stationary phase: (i) the time when saturation of the maximal entanglement
is achieved, (ii) the cut-off moment, when the entanglement probability
distribution is practically stationary, and (iii) the moment block entanglement
scales exhibits volume scaling. We furthermore investigate the mixed state and
multipartite setting. Numerically we find that classical and quantum
correlations appear to behave similarly and that there is a well-behaved
phase-space flow of entanglement properties towards an equilibrium, We describe
how the emergence of typical entanglement can be used to create a much simpler
tripartite entanglement description. The results form a bridge between certain
abstract results concerning typical (also known as generic) entanglement
relative to an unbiased distribution on pure states and the more physical
picture of distributions emerging from random local interactions.

a variety of arguments on the phenomenological properties of thermal states
[Szi25, TQ63, HK65, GB91] and of statistical distributions[HG76, PW78, Len78].
This enables the identification of the canonical distribution as the unique
representation of thermal states without approximation or presupposing the
existence of an entropy function. The Gibbs-von Neumann entropy is then
derived, from arguments based solely on the addition of probabilities to
Hamiltonian dynamics.

that higher electromagnetic modes can be converted into atomic coherences, and
that modes with phase singularities are robust to decoherence effects such as
diffusion. This opens the possibility to more elaborate schemes for two
