hydrocarbons (PAHs) in disks around Herbig Ae/Be and T Tauri stars are
investigated. The equilibrium distribution of the PAHs over all accessible
charge/hydrogenation states depends on the size and shape of the PAHs and on
the physical properties of the star and surrounding disk.
  Methods. A chemistry model is created to calculate this equilibrium
distribution. Destruction of PAHs by ultraviolet (UV) photons, possibly in
multi-photon absorption events, is taken into account. The chemistry model is
coupled to a radiative transfer code to provide the physical parameters and to
combine the PAH emission with the spectral energy distribution (SED) from the
star+disk system.
  Results. Normally hydrogenated PAHs in Herbig Ae/Be disks account for most of
the observed PAH emission, with neutral and positively ionized species
contributing in roughly equal amounts. Close to the midplane, the PAHs are more
strongly hydrogenated and negatively ionized, but these species do not
contribute to the overall emission because of the low UV/optical flux deep
inside the disk. PAHs of 50 carbon atoms are destroyed out to 100 AU in the
disk's surface layer, and the resulting spatial extent of the emission does not
agree well with observations. Rather, PAHs of about 100 carbon atoms or more
are predicted to cause most of the observed emission. The emission is extended
on a scale similar to that of the size of the disk. Furthermore, the emission
from T Tauri disks is much weaker and concentrated more towards the central
star than that from Herbig Ae/Be disks. Positively ionized PAHs are predicted
to be largely absent in T Tauri disks because of the weaker radiation field.

reduction of the number of detectable transits, and the estimation of the

could give overoptimistic results. We have developed a code which allows to
estimate the extent by which such a survey is affected by the crowding of the

Numerical problems for treating extremely energetic binaries orbiting a single
massive object are circumvented by employing the special ``wheel-spoke''
regularization method of Zare (1974) which has not been used in large-N
simulations before. Idealized models containing N = 10^5 particles of mass 1
M_sun with a central black hole of 300 M_sun have been studied on GRAPE-type
computers. An initial half-mass radius of r_h = 0.1 pc is sufficiently small to
yield examples of relativistic coalescence. This is achieved by significant
binary shrinkage within a density cusp environment, followed by the generation
of extremely high eccentricities which are induced by Kozai (1962) cycles
and/or resonant relaxation. More realistic models with white dwarfs and ten
times larger half-mass radii also show evidence of GR effects before
disruption. Experimentation with the post-Newtonian terms suggests that
reducing the time-scales for activating the different orders progressively may
be justified for obtaining qualitatively correct solutions without aiming for
precise predictions of the final gravitational radiation wave form. The results
obtained suggest that the standard loss-cone arguments underestimate the
swallowing rate in globular clusters containing a central black hole.

slope of the low-mass stellar global mass function (GMF) of globular clusters

logarithmic ratio of tidal and core radii. This result is based on the analysis
of a sample of twenty Galactic GCs with solid GMF measurements from deep HST or
VLT data. All the high-concentration clusters in the sample have a steep GMF,
most likely reflecting their initial mass function. Conversely,
low-concentration clusters tend to have a flatter GMF implying that they have
lost many stars via evaporation or tidal stripping. No GCs are found with a
flat GMF and high central concentration. This finding appears
counter-intuitive, since the same two-body relaxation mechanism that causes
stars to evaporate and the cluster to eventually dissolve should also lead to
higher central density and possibly core-collapse. Therefore, more concentrated
clusters should have lost proportionately more stars and have a shallower GMF
than low concentration clusters, contrary to what is observed. It is possible
that severely depleted GCs have also undergone core collapse and have already
recovered a normal radial density profile. It is, however, more likely that GCs
with a flat GMF have a much denser and smaller core than suggested by their
surface brightness profile and may well be undergoing collapse at present. In
either case, we may have so far seriously underestimated the number of post
core-collapse clusters and many may be lurking in the Milky Way.

lobe of the SiO outflow from the nearby source 135-356. It is likely that
redshifted lobes are deflected within the photon dominated region behind the

the southwest from Orion-S as being driven by the redshifted CO outflow arising
from 137-408. The distant object HH 400 is seen to have two even further

improved tangential velocities of low ionization features arising where the

are studied in the QE-limit (Quasi-Elastic; infinitesimal dissipation) by a
combination of analytical and numerical techniques. Their behavior at large
velocities differs qualitatively from that for higher dimensional systems. In
our generic model, a dissipative fluid is maintained in a non-equilibrium
steady state by a stochastic or deterministic driving force. The velocity
distribution for stochastic driving is regular and for infinitesimal
dissipation, has a stretched exponential tail, with an unusual stretching
exponent $b_{QE} = 2b$, twice as large as the standard one for the
corresponding $d$-dimensional system at finite dissipation. For deterministic
driving the behavior is more subtle and displays singularities, such as
multi-peaked velocity distribution functions. We classify the corresponding
velocity distributions according to the nature and scaling behavior of such
singularities.

slower than expected from the upper spectral cutoff of the bath. For a known

the creation of a stable ``spin-locked'' decoherence-free subspace. Analytical

either by doping with ferromagnetic atoms, or by electrostatically printing
artificial atoms or quantum dots. Here we report experimental evidence of a
third, and intrinsic, source of localized spins in high-mobility GaAs/AlGaAs
heterostructures, which are clearly observed in the limit of large setback
distance (=80 nm) in modulation doping. Local nonequilibrium transport

linguistic community), and their role in language evolution. Social networks
also show small-world and scale-free features, which cannot be captured by
random or regular network models. In the past, computational models of language
change and language emergence often assume a population to have a random or
regular structure, and there has been little discussion how network structures
may affect the dynamics. In the second part of the paper, a series of
simulation models of diffusion of linguistic innovation are used to illustrate
the importance of choosing realistic conditions of population structure for
modeling language change. Four types of social networks are compared, which
exhibit two categories of diffusion dynamics. While the questions about which
type of networks are more appropriate for modeling still remains, we give some
preliminary suggestions for choosing the type of social networks for modeling.

factors for 442,750 articles in 576 (biomedical) journals across 11 years, and

statistically significant increment to the citation counts. The
OA-self-archiving advantage remains a robust, independent factor. Having
successfully responded to his challenge, we now challenge Eysenbach to
demonstrate -- by testing a sufficiently broad and representative sample of

game and suggests dominance of cooperative strategies.
  Competitive analysis is suggested as a tool for investigating sub-optimal

General Relativity. The kinetic part of the theory - that describes how matter
is affected by the modified geometry due to the gravitational field - is the
same as in General Relativity. However, we do not consider the metric as an
independent field. Instead, it is an effective one, constructed in terms of two
fundamental spinor fields $\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$ and thus the metric does not
have a dynamics of its own, but inherits its evolution through its relation
with the fundamental spinors. In the first paper it was shown that the metric
that describes the gravitational field generated by a compact static and
spherically symmetric configuration is very similar to the Schwarzschild
metric. In the present paper we describe the cosmological framework in the

to the termalization and diffusion of neutrons in the moderator and reflector

conclusion raises the important problem of the interaction of EAS with the
ground, the stuff of the detectors and their environment since they have often
hydrogen containing materials like polyethilene in neutron monitors. Such
interaction can give an additional contribution to the signal in the EAS

strength and the difference in the Yukawa structure lies in some complex phase.
In both scenarios, all Yukawa couplings are of the same order of magnitude.
Thus, the main features of the fermion hierarchies are explained through the RS
geometrical mechanism, and not because some Yukawa coupling is extremely small.
We find that the RS model is particularly appropriate to incorporate the
suggested Yukawa configurations. Indeed, the RS geometrical mechanism of
fermion locations along the extra dimension, combined with the two Yukawa
scenarios, reproduces all the present experimental data on fermion masses and
mixing angles. It is quite remarkable that in the USY case, only two complex
phases of definite value +-Pi/2 are sufficient to generate the known neutrino
mass differences, while at same time, permitting large leptonic mixing in
agreement with experiment.

transformation of Dyson's hierarchical model (HM). This model can be seen as an
approximation of a scalar field theory on a lattice. We introduce the HM and
show that its large group of symmetry simplifies drastically the blockspinning
procedure. Several equivalent forms of the recursion formula are presented with
unified notations. Rigorous and numerical results concerning the recursion
formula are summarized. It is pointed out that the recursion formula of the HM
is inequivalent to both Wilson's approximate recursion formula and Polchinski's
equation in the local potential approximation (despite the very small
difference with the exponents of the latter). We draw a comparison between the
RG of the HM and other RG equations in the local potential approximation. The
construction of the linear and nonlinear scaling variables is discussed in an
operational way. We describe the calculation of non-universal critical
amplitudes in terms of the scaling variables of two fixed points. This question
appears as a problem of interpolation between these fixed points. Universal
amplitude ratios are calculated. We discuss the large-N limit and the complex
singularities of the critical potential calculable in this limit. The
interpolation between the HM and more conventional lattice models is presented
as a symmetry breaking problem. We briefly introduce models with an approximate
supersymmetry. One important goal of this review article is to present a
configuration space counterpart, suitable for lattice formulations, of other RG
equations formulated in momentum space (sometimes abbreviated as ERGE).

analyzed from theoretical group point of view. To this end an alternative
technique of quantization outlined by the authors in a previous work and that
is based in the correct interpretation of the square root Hamiltonian, is used.
The obtained spectrum of physical states and the Fock construction consist of
Squeezed States which correspond to the representations with the lowest weights
s=1/4 and s=3/4 with four possible (non-trivial) fractional representations for
the group decomposition of the spin structure. From the theory of semi-groups
the analytical representation of the radical operator in the superspace is
constructed, the conserved currents are computed and a new relativistic wave
equation is proposed and explicitly solved for the time dependent case. The
relation with the Relativistic Schr\""odinger equation and the Time-dependent
Harmonic Oscillator is analyzed and discussed.

  The construction is based on a local functional equation, which overcomes the
problems due to the presence (already at one loop) of non chiral symmetric
divergences. The subtraction procedure of the divergences in the loop expansion
is performed by means of minimal subtraction of properly normalized amplitudes
in dimensional regularization.
  In this paper we complete the study of this subtraction procedure by giving

apparent horizon on the brane and by using the bulk geometry. When the
intrinsic curvature appears, the entropy of apparent horizon on the brane has
two parts, one part follows the $n$-dimensional area formula on the brane, and
the other part is the same as the entropy in the case without the intrinsic

expression in the bulk and on the brane are not the same. This is reasonable,

they study the global regularity issue for the critical ($\alpha = 1/2$) QG
equation \cite{CV}. Their approach successively increases the regularity levels
of Leray-Hopf weak solutions: from $L^2$ to $L^\infty$, from $L^\infty$ to
H\""{o}lder ($C^{\delta}$, $\delta>0$), and from H\""{o}lder to classical
solutions. In the supercritical case, Leray-Hopf weak solutions can still be
shown to be $L^\infty$, but it does not appear that their approach can be
easily extended to establish the H\""{o}lder continuity of $L^\infty$ solutions.
In order for their approach to work, we require the velocity to be in the
H\""{o}lder space $C^{1-2\alpha}$. Higher regularity starting from $C^\delta$
with $\delta>1-2\alpha$ can be established through Besov space techniques and
will be presented elsewhere \cite{CW6}.

supposed to be either Gaussian or to have a symmetric bounded distribution, and
we observe $n$ i.i.d copies of it. The confidence regions are built using a
data-dependent threshold based on a weighted bootstrap procedure. We consider
two approaches, the first based on a concentration approach and the second on a
direct boostrapped quantile approach. The first one allows to deal with a very
large class of resampling weights while our results for the second are
restricted to Rademacher weights. However, the second method seems more
accurate in practice. Our results are motivated by multiple testing problems,

the subplanckian quantum level in such a way that a discrete structural quantum
time constitutes the time part of the space-time internal vacuum of every
elementary particle. It has thus been shown that a quantum time, quantized
algebraically according to a lattice of time quanta, really exists and is
emergent in the sense that time quanta can be transformed into space quanta and
vice-versa. Furthermore,this quantum time, only relevant at the subplanckian
scale, is proved to be in one-to-one correspondence with the absolute and
relative clock times.

the possible removal or relaxation of the approximations used in the

is composed of cyclic sub-circuits. A big loop has been defined to be
consisting of a feed forward path from the sensory neurons to the highest
processing area of the brain and feed back paths from that region back up to
close to the same sensory neurons. It has been mathematically shown how some
smaller cycles can amplify signal. A big loop processes information by contrast
and amplify principle. It has been assumed that the spike train coming out of a
firing neuron encodes all the information produced by it as output. This
information over a period of time can be extracted by a Fourier transform. The
Fourier coefficients arranged in a vector form will uniquely represent the
neural spike train over a period of time. The information emanating out of all
the neurons in a given neural circuit over a period of time will be represented
by a collection of points in a multidimensional vector space. This cluster of
points represents the functional or behavioral form of the neural circuit. It
has been proposed that a particular cluster of vectors as the representation of

stored in that circuit and the synaptic plasticity of the circuit. It has been
proposed that in this situation a Coulomb force like expression governs the

at the minimum of all the minima of a potential function derived from the force
like expression. The calculations have been done with respect to a pseudometric

Deviation from directional uniformity leads to the enhancement of the search
efficiency compared to uniform loss with the same average. In certain cases
even increasing loss in some of the directions can improve search efficiency.
We show that while we approach the classical limit of the general search
algorithm by introducing random phase fluctuations, its utility for searching
is lost. Using numerical methods, we found that for static phase errors the
averaged search efficiency displays a damped oscillatory behaviour that
asymptotically tends to a non-zero value.

force by starting from the Lorentz force and evaluating its average as a
function of time. For strong atom-field coupling, we find that the force may
undergo damped Rabi oscillations. The damping is due to the decay of both the
atomic excitation and the field excitation, and both amplitude and mean value
of the oscillations depend on the chosen initial state.

protocols implementing secure two-party computations in the light of Mayers'

contrast to the commonly adobted quantum pure two-party model in the literature
where classical communication is normally ignored, we propose an alternative
interpretation for the purification of classical communication in two-party
protocols by introducing a quantum third party for the classical channel. This
interpretation leads to a global three-party model, involving Alice's and Bob's
machines and the environment coupled to the macroscopic channel, using the
decoherence scheme in quantum measurements. This model could give a more
general view on the concealing/binding trade-off of quantum bit commitment
protocols.
  Inspired from this three-party interpretation, we extend the no-go theorems
for denying some classes of two-party protocols having access to some
particular quantum trusted third-parties, known as quantum two-party oracles.
The extension implies that a quantum protocol for implementing secure two-party
computations musts have access to a trusted third-party which erases
information and thus makes dissipation of heat to the environment.
