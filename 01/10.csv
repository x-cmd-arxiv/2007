of 76 (z < 0.3) ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) from the 1-Jy sample.
The Bgc parameter is used to quantify the richness of the environment within
0.5 Mpc of each ULIRG. We find that the environment of local ULIRGs is similar
to that of the field with the possible exceptions of a few objects with
environmental densities typical of clusters with Abell richness classes 0 and
1. No obvious trends are seen with redshift, optical spectral type, infrared
luminosity, or infrared color. We compare these results with those of local
AGNs and QSOs at various redshifts. The 1-Jy ULIRGs show a broader range of
environments than local Seyferts, which are exclusively found in the field. The
distribution of ULIRG Bgc-values overlaps considerably with that of local QSOs,
consistent with the scenario where some QSOs go through a ultraluminous
infrared phase. However, a rigorous statistical analysis of the data indicates
that these two samples are not drawn from the same parent population. The Bgc
distribution of QSOs shows a distinct tail at high Bgc-values which is not
apparent among the ULIRGs. This difference is consistent with the fact that
some of the QSOs used for this comparison have bigger and more luminous hosts
than the 1-Jy ULIRGs.

have the pulsed double-peaked profile observed at the optical frequencies,
while the second component, C_X, isdominant in the interpeak and second peak

to accelerated expansion to account for the dimming of \s fluxes beyond $z
\simeq 0.5$. The ``replenishing'' grey dust model, although fitting the
observational data, does not seem to be based on physical assumptions. For this
reason, in this paper we propose a new grey dust model whose dust distribution
follows the comoving SFR density evolution, a reasonably established
phenomenon. This new model is compared with the updated photometric data sample
from the High Z Supernova Search Team (HZT). Also, using pairs of supernovae at
different redshifts, the possibility of any ``patchy'' distribution proposed to
explain the discrepancies between the ``high $z$'' dust model and the \s
observations at very high redshift ($z \ge 0.9$) is ruled out. Finally, the
data are compared with different models with and without dark energy and a best
fit to a universe with adimensional parameters $\Omega_{\mathrm{m0}} = 0.31$
and $\Omega_{\mathrm{\Lambda 0}} = 0.69$ is obtained, from which an age of the
universe of $t_{0} \simeq 14.6 \times 10^{9}$ years is derived. This age is
compatible with the age of the globular clusters using an equation of state
$\omega = -1$ and it obviates the need to resort to any kind of phantom energy.

electric current loss in the energy output of radio pulsars. We remind that
even the losses attributed to the magneto-dipole radiation of a pulsar in
vacuum can be written as a result of Ampere force action of the electric
currents flowing over the neutron star surface (Michel 1991, Beskin, Gurevich &
Istomin 1993). It is this force that is responsible for the transfer of angular
momentum of a neutron star to an outgoing magneto-dipole wave. If a pulsar is
surrounded by plasma, and there is no longitudinal current in its
magnetosphere, there is no energy loss (Beskin, Gurevich & Istomin 1993,
Mestel, Panagi & Shibata 1999). It is the longitudinal current closing within
the pulsar polar cap that exerts the retardation torque acting on the neutron
star. This torque can be determined if the structure of longitudinal current is
known. Here we remind of the solution by Beskin, Gurevich & Istomin (1993) and
discuss the validity of such an assumption. Finally, it is shown that the
behaviour of the recently observed ""part-time job"" pulsar B1931+24 can be
naturally explained within the model of current loss while the magneto-dipole

circumstellar envelopes of five AGB stars. We have detected HI 21-cm emission
coincident in both position and velocity with the semi-regular variable RS Cnc.
The emission comprises a compact, slightly elongated feature centered on the
star with a mean diameter ~82'' (1.5e17 cm), plus an additional filament
extending ~6' to the NW. This filament suggests that a portion of the mass loss
is highly asymmetric. We estimate MHI=1.5e-3 Msun and M_dot~1.7e-7 Msun/yr.
Toward R Cas, we detect weak emission that peaks at the stellar systemic
velocity and overlaps with the location of its circumstellar dust shell and
thus is probably related to the star. In the case of IRC+10216, we were unable
to confirm the detection of HI in absorption against the cosmic background
previously reported by Le Bertre & Gerard. However, we detect arcs of emission
at projected distances of r~14'-18' (~2e18 cm) to the NW. A large separation of
the emission from the star is plausible given its advanced evolutionary status,
although it is unclear if the asymmetric distribution and complex velocity
structure are consistent with a circumstellar origin. For EP Aqr, we detected
HI emission comprising multiple clumps redward of the systemic velocity, but we
are unable to determine unambiguously whether the emission arises from the
circumstellar envelope or from interstellar clouds along the line-of-sight.
Regardless of the adopted distance for the clumps, their inferred HI masses are
at least an order of magnitude smaller than their individual binding masses. We
detected our fifth target, R Aqr (a symbiotic binary), in the 1.4 GHz
continuum, but did not detect any HI emission from the system.

from several Earth to several Jupiter masses. While mass accretion onto
protoplanetary cores in weak-line T-Tauri disks may eventually be quenched by a
global depletion of gas, such a mechanism is unlikely to have stalled the
growth of some known planetary systems which contain relatively low-mass and
close-in planets along with more massive and longer period companions. Here, we
suggest a potential solution for this conundrum. In general, supersonic infall
of surrounding gas onto a protoplanet is only possible interior to both of its
Bondi and Roche radii. At a critical mass, a protoplanet's Bondi and Roche
radii are equal to the disk thickness. Above this mass, the protoplanets' tidal
perturbation induces the formation of a gap. Although the disk gas may continue
to diffuse into the gap, the azimuthal flux across the protoplanets' Roche lobe
is quenched. Using two different schemes, we present the results of numerical
simulations and analysis to show that the accretion rate increases rapidly with
the ratio of the protoplanet's Roche to Bondi radii or equivalently to the disk
thickness. In regions with low geometric aspect ratios, gas accretion is
quenched with relatively low protoplanetary masses. This effect is important
for determining the gas-giant planets' mass function, the distribution of their
masses within multiple planet systems around solar type stars, and for
suppressing the emergence of gas-giants around low mass stars.

Lense-Thirring precession caused by the rotating compact object can
dramatically affect the disk. In this presentation we describe results from a
three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of an MRI
turbulent disk accreting onto a tilted rapidly rotating black hole. For this
case, the disk does not achieve the commonly described Bardeen-Petterson
configuration; rather, it remains nearly planar, undergoing a slow global
precession. Accretion from the disk onto the hole occurs predominantly through
two opposing plunging streams that start from high latitudes with respect to

non-sphericity of the gravitational spacetime of the black hole.

clustering. Overall, L* galaxies at z~ 1.5 show a correlation length r_0=3.6\pm

the same range from the value b~1 measured locally, to b=1.5 +/- 0.1. The
interplay of galaxy and structure evolution in producing this observation is
discussed in some detail. Galaxy clustering is found to depend on galaxy
luminosity also at z~ 1, but luminous galaxies at this redshift show a
significantly steeper small-scale correlation function than their z=0

out to similar redshifts, with a nearly constant relative bias among the two

absorption. We find that the absorption predicted by the models is weakly
affected by both the magnitude and orientation of the assumed ISM magnetic

degree to which heliospheric asymmetries induced by the ISM field should be
apparent in Lyman-alpha absorption. An ISM field that is skewed with respect to
the ISM flow vector results in substantial azimuthal asymmetries in both the
hydrogen wall and heliosheath, but only the heliosheath asymmetries yield
potentially detectable asymmetries in Lyman-alpha absorption; and then only in
downwind directions, where comparison with the data is complicated by few

based jointly on the large-scale velocity field of interstellar gas fitted to
HI and CO observations of this galaxy and on mean-field dynamo theory. The aim
of the paper is to present a detailed quantitative comparison of a galactic
dynamo model with independent radio observations. We consider several gas
dynamical and nonlinear dynamo models that include plausible variations of
parameters that are poorly known. Models of cosmic ray distribution in the
galaxy are introduced to produce synthetic radio polarization maps allowing
direct comparison with those observed at 3.5cm and 6.2cm. We show that the
dynamo model is robust in that the most important magnetic features are
controlled by the relatively well established properties of the density
distribution and gas velocity field. The optimal agreement between the
synthetic polarization maps and observations is obtained when a uniform cosmic
ray distribution is adopted. We find some indirect evidence for enhanced
turbulence in the regions of strong velocity shear and within 1-2kpc of the
galactic centre. We confirm that magnetic stresses can drive an inflow of gas
into the inner 1kpc of the galaxy at a rate of a few solar masses per year. The
dynamo models are successful to some extent in modelling the large scale
regular magnetic field in this galaxy. Our results demonstrate that dynamo
models and synthetic polarization maps can provide information about both the
gas dynamical models and conditions in the interstellar medium. We demonstrate
that the dynamical effects of magnetic fields cannot be everywhere ignored in
galaxy modelling.

our attention since, at a putative distance of 45.3 Mpc, it would be a peculiar
object having a very low surface brightness typical of a dwarf galaxy, and at
the same time having the size of an early-type spiral or S0 galaxy. To confirm
or reject this peculiarity, our immediate objective was to have the first
reliable measurement of its recession velocity. The observations were carried

low redshift of v_sun=647+/-96 km/sec and thus is a nearby dwarf galaxy rather
than a member of the distant Centaurus cluster as believed for the past 23

scenario. As a byproduct of our study we update the redshift for NGC 5011B at

arising from an inner envelope (i.e., the inner part of a previously seen

rotation in CO, HCO$^+$, and probably SO. Like H$_2$ emission, CO and SiO
emission are seen along the jet axis but extending closer to the source,
tracing the bow shocks with a broad range of velocities and the continuous
structures in between. SO emission is seen only around the source, forming a
jetlike structure extending along the jet axis from the source, likely tracing
the jet near the launching region. The jet is episodic and bending. It may also
be slightly precessing as the jetlike SO structure shows a slight S-shaped
symmetry about the source. A hint of jet rotation is also seen across the jet
axis. Internal outflow shells are seen in CO and HCO$^+$, associated with the
bow shocks in the inner part of the jet. The bases of the HCO$^+$ shells are
seen with a hint of rotation similar to that seen in the inner envelope,
probably consisted mainly of the material extended from the inner envelope and
even the possible disk.

accreting mass (violently or not) and such mechanism affects their dynamical

(Methods) We have performed cosmological N-body simulations from which we have
carried a detailed study of the evolution of ~35 dark halos in the interval

evolutionary phases. First, an early and fast decrease of Q associated to
virialization after the gravitational collapse takes place. The nice agreement
between simulated data and theoretical expectations based on the spherical
collapse model support such a conjecture. The late and long period where a slow
decrease of the phase-space density occurs is related to accretion and merger
episodes. The study of some merger events in the phase-space (radial velocity
versus radial distance) reveals the formation of structures quite similar to
caustics generated in secondary infall models of halo formation. After mixing
in phase-space, halos in quasi-equilibrium have flat-topped velocity
distributions (negative kurtosis) with respect to Gaussians. The effect is more
noticiable for captured satellites and/or substructures than for the host halo.

We find that possible residual DSC should leave a non-negligible impact on low
multipole alignments for effective values of the fractional far sidelobe
integrated response, $p$, larger than $\sim {\rm few} \times 10^{-3}$. The
effect is strongly dependent on the intrinsic sky amplitude and weakly
dependent on the considered scanning strategy. We find a decrease of the
alignment probability between the quadrupole and the dipole and an increase of
the alignment probability between the hexadecapole and the dipole (larger is
the intrinsic sky amplitude and lower is the contamination). The remaining
estimators do not exhibit clear signatures, except, in some cases, considering
the largest values of $p$ and the lowest sky amplitudes. Provided that the real
sidelobes of the {\it Planck} receivers in flight conditions will correspond to
$p \lsim {\rm few} \times 10^{-3}$, as realistically expected at least in the

frequencies. In this paper we report on multifrequency monitoring by the WEBT
aimed at following the further evolution of the outburst in detail. In
particular, we investigate the expected correlation and time delays between the
optical and radio emissions in order to derive information on the variability
mechanisms and jet structure. A comparison among the light curves at different
frequencies is performed by means of visual inspection and discrete correlation
function, and the results are interpreted with a simple model taking into
account Doppler factor variations of geometric origin. The high-frequency radio
light curves show a huge outburst starting during the dimming phase of the
optical one and lasting more than 1 year. The first phase is characterized by a
slow flux increase, while in early 2006 a major flare is observed. The
lower-frequency radio light curves show a progressively delayed and fainter
event, which disappears below 8 GHz. We suggest that the radio major peak is
not physically connected with the spring 2005 optical one, but it is actually
correlated with a minor optical flare observed in October-November 2005. This
interpretation involves both an intrinsic and a geometric mechanism. The former
is represented by disturbances travelling down the emitting jet, the latter
being due to the curved-jet motion, with the consequent differential changes of
viewing angles of the different emitting regions.

observed through its 21 cm line signal. If dark matter (DM) decays or
annihilates the corresponding energy input affects the hydrogen kinetic
temperature and ionized fraction, and contributes to the Ly_alpha background.
The changes induced by these processes on the 21 cm signal can then be used to
constrain the proposed DM candidates, among which we select the three most
popular ones: (i) 25-keV decaying sterile neutrinos, (ii) 10-MeV decaying light
dark matter (LDM) and (iii) 10-MeV annihilating LDM. Although we find that the
DM effects are considerably smaller than found by previous studies (due to a
more physical description of the energy transfer from DM to the gas), we
conclude that combined observations of the 21 cm background and of its gradient
should be able to put constrains at least on LDM candidates. In fact, LDM
decays (annihilations) induce differential brightness temperature variations
with respect to the non decaying/annihilating DM case up to Delta_delta T_b=8
(22) mK at about 50 (15) MHz. In principle this signal could be detected both
by current single dish radio telescopes and future facilities as LOFAR;
however, this assumes that ionospheric, interference and foreground issues can
be properly taken care of.

atmospheric dispersion for the Sun during the year and examine the problems
produced by this dispersion in both spectrographic and filter observations. We
describe an observing technique for scanning spectrograph observations that
minimizes the effects of the atmospheric dispersion while maintaining a regular

routing optimization preserves the small-world character exhibited by networks
under shortest path routing, and that it significantly reduces the average

I start from measuring \theta_{13} by reactors and accelerators as a
prerequisite for proceeding to search for leptonic CP violation. I then discuss
how CP violation can be uncovered, and how the neutrino mass hierarchy can be
determined. I do these by resolving so called the ``parameter degeneracy''
which is necessary anyway if one wants to seek precision measurement of the
lepton mixing parameters. As a concrete setting for resolving the degeneracy I
introduce the Tokai-to-Kamioka-Korea two detector complex which receives
neutrino superbeam from J-PARC, sometimes dubbed as ``T2KK''. It is shown that
T2KK is able to resolve all the eight-fold parameter degeneracy in a wide range
of the lepton mixing parameters. I also discuss an alternative way for lifting
the \theta_{23} octant degeneracy by reactor-accelerator combined method.
Finally, I discuss by taking some examples how some theoretically or
phenomenologically motivated ideas can be tested experimentally.

are replaced by Weyl fermions in the adjoint representation of the color SU(N).
In the case of two flavors the low-energy chiral Lagrangian is that of the
Skyrme-Faddeev model. The latter supports topologically stable solitons with
mass scaling as N^2. Topological stability is due to the existence of a
nontrivial Hopf invariant in the Skyrme-Faddeev model. Our task is to identify,
at the level of the fundamental theory, adjoint QCD, an underlying reason
responsible for the stability of the corresponding hadrons. We argue that all
""normal"" mesons and baryons, with mass O(N^0), are characterized by (-1)^Q
(-1)^F =1, where Q is a conserved charge corresponding to the unbroken U(1)
surviving in the process of the chiral symmetry breaking (SU(2) \to U(1) for
two adjoint flavors). Moreover, F is the fermion number (defined mod 2 in the
case at hand). We argue that there exist exotic hadrons with mass O(N^2) and
(-1)^Q (-1)^F = -1. They are in one-to-one correspondence with the Hopf
Skyrmions. The transition from nonexotic to exotic hadrons is due to a shift in
F, namely F \to F - {\cal H} where {\cal H} is the Hopf invariant. To detect
this phenomenon we have to extend the Skyrme-Faddeev model by introducing
fermions.

""twisted Poincare'"" covariance of Chaichian et al. [14], Wess [50], Koch et al.
[34], Oeckl [41] upon many-particle quantum mechanics and field quantization on
a Moyal-Weyl noncommutative space(time). This entails the associated braided
tensor product with an involutive braiding (or $\star$-tensor product in the
parlance of Aschieri et al. [3,4]) prescription for any coordinates pair of
$x,y$ generating two different copies of the space(time); the associated
nontrivial commutation relations between them imply that $x-y$ is central and
its Poincar\'e transformation properties remain undeformed. As a consequence,
in QFT (even with space-time noncommutativity) one can reproduce notions (like
space-like separation, time- and normal-ordering, Wightman or Green's
functions, etc), impose constraints (Wightman axioms), and construct free or
interacting theories which essentially coincide with the undeformed ones, since
the only observable quantities involve coordinate differences. In other words,
one may thus well realize QM and QFT's where the effect of space(time)
noncommutativity amounts to a practically unobservable common noncommutative
translation of all reference frames.

proved by Perelman, the proof relies heavily on properties of the Ricci flow
previously investigated in great detail by Hamilton. Physical realization of
such a flow can be found, for instance, in the work by Friedan
(Ann.Phys.163(1985)318-419). In his work the renormalization group flow for a
nonlinear sigma model in 2+e dimensions was obtained and studied. For e=0, by
approximating the beta function for such a flow by the lowest order terms in
the sigma model coupling constant, the equations for Ricci flow are obtained.
In view of such an approximation, the existence of this type of flow in nature
is questionable. In this work, we find totally independent justification for
the existence of Ricci flows in nature. This is achieved by developing a new
formalism extending the results of 2d CFT to 3 and higher dimensions. Equations
describing critical dynamics of these CFT's are examples of the Yamabe and
Ricci flows realizable in nature. Although in the original works by Perelman
some physically motivated arguments can be found, their role in his proof
remain either nonexistent or obscure. In this paper, steps are made toward
making these arguments more explicit thus creating an opportunity for
developing alternative, more physically motivated, proofs of the Poincare' and
geometrization conjectures.

of a central automorphism and of an automorphism which preserves the

definition of $G$, injects into the group of outer automorphisms of $G$, and
that this injection can be chosen such that it induces the usual Galois action
on characters of $G$, apart from a few exceptional characters; further,
replacing if needed $K$ by an extension of degree 2, the injection can be
lifted to $\Aut(G)$, and every irreducible representation admits a model which
is equivariant with respect to this lifting. Along the way we show that the
fundamental invariants of $G$ can be chosen rational.

author in math.DG/0403528. When n>3, they are new twistor spaces, to the best
of the author's knowledge. By investigating the anticanonical system, we show
that our twistor spaces are bimeromorphic to conic bundles over certain
rational surfaces. The latter surfaces can be regarded as orbit spaces of the
C*-action on the twistor spaces. Namely they are minitwistor spaces. We
explicitly determine their defining equations in CP^4. It turns out that the
structure of the minitwistor space is independent of n. Further we concrelely
construct a CP^2-bundle over the resolution of this surface, and provide an
explicit defining equation of the conic bundles. It shows that the number of
irreducible components of the discriminant locus for the conic bundles
increases as n does. Thus our twistor spaces have a lot of similarities with
the famous LeBrun twistor spaces, where the minitwistor space CP^1 x CP^1 in
LeBrun's case is replaced by our minitwistor spaces found in math.DG/0508088.

convolution of some unknown density f and some known or partially known noise
density g. In this paper, we focus on statistical procedures, which are
adaptive with respect to the smoothness parameter tau of unknown density f, and
also (in some cases) to some unknown parameter of the noise density g. In a
first part, we assume that g is known and polynomially smooth. We provide
goodness-of-fit procedures for the test H_0:f=f_0, where the alternative H_1 is
expressed with respect to L_2-norm. Our adaptive (w.r.t tau) procedure behaves
differently according to whether f_0 is polynomially or exponentially smooth. A
payment for adaptation is noted in both cases and for computing this, we
provide a non-uniform Berry-Esseen type theorem for degenerate U-statistics. In
the first case we prove that the payment for adaptation is optimal (thus
unavoidable). In a second part, we study a wider framework: a semiparametric
model, where g is exponentially smooth and stable, and its self-similarity
index s is unknown. In order to ensure identifiability, we restrict our
attention to polynomially smooth, Sobolev-type densities f. In this context, we
provide a consistent estimation procedure for s. This estimator is then
plugged-into three different procedures: estimation of the unknown density f,
of the functional \int f^2 and test of the hypothesis H_0. These procedures are
adaptive with respect to both s and tau and attain the rates which are known
optimal for known values of s and tau. As a by-product, when the noise is known
and exponentially smooth our testing procedure is adaptive for testing
Sobolev-type densities.

this paper. By interpolating the properties of the edges that constitute
network into the two leading parameters of the nodes, this method can abstract
the configuration of real-life transportation networks without losing the
influence of the distance and the capability of the physical facilities, which
are essential parts of the transportation networks. With this method we can
study network transportation from the local point of view and describe network
congestion in detail, especially the dispersing of congestion. After applying
this method, as an example, to the traffic problem in the process of city
expansion, simulation results show that: the intuitions that with the same rate
of particle generation and the same capacity and power, the smaller the network
is the harder for the network to become congested; and the network will never
be congested if the power of each node equals or is bigger than its capacity
are incorrect. And the distance from one crossroad to another and the width of
the roads can be designed properly, when designing a city, so as to enlarge the
tolerance size of the city in the process of city expansion. This method may
provide more appropriate guide for real-life traffic design of network
transportation.

benefits of low power and small size, the readout electronics typically consist
of multi-channel data acquisition modules in a common chassis for power, clock
and trigger distribution, and data readout. As arrays become larger and reach
several hundred channels, the readout electronics have to be divided over
several chassis, but still must maintain precise synchronization of clocks and
trigger signals across all channels. This division becomes necessary not only
because of limits given by the instrumentation standards on module size and
chassis slot numbers, but also because data readout times increase when more
modules share the same data bus and because power requirements approach the
limits of readily available power supplies. In this paper, we present a method
for distributing clocks and triggers between 4 PXI chassis containing DGF
Pixie-16 modules with up to 226 acquisition channels per chassis in a data
acquisition system intended to instrument the over 600 channels of the SeGA

(PN-RQRPA) is applied in the calculation of beta-decay half-lives of

is based on the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov calculation of nuclear
ground-states, using effective Lagrangians with density-dependent meson-nucleon
couplings, and also extended by the inclusion of couplings between the
isoscalar meson fields and the derivatives of the nucleon fields. This leads to
a linear momentum dependence of the scalar and vector nucleon self-energies.
The residual QRPA interaction in the particle-hole channel includes the $\pi +
\rho$ exchange plus a Landau-Migdal term. The finite-range Gogny interaction is
employed in the T=1 pairing channel, and the model also includes a
proton-neutron particle-particle interaction. The results are compared with

  Relativity Formulas in a Variety of Non-Archimedean Setups",,,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Galilean Relativity and Einstein's Special and General Relativity showed that
the Laws of Physics go deeper than their representations in any given reference
frame. Thus covariance, or independence of Laws of Physics with respect to
changes of reference frames became a fundamental principle. So far, all of that
has only been expressed within one single mathematical model, namely, the
traditional one built upon the usual continuum of the field $\mathbb{R}$ of
real numbers, since complex numbers, finite dimensional Euclidean spaces, or
infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, etc., are built upon the real numbers.
Here, following [55], we give one example of how one can go beyond that
situation and study what stays the same and what changes in the Laws of
Physics, when one models them within an infinitely large variety of algebras of
scalars constructed rather naturally. Specifically, it is shown that the
Special Relativistic addition of velocities can naturally be considered in any
of infinitely many reduced power algebras, each of them containing the usual
field of real numbers and which, unlike the latter, are non-Archimedean. The
nonstandard reals are but one case of such reduced power algebras, and are as
well non-Archimedean. Two surprising and strange effects of such a study of the
Special Relativistic addition of velocities are that one can easily go beyond
the velocity of light, and rather dually, one can as easily end up frozen in
immobility, with zero velocity. Both of these situations, together with many
other ones, are as naturally available, as the usual one within real numbers.

momentum resolution can be described as: sigma(p)/p (in %) = (1.61 +- 0.02) +
(0.0051 +- 0.0006) p. At the end of the HERA-B running no aging effects in the
Outer Tracker cells were observed.

paradox, a place where questions on completeness and reality comes into play.
The fundamental result of the last century was maybe Bell's that states that
local realism is false if quantum mechanics is true. From this fact we can
obtain the so called Bell inequalities. After a didactic example of the fact
what these inequalities means we describe the key concept of quantum
entanglement motivated here by quantum information theory. Also classical

Rep. 428, 53 (2006)","10.1016/j.physrep.2006.01.004",,"quant-ph",,"  We present a review of theoretical and experimental aspects of multiphoton
quantum optics. Multiphoton processes occur and are important for many aspects
of matter-radiation interactions that include the efficient ionization of atoms
and molecules, and, more generally, atomic transition mechanisms;
system-environment couplings and dissipative quantum dynamics; laser physics,
optical parametric processes, and interferometry. A single review cannot
account for all aspects of such an enormously vast subject. Here we choose to
concentrate our attention on parametric processes in nonlinear media, with
special emphasis on the engineering of nonclassical states of photons and
atoms. We present a detailed analysis of the methods and techniques for the
production of genuinely quantum multiphoton processes in nonlinear media, and
the corresponding models of multiphoton effective interactions. We review
existing proposals for the classification, engineering, and manipulation of
nonclassical states, including Fock states, macroscopic superposition states,
and multiphoton generalized coherent states. We introduce and discuss the
structure of canonical multiphoton quantum optics and the associated one- and
two-mode canonical multiphoton squeezed states. This framework provides a
consistent multiphoton generalization of two-photon quantum optics and a
consistent Hamiltonian description of multiphoton processes associated to
higher-order nonlinearities. Finally, we discuss very recent advances that by
combining linear and nonlinear optical devices allow to realize multiphoton
entangled states of the electromnagnetic field, that are relevant for
applications to efficient quantum computation, quantum teleportation, and
related problems in quantum communication and information.

  between this submission and the one submitted to the University due to some
  limitations imposed upon submissions's size. These changes, wherever occured,
  are noted by footnotes",,,,"quant-ph",,"  It is accepted that among the ways through which a quantum phenomenon
decoheres and becomes a classical one is what is termed in the literature the
Zeno effect. This effect, named after the ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of
Elea (born about 485 B.C), were used in 1977 to analytically predict that an
initial quantum state may be preserved in time by merely repeating a large
number of times, in a finite total time, the experiment of checking its state.
Since then this effect has been experimentally validated and has become an
established physical fact. It has been argued by Simonius that the Zeno effect
must be related not only to quantum phenomena but also to many macroscopic and
classical effects. Thus, since it operates in both quantum and classical
regimes it must cause to a more generalized kind of decoherence than the
restricted one that ``classicalizes'' a quantum phenomenon. We show that this
generalized decoherence, {\it obtained as a result of dense measurement}, not
only gives rise to new phenomena that are demonstrated through new responses of
the densely interacted-upon system but also may physically {\it establish}
them. For that matter we have found and established the analogous {\it space
Zeno effect} which leads to the necessity of an ensemble of related observers
(systems) for the remarked physical validation of new phenomena. As will be
shown in Chapters 3-5 of this work the new phenomena (new responses of the
system) that result from the space Zeno effect may be of an unexpected nature.
We use quantum field theory in addition to the more conventional methods of
analysis and also corroborate our analytical findings by numerical simulations.

Cirac","Engineering correlation and entanglement dynamics in spin systems","4 pages, 4 figures, REVTeX4 format",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.180406",,"quant-ph cond-mat.other",,"  We show that the correlation and entanglement dynamics of spin systems can be
understood in terms of propagation of spin waves. This gives a simple, physical
explanation of the behaviour seen in a number of recent works, in which a
localised, low-energy excitation is created and allowed to evolve. But it also
extends to the scenario of translationally invariant systems in states far from
equilibrium, which require less local control to prepare. Spin-wave evolution
is completely determined by the system's dispersion relation, and the latter
typically depends on a small number of external, physical parameters.
Therefore, this new insight into correlation dynamics opens up the possibility
not only of predicting but also of controlling the propagation velocity and
dispersion rate, by manipulating these parameters. We demonstrate this
analytically in a simple, example system.
