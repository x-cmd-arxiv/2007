  bi-annual publication of the Department of Physics and Astronomy, University
  of South Carolina",,,"astro-ph gr-qc",,"  This is an essay sketching the line of thinking which has led the present
author to propose the constituent or atomic model of gravitation more than a
decade ago. It turns out that viewing the problem of gravitation as a quantum
many body problem could be quite useful when addressing some old unsolved
problems such as the cosmological constant problem. I have applied this idea in
1996 to the problem of the largest cold gravitating system, the finite Universe
itself. The result was the prediction of a small, positive vacuum energy
density, now known, after its experimental discovery in 1998, as `dark energy'.
The smallness of this quantity was understood as the finite size effect in the
cold quantum many body system, and I quote here from \cite{Ma96}, {\it `` The
smallness of the cosmological constant in natural Planck units is a result of
an almost perfect thermodynamical limit. This is to say that the smallness of
the cosmological constant is an effect due to an enormous number $N$ of
hypothetical \textsf{gravitational} \textsf{atoms}. The present upper bound on
the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ allows us to draw the conclusion about the
lower bound on a number of \textsf{gravitational} \textsf{atoms} in the
observed Universe, $N\sim 10^{122}$. ...''}. The old cosmological constant
problem is a man-made problem because the vacuum energy density has nothing to
do with the quartic divergences (zero point energies) in the interacting
relativistic quantum field theories (i.e. in the Standard Model of elementary
particles). The actual value of the vacuum energy density of the vacuum finite
size de Sitter Universe is $\frac{E_{0}}{V}$, where $E_{0}$ is the ground state
energy of $N$ \textsf{gravitational} \textsf{atoms}, which are spin-zero bosons
of mass $M\sim M_{_{Pl}}$, contained in the finite volume $V$.

clusters we have undertaken a systematic `blind' search for line emission with
NIRSPEC in the J-band within carefully-selected regions which offer very high
magnifications (>10-50x) for background sources with redshifts z~10. The high
magnification enables the detection of emission at unprecedented limits (10^41
- 10^42 erg/s), much fainter than those of conventional narrow band imaging and
other spectroscopic searches. As the comoving volumes probed are small, our
survey is designed to address the important question of whether intrinsically
feeble star forming galaxies could provide the dominant ionizing flux at z~10.
Our survey has yielded six promising (>5 sigma) candidate Lyman-alpha emitters
which lie between z=8.7 and z=10.2. While the predicted reionization photon
budget depends upon a large number of physical assumptions, our first glimpse
at the z~10 Universe suggests that low luminosity star-forming galaxies
contribute a significant proportion of the UV photons necessary for cosmic
reionization. [Abridged]

optical depth less than 10^-4) then an Earth mass planet suffices. We find that

the near- to mid-IR (1.235 - 8 microns). We find that five out of the six
polars have flux densities in the mid-IR that are substantially in excess of
the values expected from the stellar components alone. We have modeled the
observed SEDs with a combination of contributions from the white dwarf,
secondary star, and either cyclotron emission or a cool, circumbinary dust disk
to fill in the long-wavelength excess. We find that a circumbinary dust disk is
the most likely cause of the 8 micron excess in all cases, but we have been
unable to rule out the specific (but unlikely) case of completely optically
thin cyclotron emission as the source of the observed 8 micron flux density.
While both model components can generate enough flux at 8 microns, neither dust
nor cyclotron emission alone can match the excess above the stellar components
at all wavelengths. A model combining both cyclotron and dust contributions,
possibly with some accretion-generated flux in the near-IR, is probably
required, but our observed SEDs are not sufficiently well-sampled to constrain
such a complicated model. If the 8 micron flux density is caused by the
presence of a circumbinary dust disk, then our estimates of the masses of these
disks are many orders of magnitude below the mass required to affect CV
evolution.

precession of a neutron star and the standard picture in which its core is
composed of a mixture of a neutron superfluid and a type-II proton
superconductor. We will show that if there is a persistent, non-dissipating
current running along the magnetic flux tubes, the force between magnetic flux
tubes may be attractive, resulting in a type-I, rather than a type-II,
superconductor. If this is the case, the conflict between the observed
precession and the canonical estimation of the Landau-Ginzburg parameter (which
suggests type II behaviour) will be automatically resolved. Such a current
arises in some condensed matter systems and may also appear in QCD dense matter
as a consequence of quantum anomalies. We calculate the interaction between two
vortices carrying a current j and find a constraint on the magnitude of j where
a superconductor is always type-I, even when the cannonical Landau-Ginzburg
parameter indicates type-II behaviour. If this condition is met, the magnetic
field is expelled from the superconducting regions of the neutron star leading
to the formation of the intermediate state where alternating domains of
superconducting matter and normal matter coexist. We further argue that even
when the induced current is small the vortex Abrikosov lattice will
nevertheless be destroyed due to the helical instability studied previously in
many condensed matter systems. This would also resolve the apparent
contradiction with the precession of the neutron stars. We also discuss some
instances where anomalous induced current may play a crucial role, such as the
neutron star kicks, pulsar glitches and the toroidal magnetic field.

possible signature of the approach to the general relativistic innermost stable
circular orbit (ISCO), but the implications of such an interpretation for
strong gravity and dense matter are important enough that it is essential to
explore alternate explanations. In this spirit, Mendez has recently proposed
that Q depends fundamentally on mass accretion rate (as measured by spectral
hardness) rather than the frequency of the QPO. We test this hypothesis for
4U1636-536 by measuring precisely spectral colors simultaneously with the lower
QPO frequency and Q after correction for the frequency drift, over a data set
spanning eight years of RXTE observations. We find that in this source there is
no correlation between Q and spectral hardness. In particular, no apparent
changes in hardness are observed when Q reaches its maximum before dropping
off. We perform a similar analysis on 4U1608-522; another source showing a
sharp drop in the quality factor of its lower kHz QPO. We find that for this
source, positive and negative correlations are observed between spectral
hardness, frequency and Q. Consequently, if we are to search for a common
explanation for the sharp drop in the quality factor seen in both sources, the
spectral hardness is not a good candidate for the independent variable whereas
the frequency remains. Therefore, we conclude that the ISCO explanation is
viable for 4U1636-536, and thus possibly for others.

quick retreat, in contrast to solar proton events, which usually take hours to
deliver significant fluence and can often be anticipated by flares or other
light-speed precursors. Our results contrast with the view that only particle
radiation poses dangers for human space exploration. Heavy-element shields
provide the most efficient protection from X-ray flares, since X-rays produce

explore the possibility that at least part of this diversity is a consequence
of a single basic model for the central engine operating in a massive star of
variable mass, differential rotation rate, and mass loss rate. Whatever that
central engine may be - and here the collapsar is used as a reference point -
it must be capable of generating both a narrowly collimated, highly
relativistic jet to make the GRB, and a wide angle, sub-relativistic outflow
responsible for exploding the star and making the supernova bright. To some
extent, the two components may vary independently, so it is possible to produce
a variety of jet energies and supernova luminosities. We explore, in
particular, the production of low energy bursts and find a lower limit,
$\sim10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to the power required for a jet to escape a massive
star before that star either explodes or is accreted. Lower energy bursts and
and ``suffocated'' bursts may be particularly prevalent when the metallicity is
high, i.e., in the modern universe at low redshift.

and absorbed by a foreground galactic system at z=0.524, the stars of which can
act as gravitational micro-lenses. In this period the object was in an
optically faint, though variable state, and a broad Mg II emission line was
visible at all epochs. The spectroscopic analysis reveals an overall variation
in the Mg II line flux of a factor 1.9, while the corresponding continuum flux
density changed by a factor 4.3. Most likely, the photoionising radiation can
be identified with the emission component that was earlier recognised to be

optical domain only in very faint optical states. We estimate an upper limit to
the BLR size of a few light months from the historical minimum brightness
level; from this we infer the maximum amplification of the Mg II line predicted
by the microlensing scenario. Unless we have strongly overestimated the size of
the BLR, only very massive stars could significantly magnify the broad Mg II
emission line, but the time scale of variations due to these (rare) events
would be of several years. In contrast, the continuum flux, coming from much
smaller emission regions in the jet, could be affected by microlensing from the
more plausible MACHO deflectors, with variability time scales of some months.

detailed photospheric abundance study on the basis of high-quality UVES spectra
was performed on the RV Tauri star in the LMC: MACHO82.8405.15. Abundances were
derived using a critically compiled line list with accurate log(gf) values and
the latest Kurucz model atmospheres. With [Fe/H]=-2.6 in combination with
[Zn/Fe]=+2.3 and [S/Ti]=+2.5, MACHO82.8405.15 displays a strong depletion
abundance pattern. The effect of the depletion is comparable to the strongest
depletions seen in field Galactic RV Tauri stars. The chemical analysis of
MACHO82.8405.15 proves that the depletion process also occurs in the
extragalactic members of the RV Tauri pulsation class. Our program star is a
member of a larger sample of LMC RV Tauri objects. This sample is unique, since
the distances of the members are well-constrained. Further studies of this

Heat input from cluster mergers, AGN, and galaxy winds offsets and may even
halt the cooling of the ICM. Consequently, the processes that set the
properties of the ICM play a key role in determining how galaxies form. In this
paper we focus on the shock heating of the ICM during cluster mergers, with the
eventual aim of incorporating this mechanism into semi-analytic models of
galaxy formation.
  We use a suite of hydrodynamic simulations to track the evolution of the ICM
in idealised two-body mergers. We find the heating of the ICM can be understood
relatively simply by considering the evolution of the gas entropy during the
mergers. We examine the processes that generate the entropy in order to
understand why previous analytic shock heating models failed. We find that: (1)
The energy that is thermalised in the collision greatly exceeds the kinetic
energy available when the systems first touch. The smaller system penetrates
deep into the potential well before it is disrupted. (2) For unequal mass
mergers, most of the energy is thermalised in the more massive component. The
heating of the smaller system is minor and its gas sinks to the centre of the
final system. (3) The bulk of the entropy generation occurs in two distinct
episodes. The first episode occurs following core collision, when a shock wave
is generated that propagates outwards from the centre. This causes the combined
system to expand rapidly and overshoot hydrostatic equilibrium. The second
episode occurs as this material is shock heated as it re-collapses. This
revised model for entropy generation significantly improves our physical
understanding of cosmological gas simulations.

hard component characterized by T ~ 10^8 K if fit with a thermal plasma model.
The spectrum hardened considerably between 2000.7 and 2004.0, primarily due to
increased flux above 5 keV, suggesting a change in the accretion activity of
the white dwarf on a timescale of a few years or less. Point-source Fe K
emission is detected at the position of the central binary system in both
observations. While the earlier observation shows evidence of only a single
emission peak near Fe K alpha at 6.4 keV, the later observation shows a more
complex emission structure between 6 and 7 keV. Finally, we have discovered a
modulation in the hard X-ray flux with a period of 1734 s at a 95% confidence
level in the 2004 observation only. The modulation potentially arises from
standing shocks in an accretion column and we have explored the possibility
that the white dwarf in R Aqr is analogous to the magnetic white dwarfs in
Intermediate Polar.

compared with a new determination of the corresponding gradient from planetary

blocks. Thus, it seems to be quite logic to expect the same properties from
geometrically identical macroscopic regions of the same macroscopic system. The
above statement is quite general and it is also known to be valid for the
systems of a reduced dimensionality in the direction, along which they are
macroscopic. However, in this work we report on a macroscopic system, which
does not obey the above postulates and demonstrates specific quantum behaviour
on a macroscopic length. It is conventional quantum Hall system possessing an
asymmetric confining potential in presence of a tilted quantizing magnetic
field. In the direction, along which the system is macroscopic, it demonstrates
the following unusual properties: (i) a spatially-dependent response on a
spatially-homogeneous photo-excitation that implies spontaneous breaking of
translational symmetry (ii) high sensitivity of a local photo-response to the
conditions of macroscopically remote local regions (iii) excitation of whole
system through the excitation of its local region without an appropriate energy
transfer within the system. All these properties imply the electron coherent
length to be as high as the macroscopic sample length. We demonstrate that the
effect revealed opens the door for an energy-free quantum communication on

two-dimensional (2D) Coulomb anyon gas and a regularization procedure for
vanishing confinement. To take into account the fractional statistics and
Coulomb interaction we introduce a function, which depends on both the
statistics and density parameters (nu and r_s, respectively). We determine this
function by fitting to the ground state energies of the classical electron
crystal at very large r_s (the 2D Wigner crystal), and to the Hartree-Fock (HF)
energy of the spin-polarized 2D electron gas, and the dense 2D Coulomb Bose gas
at very small r_s. The latter is calculated by use of the Bogoliubov
approximation. Applied to the boson system (nu=0) our results are very close to
recent results from Monte Carlo (MC) calculations. For spin-polarized electron
systems (nu=1) our comparison leads to a critical judgment concerning the
density range, to which the HF approximation and MC simulations apply. In
dependence on nu, our analytic formula yields ground-state energies, which
monotonously increase from the bosonic to the fermionic side if r_s > 1. For
r_s leq 1 it shows a nonmonotonous behavior indicating a breakdown of the

(1998 Phys. Rev. B 58 6506) with a Jc(B) law appropriate for a polycrystalline
material. Specifically, we observe that the applied field can sweep into the
central region either through the thickness of the shield or through the
opening ends, the latter mechanism being suppressed for long tubes. For the
first time, we systematically detail the spatial variation of the shielding
factor (the ratio of the applied field over the internal magnetic field) along
the axis of a high-temperature superconducting tube. The shielding factor is
shown to be constant in a region around the centre of the tube, and to decrease
as an exponential in the vicinity of the ends. This spatial dependence comes
from the competition between two mechanisms of field penetration. The frequency
dependence of the shielding factor is also discussed and shown to follow a
power law arising from the finite creep exponent n.

analyze best-response walks on the configuration space defined by the uniform

suggest that loop-free best-response walks always exist, but may not be
polynomially bounded. We also study a special family of \emph{regular} wirings,
the class of Abelian Cayley graphs, in which all nodes imitate the same wiring

symmetries of QCD in excited hadrons is reviewed. While the low-lying hadron
spectrum is mostly shaped by the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, in
the high-lying hadrons the role of the quark condensate of the vacuum becomes
negligible and the chiral symmetry is effectively restored. This implies that
the mass generation mechanisms in the low- and high-lying hadrons are
essentially different. The fundamental origin of this phenomenon is a
suppression of quark quantum loop effects in high-lying hadrons relative to the
classical contributions that preserve both chiral and $U(1)_A$ symmetries.
Microscopically the chiral symmetry breaking is induced by the dynamical
Lorentz-scalar mass of quarks due to their coupling with the quark condensate
of the vacuum. This mass is strongly momentum-dependent, however, and vanishes
in the high-lying hadrons where the typical momentum of valence quarks is
large. This physics is illustrated within the solvable chirally-symmetric and
confining model. Effective Lagrangians for the approximate chiral multiplets at
the hadron level are constructed which can be used as phenomenological
effective field theories in the effective chiral restoration regime. Different
ramifications and implications of the effective chiral restoration for the
string description of excited hadrons, the decoupling of excited hadrons from
the Goldstone bosons, the glueball - quark-antiquark mixing and the OZI rule
violations are discussed.

sandpile model (ASM) and its variants. We treat a less known - but equally
interesting - model, namely Zhang's sandpile. This model differs in two aspects
from the ASM. First, additions are not discrete, but random amounts with a
uniform distribution on an interval $[a,b]$. Second, if a site topples - which
happens if the amount at that site is larger than a threshold value $E_c$
(which is a model parameter), then it divides its entire content in equal
amounts among its neighbors. Zhang conjectured that in the infinite volume
limit, this model tends to behave like the ASM in the sense that the stationary
measure for the system in large volumes tends to be peaked narrowly around a
finite set. This belief is supported by simulations, but so far not by
analytical investigations.
  We study the stationary distribution of this model in one dimension, for
several values of $a$ and $b$. When there is only one site, exact computations
are possible. Our main result concerns the limit as the number of sites tends
to infinity, in the one-dimensional case. We find that the stationary
distribution, in the case $a \geq E_c/2$, indeed tends to that of the ASM (up
to a scaling factor), in agreement with Zhang's conjecture. For the case $a=0$,
$b=1$ we provide strong evidence that the stationary expectation tends to
$\sqrt{1/2}$.

layers of turbulence in the frame of the same model. Statistical layer is
described by Zakharov-Kolmogorov energy spectra in the case of irrational
enough dispersion function. Discrete layer is covered by some system(s) of
Diophantine equations while their form is determined by wave dispersion
function. This presents a very special computational challenge - to solve
Diophantine equations in many variables, usually 6 to 8, in high degrees, say
16, in integers of order $10^{16}$ and more. Generic algorithms for solving
this problem in the case of
  {\it irrational} dispersion function have been presented in our previous
papers. In this paper we present a new generic algorithm for the case of {\it
rational} dispersion functions. Special importance of this case is due to the
fact that in wave systems with rational dispersion the statistical layer does
not exist and the general energy transport is governed by the discrete layer
alone.

develop the technical machinery on which all of our results rely. In

This allows us to characterize graded group-valued continuously Pansu
differentiable mappings through a system of nonlinear first order PDEs, namely,
the ""contact equations"". Through this approach we establish a quantitative
estimate for the Pansu difference quotient. This key result is crucial to get
the mean value inequality, the inverse mapping theorem, the rank theorem and
the implicit function theorem for graded group-valued continuously Pansu
differentiable mappings. All of these results represent the backbone to develop
a reasonable ""Calculus"" in this context. On the other hand, these theorems rise
the question of possible factorizations of stratified groups into inner

image-sets and level-sets of suitable continuously Pansu differentiable
mappings are intrinsic graphs. These sets represent the intrinsic regular
submanifolds modeled on a couple of fixed groups. Notice that the metric

transformation called \emph{intermutation} made of arrows from $(A\wedge
B)\vee(C\wedge D)$ to ${(A\vee C)\wedge(B\vee D)}$, for $\wedge$ and $\vee$
being two biendofunctors. Intermutation occurs in iterated, or $n$-fold,
monoidal categories, which were introduced in connection with $n$-fold loop
spaces, and for which a related, but different, coherence result was obtained
previously by Balteanu, Fiedorowicz, Schw\"" anzl and Vogt. The results of the
present paper strengthen up to a point this previous result, and show that
two-fold loop spaces arise in the manner envisaged by these authors out of
categories of a more general kind, which are not two-fold monoidal in their
sense. In particular, some categories with finite products and coproducts are
such.
  Coherence is proved here first for categories where for $\wedge$ and $\vee$
one assumes only intermutation, and next for categories where one also assumes
natural associativity isomorphisms. Coherence in the sense of coherence for
symmetric monoidal categories is proved when one assumes moreover natural
commutativity isomorphisms. A restricted coherence result, involving a proviso
of the kind found in coherence for symmetric monoidal closed categories, is
proved in the presence of two nonisomorphic unit objects. The coherence
conditions for intermutation and for the unit objects are derived from a
unifying principle, which roughly speaking is about preservation of categories
with structure by functors up to a natural transformation that is not an
isomorphism.

non-conservative as demonstrated by microelectrode recordings. The model
presented here shows that SOC can arise in non-conservative systems as well, if
driven internally. Evidence suggests that synaptic background activity provides
the internal drive for non-conservative cortical networks to achieve and
maintain a critical state. SOC is robust to any degree $\eta \in (0,1]$ of
background activity when the network size $N$ is large enough such that $\eta

activity, consistent with neurophysiological knowledge about epilepsy.

state. Furthermore, we model the behavior of the agents through the use of an
expression that scores the local attendance states available to the agents. It
incorporates a single parameter that weighs the relative contributions that
originate from the external and internal limiting factors. Solving this

daughter, who is the editor of all texts. I. Z. Shkurchenko created four works
on fluid and gas mechanics. In 2007, the editor posted the texts of all the
works of I.Z. Shkurchenko in this archive. The editor made mistakes. He found
them in the first version of the edition. The editor has corrected and
supplemented the texts in accordance with the originals and asks the reader to
use only the second version (v2) of all texts (2022). As the title implies, the
monograph presents a new look at the mechanical movement of liquids and gases,
explaining the phenomena associated with the movement of matter in continuous
media. The second part of the same name which is the completion of the
monograph is also placed by the editor in this archive. It takes into account
the properties of real liquids and gases and gives examples of the practical
application of the theory. The created theory of fluid and gas mechanics will
eliminate discrepancies with practice and thus allow the theory to be guided in
practice throughout the entire range of practical use of liquids and gases.
This is the answer to the question of what this work gives. This situation will
not only improve any technique dealing with liquids and gases (including
long-suffering windmills), but the theory will also be indispensable for
meteorologists, oceanologists and many other specialists. The author believed
that the theory of elasticity and plasticity of materials would also be revised
from the point of view of the mechanics of inertless mass.

contributions draw their inspiration from the complex appearance of investors'
interactions in real-life markets. Their main aim is to reproduce (and,
thereby, provide possible explanations) for the spectacular bubbles and crashes

analytically the average and standard deviation of the entanglement (as
quantified by the reduced purity) between one mode and all the other modes.

showing that the onset of the concentration of measure already occurs at
relatively small n.

equation to obtain the Pauli equation for one particle is generalized to obtain
an $N$-particle equation with spin. This is achieved by using the more
universal matrix factorization, $G\tilde{G} = |G| I = (-K)^l I$. Here the
square matrix $G$ is linear in the total energy E and all momenta, $\tilde G$
is the matrix adjoint of $G$, $I$ is the identity matrix, $|G|$ is the
determinant of $G$, $l$ is a positive integer and $K=H-E$ is Lanczos' extended
Hamiltonian where $H$ is the classical Hamiltonian of the electro-mechanical
system. $K$ is identically zero for all such systems, so that matrix $G$ is
singular. As a consequence there always exists a vector function
$\underline\theta$ with the property $G\underline\theta=0$. This factorization
to obtain the matrix $G$ and vector function $\underline\theta$ is illustrated
first for a one-dimensional particle in a simple potential well. This same
technique, when applied to the classical nonrelativistic Hamiltonian for $N$
interacting particles in an electromagnetic field, is shown to yield for N=1
the Pauli wave equation with spin and its generalization to $N$ particles.
Finally this nonrelativistic generalization of the Pauli equation is used to
treat the simple Zeeman effect of a hydrogen-like atom as a two-particle
problem with spin.
