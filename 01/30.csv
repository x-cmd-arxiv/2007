long burst of non-thermal gamma-rays, lasting over 2000 s, as a jet erupted
through the surface of the star. While this was in progress, an optically-thick
thermal component from the shock wave of the supernova explosion grew to
prominence, and we were able to track the mildly relativistic expansion of this

which had exploded, but the lack of Hydrogen emission lines in the supernova

shock ploughed into the massive stellar wind of a Wolf-Rayet progenitor, with
the shock breaking out and becoming visible to us once it reached the radius
where the wind became optically-thin. I present the Swift observations of this

intermediate velocity dispersion sigma_v~500 km/s and is characterized by a

the difference in the Galactic column density in these two directions to deduce
the contributions of the unabsorbed foreground emission due to the Local
Bubble, and the absorbed emission from the Galactic halo and the extragalactic
background. We find the Local Bubble emission is consistent with emission from
a plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium with a temperature $\log T_{LB}
= 6.06^{+0.02}_{-0.04}$ and an emission measure of 0.018 cm^{-6} pc. Our
measured temperature is in good agreement with values obtained from ROSAT
All-Sky Survey data, but is lower than that measured by other recent XMM-Newton
observations of the Local Bubble, which find $\log T_{LB} \approx 6.2$
(although for some of these observations it is possible that the foreground
emission is contaminated by non-Local Bubble emission from Loop I). The higher
temperature observed towards other directions is inconsistent with our data,
when combined with a FUSE measurement of the Galactic halo O VI intensity. This
therefore suggests that the Local Bubble is thermally anisotropic.
  Our data are unable to rule out a non-equilibrium model in which the plasma
is underionized. However, an overionized recombining plasma model, while
observationally acceptable for certain densities and temperatures, generally
gives an implausibly young age for the Local Bubble ($\la 6 \times 10^5$ yr).

by the hot nuclear dust emission. We performed spectroscopy in the optical and,
for a subset of the sample, also in the mid-infrared with Spitzer. Results: We
find nine type 2 AGN at redshift 0.1<z<0.5, three of them have even quasar-like

young and old stellar populations. Only one object is an ultraluminous infrared

fields consist of two blank regions of the sky (the HDF-N and J0053+1234), and
the total effective surveyed area is 1290 sqarcmin. Applications of carefully
determined colour selection criteria in V-I and I-z' yield a detection of 853
candidates with z'AB<26.5 mag. The derived UVLF at z~5 shows no significant
change in the number density of bright (L>=L*_z=3) LBGs from that at z~3, while
there is a significant decline in the LF's faint end with increasing lookback
time. This result means that the evolution of the number densities is
differential with UV luminosity: the number density of UV luminous objects
remains almost constant from z~5 to 3 while the number density of fainter
objects gradually increases with cosmic time. This trend becomes apparent
thanks to the small uncertainties in number densities both in the bright and
faint parts of LFs at different epochs that are made possible by the deep and
wide surveys. We discuss the origins of this differential evolution and suggest
that our observational findings are consistent with the biased galaxy evolution
scenario: a galaxy population hosted by massive dark haloes starts active star
formation preferentially at early cosmic time, while less massive galaxies
increase their number density later. We also calculated the UV luminosity
density by integrating the UVLF and at z~5 found it to be 38.8% of that at z~3
for the luminosity range L>0.1 L^*_z=3. By combining our results with those
from the literature, we find that the cosmic UV luminosity density marks its
peak at z=2-3 and then slowly declines toward higher redshift.

  Zones","7 pages, 9 figures",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20077172",,"astro-ph",,"  The questions of how strong magnetic fields can be stored in rotating stellar
radiative zones without being subjected to pinch-type instabilities and how
much radial mixing is produced if the fields are unstable are addressed. Linear
equations are derived for weak disturbances of magnetic and velocity fields
which are global in horizontal dimensions but short--scaled in radius. The
equations are solved to evaluate the stability of toroidal field patterns with
one or two latitudinal belts under the influence of a rigid basic rotation.
Hydrodynamic stability of latitudinal differential rotation is also considered.
The magnetic instability is essentially three--dimensional. It does not exist
in a 2D formulation with strictly horizontal disturbances on decoupled
spherical shells. Only stable (magnetically modified) r-modes are found in this
case. The instability recovers in 3D. The most rapidly growing modes for the
Sun have radial scales smaller than 1 Mm. The finite thermal conductivity makes
a strong destabilizing effect. The marginal field strength for the onset of the
instability in the upper part of the solar radiative zone is about 600 G. The
toroidal field can only slightly exceed this critical value for otherwise the
radial mixing produced by the instability would be too strong to be compatible
with the observed lithium abundance. Also the threshold for hydrodynamic
instability of differential rotation which exists in 2D is lowered in 3D. When
radial displacements are included, the value of 28% for critical shear is
reduced to 21%.

its dynamical properties depend on the energy scale of the process of interest

on the Hydrostatic Equilibrium condition and on the Magnetic Virial Theorem in
the presence of a radial distribution of the magnetic field B(r)=B_* \times
[\rho_g(r)]^alpha, with alpha \sim 0.9, as indicated by observations and
numerical simulation. Our analysis shows that such a description is able to
provide a possible explanation of three problematic aspects of the cluster
structure: i) the flattening of the entropy profile in the cluster center; ii)
the flatness of the S-T relation; iii) the increasing steepening of the L_X-T
relation from the cluster scale towards the group scales. The available entropy
and X-ray luminosity data indicate that an increase of the magnetic field B_*
\sim T^0.5 is required to reproduce at the same time both the S-T and the L_X-T
relations. It follows that a consistent description of the magnetized ICM can
provide a simple explanation of several (or of all) of these still open
problems, and thus weakens the need for the inclusion of other
non-gravitational effects which have been proposed so far for the explanation
of some of these features. This (initial, but not conclusive) analysis can be
regarded as a starting point for a more refined analytical exploration of the
physics of the magnetized intra-cluster medium, and it provides testable
predictions that can be proven or disproven with the next coming sensitive
observations of groups and clusters in the X-ray band and in the radio

hypothetical weakly interacting massive dark matter particles. Discrimination
between nuclear recoils and background electron recoils is afforded by
recording both the scintillation and ionisation signals generated within the
liquid xenon, with the ratio of these signals being different for the two
classes of event. This ratio is calibrated for different incident species using
an AmBe neutron source and Co-60 gamma-ray sources. From our first 31 live days
of running ZEPLIN-II, the total exposure following the application of fiducial
and stability cuts was 225 kgxdays. A background population of radon progeny
events was observed in this run, arising from radon emission in the gas
purification getters, due to radon daughter ion decays on the surfaces of the
walls of the chamber. An acceptance window, defined by the neutron calibration
data, of 50% nuclear recoil acceptance between 5 keVee and 20 keVee, had an
observed count of 29 events, with a summed expectation of 28.6+/-4.3 gamma-ray
and radon progeny induced background events. These figures provide a 90% c.l.
upper limit to the number of nuclear recoils of 10.4 events in this acceptance
window, which converts to a WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross-section with a

(Skilling 2004), which was recently applied successfully to cosmology by
Muhkerjee et al. 2006, overcomes both of these impediments. Their
implementation restricts the parameter space sampled, and thus improves the
efficiency, using a decreasing ellipsoidal bound in the n-dimensional parameter
space centred on the maximum likelihood point. However, if the likelihood
function contains any multi-modality, then the ellipse is prevented from
constraining the sampling region efficiently. In this paper we introduce a
method of clustered ellipsoidal nested sampling which can form multiple
ellipses around each individual peak in the likelihood.
  In addition we have implemented a method for determining the expectation and
variance of the final evidence value without the need to use sampling error
from repetitions of the algorithm ; this further reduces the computational load
by at least an order of magnitude. We have applied our algorithm to a pair of
toy models and one cosmological example where we demonstrate that the number of

charge detectors in the solid state. Recent experimental advances have
demonstrated the on-chip detection of single electron transport through a
quantum dot (QD). The discreteness of charge in units of e leads to intrinsic
fluctuations in the electrical current, known as shot noise. To measure these
single-electron fluctuations a nearby coherent conductor, called a quantum
point contact (QPC), interacts with the QD and acts as a detector. An important
property of the QPC charge detector is noninvasiveness: the system physically
affects the detector, not visa-versa. Here we predict that even for ideal
noninvasive detectors such as the QPC, when a particular detector result is
observed, the system suffers an informational backaction, radically altering
the statistics of transport through the QD as compared to the unconditional
shot noise. We develop a theoretical model to make predictions about the joint
current probability distributions and conditional transport statistics. The
experimental findings reported here demonstrate the reality of informational
backaction in nanoscale systems as well as a variety of new effects, such as
conditional noise enhancement, which are in essentially perfect agreement with
our model calculations. This type of switching telegraph process occurs
abundantly in nature, indicating that these results are applicable to a wide
variety of systems.

defined nearest neighbor ordering indicating crystallinity of the MgO barrier
does not change by the annealing, a small amount of interfacial Fe-O at the
lower Co-Fe-B / MgO interface is found in the as grown samples, which is
completely reduced after annealing at 275C. This is accompanied by a
simultaneous increase of the Fe magnetic moment and the tunnel
magnetoresistance. However, the TMR of the MgO based junctions increases
further for higher annealing temperature which can not be caused by Fe-O
reduction. The occurrence of an x-ray absorption near-edge structure above the
Fe and Co L-edges after annealing at 350C indicates the recrystallization of
the Co-Fe-B electrode. This is prerequisite for coherent tunneling and has been
suggested to be responsible for the further increase of the TMR above 275C.
Simultaneously, the B concentration in the Co-Fe-B decreases with increasing
annealing temperature, at least some of the B diffuses towards or into the MgO
barrier and forms a B2O3 oxide.

the Bose-Fermi soliton such that the one-dimensional bright soliton exists for
any finite attractive Bose-Fermi scattering length. We study density profile
and collective excitations of the atomic bright soliton showing that they
depend on the bosonic regime involved: mean-field or Tonks-Girardeau.

third-party suppliers is steadily increasing. As the suppliers seek to secure
their intellectual property (IP) rights, the customer usually has no direct
access to the suppliers' source code, and is able to enforce the use of
verification tools only by legal requirements. In turn, the supplier has no
means to convince the customer about successful verification without revealing
the source code. This paper presents an approach to resolve the conflict
between the IP interests of the supplier and the quality interests of the
customer. We introduce a protocol in which a dedicated server (called the
""amanat"") is controlled by both parties: the customer controls the verification
task performed by the amanat, while the supplier controls the communication
channels of the amanat to ensure that the amanat does not leak information
about the source code. We argue that the protocol is both practically useful
and mathematically sound. As the protocol is based on well-known (and
relatively lightweight) cryptographic primitives, it allows a straightforward
implementation on top of existing verification tool chains. To substantiate our
security claims, we establish the correctness of the protocol by cryptographic
reduction proofs.

improved bounds for the cost of several matrix problems, considering, in
particular, ``sparse'' matrices that can be be multiplied by a vector using
softO(n) field operations. We show how to compute the inverse of a sparse
matrix over a field F using an expected number of softO(n^(2.27)) operations in

flipped by 103 degrees with respect to the initial spin direction of the larger

value scales to nearly 4000 km/s for maximally spinning holes. Such a large

somewhat larger than the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole were fully
absorbed by it, the second law of thermodynamics would be violated, under the
Bekenstein interpretation of the area of a black hole as a measure of its
entropy. Thus, entropy considerations make the well known fact that large
wavelengths are only marginally absorbed by black holes, a natural consequence
of thermodynamics. We also study numerically the ingoing radial propagation of
a scalar field wave in a Schwarzschild metric, relaxing the standard assumption
which leads to the eikonal equation, that the wave has zero spatial extent. We
find that if these waves have wavelengths larger that the Schwarzschild radius,
they are very substantially reflected, fully to numerical accuracy.
Interestingly, this critical wavelength approximately coincides with the one
derived from entropy considerations of the EM field, and is consistent with
well known limit results of scattering in the Schwarzschild metric. The
propagation speed is also calculated and seen to differ from the value $c$, for
wavelengths larger than $R_{s}$, in the vicinity of $R_{s}$. As in all
classical wave phenomena, whenever the wavelength is larger or comparable to
the physical size of elements in the system, in this case changes in the
metric, the zero extent 'particle' description fails, and the wave nature
becomes apparent.

regular Cauchy initial value problem at spatial infinity which uses Friedrich's
representation of spatial infinity as a cylinder. The decay of the Weyl tensor
for the developments of the class of initial data under consideration is
analysed under some existence and regularity assumptions for the asymptotic
expansions obtained using the cylinder at spatial infinity. Conditions on the
initial data to obtain developments satisfying the Peeling Behaviour are
identified. Further, the decay of the asymptotic shear on null infinity is also
examined as one approaches spatial infinity. This decay is related to the
possibility of selecting the Poincar\'e group out of the BMS group in a
canonical fashion. It is found that for the class of initial data under
consideration, if the development peels, then the asymptotic shear goes to zero
at spatial infinity. Expansions of the Bondi mass are also examined. Finally,
the Newman-Penrose constants of the spacetime are written in terms of initial
data quantities and it is shown that the constants defined at future null

a method for rapidly producing isotropic thermal matter at RHIC energies is
required. One of the chief obstacles to early isotropization/thermalization is
the rapid longitudinal expansion of the matter during the earliest times after
the initial nuclear impact. As a result of this expansion the parton
distribution functions become locally anisotropic in momentum space. In
contrast to locally isotropic plasmas anisotropic plasmas have a spectrum of
soft unstable modes which are characterized by exponential growth of transverse
chromo-magnetic/-electric fields at short times. This instability is the QCD
analogue of the Weibel instability of QED. Parametrically the chromo-Weibel

fields and dominates the short-time dynamics of the system.

$c\Pi_{t}^{0}(h_{t}^{0})$ productions. We find that the light charged top-pions
are not favorable by the Tevatron experiments and the Tevatron has a little
capability to probe neutral top-pion and top-Higgs via these FC production
processes. At the LHC, however, the cross section can reach the level of
$10\sim 100$ pb for $c\Pi_t^-$ production and $ 10\sim 100$ fb for
$c\Pi_t^0(h_t^0)$ production. So one can expect that enough signals could be
produced at the LHC experiments. Furthermore, the SM background should be clean
due to the FC feature of the processes and the FC decay modes $\Pi_t^-\to
b\bar{c}, \Pi_t^0(h_t^0)\to t\bar{c}$ can provide us the typical signal to
detect the top-pions and top-Higgs. Therefore, it is hopeful to find the signal
of top-pions and top-Higgs with the running of the LHC via these FC processes.

corrections in the Resonance Chiral Theory, the suggested framework to handle
QCD in the resonance region. After a theoretical introduction, Chapter 3 is
devoted to calculate the vector form factor of the pion at the next-to-leading
order in the 1/N(C) expansion. The ultraviolet behaviour of the calculation is
analyzed, together with the needed counterterms in the renormalization
procedure. The long-distance limit allows to determine the resonance
contribution to the low-energy constants of Chiral Perturbation Theory at the
NLO in 1/N(C). In Chapter 4 a study of the two-body hadronic form factors from
large-N(C) QCD is shown. We present a dispersive method which allows to
investigate the chiral LECs and we perform a NLO calculation of the scalar and
pseudoscalar two-point functions. Imposing the correct QCD short-distance
constraints, one determines their difference Pi(t)=Pi_S(t)-Pi_P(t) in terms of
the pion decay constant and resonance masses. Its low-momentum expansion fixes
then the ChPT coupling L(8). In Chapter 5 we evaluate the beta-function at
one-loop of the resonance lagrangian with one multiplet of scalar and

without additional matter sources partially in view of the fact that if the
acceleration is to continue indefinitely any ordinary matter term is to
redshift to irrelevancy and mostly for economy in understanding. The general
conditions we find is that the manifold of the extra dimensional space is to
have negative internal curvature and that the Ricci scalar of the full
space-time manifold is also negative. The positive curvature case for extra
dimensional manifold is actually the most generic case. However this
necessitates a fine tuning between the Hubble constant and the size of extra

nonequilibrium steady state are studied rigorously in the thermodynamic limit.
In particular, the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of a quantum spin system
that is composed of two infinite reservoirs at different temperatures coupled
in a bounded region is considered. Under suitable assumptions on the
interaction and the asymptotics of the fluctuations, a nonequilibrium central
limit theorem for the fluctuations of the NESS expectation value of the
empirical average of observables is proven by showing the analyticity of the
corresponding moment generating function in a neighbourhood of the origin using
the cluster expansion method. Furthermore, the large deviation principle is
proven for a class of observables by establishing the existence and
differentiability of the corresponding moment generating function.

can be defined either as a special case of almost periodic currents or as a
holomorphic chain whose trace measure is an almost periodic distribution. It is
shown that in general situation almost periodicity of the trace of a current
does not imply that for the current itself, even if it is closed and positive.
  The zero set (regarded as a holomorphic chain) of a holomorphic mapping can
be represented as a Monge-Ampere type current, and one could expect that the
zero set of an almost periodic holomorphic mapping should be almost periodic;
however we construct an example of an almost periodic holomorphic mapping whose
zero set is not almost periodic. Nevertheless, we prove almost periodicity of
the Monge-Ampere currents corresponding to almost periodic holomorphic mappings
with certain additional properties. Then we construct functions that play the
same role for almost periodic divisors as the so-called Jessen functions for
almost periodic holomorphic functions. In terms of Jessen function we give a
sufficient condition for realizability of an almost periodic divisor as the
divisor of a holomorphic almost periodic function; some necessary condition is

robust if we increase the tendency towards homophily as follows. First, we
raised the threshold of similarity below which influence is precluded. Second,
we allowed agents to be influenced by all neighbors simultaneously, instead of
only one neighbor as assumed in the orginal model. Computational experiments
show how both modifications strongly increase the robustness of diversity
against mutation. We also find that our extensions may reverse at least one of
the main results of Axelrod. While Axelrod predicted that a larger number of

It is assumed that all grains of dust have equal masses but charges are not
constant in time-they may fluctuate in time. The dust charges are not really
independent of the variations of the plasma potentials. All modes will
influence the charging mechanism, and feedback will lead to several new
interesting and unexpected phenomena. The charging of the grains depends on
local plasma characteristics. If the waves disturb these characteristic, then
charging of the grains is affected and the grain charge is modified, with a
resulting feedback on the wave mode. In case considering here, when temperature
of electrons is much greater then the temperature of the ions and temperature
of electrons is not great enough for further ionization of the ions, we show
that stability of the acoustic wave depends only one phenomenological

resulting feedback on the wave mode. In the case considered here, when the
temperature of electrons is much greater than the temperature of the ions and
the temperature of electrons is not great enough for further ionization of the
ions, we show that attenuation of the acoustic wave depends only on one

walls is driven by the motion of those walls. The laminar solution, in which
the streamwise velocity varies linearly in the wall-normal direction, is known
to be linearly stable at all Reynolds numbers ($Re$). Yet, in both experiments
and computations, turbulence is observed for $Re \gtrsim 360$.
  In this article, we show that for certain {\it threshold} perturbations of
the laminar flow, the flow approaches either steady or traveling wave
solutions. These solutions exhibit some aspects of turbulence but are not fully
turbulent even at $Re=4000$. However, these solutions are linearly unstable and
flows that evolve along their unstable directions become fully turbulent. The
solution approached by a threshold perturbation could depend upon the nature of
the perturbation. Surprisingly, the positive eigenvalue that corresponds to one
family of solutions decreases in magnitude with increasing $Re$, with the rate
of decrease given by $Re^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx -0.46$.

the ambient temperature that birds were exposed to above 0 degrees C (at

Math, Chem. 43, 749(2007)",,,"quant-ph",,"  Exact solution of Schrodinger equation for the Mie potential is obtained for
an arbitrary angular momentum. The energy eigenvalues and the corresponding
wavefunctions are calculated by the use of the Nikiforov-Uvarov method.
Wavefunctions are expressed in terms of Jacobi polynomials. The bound states
are calculated numerically for some values of l and $n$ with n<5. They are
applied to several diatomic molecules.

sector via Dirac procedure. The possibility of introducing standard canonical
variables is analysed in detail. The ambiguities in quantization procedure are
pointed out.

from coherently driven Rb atomic vapor. The prism possesses spectral angular
dispersion that is six orders of magnitude higher than that of a prism made of
optical glass; it is the highest spectral angular dispersion that has ever been
shown (such angular dispersion allows one to spatially resolve light beams with
different frequencies separated by a few kHz). The prism operates near the
resonant frequency of atomic vapor and its dispersion is optically controlled
by a coherent driving field.

space can be realized as a subspace of the representation space of SU(2)
corresponding to an irreducible representation of SU(2). The representation
theory of SU(2) is reconsidered via the use of two truncated deformed
oscillators. This leads to replace the familiar scheme {j^2, j_z} by a scheme
{j^2, v(ra)}, where the two-parameter operator v(ra) is defined in the
enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra su(2). The eigenvectors of the commuting
set of operators {j^2, v(ra)} are adapted to a tower of chains SO(3) > C(2j+1),
2j integer, where C(2j+1) is the cyclic group of order 2j+1. In the case where
2j+1 is prime, the corresponding eigenvectors generate a complete set of
mutually unbiased bases. Some useful relations on generalized quadratic Gauss
sums are exposed in three appendices.

an operator is determined via suitable data-processing of the outcomes of a
quantum measurement described by a POVM. After reviewing the optimization of
data processing that minimizes the statistical error of the estimation, we
provide a compact formula for the evaluation of the estimation error.

D. This means that the energies get complex (= unobservable) beyond the
boundary (= Kato's ""exceptional points"", EPs). In a solvable example we detect
an enlargement of D caused by the emergence of a new degree of freedom. We
conjecture that such a beneficial mechanism of a return to the real spectrum
near EPs may be generic and largely model-independent.
