Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) has not yet found a convincing explanation. The fact
that the optical and X-ray lightcurves are often different, with breaks at
different times, makes contrived any explanation based on the same origin for
both the X-ray and optical fluxes. We here assume that the central engine can
be active for a long time, producing shells of decreasing bulk Lorentz factors
Gamma. We also assume that the internal dissipation of these late shells
produces a continuous and smooth emission (power-law in time), usually dominant
in X-rays and sometimes in the optical. When Gamma of the late shells is larger
than 1/theta_j, where theta_j is the jet opening angle, we see only a portion
of the emitting surface. Eventually, Gamma becomes smaller than 1/theta_j, and
the entire emitting surface is visible. Thus there is a break in the light
curve when Gamma=1/theta_j, which we associate to the time at which the plateau
ends. After the steeply decaying phase which follows the early prompt, we see
the sum of two emission components: the ""late-prompt"" emission (due to late
internal dissipation), and the ""real afterglow"" emission (due to external
shocks). A variety of different optical and X-ray light curves are then
possible, explaining why the X-ray and the optical light curves often do not
track each other (but sometimes do), and often they do not have simultaneous
breaks.

  The character of distribution of the galaxies over three paremeters: M_B,
SFR, and total hydrogen mass permits us to draw the following conclusions as to

would have time to generate their luminosity (baryon mass) during the
cosmological time T_0=13.7 Gyr, but dwarf spheroidal objects are capable of
reproducing only ~5% of their observed luminosity. b) S and Im, BCD galaxies
possess the supply of gas sufficient to maintain their observed SFRs during
only next (1/4 -1/3)T_0 years, while dIr and dSph populations have the mean gas
depletion time about 3 T_0. c) There is indirect evidence that the star
formation in Im, BCD and dIr galaxies proceeds in a mode of vigorous burst
activity rather than in the form of a sluggish process. We note the dwarf tidal
system near NGC 3077, the Garland, to have the highest SFR per unit luminosity

proposed before, the superorbital variability can be explained by oscillations

maximum of the eccentricity of about 0.004 is sufficient to explain the

inner and outer orbits. Last but not least, we discover a remarkable and
puzzling synchronization between the observed period of the superorbital

binary \source. This state (measured by us by the position on the X-ray
colour-colour diagram) is tightly coupled to the accretion rate, which, in
turn, is coupled to the phase of the 170-d superorbital cycle of this source.
The modulation depth is much stronger in the high-luminosity, so-called banana,
state than in the low-luminosity, island, state. We find the X-ray modulation
is independent of energy, which rules out bound-free X-ray absorption in an
optically thin medium as the cause of the modulation. We also find a
significant dependence of the offset phase of the orbital modulation on the
spectral state, which favours the model in which the modulation is caused by
scattering in hot gas around a bulge at the disc edge, which both size and the
position vary with the accretion rate. Estimates of the source inclination
appear to rule out a model in which the bulge itself occults a part of an
accretion disc corona. We calculate the average flux of this source over the
course of its superorbital variability (which has the period of 170 d), and
find it to be fully compatible with the model of accretion due to the angular
momentum loss via emission of gravitational radiation. Also, we compare the
dates of all X-ray bursts observed from this source by BeppoSAX and RXTE with
the RXTE light curve, and find all of them to coincide with deep minima of the

mass to grow the white-dwarf to instability. Plasma jets, winds and radiation
driven by contraction and spin-up of the carbon star evaporate JPPs revealing

bright elongated nebula, terminated on its eastern end by a sharp perpendicular
structure aligned with the radio shell. The X-ray spectrum of W49B is
characterized by strong K emission lines from Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe. There is a
variation of the temperature in the remnant with the highest temperature found
in the eastern side and the lowest one in the western side. The analysis of the
recent observations of W49B indicates that the remnant may be the result of an
asymmetric bipolar explosion where the ejecta are collimated along a jet-like
structure and the eastern jet is hotter and more Fe-rich than the western one.
Another possible scenario associates the X-ray emission with a spherical
explosion where parts of the ejecta are interacting with a dense belt of
ambient material. To overcome this ambiguity we present new results of the
analysis of an XMM-Newton observation and we perform estimates of the mass and
energy of the remnant. We conclude that the scenario of an anisotropic jet-like
explosion explains quite naturally our observation results, but the association
of W49B with a hypernova and a gamma-ray burst, although still possible, is not
directly supported by any evidence.

diagrams. Using the spectral energy distribution (SED) slopes in the IRAC
spectral range, we place objects in several classes: non-excess stars, stars
with optically thick disks(like classical T Tauri stars), class I
(protostellar) candidates, and stars with ``evolved disks''; the last exhibit
smaller IRAC excesses than optically thick disk systems. In general, this
classification agrees with the location expected in IRAC-MIPS color-color
diagrams for these objects. We find that the evolved disk systems are mostly a
combination of objects with optically thick but non-flared disks, suggesting
grain growth and/or settling, and transition disks, systems in which the inner
disk is partially or fully cleared of small dust. In all, we identify 7
transition disk candidates and 3 possible debris disk systems. As in other
young stellar populations, the fraction of disks depends on the stellar mass,
ranging from ~10% for stars in the Herbig Ae/Be mass range (>2 msun) to ~35% in
the T Tauri mass range (1-0.1 msun). We find that the disk fraction does not
decrease significantly toward the brown dwarf candidates (<0.1 msun). The IRAC
infrared excesses found in stellar clusters and associations with and without
central high mass stars are similar, suggesting that external photoevaporation
is not very important in many clusters. Finally, we find no correlation between
the X-ray luminosity and the disk infrared excess, suggesting that the X-rays
are not strongly affected by disk accretion.

parameters Omega_m, the density of matter in the universe, and sigma_8, the
normalization of the matter power spectrum. The introduction of redshift
information tightens the constraints by a factor of three, and also reduces the
relative sampling (or ""cosmic"") variance compared to recent surveys that may be

including, for the first time, multiply deuterated species. We use these models
to explore whether observations in combination with models can give us clues as
to which desorption processes occur in disks. We find, in common with other
authors, that photodesorption can allow strongly bound molecules such as HDO to
exist in the gas phase in a layer above the midplane. Models including this
process give the best agreement with the observations. In the midplane, cosmic
ray heating can desorb weakly bound molecules such as CO and N$_2$. We find the
observations suggest that N$_2$ is gaseous in this region, but that CO must be
retained on the grains to account for the observed DCO$^+$/HCO$^+$. This could
be achieved by CO having a higher binding energy than N$_2$ (as may be the case
when these molecules are accreted onto water ice) or by a smaller cosmic ray
desorption rate for CO than assumed here, as suggested by recent theoretical
work.
  For gaseous molecules the calculated deuteration can be greatly changed by
chemical processing in the disk from the input molecular cloud values. On the
grains singly deuterated species tend to retain the D/H ratio set in the
molecular cloud, whereas multiply deuterated species are more affected by the
disk chemistry. Consequently the D/H ratios observed in comets may be partly
set in the parent cloud and partly in the disk, depending on the molecule.

NGC 4594), based on XMM-Newton and Chandra observations. A list of 62
XMM-Newton and 175 Chandra discrete X-ray sources is provided. At energies
above 2 keV, the source-subtracted X-ray emission is distributed similarly as
the stellar K-band light and is primarily due to the residual emission from
discrete sources. At lower energies, however, a substantial fraction of the
source-subtracted emission arises from diffuse hot gas extending to ~20 kpc
from the galactic center. The observed diffuse X-ray emission from the galaxy
shows a steep spectrum that can be characterized by an optically-thin thermal
plasma with temperatures of ~0.6-0.7 keV, varying little with radius. The
diffuse emission has a total luminosity of ~3e39 erg/s in the 0.2-2 keV energy
range. This luminosity is significantly smaller than the prediction by current
numerical simulations for galaxies as massive as Sombrero. We argue that the
stellar feedback likely plays an essential role in regulating the physical
properties of hot gas. Indeed, the observed diffuse X-ray luminosity of
Sombrero accounts for at most a few percent of the expected mechanical energy
input from Type Ia supernovae. The inferred gas mass and metal content are also
substantially less than those expected from stellar ejecta. We speculate that a
galactic bulge wind, powered primarily by Type Ia supernovae, has removed much
of the 'missing' energy and metal-enriched gas from regions revealed by the
X-ray observations.

ray transient Swift J1753.5-0127 observed by the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer

emissions are dominated by the hard X-rays, thus revealing the low/hard state
of the source during the outburst. The peak luminosity is found lower than the
typical value of balancing the mass flow and evaporation of the inner edge of
disk (Meyer-Hofmeister 2004). As a result, the disk is prevented from extending
inward to produce strong soft X-rays, corresponding to the so-called high/soft
state. These are the typical characteristics for a small subset of BHCs, i.e.
those soft X-ray transients stay at the low/hard state during the outburst. In
most observational time, the QPO frequencies are found to vary roughly linearly
with the fluxes and the spectral indices, while the deviation from this
relationship at the peak luminosity might provide the first observational
evidence of a partially evaporated inner edge of the accretion disk. The
anti-correlation between the QPO frequency and spectral color suggests that the
global disk oscillation model proposed by Titarchuk & Osherovich (2000) is not

that external irradiation has both positive and negative effects, accelerating
the formation of some objects, delaying the formation of others, and inducing
the formation of some that would not otherwise have formed. Overall, the
calculation in which feedback is included forms nearly twice as many objects
over a period of \sim0.5 freefall times (\sim2.4 Myr), resulting in a
star--formation efficiency approximately one third higher (\sim4% as opposed to
\sim3% at this epoch) as in the control run in which feedback is absent.

so far been focused on the peculiar electronic structure of this material, in
which charge carriers mimic massless relativistic particle. However, the
structure of graphene - a single layer of carbon atoms densely packed in a

to be a strictly two-dimensional (2D) material and exhibits such a high crystal
quality that electrons can travel submicron distances without scattering. On
the other hand, perfect 2D crystals cannot exist in the free state, according
to both theory and experiment. This is often reconciled by the fact that all
graphene structures studied so far were an integral part of larger 3D
structures, either supported by a bulk substrate or embedded in a 3D matrix.

display a long-range crystalline order. However, our studies by transmission

perfectly flat but exhibit intrinsic microscopic roughening such that the
surface normal varies by several degrees and out-of-plane deformations reach 1

studies, consisting in general of a linear combination of all possible operator
orderings. In some cases the valence-band Rashba coupling differs significantly

effected by the Rashba spin-orbit interaction, lateral confinement of a two
dimensional electronic system leads to a finite transverse spin polarization
near the longitudinal edges of a current carrying quantum wire. The sign of
this component of the polarization is opposite at the two edges and can be
reversed upon inversion of the current. Interestingly for small spin orbit
coupling this is the largest contribution to the total polarization, its
magnitude being of second order in the coupling constant. As a consequence this
phenomenon cannot be revealed in lowest order perturbative approaches. An in
plane spin polarization component is also present that is perpendicular to the
current. Within the same model this component would be also present in the
bulk. On the other hand while in the latter case its magnitude is linear in the

spectrum of a finite-order $L$, we derive two new results for the feedback
capacity under an average channel input power constraint. First, we show that a
very simple feedback-dependent Gauss-Markov source achieves the feedback
capacity, and that Kalman-Bucy filtering is optimal for processing the
feedback. Based on these results, we develop a new method for optimizing the
channel inputs for achieving the Cover-Pombra block-length-$n$ feedback
capacity by using a dynamic programming approach that decomposes the
computation into $n$ sequentially identical optimization problems where each
stage involves optimizing $O(L^2)$ variables. Second, we derive the explicit
maximal information rate for stationary feedback-dependent sources. In general,
evaluating the maximal information rate for stationary sources requires solving
only a few equations by simple non-linear programming. For first-order
autoregressive and/or moving average (ARMA) noise channels, this optimization
admits a closed form maximal information rate formula. The maximal information
rate for stationary sources is a lower bound on the feedback capacity, and it
equals the feedback capacity if the long-standing conjecture, that stationary
sources achieve the feedback capacity, holds.

channel noise is assumed to be a ARMA (autoregressive and/or moving average)
process. We reformulate the Gaussian noise channel into an intersymbol
interference channel with white noise, and show that the delayed-feedback of
the original channel is equivalent to the instantaneous-feedback of the derived
channel. By generalizing results previously developed for Gaussian channels
with instantaneous feedback and applying them to the derived intersymbol
interference channel, we show that conditioned on the delayed feedback, a
conditional Gauss-Markov source achieves the feedback capacity and its Markov
memory length is determined by the noise spectral order and the feedback delay.
A Kalman-Bucy filter is shown to be optimal for processing the feedback. The
maximal information rate for stationary sources is derived in terms of channel
input power constraint and the steady state solution of the Riccati equation of
the Kalman-Bucy filter used in the feedback loop.

the traces which they leave or those that one makes them produce. It is
considered here that it should be possible to make several observations
simultaneously, using a large variety of independently developed analyzers. For
this purpose, we introduce the original notion of ``full trace'' to capture the
idea that a process can be instrumented in such a way that it may broadcast all
information which could ever be requested by any kind of observer. Each
analyzer can then find in the full trace the data elements which it needs. This
approach uses what has been called a ""tracer driver"" which completes the tracer
and drives it to answer the requests of the analyzers. A tracer driver allows
to restrict the flow of information and makes this approach tractable. On the
other side, the potential size of a full trace seems to make the idea of full
trace unrealistic. In this work we explore the consequences of this notion in
term of potential efficiency, by analyzing the respective workloads between the
(full) tracer and many different analyzers, all being likely run in true
parallel environments. To illustrate this study, we use the example of the
observation of the resolution of constraints systems (proof-tree, search-tree
and propagation) using sophisticated visualization tools, as developed in the
project OADymPPaC (2001-2004). The processes considered here are computer
programs, but we believe the approach can be extended to many other kinds of

example inference of types that describe an over-approximation of the success
set of a program, inference of well-typings, and abstractions based on given
types. Analyses can be descriptive or prescriptive or a mixture of both, and
they can be goal-dependent or goal-independent. We describe a prototype tool
that can be accessed from a web browser, allowing various type analyses to be
run. The first goal of the tool is to allow the analysis results to be examined
conveniently by clicking on points in the original program clauses, and to
highlight ill-typed program constructs, empty types or other type anomalies.
Secondly the tool allows combination of the various styles of analysis. For
example, a descriptive regular type can be automatically inferred for a given
program, and then that type can be used to generate the minimal ""domain model""
of the program with respect to the corresponding pre-interpretation, which can
give more precise information than the original descriptive type.

  Programming Environments (WLPE2006)",,,,"cs.PL",,"  Abstraction-Carrying Code (ACC) has recently been proposed as a framework for
proof-carrying code (PCC) in which the code supplier provides a program
together with an abstraction (or abstract model of the program) whose validity
entails compliance with a predefined safety policy. The abstraction thus plays
the role of safety certificate and its generation (and validation) is carried
out automatically by a fixed-point analyzer. Existing approaches for PCC are
developed under the assumption that the consumer reads and validates the entire
program w.r.t. the full certificate at once, in a non incremental way. In this
abstract, we overview the main issues on incremental ACC. In particular, in the
context of logic programming, we discuss both the generation of incremental
certificates and the design of an incremental checking algorithm for untrusted
updates of a (trusted) program, i.e., when a producer provides a modified
version of a previously validated program. By update, we refer to any arbitrary
change on a program, i.e., the extension of the program with new predicates,
the deletion of existing predicates and the replacement of existing predicates
by new versions for them. We also discuss how each kind of update affects the
incremental extension in terms of accuracy and correctness.

generalization of the well-known method of adding a parity bit in the case of a

generator matrix of C by adding l columns with the property that at least s of
the l letters added to each of the codewords of minimum weight in C are
different from 0. If one finds such columns the minimum distance of the
extended code is d+s provided that the second smallest weight in C was at least

be well described by a linear superposition of complex exponentials
(quasinormal modes). In the strong-field conditions typical of a binary black
hole merger, non-linear effects may produce mode coupling. Artificial mode
coupling can also be induced by the black hole's rotation, if the radiation
field is expanded in terms of spin-weighted spherical (rather than spheroidal)
harmonics. Observing deviations from linear black hole perturbation theory
requires optimal fitting techniques to extract ringdown parameters from
numerical waveforms, which are inevitably affected by errors. So far,
non-linear least-squares fitting methods have been used as the standard
workhorse to extract frequencies from ringdown waveforms. These methods are
known not to be optimal for estimating parameters of complex exponentials.
Furthermore, different fitting methods have different performance in the
presence of noise. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce the
gravitational wave community to modern variations of a linear parameter
estimation technique first devised in 1795 by Prony: the Kumaresan-Tufts and
matrix pencil methods. Using ""test"" damped sinusoidal signals in Gaussian white
noise we illustrate the advantages of these methods, showing that they have
variance and bias at least comparable to standard non-linear least-squares
techniques. Then we compare the performance of different methods on
unequal-mass binary black hole merger waveforms. The methods we discuss should
be useful both theoretically (to monitor errors and search for non-linearities
in numerical relativity simulations) and experimentally (for parameter
estimation from ringdown signals after a gravitational wave detection).

the remaining cases of negative curvature (i.e. anti-de Sitter) spacetimes and

case, the existence of CMC time functions is obtained by using the level sets
of the cosmological time function as barriers. A major part of the work
consists of proving the required curvature estimates for these level sets.
  The nonzero curvature case presents significant new difficulties, in part due
to the fact that the topological structure of nonzero constant curvature
spacetimes is much richer than that of the flat spacetimes. Further, the
timelike convergence condition fails for de Sitter spacetimes, and hence
uniqueness for CMC hypersurfaces fails in general. We characterize those de

unique), as well as those which admit CMC foliations but no CMC time function.

Markovian. However, other waiting time distributions are also relevant in
applications, in particular such ones with a fat tail caused by a power law

process with a waiting time distribution described by the Mittag-Leffler
function. This distribution, containing the exponential as particular case, is
shown to play a fundamental role in the infinite thinning procedure of a
generic renewal process governed by a power asymptotic waiting time. We then
consider the renewal theory with reward that implies a random walk subordinated

variety $X/G$. The aim of this paper is to determine the place of $X/G$ in the
birational classification of varieties. That is, we determine the Kodaira
dimension of $X/G$ and decide when it is uniruled or rationally connected.
  If $G$ acts without fixed points, then $\kappa(X/G)=\kappa(X)=0$; thus the
interesting case is when $G$ has fixed points. We answer the above questions in
terms of the action of the stabilizer subgroups near the fixed points.
  We give a rough classification of possible stabilizer groups which cause
$X/G$ to have Kodaira dimension $-\infty$ or equivalently (as we show) to be
uniruled. These stabilizers are closely related to unitary reflection groups.

However, the Colombeau theory of generalized functions allows for a pullback by
an arbitrary c-bounded generalized function. It has been shown in previous work
that in the case of multiplication of Colombeau functions (which is a special
case of a $C^{\infty}$ pullback), the generalized wave front set of the product
satisfies the same inclusion relation as in the distributional case, if the
factors have their wavefront sets in favorable position. We prove a microlocal

vortical structures of a turbulent flow is introduced. This model involves a
space and time discretization of the dynamics and depends on only two
parameters: the fraction of space-time occupied by rotating structures of the
carrier flow and the rate at which particles are ejected from them. The latter
can be heuristically related to the response time of the particles and hence
measure their inertia. It is shown that such a model reproduces qualitatively
most aspects of the spatial distribution of heavy particles transported by
realistic flows. In particular the probability density function of the mass $m$
in a cell displays an power-law behavior at small values and decreases faster
than exponentially at large values. The dependence of the exponent of the first
tail upon the parameters of the dynamics is explicitly derived for the model.
The right tail is shown to decrease as $\exp (-C m \log m)$. Finally, the
distribution of mass averaged over several cells is shown to obey rescaling
properties as a function of the coarse-grain size and of the ejection rate of
the particles. Contrarily to what has been observed in direct numerical
simulations of turbulent flows (Bec et al., http://arxiv.org/nlin.CD/0608045),
such rescaling properties are only due in the model to the mass dynamics of the
particles and do not involve any scaling properties in the spatial structure of
the carrier flow.

of the G measurement pointed out the progress made in various experimental
methods and discussed the effects on the accuracy of G. In spite of several
measurements with torsion balance in vacuum to the aim of reducing some
disturbances, no mention was made about a possible pressure effect in calm air.
In 2000 J.Luo and Z.K.Hu firstly denounced the presence of some unknown
systematic problem on G measurement. In the present work a new systematic error
is analysed which arises from the non-zero balance of the overall momentum
discharged by the air molecules upon the test mass within the vacuum chamber.
This effect is normally negligible, but when the pressure is so low that the
molecule mean free path is comparable to the thickness of the air meatus
surrounding the test mass, the drawing force may become greater than the
gravitational force. Considering the usual size of the meatus, the molecular
effect becomes maximum when the pressure drops to about 0.01milli bar. Before
Heyl measurement at 1 millibar (1927), the experiments were made at higher
pressures. Conversely those made with recent vacuum techniques show pressures
down to 0.1 nanobar (Gundlach and Merkowitz, 2000) and 0.01 nanobar (Gershteyn,
2002). In these experiments the effect of the vacuum pressure appears very
little. As a matter of fact, we were not able to find in the literature some
measurements made at vacuum pressures between the millibar and the nanobar. Why
? This lack appears embarrassing in absence of an adequate physical
explanation.

resonance imaging (MRI). Multiple receiver coils have been shown to improve
image quality and allow accelerated image acquisition. Magnetic resonance
imaging at ultra-low fields (ULF MRI) is a new imaging approach that uses SQUID
(superconducting quantum interference device) sensors to measure the spatially
encoded precession of pre-polarized nuclear spin populations at
microtesla-range measurement fields. In this work, parallel imaging at
microtesla fields is systematically studied for the first time. A seven-channel
SQUID system, designed for both ULF MRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG), is
used to acquire 3D images of a human hand, as well as 2D images of a large
water phantom. The imaging is performed at 46 microtesla measurement field with
pre-polarization at 40 mT. It is shown how the use of seven channels increases
imaging field of view and improves signal-to-noise ratio for the hand images. A
simple procedure for approximate correction of concomitant gradient artifacts
is described. Noise propagation is analyzed experimentally, and the main source
of correlated noise is identified. Accelerated imaging based on one-dimensional
undersampling and 1D SENSE (sensitivity encoding) image reconstruction is
studied in the case of the 2D phantom. Actual 3-fold imaging acceleration in
comparison to single-average fully encoded Fourier imaging is demonstrated.
These results show that parallel imaging methods are efficient in ULF MRI, and
that imaging performance of SQUID-based instruments improves substantially as
the number of channels is increased.

data making minimal a priori assumptions about the underlying dynamics. To this
end, we generalize the elementary concept of recurrence for a point process in
time to recurrent events in space and time. An event is defined to be a
recurrence of any previous event if it is closer to it in space than all the
intervening events. As such, each sequence of recurrences for a given event is
a record breaking process. This definition provides a strictly data driven
technique to search for structure. Defining events to be nodes, and linking
each event to its recurrences, generates a network of recurrent events.
Significant deviations in properties of that network compared to networks
arising from random processes allows one to infer attributes of the causal
dynamics that generate observable correlations in the patterns. We derive
analytically a number of properties for the network of recurrent events
composed by a random process. We extend the theory of records to treat not only
the variable where records happen, but also time as continuous. In this way, we
construct a fully symmetric theory of records leading to a number of new
results. Those analytic results are compared to the properties of a network
synthesized from earthquakes in Southern California. Significant disparities
from the ensemble of acausal networks that can be plausibly attributed to the
causal structure of seismicity are: (1) Invariance of network statistics with
the time span of the events considered, (2) Appearance of a fundamental length
scale for recurrences, independent of the time span of the catalog, which is
consistent with observations of the ``rupture length'', (3) Hierarchy in the
distances and times of subsequent recurrences.

with major contribution of other evolutionary processes, such as neutral
variation, exaptation, and gene duplication. However, for biological evolution
to take off, a certain minimal degree of complexity is required such that a
replicating genome encodes means for its own replication with sufficient rate
and fidelity. In all existing life forms, this is achieved by dedicated
proteins, polymerases (replicases), that are produced by the elaborate
translation system. However, evolution of the coupled system of replication and
translation does not appear possible without pre-existing efficient
replication; hence a chicken-egg type paradox. I argue that the
many-worlds-in-one version of the cosmological model of eternal inflation
implies that emergence of replication and translation, as well as the major
protein folds, by chance alone, as opposed to biological evolution, is a
realistic possibility and could provide for the onset of biological evolution.
Hence an RNA world, as it is currently conceived, might have never existed

cryptosystems which can be implemented with current technology, but which
remain secure even in the presence of quantum computers. Inspired by recent
negative results pertaining to the nonabelian hidden subgroup problem, we
present here a classical algebraic function $f_V(M)$ of a matrix $M$ which we
believe is a one-way function secure against quantum attacks. Specifically,
inverting $f_V$ reduces naturally to solving a hidden subgroup problem over the
general linear group (which is at least as hard as the hidden subgroup problem
over the symmetric group). We also demonstrate a reduction from Graph
Isomorphism to the problem of inverting $f_V$; unlike Graph Isomorphism,
however, the function $f_V$ is random self-reducible and therefore uniformly
hard.
  These results suggest that, unlike Shor's algorithm for the discrete
logarithm--which is, so far, the only successful quantum attack on a classical
one-way function--quantum attacks based on the hidden subgroup problem are
unlikely to work. We also show that reconstructing any entry of $M$, or the

$f_V$. Finally, $f_V$ can be efficiently computed and the number of output bits
is less than $1+\epsilon$ times the number of input bits for any $\epsilon >
0$.

particles is systematically developed. Contrary to the nonrelativistic
time-of-arrival operator studied thoroughly in previous literatures, the
relativistic time-of-arrival operator possesses self-adjoint extensions because
of the particle-antiparticle symmetry. The nonrelativistic limit of our theory
is in agreement with the nonrelativistic time-of-arrival theory. By comparing
the time-of-arrival operator with the Hamiltonian operator of a free Dirac
particle, one can show a duality between position space and momentum space.

generalized measurement. Another paradigm of measurement--arising naturally in
quantum optics, among other fields--is that of continuous-time measurements,
which can be seen as the limit of a consecutive sequence of weak measurements.
They are naturally described in terms of stochastic processes, or
time-dependent random variables. We show that any generalized measurement can
be decomposed as a sequence of weak measurements with a mathematical limit as a
continuous stochastic process. We give an explicit construction for any
generalized measurement, and prove that the resulting continuous evolution, in
the long-time limit, collapses the state of the quantum system to one of the
final states generated by the generalized measurement, being decomposed, with
the correct probabilities. A prominent feature of the construction is the
presence of a feedback mechanism--the instantaneous choice weak measurement at
a given time depends on the outcomes of earlier measurements. For a generalized
measurement with $n$ outcomes, this information is captured by a real
$n$-vector on an $n$-simplex, which obeys a simple classical stochastic
evolution.

Hamiltonian, we find the entanglement to be the functions of observables for
six kinds of chosen state sets and verify how these functions be invariant with

entanglement versus a set of commutable observables under eight kinds of given

devices like single-electron transistors. The blockade mechanisms are based on
strong interactions like the Coulomb interaction in case of single electrons.
Neutral atoms excited into a Rydberg state experience abnormally strong
interactions that lead to the corresponding blockade effect for Rydberg atoms.
In this paper we report on our measurements of a strong van der Waals blockade,
showing that only one out of several thousand atoms within a blockade volume
can be excited. In addition, our experimental results demonstrate the coherent
nature of the excitation of magnetically trapped ultracold atoms into a Rydberg
state, confirming the predicted dependence of the collective Rabi frequency on
the square root of the mesoscopic system size. This collective coherent
behaviour is generic for all mesoscopic systems which are able to carry only
one single excitation quantum.

two periodically-curved waveguides in an Er:Yb-doped glass, is designed so that
spatial light propagation exactly mimics the coherent space-time dynamics of
matter waves in a driven double-well potential governed by the Schr\""{o}dinger

evolution of light in the two wells, clearly demonstrating suppression of light
tunneling for special ratios between frequency and amplitude of the driving
