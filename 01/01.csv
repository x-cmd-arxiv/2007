boundary conditions for the brane-bulk system. Boundary conditions (BC's)
employing regulatory branes or demanding that the bulk metric be nonsingular
have yet to be implemented in full generality. In this paper, we take a
different route and specify boundary conditions directly on the brane thereby
arriving at a local and closed system of equations (on the brane). We consider
a one-parameter family of boundary conditions involving the anisotropic stress
of the projection of the bulk Weyl tensor on the brane and derive an exact
system of equations describing scalar cosmological perturbations on a generic
braneworld with induced gravity. Depending upon our choice of boundary
conditions, perturbations on the brane either grow moderately (region of
stability) or rapidly (instability). In the instability region, the evolution
of perturbations usually depends upon the scale: small scale perturbations grow
much more rapidly than those on larger scales. This instability is caused by a
peculiar gravitational interaction between dark radiation and matter on the
brane. Generalizing the boundary conditions obtained by Koyama and Maartens, we
find for the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model an instability, which leads to a
dramatic scale-dependence of the evolution of density perturbations in matter
and dark radiation. A different set of BC's, however, leads to a more moderate
and scale-independent growth of perturbations. For the mimicry braneworld,
which expands like LCDM, this class of BC's can lead to an earlier epoch of
structure formation.

to inject, modulate, and detect electron spin in a single device. A simple
prototype consists of a lateral semiconductor channel with two ferromagnetic
contacts, one of which serves as a source of spin-polarized electrons and the
other as a detector. Based on work in analogous metallic systems, two important
criteria have emerged for demonstrating electrical detection of spin transport.
The first is the measurement of a non-equilibrium spin population using a
non-local ferromagnetic detector through which no charge current flows. The
potential at the detection electrode should be sensitive to the relative
magnetizations of the detector and the source electrodes, a property referred
to as the spin-valve effect. A second and more rigorous test is the existence
of a Hanle effect, which is the modulation and suppression of the spin valve
signal due to precession and dephasing in a transverse magnetic field. Here we
report on the observation of both the spin valve and Hanle effects in lateral
devices consisting of epitaxial Fe Schottky tunnel barrier contacts on an
n-doped GaAs channel. The dependence on transverse magnetic field, temperature,
and contact separation are in good agreement with a model incorporating spin
drift and diffusion. Spin transport is detected for both directions of current
flow through the source electrode. The sign of the electrical detection signal
is found to vary with the injection current and is correlated with the spin
polarization in the GaAs channel determined by optical measurements. These
results therefore demonstrate a fully electrical scheme for spin injection,
transport, and detection in a lateral semiconductor device.

(mis)represent a uniform negative net mass density of gravitationally
attractive and gravitationally repulsive matter. Field equations with both
positive and negative active gravitational mass densities of both primordial

`relax the constraints' on the space-time geometry, yield cosmological
solutions that exhibit inflation, deceleration, coasting, acceleration, and a
`big bounce' instead of a `big bang', and provide good fits to a Hubble diagram

sides of the `drainholes' introduced by the author in 1973 as solutions of
those same field equations. Drainholes (prototypical examples of `traversable
wormholes') are topological tunnels in space which gravitationally attract on
their front, entrance sides and repel more strongly on their back, exit sides.
The front sides serve both as the gravitating cores of the visible, baryonic
particles of primordial matter and as the continuously created, invisible
particles of the `dark matter' needed to hold together the large scale
structures seen in the universe; the back sides serve as the misnamed `dark

Formation of cosmic voids, walls, filaments, and nodes is attributed to
expulsion of drainhole entrances from regions populated by drainhole exits, and
accumulation of the entrances on boundaries separating those regions.

Ground-based gravitational wave detectors are now operating at a sensitivity

several groups have independently made significant breakthroughs that have
finally enabled numerical relativists to solve the Einstein field equations for
coalescing black-hole binaries, a key source of gravitational radiation. The
numerical relativity community is now in the position to begin providing
simulated merger waveforms for use by the data analysis community, and it is
therefore very important that we provide ways to validate the results produced
by various numerical approaches. Here, we present a simple comparison of the
waveforms produced by two very different, but equally successful
approaches--the generalized harmonic gauge and the moving puncture methods. We
compare waveforms of equal-mass black hole mergers with minimal or vanishing
spins. The results show exceptional agreement for the final burst of radiation,
with some differences attributable to small spins on the black holes in one
case.

Our treatment is based on a recently-proposed, general formulation for growth
within the context of Mixture Theory (Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of
Solids, 52, 2004, 1595--1625). We aim to enhance this treatment by making it
more appropriate for the biophysics of growth in porous soft tissue,
specifically tendon. This involves several modifications to the mathematical
formulation to represent the reactions, transport and mechanics, and their
interactions. We also reformulate the governing differential equations for
reaction-transport to represent the incompressibility constraint on the fluid
phase of the tissue. This revision enables a straightforward implementation of
numerical stabilisation for the hyperbolic, or advection-dominated, limit. A
finite element implementation employing an operator splitting scheme is used to
solve the coupled, non-linear partial differential equations that arise from
the theory. Motivated by our experimental model, an in vitro scaffold-free
engineered tendon formed by self-assembly of tendon fibroblasts (Tissue

shown to admit a clear geometrical interpretation, when applied to
Schmidt-correlated (SC) states: the negativity of a SC state equals a distance
of the state from a pertinent separable state. As a consequence, a SC state is
separable if and only if its negativity vanishes. Another remarkable
consequence is that the negativity of a SC can be estimated ""at a glance"" on
the density matrix. These results are generalized to mixtures of SC states,
which emerge in certain quantum-dynamical settings.
