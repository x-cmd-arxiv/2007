HCN-to-CO intensity ratios in AGN than in starburst (SB) environments. HCN
enhancement can be caused by many different effects, such as higher gas
densities/temperatures, UV/X-ray radiation, and non-collisional excitation. As
active galaxies often exhibit intense circumnuclear SB, high angular
resolution/sensitivity observations are of paramount importance to
disentangling the influence of SB from that of nuclear activity on the
chemistry of the surrounding molecular gas. The tight relation of HCN
enhancement and nuclear activity may qualify HCN as an ideal tracer of
molecular gas close to the AGN, providing complementary and additional
information to that gained via CO. NGC6951 houses nuclear and SB activity,
making it an ideal testbed in which to study the effects of different
excitation conditions on the molecular gas. We used the new ABCD configurations
of the IRAM PdBI to observe HCN(1-0) in NGC6951 at high angular resolution
(1''). We detect very compact (<50pc) HCN emission in its nucleus, supporting
previous hints of nuclear gas structure. Our observations also reveal HCN
emission in the SB ring and resolve it into several peaks, leading to a higher
coincidence between the HCN and CO distributions than previously reported. We
find a significantly higher HCN-to-CO intensity ratio (>0.4) in the nucleus
than in the SB ring (0.02-0.05). As for NGC1068, this might result from a
higher HCN abundance in the centre due to an X-ray dominated gas chemistry, but
a higher gas density/temperature or additional non-collisional excitation of
HCN cannot be entirely ruled out, based on these observations. The compact HCN
emission is associated with rotating gas in a circumnuclear disk/torus.

D","Phys.Rev.D76:023502,2007","10.1103/PhysRevD.76.023502",,"astro-ph gr-qc hep-ph hep-th",,"  The holographic dark energy model is proposed by Li as an attempt for probing
the nature of dark energy within the framework of quantum gravity. The main
characteristic of holographic dark energy is governed by a numerical parameter
$c$ in the model. The parameter $c$ can only be determined by observations.
Thus, in order to characterize the evolving feature of dark energy and to
predict the fate of the universe, it is of extraordinary importance to
constrain the parameter $c$ by using the currently available observational
data. In this paper, we derive constraints on the holographic dark energy model
from the latest observational data including the gold sample of 182 Type Ia
supernovae (SNIa), the shift parameter of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
given by the three-year {\it Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe} ({\it WMAP})
observations, and the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurement from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The joint analysis gives the fit results in
1-$\sigma$: $c=0.91^{+0.26}_{-0.18}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m0}=0.29\pm 0.03$. That
is to say, though the possibility of $c<1$ is more favored, the possibility of
$c>1$ can not be excluded in one-sigma error range, which is somewhat different
from the result derived from previous investigations using earlier data. So,
according to the new data, the evidence for the quintom feature in the
holographic dark energy model is not as strong as before.

show that the existence of such homomorphisms places constraints on the

variety and consequently determine a priori bounds on the number of virtual
epimorphisms between the fundamental groups of small knot manifolds with a

Small-Gain Theorem (SGT) for input/output monotone systems provides a
sufficient condition for global asymptotic stability of an equilibrium and
hence its violation is a necessary condition for the existence of periodic
solutions. One advantage of the use of the monotone SGT technique is its
robustness with respect to all perturbations that preserve monotonicity and
stability properties of a very low-dimensional (in many interesting examples,
just one-dimensional) model reduction. This robustness makes the technique
useful in the analysis of molecular biological models in which there is large
uncertainty regarding the values of kinetic and other parameters. However,
verifying the conditions needed in order to apply the SGT is not always easy.
This paper provides an approach to the verification of the needed properties,
and illustrates the approach through an application to a classical model of
