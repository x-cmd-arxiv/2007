correlation established using the XMM-Newton Hard Bright Sample between the
intrinsic absorption and the hardness ratio to the 0.5-2.0 keV and 2.0-4.5 keV

hardness ratio selection based on the 2XMM-Newton pre-release Source Catalogue
led us to the definition of candidates likely to be obscured in X-rays. X-ray
and optical spectral analysis were performed for three objects. Strong
absorption (NH > 10^{22} cm^{-2}) was detected from the X-ray analysis,
confirming the efficiency of the method used to select obscured sources. The
presence of absorption is also revealed in the optical band, although at a
significantly lower level than inferred from the X-ray band.

to be energetically dominant in the near- and mid-infrared, the power-law
galaxies comprise a significant fraction of the Spitzer-detected AGN population
at high luminosities and redshifts. The high 24 micron detection fraction also
points to a luminous population. The power-law galaxies comprise a subset of
color-selected AGN candidates. A comparison with various mid-infrared color
selection criteria demonstrates that while the color-selected samples contain a

(less than a few hundred milliseconds) from the soft gamma repeaters (SGRs)
1806-20 and 1900+14 using the HETE-2 samples. In five years from 2001 to 2005,
HETE-2 detected 50 bursts which were localized to SGR 1806-20 and 5 bursts
which were localized to SGR 1900+14. Especially SGR 1806-20 was active in 2004,
and HETE-2 localized 33 bursts in that year. The cumulative number-intensity
distribution of SGR 1806-20 in 2004 is well described by a power law model with
an index of -1.1+/-0.6. It is consistent with previous studies but burst data
taken in other years clearly give a steeper distribution. This may suggest that
more energetic bursts could occur more frequently in periods of greater
activity. A power law cumulative number-intensity distribution is also known
for earthquakes and solar flares. It may imply analogous triggering mechanisms.
Although spectral evolution during bursts with a time scale of > 20 ms is not
common in the HETE-2 sample, spectral softening due to the very rapid (< a few
milliseconds) energy reinjection and cooling may not be excluded. The spectra
of all short bursts are well reproduced by a two blackbody function (2BB) with
temperatures ~4 and ~11 keV. From the timing analysis of the SGR 1806-20 data,
a time lag of 2.2+/-0.4 ms is found between the 30-100 keV and 2-10 keV
radiation bands. This may imply (1) a very rapid spectral softening and energy
reinjection, (2) diffused (elongated) emission plasma along the magnetic field
lines in pseudo equilibrium with multi-temperatures, or (3) a separate (located
at < 700 km) emission region of softer component (say, ~4 keV) which could be
reprocessed X-rays by higher energy (> 11 keV) photons from an emission region

from eclipsing binaries and interferometry of single stars has opened more
questions about what can be causing the discrepancy between the observed radii
and the ones predicted by the models. The two main explanations being proposed
are a correlation between the radius of the stars and their activity levels or
their metallicities. This paper presents a study of such correlations using all
the data published to date. The study also investigates correlations between
the radii deviation from the models and the masses of the stars. There is no
clear correlation between activity level and radii for the single stars in the
sample. Those single stars are slow rotators with typical velocities v_rot sini
< 3.0 km s^-1. A clear correlation however exists in the case of the faster
rotating members of binaries. This result is based on the of X-ray emission
levels of the stars. There also appears to be an increase in the deviation of
the radii of single stars from the models as a function of metallicity, as
previously indicated by Berger et al. (2006). The stars in binaries do not seem
to follow the same trend. Finally, the Baraffe et al. (1998) models reproduce
well the radius observations below 0.30-0.35Msun, where the stars become fully
convective, although this result is preliminary since almost all the sample
stars in that mass range are slow rotators and metallicities have not been
measured for most of them. The results in this paper indicate that stellar
activity and metallicity play an important role on the determination of the
radius of very low-mass stars, at least above 0.35Msun.

very low mass members of UpSco. Thirteen objects in this sample show clear
excess flux at 24\mu m, explained by dust emission from a circum-sub-stellar
disk. Objects without excess emission either have no disks at all or disks with
inner opacity holes of at least ~5 AU radii. Our disk frequency of 37\pm 9% is
higher than what has been derived previously for K0-M5 stars in the same region
(on a 1.8 sigma confidence level), suggesting a mass-dependent disk lifetime in
UpSco. The clear distinction between objects with and without disks as well as
the lack of transition objects shows that disk dissipation inside 5 AU occurs
rapidly, probably on timescales of <~10^5 years. For the objects with disks,
most SEDs are uniformly flat with flux levels of a few mJy, well modeled as
emission from dusty disks affected by dust settling to the midplane, which also
provides indirect evidence for grain growth. The silicate feature around 10\mu
m is either absent or weak in our SEDs, arguing for a lack of hot, small dust
grains. Compared with younger objects in Taurus, BD disks in UpSco show less
flaring. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that we see disks in
an advanced evolutionary state: Dust settling and grain growth are ubiquituous
in circum-sub-stellar disks at ages of 5 Myr, arguing for planet forming
processes in BD disks. For almost all our targets, results from high-resolution
spectroscopy and high-spatial resolution imaging have been published before,
thus providing a large sample of BDs for which information about disks,
accretion, and binarity is available. (abridged)

the recent analysis of Willingale et al., we have assembled a sample of GRBs of

T_a as a jet angle indicator, and then estimating the collimation corrected
prompt energetics, we find a correlation between the latter quantity and the
peak energy of the prompt emission. However, this correlation has a large
dispersion, similar to the dispersion of the Amati correlation and it is not
parallel to the Ghirlanda correlation. Furthermore, we show that the
correlation itself results mainly from the dependence of the jet opening angle
on the isotropic prompt energy, with the time T_a playing no role, contrary to
what we find for the jet break time t_jet. We also find that for the bursts in
our sample T_a weakly correlates with E_iso of the prompt emission, but that
this correlation disappears when considering all bursts of known redshift and

critical rate above which bursts cease, ignition occurs preferentially at
higher latitudes. The range of accretion rates over which nonequatorial
ignition occurs is an increasing function of the neutron star spin frequency.
These findings have significant implications for thermonuclear flame
propagation, and they may explain why oscillations during the burst rise are
detected predominantly when the accretion rate is high. They also support the
suggestion of Bhattacharyya & Strohmayer that non-photospheric radius expansion
double-peaked bursts and the unusual harmonic content of oscillations during

the gamma-rays are produced via leptonic or hadronic processes, so it is
important to consider possible acceleration sites for the charged particles
which produce the gamma-rays. One exciting possibility for the origin of these
particles is the central black hole, Sgr A*, where the turbulent magnetic
fields close to the event horizon can accelerate protons to TeV energies. Using
a realistic model of the density distribution in a 6 pc x 6 pc x 6pc cube at
the Galactic center, we here calculate the trajectories followed by these TeV
protons as they gyrate through the turbulent medium surrounding Sgr A*.
Diffusing out from the black hole, the protons produce TeV gamma-rays via pi^0
decay following a collision with a proton in the surrounding medium. After
following over 222,000 such trajectories, we find that the circumnuclear ring
around Sgr A* can reproduce the observed 0.1-100 TeV HESS spectrum and flux if
the protons are injected into this medium with an effective power-law index of
0.75, significantly harder than the observed photon index of 2.25. The total
energy in the steady-state 1-40 TeV proton population surrounding Sgr A* is
inferred to be approx 5x10^{45} ergs. Only 31% of the emitted 1-100 TeV protons
encounter the circumnuclear torus, leaving a large flux of protons that diffuse

group of nearly 200 low-mass pre-main sequence stars, concentrated within ~ 1
deg of the early-B star 25 Ori, in the Orion OB1a sub-association. We refer to
this stellar aggregate as the 25 Orionis group. The group also harbors the
Herbig Ae/Be star V346 Ori and a dozen other early type stars with photometry,
parallaxes, and some with IR excess emission, consistent with group membership.
The number of high and low-mass stars is in agreement with expectations from a
standard Initial Mass Function. The velocity distribution for the young stars
in 25 Ori shows a narrow peak centered at 19.7 km/s, very close to the velocity
of the star 25 Ori. Our results provide new and compelling evidence that the 25
Ori group is a distinct kinematic entity, and that considerable space and
velocity structure is present in the Ori OB1a sub-association. The low-mass
members follow a well defined band in the color-magnitude diagram, consistent
with an isochronal age of ~ 7-10 Myr, depending on the assumed evolutionary
model. The highest density of members is located near the star 25 Ori, but the
actual extent of the cluster cannot be well constrained with our present data.
In a simple-minded kinematic evolution scenario, the 25 Ori group may represent
the evolved counterpart of a younger aggregate like the sigma Ori cluster. The
25 Ori stellar aggregate is the most populous ~ 10 Myr sample yet known within
500 pc, setting it as an excellent laboratory to study the evolution of
solar-like stars and protoplanetary disks.

members, such that some have had time to evolve more than others.
Alternatively, if the aggregate members all formed at roughly the same time,
then remarkably rapid circumstellar evolution would be required to account for
the association of Class I and Class III sources at ages <~1 Myr.
  We highlight important results for several other objects as well (full

lobes in the hot diffuse gas in galaxy groups and clusters. Cosmic rays are
assumed to be produced in a small shocked region near the cavity center, such
as at the working surface of a radio jet. The coupled equations for gasdynamics
and cosmic ray diffusion are solved with various assumptions about the
diffusion coefficient. To form large, long-lived cavities similar to those
observed, the diffusion coefficient must not exceed kappa = 10^28 cm^2/s in the
hot gas, very similar to values required in models of cosmic ray diffusion in
the Milky Way. When kappa does not exceed 10^28, cosmic rays are confined
within the cavities for times comparable to the cavity buoyancy time, as
implied by observations of X-ray cavities and their radio synchrotron emission.
Collisions of proton cosmic rays with thermal plasma nuclei followed by pion
decay can result in enhanced gamma ray emission from the cavity walls.

Therefore we use the projected two-point correlation function wp(rp) to study

microns with IRAC and for which we have spectroscopic redshifts from first
epoch VVDS. We find that in the flux limited samples at 3.6 and 4.5 microns,
the clustering length does not change from redshift ~2 to the present. In
addition, we find that the clustering lengths are systematically higher when
galaxy samples are selected from increasingly redder wavelengths. These values
are larger than the typical values found for I-band selected galaxies in the
same redshift range, but we find that the difference in clustering length
between I-band and 3.6/4.5 microns selected samples is decreasing with
increasing redshift to become comparable at z~1.5. We interpret this as
evidence that galaxies with older stellar populations and galaxies actively
forming stars reside in comparably overdense environments at epochs earlier
than z~1.5. The increasing difference in clustering length observed between
rest-frame UV-optical and infrared selected samples could then be an indication
that star formation is gradually shifting to lower density regions as cosmic

high redshifts ($z=0.5-2.0$) have very clumpy and irregular distributions of
stars. It is however unclear whether and how these clumpy galaxies evolve into
the present spiral and elliptical galaxies with regular shapes. We here propose
that spatial distributions of AGB stars, probing the different mean age and
metallicity of the underlying stellar population, can provide vital clues to
the evolution of these clumpy galaxies, in particular, those at intermediate
redshifts. In order to demonstrate this proposal to be quite promising, we show
the results of test-particle simulations on the long-term dynamical evolution
of unbound groups of AGB stars (``stellar clumps''), which correspond to the
successors of star-forming clumps at intermediate redshifts, in isolated and
interacting galaxies. We particularly show that azimuthal distributions of AGB
stars dispersed from stellar clumps as a result of gravitational interaction
with their host galaxies can be still inhomogeneous several Gyrs after stellar
clump formation for some models. We also show that the inhomogeneities in the
azimuthal distributions of dispersed AGB stars can more quickly disappear in
stellar clumps with larger sizes and higher velocity dispersions. These results
suggest that if apparently clumpy structures of galaxies at intermediate
redshifts are due to stars in unbound or weakly bound clusters, spatial
distributions of AGB stars can have fossil records on past clumpy structures of
galaxies.

sensitivity of HIPASS, these galaxies represent the most HI-rich early-type
galaxies. In two-thirds of the galaxies, we find the HI to be in a large,
regular disk- or ring-like structure that in some cases is strongly warped. In
the remaining cases we find the HI distributed in irregular tails or clouds
offset from the galaxy. The giant, regular HI structures can be up to ~200 kpc
in diameter and contain up to 10^10 M_sun of HI. The incidence of irregular HI
structures appears to be somewhat higher in elliptical galaxies, but the large,
regular structures are observed in both elliptical and S0 galaxies and are not
strictly connected to the presence of a stellar disk. If these two types of
galaxies are the result of different formation paths, this is not strongly
reflected in the characteristics of the HI. The size and the regular kinematics
of the HI structures imply that the neutral hydrogen must have settled in these
galaxies several Gyr ago. Merging as well as gas accretion from the IGM are
viable explanations for the origin of the gas in these galaxies. The average
column density of the HI is low so that little star formation is expected to
occur and these early-type galaxies can remain gas rich for very long periods
of time. The large HI structures likely represent key structures for tracing
the origin and evolution of these galaxies.

approach based on Akaike criterion as an estimator of Kullback-Leibler entropy.
In particular, we present the proper way of ranking the competing models based

quintessence, quintessence with time varying equation of state, brane-world and
generalized Chaplygin gas model and test them on Riess' Gold sample. As a
result we obtain that the best model - in terms of Akaike Criterion - is the
quintessence model. The odds suggest that although there exist differences in
the support given to specific scenarios by supernova data most of the models
considered receive similar support. One can also notice that models similar in

disk galaxies observed today. This study is based on a complete sample of 32,
0.4<z<0.75 galaxies observed with FLAMES/GIRAFFE at the VLT. Their kinematics
had been classified as rotating disks, perturbed rotators, or complex
kinematics .We have computed the specific angular momentum of disks (j_disk)
and the dynamical support of rotating disks through the V/sigma ratio. To study
how angular momentum can be acquired dynamically, we have compared the
properties of distant and local galaxies. We find that distant rotating disks
have essentially the same properties (j_disk and R_d) as local disks, while
distant galaxies with more complex kinematics have a significantly higher
scatter in the j_disk--V_max and R_d--V_max planes. On average, distant
galaxies show lower values of V/sigma than local galaxies. We found
observational evidence for a non-linear random walk evolution of the angular
momentum in galaxies during the last 8 Gyr. The evolution related to galaxies
with complex kinematics can be attributed to mergers. If galaxies observed at

ionisation-potential emission-line indicating the presence of a hard ionising
continuum from an AGN. Like most objects in our sample the rest-frame-UV
spectrum shows the UV continuum breaking across a Ly_alpha line. Uniquely
within this sample of LBGs, emission from NV is also detected, a clear
signature of AGN photo-ionisation. The object is spatially resolved in HST
imaging. This, and the comparatively high Ly_alpha/NV flux ratio indicates that
the majority of the Ly_alpha (and the UV continuum longward of it) originates
from stellar photo-ionisation, a product of the ongoing starburst in the Lyman
break galaxy. Even without the AGN emission, this object would have been
photometrically-selected and spectroscopically-confirmed as a Lyman break in
our survey. The measured optical flux (I(AB)=26.1) is therefore an upper limit
to that from the AGN and is of order 100 times fainter than the majority of
known quasars at these redshifts. The detection of a single object in our
survey volume is consistent with the best current models of high redshift AGN
luminosity function, providing a substantial fraction of such AGN are found

have lower stellar masses (10^9Msol) than their z~3 counterparts. The
difference in mass is significant even when considering the presence of an
older, underlying population in both samples. Such young and moderately massive
systems dominate the luminous z~5 LBG population (>70%), whereas they comprise
<30% of LBG samples at z~3. This result is robust under all reasonable
modelling assumptions. These intense starbursts appear to be experiencing their
first (few) generations of large-scale star formation and are accumulating
their first significant stellar mass. Their dominance in luminous LBG samples
suggests that z~5 witnesses a period of wide-spread, recent galaxy formation.
As such, z~5 LBGs are the likely progenitors of the spheroidal components of
present-day massive galaxies. This is supported by their high stellar mass
surface densities, their core phase-space densities, as well as the ages of
stars in the bulge of our Galaxy and other massive systems. Their high star
formation rates per unit area suggest that these systems host outflows or winds
that enrich the intra- and inter-galactic media with metals. Their estimated
young ages are consistent with inefficient metal-mixing on galaxy-wide scales.
Therefore these galaxies may contain a significant fraction of metal-free stars

argue that the similarity of the red elliptical and the red bulge luminosity
functions supports our previous arguments that they share a common origin and
surprisingly find that the same follows for the blue ellipticals and blue
bulges, the latter of which we refer to as pseudo-bulges. In terms of the
stellar mass budget we find that $58\pm6$ per cent is currently in the form of
discs, 39+/-6 per cent in the form of red spheroids (13+/-4 per cent
ellipticals, 26+/-4 per cent bulges) and the remainder is in the form of blue
spheroidal systems (~1.5 per cent blue ellipticals and ~1.5 per cent
pseudo-bulges). In terms of galaxy formation we argue that our data on galaxy
components strongly supports the notion of a two-stage formation process
(spheroid first, disc later) but with the additional complexity of secular
evolution occurring in quiescent discs giving rise to two distinct bulge types:
genuine 'classical' bulges and pseudo-bulges. We therefore advocate that there
are three significant structures underpinning galaxy evolution: classical
spheroids (old); pseudo-bulges (young) and discs (intermediate). The luminous
nearby galaxy population is a mixture of these three structural types.

surface brightness, colour, ellipticity, position angle and deviations of
axisymmetry for all galaxies, as well as isophotal and effective radii and
total magnitudes. We have decomposed the images into contributions from a
spheroidal bulge and a flat disk, using an interactive, 2D decomposition
technique.
  We study in detail the relations between various bulge and disk parameters.
In particular, we find that the bulges of our galaxies have surface brightness
profiles ranging from exponential to De Vaucouleurs, with the average value of
the Sersic shape parameter n being 2.5. In agreement with previous studies, we
find that the shape of the bulge intensity distribution depends on luminosity,
with the more luminous bulges having more centrally peaked light profiles. By
comparing the ellipticity of the isophotes in the bulges to those in the outer,
disk dominated regions, we are able to derive the intrinsic axis ratio q_b of
the bulges. The average axis ratio is 0.55, with an rms spread of 0.12. None of
the bulges in our sample is spherical, whereas in some cases, the bulges can be
as flat as q_b = 0.3 - 0.4. The bulge flattening seems to be weakly coupled to
luminosity, more luminous bulges being on average slightly more flattened than
their lower-luminosity counterparts. Our finding that most bulges are
significantly flattened and have an intensity profile shallower than R^{1/4}
suggests that `pseudobulges', formed from disk material by secular processes,
do not only occur in late-type spiral galaxies, but are a common feature in
early-type disk galaxies as well. (abridged)

Rotation velocities are measured from a combination of HI velocity fields and
long-slit optical emission line spectra along the major axis. We find that the
rotation curves generally rise rapidly in the central regions and often reach
rotation velocities of 200 - 300 km/s within a few hundred parsecs of the
centre. The detailed shape of the central rotation curves shows a clear
dependence on the concentration of the stellar light distribution and the
bulge-to-disk luminosity ratio: galaxies with highly concentrated stellar light
distributions reach the maximum in their rotation curves at relatively smaller
radii than galaxies with small bulges and a relatively diffuse light
distribution. We interpret this as a strong indication that the dynamics in the
central regions are dominated by the stellar mass.
  At intermediate radii, many rotation curves decline. The strength of the
decline is correlated with the total luminosity of the galaxies, more luminous
galaxies having on average more strongly declining rotation curves. At large
radii, however, all declining rotation curves flatten out, indicating that
substantial amounts of dark matter must be present in these galaxies too.
  A comparison of our rotation curves with the Universal Rotation Curve from
Persic et al. (1996) reveals large discrepancies between the observed and
predicted rotation curves; we argue that rotation curves form a multi-parameter
family which is too complex to describe with a simple formula depending on
total luminosity only. (abridged)

simulations have yielded essential insights into how stars form. They show that
star formation is a highly nonuniform runaway process characterized by the
emergence of nearly singular peaks in density, followed by the accretional
growth of embryo stars that form at these density peaks. Circumstellar disks
often form from the gas being accreted by the forming stars, and accretion from
these disks may be episodic, driven by gravitational instabilities or by
protostellar interactions. Star-forming clouds typically develop filamentary
structures, which may, along with the thermal physics, play an important role
in the origin of stellar masses because of the sensitivity of filament
fragmentation to temperature variations. Simulations of the formation of star
clusters show that the most massive stars form by continuing accretion in the
dense cluster cores, and this again is a runaway process that couples star
formation and cluster formation. Star-forming clouds also tend to develop
hierarchical structures, and smaller groups of forming objects tend to merge
into progressively larger ones, a generic feature of self-gravitating systems
that is common to star formation and galaxy formation. Because of the large
range of scales and the complex dynamics involved, analytic models cannot
adequately describe many processes of star formation, and detailed numerical
simulations are needed to advance our understanding of the subject.

the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ indicate that the

strong: tau_v is typically only an order of magnitude greater than the

manner. The requests are of two types: an insertion request requires to
allocate a complete subtree of a given height, and a deletion request frees a
given allocated subtree. In order to serve an insertion request it might be
necessary to move some already allocated subtrees to other locations in order
to free a large enough subtree. We are interested in the worst case average
number of such reallocations needed to serve a request.
  It was proved in previous work that the competitive ratio of the optimal
online algorithm solving this problem is between 1.5 and O(n). We partially
answer the question about its exact value by giving an O(1)-competitive online

analyzed for the number of reallocations needed to serve a request in the worst
case. In this setting, our result is a corresponding amortized analysis.

that violates the latter, and in this work, the stress energy tensor confined
on the brane, threading the wormhole, is imposed to satisfy the NEC. It is also
shown that in addition to the local high-energy bulk effects, nonlocal
corrections from the Weyl curvature in the bulk may induce a NEC violating
signature on the brane. Thus, braneworld gravity seems to provide a natural
scenario for the existence of traversable wormholes.

phases) in dense two-flavor quark matter. These phases yield an example of
dynamics in which the Higgs mechanism is provided by condensates of gauge (or
gauge plus scalar) fields. Because vacuum expectation values of spatial
components of vector fields break the rotational symmetry, it is naturally to
have a spontaneous breakdown both of external and internal symmetries in this
case. In particular, by using the Ginzburg-Landau approach, we establish the
existence of a gluonic phase with both the rotational symmetry and the
electromagnetic U(1) being spontaneously broken. In other words, this phase
describes an anisotropic medium in which the color and electric
superconductivities coexist. It is shown that this phase corresponds to a
minimum of the Ginzburg-Landau potential and, unlike the two-flavor
superconducting (2SC) phase, it does not suffer from the chromomagnetic
instability. The dual (confinement) description of its dynamics is developed
and it is shown that there are light exotic vector hadrons in the spectrum,
some of which condense. Because most of the initial symmetries in this system
are spontaneously broken, its dynamics is very rich.

multiple stages of old inflation with large cosmological constant ending by
tunnelling. Old inflation has a well known graceful exit problem as the
observable universe becomes empty, devoid of any entropy. Simultaneously, in
the quest for reheating the right degrees of freedom, it is important that the
final stage of inflation reheat Standard Model sector. It is known that
inflation can occur naturally along a flat direction of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), solving the reheating problem, but the
initial conditions require a large degree of fine-tuning. In this paper, we
study how inflation of a MSSM flat direction can be embedded into the string
theory landscape to solve both the graceful exit problem of old inflation and
the fine-tuning problem of MSSM inflation, elaborating on ideas of Bousso and
Polchinski. The fluctuations of the MSSM flat direction during old inflation
create regions with initial conditions favorable for eternal inflation, which
also allows the cosmological constant to continue to relax. This final phase of
inflation also provides all the usual benefits of MSSM inflation, including
straightforward reheating into Standard Model degrees of freedom.

  percolation model","29 pages and 5 figures",,,,"math.PR",,"  We consider the first passage percolation model on the square lattice. In
this model, $\{t(e): e{an edge of}{\bf Z}^2 \}$ is an independent identically
distributed family with a common distribution $F$. We denote by $T({\bf 0}, v)$
the passage time from the origin to $v$ for $v\in {\bf R}^2$ and $B(t)=\{v\in
{\bf R}^d: T({\bf 0}, v)\leq t\}.$ It is well known that if $F(0) < p_c$, there
exists a compact shape ${\bf B}_F\subset {\bf R}^2$ such that for all $\epsilon
>0$, $t {\bf B}_F(1-\epsilon) \subset {B(t)} \subset t{\bf B}_F(1+\epsilon)$,
eventually with a probability 1. For each shape boundary point $u$, we denote
its right- and left-curvature exponents by $\kappa^+(u)$ and $\kappa^-(u)$. In
addition, for each vector $u$, we denote the transversal fluctuation exponent
by $\xi(u)$. In this paper, we can show that $\xi(u) \leq
1-\max\{\kappa^-(u)/2, \kappa^+(u)/2\}$ for all shape boundary points $u$.
  To pursue a curvature on ${\bf B}_F$, we consider passage times with a
special distribution infsupp$(F)=l$ and $F(l)=p > \vec{p}_c$, where $l$ is a
positive number and $\vec{p}_c$ is a critical point for the oriented
percolation model. With this distribution, it is known that there is a flat
segment on the shape boundary between angles $0< \theta_p^- < \theta_p^+<
90^\circ$. In this paper, we show that the shape are strictly convex at the
directions $\theta_p^\pm$. Moreover, we also show that for all $r>0$, $\xi((r,
\theta^\pm_p)) = 0.5$ and $\xi((r, \theta)) =1$ for all $\theta_p^- <\theta<
\theta_p^+$ and $r>0$.

that every group matrix may be written as a block circulant matrix and that
this result leads to partial diagonalization of group matrices, which are
present in modern applied mathematics. We also discuss right division in loops
with the antiautomorphic inverse property.

irreducible and its fundamental group satisfies appropriate subgroup
separability conditions. This statement includes 3-manifolds with vanishing
Thurston norm, graph manifolds and 3-manifolds with surface subgroup
separability (a condition satisfied conjecturally by all hyperbolic
3-manifolds). Our result covers, in particular, the case of 0-framed surgeries

Alexander polynomials decide fiberability for all the 3-manifolds listed above.
As a corollary, it follows that twisted Alexander polynomials decide if a knot

$G$-admissible if $G$ lifts along $\p$. Denote by $\tG$ the lifted group, and
let $\CT(\p)$ be the group of covering transformations. The projection is
called $G$-split whenever the extension $\CT(\p) \to \tG \to G$ splits. In this
paper, split 2-covers are considered. Supposing that $G$ is transitive on $X$,
a $G$-split cover is said to be $G$-split-transitive if all complements $\bG
\cong G$ of $\CT(\p)$ within $\tG$ are transitive on $\tX$; it is said to be
$G$-split-sectional whenever for each complement $\bG$ there exists a
$\bG$-invariant section of $\p$; and it is called $G$-split-mixed otherwise.
  It is shown, when $G$ is an arc-transitive group, split-sectional and
split-mixed 2-covers lead to canonical double covers. For cubic symmetric
graphs split 2-cover are necessarily cannonical double covers when $G$ is 1- or
4-regular. In all other cases, that is, if $G$ is $s$-regular, $s=2,3$ or 5, a
necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a transitive complement
$\bG$ is given, and an infinite family of split-transitive 2-covers based on
the alternating groups of the form $A_{12k+10}$ is constructed.
  Finally, chains of consecutive 2-covers, along which an arc-transitive group
$G$ has successive lifts, are also considered. It is proved that in such a
chain, at most two projections can be split. Further, it is shown that, in the
context of cubic symmetric graphs, if exactly two of them are split, then one
is split-transitive and the other one is either split-sectional or split-mixed.

by a fixed Markov process $M$ on a Riemannian manifold $X$. The main problem
arising here is a possible collapse of the system, in the sense that, though
the initial configuration of particles is locally finite, there could exist a
compact set in $X$ such that, with probability one, infinitely many particles
will arrive at this set at some time $t>0$. We assume that $X$ has infinite
volume and, for each $\alpha\ge1$, we consider the set $\Theta_\alpha$ of all
infinite configurations in $X$ for which the number of particles in a compact
set is bounded by a constant times the $\alpha$-th power of the volume of the

the corresponding infinite particle process can start at each configuration
from $\Theta_\alpha$, will never leave $\Theta_\alpha$, and has cadlag (or,
even, continuous) sample paths in the vague topology. We consider the following
examples of applications of our results: Brownian motion on the configuration
space, free Glauber dynamics on the configuration space (or a birth-and-death
process in $X$), and free Kawasaki dynamics on the configuration space. We also
show that if $X=\mathbb R^d$, then for a wide class of starting distributions,

path? In the case $p=1/2$ (the critical value for nontriviality), it is shown
to take $\Theta(\epsilon^{-1}n)$ steps. In the case $p<1/2$, the number of
steps is shown to be at least $n\cdot\exp(\operatorname
{const}\epsilon^{-1/2})$. This last result matches the known upper bound from

whose electron distribution is given by two Maxwellians at slightly different
temperatures. To obtain the growth rate it is necessary to evaluate non-trivial
integrals whose number is kept to minimum by using recursion relations. It is
shown that a key instance of one such relation cannot be used for classes of
solution whose minimum value is zero, and an additional integral must be
evaluated explicitly instead. The SKdVZK equation contains two nonlinear terms
whose ratio $b$ increases as the electron distribution becomes increasingly
flat-topped. As $b$ and hence the deviation from electron isothermality
increases, it is found that for cnoidal wave solutions that travel faster than
long-wavelength linear waves, there is a more pronounced variation of the
growth rate with the angle $\theta$ at which the perturbation is applied.
Solutions whose minimum value is zero and travel slower than long-wavelength

perturbations and have a relatively narrow range of $\theta$ for which the

nodes of higher degree (hubs) are better connected among themselves than are
nodes with smaller degree. The presence of the rich-club phenomenon may be an
indicator of several interesting high-level network properties, such as
tolerance to hub failures. Here we investigate the existence of the rich-club
phenomenon across the hierarchical degrees of a number of real-world networks.
Our simulations reveal that the phenomenon may appear in some hierarchies but
not in others and, moreover, that it may appear and disappear as we move across
hierarchies. This reveals the interesting possibility of non-monotonic behavior
of the phenomenon; the possible implications of our findings are discussed.

This calibration procedure works also when a pre-modulation on the primary

multiplications. It is obvious that with current computers there is no way
beyond about ten spins, and the calculation complexity scales exponentially
with the spin system size.
  We demonstrate that a polynomially scaling algorithm can be obtained if the
state space is reduced by neglecting unimportant or unpopulated spin states.
The class of such states is surprisingly wide. In particular, there are
indications that very high multi-spin orders can be dropped completely, as can
all the orders linking the spins that are remote on the interaction graph.
  The computational cost of the propagation step for a ktuples-restricted
densely connected n-spin system with k<<n is O(n^2k). In cases of favourable
interaction topologies (narrow graphs, e.g. in protein NMR) the asymptotic
scaling is linear.

  oligomer formation: A discrete molecular dynamics study","Accepted for publication at Biophysical Journal",,"10.1529/biophysj.106.097766",,"q-bio.BM",,"  Pathological folding and oligomer formation of the amyloid beta-protein
(Abeta) are widely perceived as central to Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Experimental approaches to study Abeta self-assembly are problematic, because
most relevant aggregates are quasi-stable and inhomogeneous. We apply a
discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) approach combined with a four-bead protein
model to study oligomer formation of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta). We
address the differences between the two most common Abeta alloforms, Abeta40
and Abeta42, which oligomerize differently in vitro. We study how the presence
of electrostatic interactions (EIs) between pairs of charged amino acids
affects Abeta40 and Abeta42 oligomer formation. Our results indicate that EIs
promote formation of larger oligomers in both Abeta40 and Abeta42. The Abeta40
size distribution remains unimodal, whereas the Abeta42 distribution is
trimodal, as observed experimentally. Abeta42 folded structure is characterized
by a turn in the C-terminus that is not present in Abeta40. We show that the
same C-terminal region is also responsible for the strongest intermolecular
contacts in Abeta42 pentamers and larger oligomers. Our results suggest that
this C-terminal region plays a key role in the formation of Abeta42 oligomers
and the relative importance of this region increases in the presence of EIs.
These results suggest that inhibitors targeting the C-terminal region of
Abeta42 oligomers may be able to prevent oligomer formation or structurally
modify the assemblies to reduce their toxicity.

sensitivity analysis of different levels of infectiousness of the virus and
initial outbreak conditions (both geographical and seasonal). For each
spreading scenario we provided the timeline and the geographical impact of the
pandemic in 3,100 urban areas, located in 220 different countries. We compared
the baseline cases with different containment strategies, including travel
restrictions and the therapeutic use of antiviral (AV) drugs. We show that the
inclusion of air transportation is crucial in the assessment of the occurrence
probability of global outbreaks. The large-scale therapeutic usage of AV drugs
in all hit countries would be able to mitigate a pandemic effect with a
reproductive rate as high as 1.9 during the first year; with AV supply use
sufficient to treat approximately 2% to 6% of the population, in conjunction
with efficient case detection and timely drug distribution. For highly
contagious viruses (i.e., a reproductive rate as high as 2.3), even the
unrealistic use of supplies corresponding to the treatment of approximately 20%
of the population leaves 30%-50% of the population infected. In the case of
limited AV supplies and pandemics with a reproductive rate as high as 1.9, we
demonstrate that the more cooperative the strategy, the more effective are the
containment results in all regions of the world, including those countries that
made part of their resources available for global use.

modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters, and
assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model development.
Directly measuring \emph{in vivo} biochemical parameters is difficult, and
collectively fitting them to other data often yields large parameter
uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier work we showed in a
growth-factor-signaling model that collective fitting could yield
well-constrained predictions, even when it left individual parameters very
poorly constrained. We also showed that the model had a `sloppy' spectrum of
parameter sensitivities, with eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many
decades. Here we use a collection of models from the literature to test whether
such sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find that
every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities. We also test
several consequences of this sloppiness for building predictive models. In
particular, sloppiness suggests that collective fits to even large amounts of
ideal time-series data will often leave many parameters poorly constrained.
Tests over our model collection are consistent with this suggestion. This
difficulty with collective fits may seem to argue for direct parameter
measurements, but sloppiness also implies that such measurements must be
formidably precise and complete to usefully constrain many model predictions.
We confirm this implication in our signaling model. Our results suggest that
sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in systems biology models. The
prevalence of sloppiness highlights the power of collective fits and suggests
that modelers should focus on predictions rather than on parameters.

status of leatherback turtles shows that their survival predominantly depends
on our ability to reduce at-sea mortality. Although areas where leatherbacks
meet fisheries have been identified during the long distance movements between
two consecutive nesting seasons, hotspots of lethal interactions are still
poorly defined within the nesting season, when individuals concentrate close to
land. Here we report movements of satellite-tracked gravid leatherback turtles
during the nesting season in Western Central Africa, South America and
Caribbean Sea, accounting for about 70% of the world population. We show that
during, and at the end of, the nesting season leatherback turtles have the
propensity to remain over the continental shelf, yet sometimes perform extended
movements and may even nest in neighbouring countries. Leatherbacks exploit
coastal commercial fishing grounds and face substantial accidental capture by
regional coastal fisheries (e.g. at least 10% in French Guiana). This
emphasises the need for regional conservation strategies to be developed at the
ocean scale, both at sea and on land, to ensure the survival of the last
leatherback turtles.
