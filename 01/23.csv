  Showers from Ground Array Measurements","10 pages",,,,"astro-ph",,"  A photon induced shower at $E_{prim}\ge 10^{18}$ eV exhibits very specific
features and is different from a hadronic one. At such energies, the LPM effect
delays in average the first interactions of the photon in the atmosphere and
hence slows down the whole shower development. They also have a smaller muonic
content than hadronic ones. The response of a surface detector such as that of
the Auger Observatory to these specific showers is thus different and has to be
accounted for in order to enable potential photon candidates reconstruction
correctly. The energy reconstruction in particular has to be adapted to the
late development of photon showers. We propose in this article a method for the
reconstruction of the energy of photon showers with a surface detector. The key
feature of this method is to rely explicitly on the development stage of the
shower. This approach leads to very satisfactory results ($\simeq 20%$). At
even higher energies ($5.10^{19}$ eV and above) the probability for the photon
to convert into a pair of e$^+$e$^-$ in the geomagnetic field becomes non
negligible and requires a different function to evaluate the energy with the
proposed method. We propose several approaches to deal with this issue in the
scope of the establishment of an upper bound on the photon fraction in UHECR.

5% and preferentially in the radial direction. We theoretically review the
problem of deceleration of the beam originating in the coronal reconnection
site due to its interaction with the chromospheric plasma, and describe the

NLTE radiation transfer problem for the particular semiempirical chromosphere
models for both intensity and linear polarization components of the radiation
field. Results. In contrast to recent calculations, our results show that the
energy distribution of the proton beam at H$\alpha$ formation levels and
depolarizing collisions by background electrons and protons cause a significant
reduction of the effect below 0.1%. The radiation transfer solution shows that
tangential resonance-scattering polarization dominates over the impact
polarization effect in all considered models. Conclusions. In the models
studied, proton beams are unlikely to be a satisfying explanation for the
observed linear polarization of the H$\alpha$ line.

  ""Challenges in Particle Astrophysics"", Hanoi (Vietnam) August 6-12 2006",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Extragalactic cosmic ray protons with an injection spectrum of the type
$E^{-2.7}$ show a spectrum on earth with a dip due to the Bethe-Heitler pair
production against the photons of the cosmic microwave background. The dip is
produced in the energy region $10^{18} - 4\times 10^{19}$ eV with position and
shape that reproduce with high accuracy the spectrum observed experimentally.
This interpretation of the observed data predicts the existence of an energy
scale that signals a possible transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic
rays. In fact, at energies lower than a characteristic value $E_c\approx
1\times 10^{18}$ eV, determined by the equality between the rate of energy
losses due to pair production and adiabatic losses, the spectrum of cosmic rays
flattens in all cases of interest. In this model, the transition from galactic
to extragalactic cosmic rays occurs at some energy below $E_c$, corresponding
to the position of the so-called second knee. Another viable explanation of the
observed data is based on a completely different approach assuming a mixed
composition with protons and nuclei at energies $E\ge 10^{19}$ eV. This
scenario implies a transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays at the
ankle energies ($\sim 10^{19}$ eV). In the present paper we will review the
main features of the dip model comparing it with the model of transition at the
ankle.

most plausibly extra-planar, although it could instead come from large galactic

the north-west of the disk. A fraction <~35% of the total soft X-ray emission
of the galaxy arises from projected heights |z| > 2 kpc. Within the optical

soft X-ray/H-alpha correlation, and X-ray to far-IR flux ratio of NGC 6810 are

of X-ray binary emission from the old and young stellar populations. The X-ray

IR and radio properties of NGC 6810 are all consistent with a starburst galaxy,

the sonic boom cone, the frequency is infinite, much like a GRB. Inside the

appears at two places at the same time, mimicking the double-lobed radio

therefore forbidden, it is tempting to work out the details and compare them
with existing data. This temptation is further enhanced by the observed
superluminality in the celestial objects associated with radio sources and some

observed frequencies from a hypothetical luminal boom and show remarkable

energy to power the H2 radiation, only the stellar EUV radiation shortward of
912 Angstrom does. Advection of material from the cold regions of the knots
produces an extensive zone where both atomic and molecular hydrogen are found,
allowing the H2 to directly be heated by Lyman continuum radiation, thus
providing a mechanism that can explain the excitation temperature and surface
brightness of the cusps and tails. New images of the knot 378-801 reveal that
the 2.12 micron cusp and tail lie immediately inside the ionized atomic gas
zone. This firmly establishes that the ""tail"" structure is an ionization
bounded radiation shadow behind the optically thick core of the knot. A unique
new image in the HeII 4686 Angstrom line fails to show any emission from knots

that our sBzKs reside in haloes with a typical mass of 2.8 x 10^{11} Msun.
Combining this halo mass estimate with those for brighter samples of Kong et

brightness, a measure of the stellar mass. Comparison with other galaxy
populations suggests that faint sBzKs (K(AB)<23.2) and Lyman Break Galaxies at
z ~ 2 are similar populations hosted by relatively low-mass haloes, while
bright sBzKs (K(AB)<21) reside in haloes comparable to or more massive than
those of Distant Red Galaxies and Extremely Red Objects. Using the extended

hosting sBzKs span a wide mass range depending on K brightness, from lower than

standard disc only if a Compton-thick AGN is present. Two extended sources
detected by Chandra close to the nucleus could be due to several unresolved

proposed recently by the Arizona group is an interesting new possibility.
Aiming to understand the elementary processes involved in the mechanism, we
have calculated the eigen frequencies and eigen functions for the g-mode
oscillations of a non-rotating proto neutron star. The possible excitation of
these modes by the standing accretion shock instability, or SASI, is discussed
based on these eigen functions. We have formulated the forced oscillations of
$g$-modes by the external pressure perturbations exerted on the proto neutron
star surface. The driving pressure fluctuations have been adopted from our
previous computations of the axisymmetric SASI in the non-linear regime. We
have paid particular attention to low l modes, since these are the modes that
are dominant in SASI and that the Arizona group claimed played an important
role in their acoustic revival scenario. Here l is the index of the spherical
harmonic functions, $Y_l^m$. Although the frequency spectrum of the non-linear
SASI is broadened substantially by non-linear couplings, the typical frequency
is still much smaller than those of g-modes, the fact leading to a severe
impedance mismatch. As a result, the excitations of various $g$-modes are
rather inefficient and the energy of the saturated g-modes is $\sim 10^{50}$erg
or smaller, with the g_2-mode being the largest in our model. Here the g_2-mode
has two radial nodes and is confined to the interior of the convection region.
The energy transfer rate from the g-modes to out-going sound waves is estimated
from the growth of the g-modes and found to be $\sim 10^{51}$erg/s in the model
studied in this paper.

spin much more slowly than expected. The first idea put forward was that
massive stellar winds may remove substantial angular momentum. Since then, it
has become clear that the magnetic interaction between the stars and their

locking scenario, which assumes the magnetic star-disk interaction also solves
the stellar spin problem, has received the most attention in the literature to
date. However, recent considerations suggest that the torques in the star-disk
interaction are insufficient for disk locking to explain the slow rotators.
This prompts us to revisit stellar winds, and we conclude that stellar winds,
working in conjunction with magnetospheric accretion, are a promising candidate
for solving the angular momentum problem. We suggest future directions for both
observations and theory, to help shed light on this issue.

spectrum. It is the first of such objects with a full 5 to 35 micron spectrum
taken with the IRS and it shows strong 10 and 20 micron silicate features with
high feature to continuum ratios and clear crystalline features out to 33
micron. The dust in the disk upper layer has a crystalline silicate grain
fraction between 15% and 33%, depending on the assumed dust continuum. The
availability of the full Spitzer infrared spectrum allows an analysis of the
dust composition as a function of temperature and position in the disk. The hot
(~ 300 K) dust responsible for the 10 micron feature consists of a roughly
equal mix of small (~ 0.1 micron) and large (~ 1.5 micron) grains, whereas the
cold (~ 70 K) dust responsible for the longer wavelength silicate features
contains primarily large grains (> 1 micron). Since the cold dust emission
arises from deeper layers in the inner (< 3 AU) disk as well as from the
surface layers of the outer (3-5 AU) disk, this provides direct evidence for
combined grain growth and settling in the disk. The inferred crystalline mass
fractions in the two components are comparable. Since only the inner 0.02 AU of
the disk is warm enough to anneal the amorphous silicate grains, even the
lowest fraction of 15% of crystalline material requires either very efficient
mixing or other formation mechanisms.

existing experimental data of manganese oxides (manganites), where Mn^{3+} and

nonextensive density matrices of composed systems. By imposing that
thermodynamic quantities, such as the magnetization of sublattices A and B,
must be invariant weather the calculation is taken over the total Hilbert space

sublattices magnetization M_A and M_B, internal energy, U_A and U_B, and
magnetic specific heat, CA and CB. It is shown that only with the modified

magnetization are additive, but no clear relationship was found between S_A,
S_B and the total entropy S_{A+B} for q \neq 1. It is shown that the reason for

of cold bosonic atoms to optical fields. The present scheme is an extension to
interacting bosonic system of the recent work \cite{liu,zhu} on optically
induced spin hall effect in non-interacting atomic system. The system has two
different types of ground states. The 1st type of ground state is a 1/3-factor
Laughlin function, and has the property of chiral - anti-chiral interchange
antisymmetry, while the 2nd type is shown to be a 1/4-factor wave function with
chiral - anti-chiral symmetry. The fractional statistics corresponding to the
fractional spin Hall states are studied in detail, and are discovered to be
different from that corresponding to the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states.
Therefore the present FSHE can be distinguished from FQH regime in the
measurement.

basis of a Fokker-Planck approach for two-dimensional single-vortex dynamics in
a washboard pinning potential in the presence of point-like disorder. Graphical
analysis of the resistive responses is presented both in the current-angle
coordinates and in the rotating current scheme. The model describes nonlinear
anisotropy effects caused by the competition of point-like (isotropic) and
anisotropic pinning. Nonlinear guiding effects are discussed and the critical
current anisotropy is analyzed. Gradually increasing the magnitude of isotropic
pinning force this theory predicts a gradual decrease of the anisotropy of the
magnetoresistivities. The physics of transition from the new scaling relations
for anisotropic Hall resistance in the absence of point-like pins to the
well-known scaling relations for the point-like disorder is elucidated. This is
discussed in terms of a gradual isotropizaton of the guided vortex motion,
which is responsible for the existence in a washboard pinning potential of new
(with respect to magnetic field reversal) Hall voltages. It is shown that
whereas the Hall conductivity is not changed by pinning, the Hall resistivity
can change its sign in some current-angle range due to presence of the
competition between i- and a-pins.

demonstrate how to generate high-fidelity controlled-not by direct application

  It is found that in order to achieve 100% fidelity in a system with
capacitive coupling of strength g one Rabi term suffices. We give the exact
values of the physical parameters needed to implement such CNOT. The gate time
and all possible Rabi frequencies are found to be t=pi/(2g) and Omega_1/g =
sqrt(64n^2-1), n=1,2,3,... .
  Generation of a perfect CNOT in a system with inductive coupling,
characterized by additional constant k, requires the presence of both Rabi
terms. The gate time is again t = pi/(2g), but now there is an infinite number
of solutions, each of which is valid in a certain range of k and is
characterized by a pair of positive integers (n,m). We distinguish two cases,
depending on the sign of the coupling constant:
  (1) the antiferromagnetic case (k>=0);
  (2) the ferromagnetic case (k<=0).
  The paper concludes with consideration of fidelity degradation by switching
to resonance. Simulation of time-evolution based on the 4th order Magnus
expansion reveals characteristics of the gate similar to those found in the
exact case, with slightly shorter gate time and shifted values of Rabi

specified by a set of abstraction predicates. For each explored transition the
method checks, with the help of a theorem prover, whether there is any loss of

decide termination or to refine the abstraction by generating new abstraction
predicates. If the (possibly infinite) concrete system under analysis has a
finite bisimulation quotient, then the method is guaranteed to eventually
explore an equivalent finite bisimilar structure. We illustrate the application

conditional obligations of an adversary, by fixing a work function, and gives a
distribution for the algorithm. When a knowledge state algorithm receives a
request, it then calculates one or more ""subsequent"" knowledge states, together
with a probability of transition to each. The algorithm then uses randomization
to select one of those subsequents to be the new knowledge state. We apply the

boxes of increasing resolution near the center of the grid. In the case of
binaries, the highest resolution boxes are placed around each black hole and
they track them in their orbits until the final merger when a single set of
levels surrounds the black hole remnant. This is particularly useful when
simulating spinning black holes since the gravitational fields gradients are
larger. We present simulations of binaries with equal mass black holes with

the accelerator based result, from the Los Alamos LSND experiment, has yet to
be fully vetted. The MiniBooNE experiment, located at Fermi National

final stages of performing a blind oscillation search ($\nu_{\mu} \to \nu_e$)
using neutrino data collected through November, 2005. A blind analysis is one
in which you may analyze some of the information in all of the data, all of the

compare two new theoretical approaches to the $D$- and $B$-meson quenching. In
the first model, radiative energy loss, collisional energy loss and heavy
quark-resonance interactions are combined to evaluate the drag and diffusion
coefficients in the quark-gluon plasma and the mixed phase. These are applied
in a relativistic Fokker-Planck equation to simulate the heavy $c$- and

the fragmentation probability for heavy quarks and the medium-induced decay
probability for heavy hadrons are derived. These are implemented in a set of
coupled rate equations that describe the attenuation of the observable spectra
from the collisional dissociation of heavy mesons in the QGP. An improved

light charged Higgs ($H^\pm$) with a mass $\gts 130$ GeV, lighter than the top
quark, at the LHC. A charged Higgs in this mass range is still allowed in
next-to-minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) at low $\tan \beta$ as
well as in CP-violating (\cp) Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) for
a certain choice of \cp parameters, still respecting all the LEP-II bounds. In
both the cases, the $H^\pm$ has a large branching ratio in the $W^\pm \phi$
channel, where $\phi$ denotes a generic Higgs which is dominantly pseudoscalar
and hence may be substantially lighter than the LEP-II mass bound. This $\phi$
decays dominantly into a $b \bar b$ pair. Thus production of $H^\pm$ in the top
decay gives a striking $t \bar t$ signal at the LHC, where one of the top
quarks decays into the $bb \bar b W$ channel, via $t \to b H^\pm, H^\pm \to
\phi$ and $\phi \to b \bar b$. The characteristic correlation between the $b
\bar b$, $b \bar b W$ and $b b \bar b W$ invariant mass peaks helps reduce the
Standard Model (SM) background very effectively. For these low values of $\tan
\beta$ the $H^\pm \to \tau \nu_\tau $ channel does not provide any reach for
the $H^\pm$. Thus this is a signal for both a light charged $H^\pm$ and a light
$\phi$, which is mostly pseudoscalar in nature and decays dominantly into a $b

One of these models, called R224, is new and the others are Pacanowski and
Philander's model (R213 model) and Gent's model (R23 model). The numerical
implementation is based on a non-conservative numerical scheme. The following
(three criteria) are used to compare the models: the surface current intensity,
the pycnocline's form and the mixed layer depth. We initialize the code with
realistic velocity and density profiles thanks the TOGA-TAO array (McPhaden,
1995). In case of static instability zone on the initial density profile, only
the R224 model gives realistic results. Afterwards, we study a mixed layer
induced by the wind stress. In this case, the R224 results and the Pacanowski
and Philander's results are similar. Furthermore, we simulate a long time case.
We obtain a linear solution for all models that is in agreement with Bennis and
al.

The external and internal polygons are of the same type, and they are mutually
as well as self-avoiding. Based on an assumption about the limiting area
distribution for unpunctured polygons, we rigorously analyse the effect of a
finite number of punctures on the limiting area distribution in a uniform
ensemble, where punctured polygons with equal perimeter have the same
probability of occurrence. Our analysis leads to conjectures about the scaling
behaviour of the models.
  We also analyse exact enumeration data. For staircase polygons with punctures
of fixed size, this yields explicit expressions for the generating functions of
the first few area moments. For staircase polygons with punctures of arbitrary
size, a careful numerical analysis yields very accurate estimates for the area
moments. Interestingly, we find that the leading correction term for each area
moment is proportional to the corresponding area moment with one less puncture.
We finally analyse corresponding quantities for punctured self-avoiding
polygons and find agreement with the conjectured formulas to at least 3-4

Littlewood. We show that the multiplicities appearing in the decomposition of
the k-th graded component of S(g) do not depend on the rank n of g providing n
is sufficiently large. Thanks to a classical result by Kostant, we establish a
similar result for the k-th graded component of the space H(g) of G-harmonic
polynomials. These stabilization properties are equivalent to the existence of
a limit in infinitely many variables for the graded characters associated to
S(g) and H(g). The limits so obtained are formal series with coefficients in
the ring of universal characters introduced by Koike and Terada.
  From Hesselink expression of the graded character of harmonics, the
coefficient of degree k in the Lusztig q-analogue associated to the partition
lambda and the weight 0 thus stablizes for n sufficiently large. By using
Morris-type recurrence formulas, we prove that this is also true for the
polynomials $K_{\lambda ,\mu}^{g}(q)$ where mu is a nonempty fixed partition.
This can be reformulated in terms of a stability property for the dimension of
the components of the Brylinski-Kostant filtration. We also associate to each
pair of partitions (lambda, mu) formal series $K_{\lambda ,\mu}^{so}(q)$ and
$K_{\lambda ,\mu}^{sp}(q)$, which can be regarded as natural limit of the
Lusztig q-analogues. One gives a duality property for these limits and obtains
simple expressions when lambda is a row or a column partition.

driver, both based on a push-pull configuration with high-speed transistors,
are separated, allowing for a protection of the control electronics. Moreover,
the coil current can be set by an analog voltage, a feature that makes possible
both fast and adiabatic switching of the quadrupole magnetic field. In order to
compensate magnetic field transients induced by eddy currents, the driver
allows a quick reversal of the quadrupole coil current providing in such a way
the required magnetic flux compensation. From a fit to the measured magnetic
field transients, we have extracted the decay constants which confirm the
efficiency of the compensation. Furthermore, we measured the influence of eddy
currents on a sample of cold caesium atoms, testing at the same time the
ultimate performance of the driver for our applications. The results show that
the implemented electronic circuit is able to reduce substantially the
transient effects with switching times of the magnetic field below 100

introduce the notion of dynamic proximity networks which takes into account the

a unified treatment of epidemic types that are driven by agent collision
dynamics. In particular, using a simple model, we show that it can can account

In recent years, many different methods have been proposed that typically
compare the timing of spikes on a certain time scale to be fixed beforehand.
Here, we propose the ISI-distance, a simple complementary approach that
extracts information from the interspike intervals by evaluating the ratio of
the instantaneous frequencies. The method is parameter free, time scale
independent and easy to visualize as illustrated by an application to real
neuronal spike trains obtained in vitro from rat slices. In a comparison with
existing approaches on spike trains extracted from a simulated Hindemarsh-Rose

1D gas (Pechukas gas) and simulate the latter numerically. This approach turns
out to be both insightful and numerically efficient, as seen from our example
of a CNOT gate simulation. For a general class of Hamiltonians we show that the
escape probability from the initial state scales no faster than
|\dot{\lambda}|^{\gamma}, where |\dot{\lambda}| is the adiabaticity parameter.
The scaling exponent for the escape probability is \gamma = 1/2 for all levels,
except the edge (bottom and top) ones, where \gamma <~1/3. In principle, our
method can solve arbitrarily large adiabatic quantum Hamiltonians.

used in the theory of continuous photodetection in cavities. Two main steps
are: 1) an absorption of a single photon by an atom passing through a high-Q
cavity containing electromagnetic field in a thermal or coherent state, 2) a
subsequent measurement of the photon statistics in the new field state arising
after the photon absorption. Then comparing the probabilities of finding 0 and
1 photons in the initial and final states of the field, one can make
conclusions on the form of the one-count operation. This method can be readily
applied in the microwave cavity QED with present technology.

thermodynamics. In particular, based on the separation between quantum and
classical realms implied in the Copenhagen interpretation, the entanglement
generated from the interaction between the system and the apparatus yields a
negative conditional entropy in the quantum component. On the other hand, the
Heisenberg cut implies mandatory tracing out of the system part, and the
resulting apparatus corresponds to a classical system. This measurement process
exhibits a conservation of energy between quantum and classical systems,
analogous to the first law of thermodynamics. Moreover, an exact amount of
entropy increase in apparatus may shed light on a connection between the first

Heisenberg Hamiltonian. This method easily applies to a general two-qubit
Hamiltonian. We show how the robust CNOT gate can achieve a very high fidelity
when a single application of the composite rotations is combined with a modest
level of Hamiltonian characterisation. Operating the robust CNOT gate in a
suitably characterised system means concatenation of the composite pulse is
unnecessary, hence reducing operation time, and ensuring the gate operates
below the threshold required for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

proportionality between noncommutative parameters with a proportional
coefficient depending on characteristic parameters of the system under study.

viewpoint, is the ability to prove the information-theoretic security (ITS) of
the established keys. As a key establishment primitive, QKD however does not
provide a standalone security service in its own: the secret keys established
by QKD are in general then used by a subsequent cryptographic applications for
which the requirements, the context of use and the security properties can
vary. It is therefore important, in the perspective of integrating QKD in
security infrastructures, to analyze how QKD can be combined with other
cryptographic primitives. The purpose of this survey article, which is mostly
centered on European research results, is to contribute to such an analysis. We
first review and compare the properties of the existing key establishment
techniques, QKD being one of them. We then study more specifically two generic
scenarios related to the practical use of QKD in cryptographic infrastructures:
1) using QKD as a key renewal technique for a symmetric cipher over a
point-to-point link; 2) using QKD in a network containing many users with the
objective of offering any-to-any key establishment service. We discuss the
constraints as well as the potential interest of using QKD in these contexts.
We finally give an overview of challenges relative to the development of QKD
technology that also constitute potential avenues for cryptographic research.
