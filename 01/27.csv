optical data of carefully selected samples of low luminosity AGN (LLAGN) in the
local universe. When the Eddington ratio is plotted against the nuclear
``radio-loudness'' parameter, sources divide according to their physical
properties. It is thus possible to disentangle between nuclear jets and
accretion disks of different radiative efficiencies. If this simple
interpretation is correct, we now have a powerful tool to investigate the
nature of the nuclear radiation, and identify radiatively inefficient accretion
flows (RIAF) candidates. Our results show that the best chance of investigating
RIAF processes in the IR-to-UV spectral region is to observe (at the resolution
provided by HST) the nuclei of unobscured Seyferts of the lowest luminosity, as
well as a sub-class of LINERs. In all other objects other radiation processes
dominate. In a sample of 132 LLAGN we identify 8 objects in which we predict
the radiation from a RIAF can be directly detected.

use of the measured X-ray luminosity function and its evolution, as well as
fits from synthesis models of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) to predict the
AGN contribution to the cosmic infrared background (CIRB) for different models
of the location and distribution of the absorbing material. By comparing our
results to observational constraints we conclude that the current deep Spitzer
surveys can account for the entire AGN contribution to the CIRB at 24 microns,
but these AGN are almost all Compton-thin. In fact, the calculations show that
Compton-thick AGN are a small fraction of the CIRB for \lambda < 100 microns.
For this reason, the most efficient method of identifying the Compton-thick AGN
population is through hard X-ray imaging at energies >~ 40 keV. Selection of
AGN based on their rest-frame near-IR colors will miss low luminosity type 2
AGN due to contamination from the host galaxy. Finally, the AGN that dominate
the CXB must have star formation rates < 100 M_{sun} yr^{-1}, consistent with
them having similar properties as the sources which dominate the CIRB at z ~1.
Including the estimated re-radiated emission from star formation, AGN and their
host galaxies may contribute ~30% of the CIRB at 70 microns, dropping to ~10%
at 24 microns and ~1% at 1-10 microns.

is detected. Observations were made with the Very Large Array at the frequency
of 325 MHz. For both clusters deep Very Large Array 1.4 GHz observations are
available. Combining the 325 MHz and 1.4 GHz data, we obtained the spectral
index images and the brightness radial profiles of the diffuse radio emission
with a resolution of ~ 1'. The azimuthally averaged spectral index in A2744 is
constant to a value close to alpha ~ 1 up to a distance of 1 Mpc from the
cluster center. However, the spectral index image shows the presence of
localized regions in which the radio spectrum is significantly different from
the average. The observed spectral index variations range from a minimum of
alpha ~ 0.7 +/- 0.1 to a maximum alpha ~ 1.5 +/- 0.2. From the comparison of
the spectral index with the X-rays data it is found for the first time that the
flat spectrum regions of the radio halo tend to have higher temperature. In the
case of A2219, the radio emission in the central regions of the cluster is
dominated by the blend of discrete sources. The azimuthally averaged radio
spectrum is alpha ~ 0.8 in the central region of the cluster and is close to a
value of alpha ~ 1 in the radio halo. The limited sensitivity of the 325 MHz
image does not allowed us to detect all the radio halo structure seen at 1.4

The effects of varying model parameters (black hole spin and inclination of the

find that the accretion rate value needed to match our calculated millimeter

  Accepted by Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/521138",,"astro-ph",,"  We have used the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys (Ford
et al. 2003) to measure the cumulative mass density in morphologically-selected
early-type galaxies over the redshift range 0.8 < z < 1.7. Our imaging data set
covers four well-separated sight-lines, and is roughly intermediate (in terms
of both depth and area) between the GOODS/GEMS imaging data, and the images
obtained in the Hubble Deep Field campaigns. Our images contain 144 galaxies
with ultra-deep spectroscopy obtained as part of the Gemini Deep Deep Survey.
These images have been analyzed using a new purpose-written morphological
analysis code which improves the reliability of morphological classifications
by adopting a 'quasi-Petrosian' image thresholding technique. We find that at z
\~ 1 about 80% of the stars living in the most massive galaxies reside in
early-type systems. This fraction is similar to that seen in the local
Universe. However, we detect very rapid evolution in this fraction over the
range 0.8 < z < 1.7, suggesting that over this redshift range the strong
morphology-mass relationship seen in the nearby Universe is beginning to fall
into place. By comparing our images to published spectroscopic classifications,
we show that little ambiguity exists in connecting spectral classes to
morphological classes for spectroscopically quiescent systems. However, the
mass density function of early-type galaxies is evolving more rapidly than that
of spectroscopically quiescent systems, which we take as further evidence that
we are witnessing the formation of massive early-type galaxies over the 0.8 < z
< 1.7 redshift range.

Additional figure and extended discussion added",,"10.1086/521543",,"astro-ph",,"  We examine the dynamics of stellar systems embedded within cold dark matter
(CDM) halos in order to assess observational constraints on the dark matter
content of Local Group dwarf spheroidals (dSphs). Our analysis shows that the
total mass within the luminous radius is reasonably well constrained and
approximately independent of the luminosity of the dwarf, highlighting the poor
correspondence between luminosity and halo mass. This result implies that the
average density of dark matter is substantially higher in physically small
systems such as Draco and Sculptor than in larger systems such as Fornax. For
example, our results imply that Draco formed in a halo 5 times more massive
than Fornax's despite being roughly 70 times fainter. Stellar velocity
dispersion profiles, sigma_p(R), provide further constraints; flat sigma_p(R)
profiles imply that stars are deeply embedded within their cold dark matter
halos and so quite resilient to tidal disruption. We estimate that halos would
need to lose more than 90% of their original mass before tides begin affecting
the kinematics of stars.
  We estimate that V_max is about 3 times higher than the central velocity
dispersion of the stars, which alleviates significantly the CDM ``substructure
crisis''.
  We use these results to interpret the size differences between the M31 and
Milky Way (MW) dSph population. Our modeling indicates that this difference
should be reflected in their kinematics, and predicts that M31 dwarfs should
have velocity dispersions up to a factor of ~ 2 higher than their MW
counterparts. This CDM-motivated prediction may be verified with present
observational capabilities.

incompatible with a ballistic path at solar gravity. We report on significant

oscillations leak into the chromosphere along the field lines of magnetic flux
concentrations. Detailed comparison of observed and simulated fibril properties

existing studies of lower redshift clusters have revealed a factor of ~2

mass X-ray binary EXO 2030+375 observed during its June-September 2006 giant
(type II) outburst. Methods: The data analyzed in this work are from partly
simultaneous observations with INTEGRAL Swift. The pulse period P and its
temporal derivative P_dot are measured. X-ray pulse profiles in different
energy ranges and time intervals are constructed. Pulse averaged X-ray spectra
for different time intervals are studied. Results: We report a strong spin-up
of the source during the outburst, comparable to that observed in 1985 during
the previous giant outburst when the source was discovered. The value of P_dot
is found to be linearly related to the X-ray luminosity of the source during
the outburst. For the first time the hard X-ray (>25 keV) characteristics of
the source during a type II outburst are studied. The X-ray pulse profiles
apparently change with luminosity. The X-ray spectral continuum in the 3--120
keV energy range is modeled with an absorbed power law with an exponential
cutoff around E ~26 keV. An iron emission line at ~6-7 keV is observed. The
spectrum reveals some features between 10 and 20 keV which can be modeled
either by a broad emission line at ~13-15 keV (a ``bump'') or by two absorption
lines at ~10 and ~20 keV.

transitions of hydrophobic polymers in explicit water focused on understanding
effects of lengthscale of the hydrophobic surface and of attractive
interactions on folding. Hydrophobic polymers display parabolic, protein-like,
temperature-dependent free energy of unfolding. Folded states of small
attractive polymers are marginally stable at 300 K, and can be unfolded by
heating or cooling. Increasing the lengthscale or decreasing the polymer-water
attractions stabilizes folded states significantly, the former dominated by the
hydration contribution. That hydration contribution can be described by the
surface tension model, $\Delta G=\gamma (T)\Delta A$, where the surface
tension, $\gamma$, is lengthscale dependent and decreases monotonically with
temperature. The resulting variation of the hydration entropy with polymer
lengthscale is consistent with theoretical predictions of Huang and Chandler
(Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.,97, 8324-8327, 2000) that explain the blurring of
entropy convergence observed in protein folding thermodynamics. Analysis of
water structure shows that the polymer-water hydrophobic interface is soft and
weakly dewetted, and is characterized by enhanced interfacial density
fluctuations. Formation of this interface, which induces polymer folding, is
strongly opposed by enthalpy and favored by entropy, similar to the
vapor-liquid interface.

decentralized detection problem where all sensors observe the same object.
While the necessity for global collaboration is clear in the decentralized
detection problem, the benefits of collaboration with limited range sensors is
unclear and has not been widely explored. In this paper we develop a
distributed detection approach based on recent development of the false
discovery rate (FDR). We first extend the FDR procedure and develop a
transformation that exploits complete or partial knowledge of either the
observed distributions at each sensor or the ensemble (mixture) distribution
across all sensors. We then show that this transformation applies to
multi-dimensional observations, thus extending FDR to multi-dimensional
settings. We also extend FDR theory to cases where distributions under both
null and positive hypotheses are uncertain. We then propose a robust
distributed algorithm to perform detection. We further demonstrate scalability
to large SNETs by showing that the upper bound on the communication complexity
scales linearly with the number of sensors that are in the vicinity of objects
and is independent of the total number of sensors. Finally, we deal with
situations where the sensing model may be uncertain and establish robustness of
our techniques to such uncertainties.

includes complete hyperbolic metrics of finite volume. When $B$ is
non-trapping, the magnetic Laplacian has nonempty essential spectrum. Using
Mourre theory, we show the absence of singular continuous spectrum and the
local finiteness of the point spectrum. When $B$ is trapping, the spectrum is
discrete and obeys the Weyl law. The existence of trapping magnetic fields with
compact support depends on cohomological conditions, indicating a new and very
strong long-range effect.
  In the non-gauge invariant case, we exhibit a strong Aharonov-Bohm effect. On
hyperbolic surfaces with at least two cusps, we show that the magnetic
Laplacian associated to every magnetic field with compact support has purely
discrete spectrum for some choices of the vector potential, while other choices
lead to a situation of limit absorption principle.
  We also study perturbations of the metric. We show that in the Mourre theory
it is not necessary to require a decay of the derivatives of the perturbation.

the Keel-Tao endpoint Strichartz estimate in $R^3$ for the nonselfadjoint

  1. How to represent functions with singularities (up to a prescribed
accuracy) in a compact way?
  2. How to reconstruct such functions from a small number of measurements?
  The stress is on a comparison of linear and non-linear approaches. As a model
case we use piecewise-constant functions on [0,1], in particular, the Heaviside
jump function. Considered as a curve in the Hilbert space, it is completely
characterized by the fact that any two its disjoint chords are orthogonal. We
reinterpret this fact in a context of step-functions in one or two variables.
  Next we study the limitations on representability and reconstruction of
piecewise-constant functions by linear and semi-linear methods. Our main tools
in this problem are Kolmogorov's n-width and entropy, as well as Temlyakov's
(N,m)-width.
  On the positive side, we show that a very accurate non-linear reconstruction
is possible. It goes through a solution of certain specific non-linear systems
of algebraic equations. We discuss the form of these systems and methods of
their solution, stressing their relation to Moment Theory and Complex Analysis.
  Finally, we informally discuss two problems in Computer Imaging which are
parallel to the problems 1 and 2 above: compression of still images and
video-sequences on one side, and image reconstruction from indirect measurement
(for example, in Computer Tomography), on the other.

known to possess mesa (box-like) steadystate patterns in the singularly
perturbed limit of small diffusivity for one of the two solution components. As
the diffusivity D of the second component is decreased below some critical
value Dc, with Dc = O(1), the existence of a steady-state mesa pattern is lost,
triggering the onset of a mesa self-replication event that ultimately leads to
the creation of additional mesas. The initiation of this phenomena is studied
in detail for a particular scaling limit of the Brusselator model. Near the
existence threshold Dc of a single steady-state mesa, it is shown that an
internal layer forms in the center of the mesa. The structure of the solution
within this internal layer is shown to be governed by a certain core problem,
comprised of a single non-autonomous second-order ODE. By analyzing this core
problem using rigorous and formal asymptotic methods, and by using the Singular
Limit Eigenvalue Problem (SLEP) method to asymptotically calculate small
eigenvalues, an analytical verification of the conditions of Nishiura and
Ueyema [Physica D, 130, No. 1, (1999), pp. 73-104], believed to be responsible
for self-replication, is given. These conditions include: (1) The existence of
a saddle-node threshold at which the steady-state mesa pattern disappears; (2)
the dimple-shaped eigenfunction at the threshold, believed to be responsible
for the initiation of the replication process; and (3) the stability of the
mesa pattern above the existence threshold. Finally, we show that the core
problem is universal in the sense that it pertains to a class of
reaction-diffusion systems, including the Gierer-Meinhardt model with
saturation, where mesa self-replication also occurs.

nuclei far from the valley of $\beta$-stability. Collective degrees of freedom
govern essential aspects of nuclear structure, and for several decades the
study of collective modes such as rotations and vibrations has played a vital
role in our understanding of complex properties of nuclei. The multipole
response of unstable nuclei and the possible occurrence of new exotic modes of
excitation in weakly-bound nuclear systems, present a rapidly growing field of
research, but only few experimental studies of these phenomena have been
reported so far. Valuable data on the evolution of the low-energy dipole
response in unstable neutron-rich nuclei have been gathered in recent
experiments, but the available information is not sufficient to determine the
nature of observed excitations. Even in stable nuclei various modes of giant
collective oscillations had been predicted by theory years before they were
observed, and for that reason it is very important to perform detailed
theoretical studies of the evolution of collective modes of excitation in
nuclei far from stability. We therefore discuss the modern theoretical tools
that have been developed in recent years for the description of collective
excitations in weakly-bound nuclei. The review focuses on the applications of
these models to studies of the evolution of low-energy dipole modes from stable
nuclei to systems near the particle emission threshold, to analyses of various
isoscalar modes, those for which data are already available, as well as those
that could be observed in future experiments, to a description of
charge-exchange modes and their evolution in neutron-rich nuclei, and to
studies of the role of exotic low-energy modes in astrophysical processes.

model of the electron beam in the presence of a decelerating field is
constructed. Nonlinear nonstationary processes in this system are investigated
by means of numerical analysis of the model. The processes are described and
interpreted with regard to formation and interaction of structures in the
electron flow. The theoretical results are qualitatively confirmed by the
experimental data showing that the system under study can be considered as a
promising controlled source of chaotic oscillations in the microwave range.

processes. In a variety of cell types, Ca signaling occurs within microdomains
where channels deliver localized pulses of Ca which activate a nearby
collection of Ca-sensitive receptors. The small number of channels involved
ensures that the signaling process is stochastic. The aggregate response of
several thousand of these microdomains yields a whole-cell response which
dictates the cell behavior. Here, we study analytically the statistical
properties of a population of these microdomains in response to a trigger
signal. We apply these results to understand the relationship between Ca influx
and Ca release in cardiac cells. In this context, we use a first passage time
approach to show analytically how Ca release in the whole cell depends on the
single channel kinetics of Ca channels and the properties of microdomains.
Using these results, we explain the underlying mechanism for the graded
relationship between Ca influx and Ca release in cardiac cells.

electrical network with threshold firing and activity-dependent synapse
strengths. We study the model on a scale-free network, the Apollonian network,
which presents many features of neuronal systems. The system exhibits a power

cluster expansion techniques of classical statistical mechanics become
operative. They provide an alternative to the usual Feynman diagrammatics in
many-body problems which is not perturbative with respect to the coupling
constant. As an application we show that the effective Coulomb interaction
between quantum charges is partially screened by thermalized photons at large
distances. More precisely one observes an exact cancellation of the dipolar
electric part of the interaction, so that the asymptotic particle density
correlation is now determined by relativistic effects. It has still the
$r^{-6}$ decay typical for quantum charges, but with an amplitude strongly
reduced by a relativistic factor.
