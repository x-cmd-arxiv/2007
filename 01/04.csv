2001, and executed aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope between 2003 and 2006.
This program exploits the sensitivity of Spitzer to carry out mid-infrared
spectrophotometric observations of solar-type stars. With a sample of ~ 328
stars ranging in age from ~ 3 Myr to ~ 3 Gyr, we trace the evolution of
circumstellar gas and dust from primordial planet-building stages in young
circumstellar disks through to older collisionally generated debris disks. When
completed, our program will help define the time scales over which terrestrial
and gas giant planets are built, constrain the frequency of planetesimal
collisions as a function of time, and establish the diversity of mature
planetary architectures.
  In addition to the observational program, we have coordinated a concomitant
theoretical effort aimed at understanding the dynamics of circumstellar dust
with and without the effects of embedded planets, dust spectral energy
distributions, and atomic and molecular gas line emission. Together with the
observations, these efforts will provide astronomical context for understanding
whether our Solar System - and its habitable planet - is a common or a rare
circumstance. Additional information about the FEPS project can be found on the

J180432.4-214009, which has been also detected with Swift and Suzaku, is
consistent with being a point-like source, with the 0.3-7 keV flux of
(1.7\pm0.2)\times10^{-13} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2}. Its hard and strongly absorbed
spectrum can be fitted by the absorbed power-law model with the best-fit photon
index of 0.45 and hydrogen column density of 4\times10^{22} cm^{-2}, both with
large uncertainties due to the strong correlation between these parameters. A
search for pulsations resulted in a 106 s period candidate, which however has a
low significance of 97.9%. We found no infrared-optical counterparts for this
source. The second brightest source, CXOU J180441.9-214224, which has been
detected with Suzaku, is either extended or multiple, with the flux of about
10^{-13} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}. We found a nearby M dwarf within the X-ray source
extension, which could contribute a fraction of the observed X-ray flux. The
remaining sources are very faint (<3\times 10^{-14} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}), and
at least some of them are likely associated with nearby stars. Although one or
both of the two brighter X-ray sources could be faint accreting binaries or
remote pulsars with pulsar wind nebulae (hence possible TeV sources), their
relation to HESS J1804-216 remains elusive. The possibility that HESS J1804-216
is powered by the relativistic wind from the young pulsar B1800-21, located at
a distance of about 10 pc from the TeV source, still remains a more plausible
option.

CXO/XMMU J073709.13+653544 detected in the 2004 August-October Chandra and XMM

pulsations with a period P~18 s, a nearly sinusoidal pulse shape and pulsed
fraction 46-70%. The source shows a rapid decrease of the pulsation period from
18.25 s on Aug. 9 to 17.93 s on Sep. 12 and possibly 17.56 s on Oct. 3, 2004.
The X-ray spectra of the source are hard and are well fitted with an absorbed
simple power law of photon index 0.9~1.2. The X-ray properties of the source
and the absence of an optical/UV counterpart allow us to identify CXO/XMMU
J073709.13+653544 as accreting X-ray pulsar in NGC2403. The maximum unabsorbed
luminosity of the source in the 0.3-7 keV range, ~2.6x10e38 erg/s at 3.2 Mpc,
is at least 260 times higher than its quiescent luminosity. The corresponding
luminosity in the 0.3-100 keV energy range could be as high as ~1.2x10e39
erg/s, assuming the typical pulsar energy spectrum with high-energy cut-off at
10-20 keV. The rate of decrease of the pulsation period of the source (-10e-7
s/s) is one of the fastest observed among accreting pulsars. The evolution of
the pulsation period suggests that it is dominated by the intrinsic spin-up of
the compact object. The accretion rate implied by X-ray luminosity of CXO/XMMU
J073709.13+653544 could account for the observed spin-up rate, assuming that
the X-ray source is powered by disk accretion onto highly magnetized neutron
star. Based on the transient behavior and overall X-ray properties of the
source, we conclude that it could be an X-ray pulsar belonging to either a Be
binary system or a low-mass system similar to GRO J1744-28.

over $\sim 115$ km s$^{-1}$ and has two components, at $z = 3.387144 (17)$ and
$z = 3.386141 (45)$. The stronger component has a redshift and velocity width
in agreement with the tentative detection of Briggs et al. (1997), but a
significantly lower optical depth. The core size and DLA covering factor are
estimated to be $\lesssim 100$ pc and $f \sim 0.69$, respectively, from a VLBA
328 MHz image. If one makes the conventional assumption that the HI column
densities towards the optical and radio cores are the same, this optical depth
corresponds to a spin temperature of $\ts \sim [(955 \pm 160) \times (f/0.69)]
$ K. However, this assumption may not be correct, given that no metal-line
absorption is seen at the redshift of the stronger 21cm component, indicating
that this component does not arise along the line of sight to the optical QSO,
and that there is structure in the 21cm absorbing gas on scales smaller than
the size of the radio core. We model the 21cm absorbing gas as having a
two-phase structure with cold dense gas randomly distributed within a diffuse
envelope of warm gas. For such a model, our radio data indicate that, even if
the optical QSO lies along a line-of-sight with a fortuitously high ($\sim
50$%) cold gas fraction, the average cold gas fraction is low, ($\lesssim
17%$), when averaged over the the spatial extent of the radio core. Finally,
the large mismatch between peak 21cm and optical redshifts and the complexity
of both profiles makes it unlikely that the $z \sim 3.39$ DLA will be useful in
tests of fundamental constant evolution.

112 weak MgII systems within the redshift interval 0.4 < z < 2.4 with 86%
completeness down to a rest-frame equivalent width of W_r(2796) = 0.02A,
covering a cumulative redshift path length of deltaZ=77.3. From this sample, we
estimate that the number of weak absorbers per unit redshift dN/dz increases
from 1.06 +/- 0.04 at <z>=1.9 to 1.76 +/- 0.08 at <z>=1.2 and thereafter
decreases to 1.51 +/- 0.09 at <z>=0.9 and 1.06 +/- 0.10 at <z>=0.6. Thus we
find evidence for an evolution in the population of weak MgII absorbers, with
their number density peaking at z=1.2. We also determine the equivalent width
distribution of weak systems at <z>=0.9 and <z>=1.9. At 0.4 < z < 1.4, there is
evidence for a turnover from a powerlaw of the form n(W_r) \propto W_r^{-1.04}
at W_r(2796) < 0.1A. This turnover is more extreme at 1.4 < z < 2.4, where the
equivalent width distribution is close to an extrapolation of the exponential
distribution function found for strong MgII absorbers. Based on these results,
we discuss the possibility that some fraction of weak MgII absorbers,
particularly single cloud systems, are related to satellite clouds surrounding
strong MgII systems. These structures could also be analogs to Milky Way high
velocity clouds. In this context, the paucity of high redshift weak MgII
absorbers is caused by a lack of isolated accreting clouds on to galaxies

our analysis here to the 19 previously known, localized millisecond pulsars

MSPs observed with sensitivity to rotational variability; it is also the first
survey of a large group of radio-discovered MSPs for which no previous X-ray
pulsations have been detected and is therefore an unbiased survey of the X-ray
properties of radio-discovered MSPs. We find that only 47 Tuc D, O and R show
significant pulsations at the >~ 4-sigma level, but there is statistical
evidence for rotational variability in five additional MSPs. Furthermore, we
constrain the pulsed magnetospheric emission of 7 more MSPs using Monte Carlo
simulations. The result is that the majority of the 47 Tuc MSPs are
characterized by low pulsed fractions, <~ 50%. In cases where larger pulsed
fractions are measured the folded pulse profiles show relatively large duty
cycles. When considered with previous spectroscopic studies, this suggests that
the X-ray emission arises from the neutron star's heated polar caps, and in
some cases, from intra-binary shocks, but generally not directly from the
star's magnetosphere. We discuss the impact of these results on our
understanding of high energy emission from MSPs.

relativistically expending fireballs. We find, due to the curvature effect, the
evolutionary curve of the raw hardness ratio (when the background count is
included) varies significantly, depending on the hardness of a burst. For a
soft burst, an upside-down pulse of its raw hardness ratio curve (HRC) would be
observed; for a hard burst, its raw HRC shows a pulse-like profile with a
sinkage in its decaying phase; for a very hard burst, the raw HRC possesses a
pulse-like profile without a sinkage in its decaying phase. For a pulse-like
raw HRC as shown in the case of the hard and very hard bursts, its peak would
appear in advance of that of the corresponding light curve. We have studied
here the HRC of GRB 920216, GRB 920830 and GRB 990816 in detail. The features
of the raw HRC expected in the hard burst are observed in these bursts. A fit
to the three bursts shows that the curvature effect alone could indeed account
for the predicted characteristics of HRCs. In addition, we find that the
observed hardness ratio tends to be harder at the beginning of the pulses than
what the curvature effect could predict and be softer at the late time of the
pulses. We believe this is an evidence showing the existence of intrinsic
hard-to-soft radiation.

formalism that is upgraded from Seo & Eisenstein (2003). We isolate the
information from the baryonic peaks by excluding distance information from
other less robust sources. Meanwhile we accommodate the Lagrangian displacement
distribution into the Fisher matrix calculation to reflect the gradual loss of
information in scale and in time due to nonlinear growth, nonlinear bias, and
nonlinear redshift distortions. We then show that we can contract the
multi-dimensional Fisher matrix calculations into a 2-dimensional or even
1-dimensional formalism with physically motivated approximations. We present
the resulting fitting formula for the cosmological distance errors from galaxy
redshift surveys as a function of survey parameters and nonlinearity, which
saves us going through the 12-dimensional Fisher matrix calculations. Finally,
we show excellent agreement between the distance error estimates from the
revised Fisher matrix and the precision on the distance scale recovered from
N-body simulations.

holes - have properties that reflect both the structure of their stellar
progenitors and the physics of the explosion. In particular, the masses of
these remnants are sensitive to the density structure of the presupernova star
and to the explosion energy. To a considerable extent, the final mass is
determined by the ``fallback'', during the explosion, of matter that initially
moves outwards, yet ultimately fails to escape. We consider here the simulated
explosion of a large number of massive stars (10 to 100 \Msun) of Population I
(solar metallicity) and III (zero metallicity), and find systematic differences
in the remnant mass distributions. As pointed out by Chevalier(1989),
supernovae in more compact progenitor stars have stronger reverse shocks and
experience more fallback. For Population III stars above about 25 \Msun and
explosion energies less than $1.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg, black holes are a common
outcome, with masses that increase monotonically with increasing main sequence
mass up to a maximum hole mass of about 35 \Msun. If such stars produce primary
nitrogen, however, their black holes are systematically smaller. For modern
supernovae with nearly solar metallicity, black hole production is much less
frequent and the typical masses, which depend sensitively on explosion energy,
are smaller. We explore the neutron star initial mass function for both
populations and, for reasonable assumptions about the initial mass cut of the
explosion, find good agreement with the average of observed masses of neutron
stars in binaries. We also find evidence for a bimodal distribution of neutron
star masses with a spike around 1.2 \Msun (gravitational mass) and a broader
distribution peaked around 1.4 \Msun.

Hall-MHD instabilities have been thoroughly studied as providers of an

radial stratification. In the current work, the Hall instability against

of the radial stratification of the disk and the Hall electric field, and its
growth rate is of the order of the rotation period.

The X-ray afterglow is best described by a smoothly broken power-law with a
break at 7.4 hours. The late optical afterglow has a well constrained single
power-law index which has a value between the two X-ray indices, though it does
agree with a single power-law fit to the X-ray. An evolution of the hardness of
the high-energy emission is demonstrated and we imply a minimum host extinction
from a comparison of the extrapolated X-ray flux to that measured in the
optical. We find that the flaring gamma-ray and X-ray emission is likely due to
internal shocks while the flat optical light curve at that time is due to the
external shock. The late afterglow is best explained by a cooling break between
the optical and X-rays and continued central engine activity up to the time of
the break. The required collimation corrected energy of ~ 2x10^52 erg, while at
the high end of the known energy distribution, is not unprecedented.

obtaining analytical expressions for its two-fermion-state scattering matrix.
Using this result, we consider ways to generate two-electron output states for

short-range repulsion and attraction at somewhat larger separations, such that

of Reed-Solomon codes in a discrete, memoryless, additive-noise channel. An
expression is derived for the error correction radius within which the
soft-decision decoder produces a list that contains the transmitted codeword.
The error radius for ASD is shown to be larger than that of Guruswami-Sudan
hard-decision decoding for a subset of low-rate codes. These results are also
extended to multivariable interpolation in the sense of Parvaresh and Vardy. An
upper bound is then presented for ASD's probability of error, where an error is
defined as the event that the decoder selects an erroneous codeword from its
list. This new definition gives a more accurate bound on the probability of
error of ASD than the results available in the literature.

a classical three-node relay channel. Assuming availability of channel state
information at nodes, the approach makes use of this information to optimize
distinct flows through the direct link from the source to the destination and
the path via the relay, respectively. It is shown that such a design can
effectively harness diversity advantage of the relay channel in both high-rate
and low-rate scenarios. When the rate requirement is low, the proposed design
gives a second-order outage diversity performance approaching that of
full-duplex relaying. When the rate requirement becomes asymptotically large,
the design still gives a close-to-second-order outage diversity performance.
The design also achieves the best diversity-multiplexing tradeoff possible for
the relay channel. With optimal long-term power control over the fading relay
channel, the proposed design achieves a delay-limited rate performance that is
only 3.0dB (5.4dB) worse than the capacity performance of the additive white
Gaussian channel in low- (high-) rate scenarios.

into its outside environment (heat bath). The existence of energy flow means
that the thermodynamic state of the whole system, which consists of the black

study the detail of evaporation process, the nonequilibrium effects of the
energy flow should be taken into account. Using the nonequilibrium
thermodynamics which has been formulated recently, this paper shows the
following: (1) Time scale of black hole evaporation in a heat bath becomes
shorter than that of the evaporation in an empty space (a situation without
heat bath), because a nonequilibrium effect of temperature difference between
the black hole and heat bath appears as a strong energy extraction from the
black hole by the heat bath. (2) Consequently a huge energy burst (stronger
than that of the evaporation in an empty space) arises at the end of
semi-classical stage of evaporation. (3) It is suggested that a remnant of
Planck size remains after the quantum stage of evaporation in order to
guarantee the increase of total entropy of the whole system.

spin one meson and a photon, the photon polarization can be measured from the
angular distribution of the final state. The P-odd, C-even components of this
distribution lead to triple correlation asymmetries that are very sensitive to
new physics as they are likely to receive only tiny contributions from the
Standard Model. There are also (CP-conserving) forward-backward asymmetries to
which there may be SM contributions of a few percent; nevertheless there is a
data driven means to overcome the SM ``pollution''. These latter observables
can be used to search for a class of New Physics which does not necessarily
possess a new CP-odd phase, and wherein the current structure is different from
the left-handed electroweak theory of the Standard Model. The mode $B^\pm \to
K^\pm \phi \gamma$ is particularly useful due to the relatively large branching
ratio and its distinctive final state but there are dozens of such final states
in the decays of $B_u$, $B_d$ and $B_s$ mesons where the analysis is
applicable. In many cases, after the decay of the spin one resonance, several
of these channels lead to only charged mesons and a photon in the final state,
so they may well be accessible in a hadronic environment in addition, of
course, to $e^+ e^-$ (Super) $B$ Factories. In passing we also briefly explain
why the CP-conserving forward-backward asymmetries in $B \to P V \gamma$ decays
is a more reliable signal of new physics compared to the (CP-conserving)
transverse polarization in $B \to V_1 V_2$ modes even though, of course, the

first order in the heterotic strong-coupling expansion, we find that the forces
on branes and anti-branes vanish and that the KKLT procedure of simply adding
to the supersymmetric theory the probe approximation to the energy density of
the anti-brane reproduces the correct potential. However, there are additional
non-supersymmetric corrections to the gauge-kinetic functions and matter terms.
The new correction to the gauge kinetic functions is important in a discussion
of moduli stabilization. At second order in the strong-coupling expansion, we
find that the forces on the branes and anti-branes become non-vanishing. These
forces are not precisely in the naive form that one may have anticipated and,
being second order in the small parameter of the strong-coupling expansion,
they are relatively weak. This suggests that moduli stabilization in heterotic

prove the global existence and compactness of entropy solutions generated by
the vanishing viscosity method. The proof relies on compensated compactness
arguments and symmetry group analysis. Interestingly, we make use here of the
fact that the isothermal gas dynamics system is invariant modulo a linear
scaling of the density. This property enables us to reduce our problem to that
with a small initial density. One symmetry group associated with the linear
hyperbolic equations describing all entropies of the Euler equations gives rise
to a fundamental solution with initial data imposed to the line $\rho=1$. This
is in contrast to the common approach (when $\gamma >1$) which prescribes
initial data on the vacuum line $\rho =0$. The entropies we construct here are
weak entropies, i.e. they vanish when the density vanishes. Another feature of
our proof lies in the reduction theorem which makes use of the family of weak
entropies to show that a Young measure must reduce to a Dirac mass. This step
is based on new convergence results for regularized products of measures and
functions of bounded variation.

preserve power to detect signals despite the detrimental effect of multiple
testing on power. We develop a weighted multiple testing procedure that
facilitates the input of prior information in the form of groupings of tests.
For each group a weight is estimated from the observed test statistics within
the group. Differentially weighting groups improves the power to detect signals
in likely groupings. The advantage of the grouped-weighting concept, over fixed
weights based on prior information, is that it often leads to an increase in
power even if many of the groupings are not correlated with the signal. Being
data dependent, the procedure is remarkably robust to poor choices in
groupings. Power is typically improved if one (or more) of the groups clusters
multiple tests with signals, yet little power is lost when the groupings are
totally random. If there is no apparent signal in a group, relative to a group
that appears to have several tests with signals, the former group will be
down-weighted relative to the latter. If no groups show apparent signals, then
the weights will be approximately equal. The only restriction on the procedure
is that the number of groups be small, relative to the total number of tests
performed.

time domain and in the state domain. Asymptotic normality is separately
established for nonparametric estimators in the time domain and state domain.
These two estimators are asymptotically independent. Hence, they can be
combined, through a dynamic weighting scheme, to improve the efficiency of
volatility matrix estimation. The optimal dynamic weights are derived, and it
is shown that the aggregated estimator uniformly dominates volatility matrix
estimators using time-domain or state-domain smoothing alone. A simulation
study, based on an essentially affine model for the term structure, is
conducted, and it demonstrates convincingly that the newly proposed procedure
outperforms both time- and state-domain estimators. Empirical studies further

important to select a subset of important features for high-dimensional

  reference to an empirical study by other authors",,,,"math.PR",,"  In designing a network to link n cities in a square of area n, one might be
guided by the following two desiderata. First, the total network length should
not be much greater than the length of the shortest network connecting all
cities. Second, the average route length (taken over source-destination pairs)
should not be much greater than the average straight-line distance. How small
can we make these two differences? For typical configurations the shortest
network length is order n and the average straight-line distance is order
n^1/2, so it seems implausible that one can construct a network in which the
first difference is o(n) and the second difference is o(n^1/2). But in fact one
can do better: for an arbitrary configuration one can construct a network where
the first difference is o(n) and the second difference is almost as small as
O(log n). The construction is conceptually simple: over the minimum-length
connected network (Steiner tree) superimpose a sparse stationary and isotropic
Poisson line process. The key ingredient is a new result about the Poisson line
process. Consider two points at distance r apart, and delete from the line
process all lines which separate these two points. The resulting pattern of
lines partitions the plane into cells; the cell containing the two points has
mean boundary length 2r + C log r. Turning to lower bounds we show that, under
a weak equidistribution assumption, if the first difference is O(n) then the
second difference cannot be o(sqrt(log n)).

  Verlag, Berlin, 2007",,,"math.MG",,"  The problem of determining finite subsets of characteristic planar model sets
(mathematical quasicrystals) $\varLambda$, called cyclotomic model sets, by
parallel $X$-rays is considered. Here, an $X$-ray in direction $u$ of a finite
subset of the plane gives the number of points in the set on each line parallel
to $u$. For practical reasons, only $X$-rays in $\varLambda$-directions, i.e.,
directions parallel to non-zero elements of the difference set $\varLambda -
\varLambda$, are permitted. In particular, by combining methods from algebraic
number theory and convexity, it is shown that the convex subsets of a
cyclotomic model set $\varLambda$, i.e., finite sets $C\subset \varLambda$
whose convex hulls contain no new points of $\varLambda$, are determined, among
all convex subsets of $\varLambda$, by their $X$-rays in four prescribed
$\varLambda$-directions, whereas any set of three $\varLambda$-directions does
not suffice for this purpose. We also study the interactive technique of
successive determination in the case of cyclotomic model sets, in which the
information from previous $X$-rays is used in deciding the direction for the
next $X$-ray. In particular, it is shown that the finite subsets of any
cyclotomic model set $\varLambda$ can be successively determined by two

more withstand the repulsive Coulomb forces producing the neck rupture and the
sudden absorption of the neck stubs by the fragments. At that moment, the
neutrons, although still characterized by their pre-scission wave functions,
find themselves in the newly created potential of their interaction with the
separated fragments. Their wave functions become wave packets with components
in the continuum. The probability to populate such states gives evidently the
emission probability of neutrons at scission. In this way, we have studied
scission neutrons for the fissioning nucleus $^{236}$U, using two-dimensional
realistic nuclear shapes. Both the emission probability and the distribution of
the emission points relative to the fission fragments strongly depend on the
quantum numbers of the pre-scission state from which the neutron is emitted. In
particular it was found that states with $\Omega \pi$ = 1/2+ dominate the
emission. Depending on the assumed pre- and post-scission configurations and on
the emission-barrier height, 30 to 50% of the total scission neutrons are
emitted from 1/2+ states. Their emission points are concentrated in the region
between the newly separated fragments. The upper limit for the total number of
neutrons per scission event is predicted to lie between 0.16 and 1.73

minimization in a variational Monte Carlo framework: the Newton, linear and
perturbative methods. In the Newton method, the parameter variations are
calculated from the energy gradient and Hessian, using a reduced variance
statistical estimator for the latter. In the linear method, the parameter
variations are found by diagonalizing a non-symmetric estimator of the
Hamiltonian matrix in the space spanned by the wave function and its
derivatives with respect to the parameters, making use of a strong
zero-variance principle. In the less computationally expensive perturbative
method, the parameter variations are calculated by approximately solving the
generalized eigenvalue equation of the linear method by a nonorthogonal
perturbation theory. These general methods are illustrated here by the
optimization of wave functions consisting of a Jastrow factor multiplied by an
expansion in configuration state functions (CSFs) for the C$_2$ molecule,
including both valence and core electrons in the calculation. The Newton and
linear methods are very efficient for the optimization of the Jastrow, CSF and
orbital parameters. The perturbative method is a good alternative for the
optimization of just the CSF and orbital parameters. Although the optimization
is performed at the variational Monte Carlo level, we observe for the C$_2$
molecule studied here, and for other systems we have studied, that as more
parameters in the trial wave functions are optimized, the diffusion Monte Carlo
total energy improves monotonically, implying that the nodal hypersurface also

identification in mammograms has been developed in the framework of the
EU-founded MammoGrid project. The CADe software is mainly based on wavelet
transforms and artificial neural networks. It is able to identify
microcalcifications in different kinds of mammograms (i.e. acquired with
different machines and settings, digitized with different pitch and bit depth
or direct digital ones). The CADe can be remotely run from GRID-connected
acquisition and annotation stations, supporting clinicians from geographically
distant locations in the interpretation of mammographic data. We report the
FROC analyses of the CADe system performances on three different dataset of
mammograms, i.e. images of the CALMA INFN-founded database collected in the
Italian National screening program, the MIAS database and the so-far collected
MammoGrid images. The sensitivity values of 88% at a rate of 2.15 false
positive findings per image (FP/im), 88% with 2.18 FP/im and 87% with 5.7 FP/im
have been obtained on the CALMA, MIAS and MammoGrid database respectively.

  stiffnesses","CD-Rom","ISMA International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering,
  Belgique (2002)",,,"physics.class-ph",,"  Noise measurement on a population of a gearbox manufactured in large number
reveals a high variability principally due to tolerances on each design
parameter of the gear. Gearbox noise results mainly from vibration of its
housing excited by the transmission error. High dynamic mesh load, high
vibratory response of housing and high acoustic level of the gearbox can be
observed for some critical rotational speeds. These ones correspond to
excitation in a resonant manner of some particular modes which store a high
potential energy at the meshing stiffness. Variability of the associated
critical modes depend on tolerances affected to gear design parameters. It also
depends on bearings stiffnesses dispersion. The physical origins of the
bearings stiffnesses variability are preloads. Bearings stiffnesses and
tolerances affect the characteristics of the meshing stiffness and the dynamic
transfer from dynamic meshing force to the housing vibratory response. The
purpose of this paper is to study effect of the bearings stiffnesses
variability by estimating the first two moments of statistical distribution of
critical modes.

detection of breast cancers. Automated or semi-automated computerized
classification schemes can be very useful in assisting radiologists with a
second opinion about the visual diagnosis of breast lesions, thus leading to a
reduction in the number of unnecessary biopsies. We present a computer-aided
diagnosis (CADi) system for the characterization of massive lesions in
mammograms, whose aim is to distinguish malignant from benign masses. The CADi
system we realized is based on a three-stage algorithm: a) a segmentation
technique extracts the contours of the massive lesion from the image; b)
sixteen features based on size and shape of the lesion are computed; c) a
neural classifier merges the features into an estimated likelihood of
malignancy. A dataset of 226 massive lesions (109 malignant and 117 benign) has
been used in this study. The system performances have been evaluated terms of
the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, obtaining A_z =
0.80+-0.04 as the estimated area under the ROC curve.

  The map of the genetic code defines 2-adic ultrametric on the space of amino
acids. We show that hydrophobic amino acids will be clustered in two balls with

linking dynamics is much faster than evolutionary dynamics and vice-versa, and
show how the individual capacity of forming new links or severing inconvenient
ones maps into the problem of strategy evolution in a well-mixed population
under a different game. For intermediate ranges, we investigate numerically the
detailed interplay determined by these two time-scales and show that the scope
of validity of the analytical results extends to a much wider ratio of time

  121-130",,,"q-bio.QM cs.AI q-bio.MN",,"  Discrete temporal transitions occur in a variety of domains, but this work is
mainly motivated by applications in molecular biology: explaining and analyzing
observed transcriptome and proteome time series by literature and database
knowledge. The starting point of a formal concept analysis model is presented.
The objects of a formal context are states of the interesting entities, and the
attributes are the variable properties defining the current state (e.g.
observed presence or absence of proteins). Temporal transitions assign a
relation to the objects, defined by deterministic or non-deterministic
transition rules between sets of pre- and postconditions. This relation can be
generalized to its transitive closure, i.e. states are related if one results
from the other by a transition sequence of arbitrary length. The focus of the
work is the adaptation of the attribute exploration algorithm to such a
relational context, so that questions concerning temporal dependencies can be
asked during the exploration process and be answered from the computed stem
base. Results are given for the abstract example of a game and a small gene
regulatory network relevant to a biomedical question.
