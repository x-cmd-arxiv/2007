means of a great number of 1-D models of the collapse of halos, exploring a
wide range of masses and virialization redshifts. We find that HD has very
little effect upon the critical mass separating the objects which are likely to
form stars from those which are not. We also find that, once the proto-stellar
collapse has started, HD effects are quite negligible. Instead, HD effects can
be important during the intermediate stage of gas fragmentation: objects below
a certain mass scale (~3x10^5 Msun at z_vir=20 in our ``fiducial'' case) can be
cooled by HD down to T~50-100 K, whereas H2 cooling never takes the gas below
T~200 K. The lower temperature implies a reduction of a factor ~10 in the Jeans
mass of the fragmenting gas, and stars forming in such low-mass halos are
probably less massive than their counterparts in larger halos. We estimate the
importance of this mode of star formation through a variation of the
Press-Schechter formalism, and find that it never exceeds the contribution of
halos which are cooled by H2 only. Halos where HD is important account at best
for a fraction ~0.25 of the total primordial star formation. However, HD
cooling might provide a channel through which long-lived low mass stars could
be formed in primordial conditions.

The most reliable explanation of the event seems to be that two somewhat
massive nearly co-eval gaseous disks failed to accrete on Sgr A*, the
super-massive black hole (SMBH) in our Galaxy, and instead cooled down and
gravitationally collapsed, forming the stars observed now. This emphasises that
star formation must be an important part of AGN feeding puzzle. I also discuss
a model in which stellar winds create the observed obscuration of AGN. These
winds are cold, clumpy and dusty, as required by the observations, but they are
Compton-thin unless wind outflow rate is highly super-Eddington. This argument
is in fact a general one, independent of the wind driving mechanism. I thus
suggest that winds may be important for optically thin absorbers, and that a
better model for optically thick AGN obscuration is a warped accretion/star
forming disk.

QSO spectra could be underestimated by a factor 1.3-2 due to dust obscuration;
ii) the equivalent-width distribution of the MgII absorbers along GRBs is
consistent with that observed along QSOs thus suggesting that the absorbers are
more extended than the beam sizes of the sources; iii) on average, GRB
afterglows showing more than one MgII system are a factor of 1.7 brighter than
the others, suggesting a lensing origin of the observed discrepancy; iv)
gravitational lensing (in different forms, from galaxy lensing to microlensing)
can bias high the counts of MgII systems along GRBs if the luminosity functions
of the prompt gamma-ray emission and of the optical afterglows have a mean
faint-end slope approaching -5/3 -- -2; v) some of the absorbers can be
associated with the circumburst environment or produced by supernova remnants
unrelated to the GRB event itself but lying in the same star-forming region.
With the possible exception of magnification bias, it is unlikely that one of

exhibit a sharp break near the cluster Virial radius, with spirals in the

atmosphere: shear power introduced by the atmosphere is larger than the
expected signal. Algorithms exist to extract the cosmic shear from the
atmospheric component, though a measure of their success applied to a range of
seeing conditions is lacking.
  To gain insight into atmospheric shear, Gemini South imaging in conjunction
with ground condition and satellite wind data were obtained. We find that under
good seeing conditions Point-Spread-Function (PSF) correlations persist well
beyond the separation typical of high-latitude stars. Under these conditions,
ellipticity residuals based on a simple PSF interpolation can be reduced to
within a factor of a few of the shot-noise induced ellipticity floor. We also
find that the ellipticity residuals are highly correlated with wind direction.
Finally, we correct stellar shapes using a more sophisticated procedure and
generate shear statistics from stars. Under all seeing conditions in our data
set the residual correlations lie everywhere below the target signal level. For
good seeing we find that the systematic error attributable to atmospheric
turbulence is comparable in magnitude to the statistical error (shape noise)

0.6 < z < 0.75 from the same time period. We compare the derived trend with
previously published rates and a supernova Type Ia production model having two
components: one component associated closely with star formation and an
additional component associated with host galaxy mass. Our observed trend is
consistent with this model, which predicts a rising SN Ia rate out to at least
z=2.

distribution of local coarse-grained correlations measured at different pairs
of times on a single function using {\it two} scaling parameters, the value of
the global correlation at the measuring times and the ratio of the coarse
graining length to the dynamical length scale (in the thermodynamic limit). (2)
The `triangular' relation between coarse-grained local correlations at three

separation. For the soft-core case, due to the presence of the multiple
occupation, a stable particle induced supersolid (SS-p) phase emerges when
$1/2<\rho<1$. The transition from the solid at $\rho=1/2$ to the SS-p is second
order with the superfluid density scaling as $ \rho_{s} \sim \rho-1/2 $. The
SS-p has the same diagonal order as the solid at $ \rho=1/2 $. As the chemical
potential increasing further, the SS-p will turn into a solid where two bosons
occupying each site of a sublattice through a first order transition. We also

abstract data type for the representatives; unfortunately, pattern matching on

special care needs to be taken in handling the singularities. Two main
techniques are used in numerical-relativity simulations: A first and more
traditional one ``excises'' a spatial neighbourhood of the singularity from the
numerical grid on each spacelike hypersurface. A second and more recent one,
instead, begins with a ``puncture'' solution and then evolves the full
3-metric, including the singular point. In the continuum limit, excision is
justified by the light-cone structure of the Einstein equations and, in
practice, can give accurate numerical solutions when suitable discretizations
are used. However, because the field variables are non-differentiable at the
puncture, there is no proof that the moving-punctures technique is correct,
particularly in the discrete case. To investigate this question we use both
techniques to evolve a binary system of equal-mass non-spinning black holes. We
compare the evolution of two curvature 4-scalars with proper time along the
invariantly-defined worldline midway between the two black holes, using
Richardson extrapolation to reduce the influence of finite-difference
truncation errors. We find that the excision and moving-punctures evolutions
produce the same invariants along that worldline, and thus the same spacetimes
throughout that worldline's causal past. This provides convincing evidence that
moving-punctures are indeed equivalent to moving black holes.

This formalism eliminates automatically the problems of relative time and

It provides bound state wave equations with the simplicity of the
nonrelativistic Schroedinger equation. Unlike other three-dimensional
truncations of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, this covariant formalism has been
thoroughly tested in nonperturbatives contexts in QED, QCD, and nucleon-nucleon
scattering. Here we continue the important studies of this formalism by
extending a method developed earlier for positronium decay into two photons to
tests on the sixteen component quarkonium wave function solutions obtained in
meson spectroscopy. We examine positronium decay and then the two-gamma

The theta-kernel on Bun_G\times Bun_H yields the theta-lifting functors between
the derived categories of l-adic sheaves on Bun_G and Bun_H. We describe the
relation of these functors with Hecke operators.
  In two particular cases it becomes the geometric Langlands functoriality for
this pair (in the nonramified case). Namely, for n=m the functor from the
derived category on Bun_H to that on Bun_G commutes with Hecke functors with
respect to the inclusion of the Langlands dual groups SO_{2n}\to SO_{2n+1}. For
m=n+1 the functor from the derived category on Bun_G to that on Bun_H commutes
with Hecke functors with respect to the inclusion of the Langlands dual groups
SO_{2n+1}\to \SO_{2n+2}.
  In other cases the relation is more complicated and involves the SL_2 of
Arthur. As a step of the proof, we establish the geometric theta-lifting for
the dual pair GL_m, GL_n. Our global results are derived from the corresponding
local ones, which provide a geometric analog of a theorem of Rallis.

(excursions with steps +1 and -1) satisfies 1-E+t^2E^2=0. The generating
function E^(k)(t) of Dyck paths of height at most k is E^(k)=F_k/F_{k+1}, where
the F_k are polynomials in t given by F_0=F_1=1 and F_{k+1}= F_k-t^2F_{k-1}.
This means that the generating function of these polynomials is \sum_{k\ge 0}
F_k z^k= 1/(1-z+t^2z^2). We note that the denominator of this fraction is the
minimal polynomial of the algebraic series E(t). This pattern persists for
walks with more general steps. For any finite set of steps S, the generating
function E^(k)(t) of excursions (generalized Dyck paths) taking their steps in
S and of height at most k is the ratio F_k/F_{k+1} of two polynomials. These
polynomials satisfy a linear recurrence relation with coefficients in Q[t].
Their (rational) generating function can be written \sum_{k\ge 0} F_k z^k=
N(t,z)/D(t,z). The excursion generating function E(t) is algebraic and
satisfies D(t,E(t))=0 (while N(t,E(t))\not = 0). If max S=a and min S=b, the
polynomials D(t,z) and N(t,z) can be taken to be respectively of degree
d_{a,b}=binomial(a+b,a) and d_{a,b}-a-b in z. These degrees are in general
optimal: for instance, when S={a,-b} with a and b coprime, D(t,z) is
irreducible, and is thus the minimal polynomial of the excursion generating
function E(t). The proofs of these results involve a slightly unusual mixture
of combinatorial and algebraic tools, among which the kernel method (which
solves certain functional equations), symmetric functions, and a pinch of
Galois theory.

groups on locally compact, connected and paracompact spaces, by embedding such
an action in a suitable zero-dimensional compactification of the underlying

construct a zero-dimensional compactification $\mu X$ of $X$ with the
properties: (a) there exists an extension of the action on $\mu X$, (b) if $\mu
L\subseteq \mu X\setminus X$ is the set of the limit points of the orbits of
the initial action in $\mu X$, then the restricted action $(G,\mu X\setminus

respect to the uniformity induced on $\mu X\setminus \mu L$ by that of $\mu X$,

compactification $\epsilon X$ of $X$, in order to obtain topological invariants
concerning the cardinality of the space of the ends of $X$, provided that $X$
has an additional ""nice"" property of rather local character (""property Z"",

If the considered space has this property, our new compactification coincides
with the end point one. On the other hand, we give an example of a space not

end point compactification. As an application, we show that the invariant

require contributions from high-momentum wave function components even for

the misconception that reproducing high-energy phase shifts is important for
such observables. Interactions derived via the similarity renormalization group
decouple high-energy and low-energy physics while preserving the phase shifts
from the starting potential. They are used to show that high-momentum
components (and high-energy phase shifts) can be set to zero when using
low-momentum interactions, without losing information relevant for low-energy
observables.

metal particles, then they cannot have a high quality factor because their
light absorption restricts performance. In this paper we address the following
question: can bound modes be formed in dielectric systems where the absorption
of light is negligible? Our investigation of circular arrays of spherical
particles within the framework of the multisphere Mie scattering theory using
the simplest dipolarlike approach shows that (1) high quality modes in an array
of 10 or more particles can be attained at least for a refractive index n > 2,
so optical materials like TiO2 or GaAs can be used; (2) the most bound modes
have nearly transverse polarization perpendicular to the circular plane; (3) in
a particularly interesting case of TiO2 particles (rutile phase, n = 2.7), the
quality factor of the most bound mode increases almost by an order of magnitude
with the addition of 10 extra particles, while for particles made of GaAs the
quality factor increases by almost two orders of magnitude with the addition of
ten extra particles. The consideration of higher multipole contributions has
demonstrated that the error of the dipolar approach does not exceed one percent
if the refractive index nr is greater than 2. Minimum acceptable disordering
not affecting the quality factor is studied.

particles of various lengths, interparticle spacing and particle materials.
Through a unique application of the multisphere Mie scattering formalism, we
have developed numerical methods to calculate eigen-optical modes for various
arrays of particles. These numerical methods involve the use of the multisphere
scattering formalism as the entries in NxN matrices where N represents the
number of particles in the chain. Eigenmodes of these matrices correspond to
the eigen-optical modes of interest. We identified the eigenmodes with the
highest quality factor by the application of a modified version of the
Newton-Raphson algorithm. We found that convergence is strong using this
algorithm for linear chains of up to several hundreds of particles. By
comparing the dipolar approach with the more complex approach which utilizes a
combination of both dipolar and quadrupolar approaches, we demonstrated that
the dipolar approach has an accuracy of approximately 99%. We found that the
quality factor Q of the mode increases with the cubed value of the number of
particles in chain in agreement with the previously developed theory, the
effects of disordering of particle sizes and inter-particle distances will be
discussed.

inflationary phase, as we show. Entropy also grows due to shear viscosity, for
the anisotropic case. The intrinsically inflationary metric that we propose can

only be eliminated by careful dynamical investigations of the hosting planetary
systems. The proportion of extrasolar planetary systems with one known giant
planet is high ($\sim 90 %$), therefore as a first step we have investigated
the possible existence of terrestrial planets in these systems. In this paper a
development of a stability catalogue of the habitable zones of exoplanetary
systems is reported. This catalogue is formed by a series of stability maps,
which can help to establish, where Earth-like planets could exist in extrasolar
planetary systems having one giant planet. After a description of the dynamical
