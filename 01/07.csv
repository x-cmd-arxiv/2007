Omega Centauri. After demonstrating that the chemical features of Omega Cen can
not be reproduced in the framework of the closed-box self-enrichment scenario,
we discuss a model in which this cluster is the remnant of a dwarf spheroidal
galaxy evolved in isolation and then swallowed by the Milky Way. Both infall of
primordial matter and metal-enriched gas outflows have to be considered in
order to reproduce the stellar metallicity distribution function, the
age-metallicity relation and several abundance ratios. Yet, as long as an
ordinary stellar mass function and standard stellar yields are assumed, we fail
by far to get the enormous helium enhancement required to explain the blue main
sequence (and, perhaps, the extreme horizontal branch) stellar data. Rotating
models of massive stars producing stellar winds with large helium excesses at
low metallicities have been put forward as promising candidates to solve the
`helium enigma' of Omega Cen (Maeder & Meynet, 2006, A&A, 448, L37). However,
we show that for any reasonable choice of the initial mass function the
helium-to-metal enrichment of the integrated stellar population is unavoidably
much lower than 70 and conclude that the issue of the helium enhancement in
Omega Cen still waits for a satisfactory explanation. We briefly speculate upon
possible solutions.

analytically the distribution of the leader's velocity at time $t$, and also
the mean and the variance of the number of collisions that are undergone by the

three possible varieties, depending on the tail of $\phi(V)$. The associated

methodology for conducting wavelet estimation with irregularly-spaced data by
viewing the data as the observed portion of an augmented regularly-spaced data
set. We then invoke the self-consistency principle to define our wavelet
estimators in the presence of incomplete data. Major advantages of this
approach include: (i) it can be coupled with almost any wavelet shrinkage
methods, (ii) it can deal with non--Gaussian or correlated noise, and (iii) it
can automatically handle other kinds of missing or incomplete observations. We
also develop a multiple-imputation algorithm and fast EM-type algorithms for
computing or approximating such estimates. Results from numerical experiments
suggest that our algorithms produce favorite results when comparing to several
common methods, and therefore we hope these empirical findings would motivate
subsequent theoretical investigations. To illustrate the flexibility of our
approach, examples with Poisson data smoothing and image denoising are also
provided.

series of events known as the SOS response, regulated by transcription factors,
protein-protein binding and active protein degradation. We present a dynamical
model of the UV-induced SOS response, incorporating mutagenesis by the
error-prone polymerase, Pol V. In our model, mutagenesis depends on a
combination of two key processes: damage counting by the replication forks and
a long term memory associated with the accumulation of UmuD'. Together, these
provide a tight regulation of mutagenesis resulting, we show, in a ""digital""
turn-on and turn-off of Pol V. Our model provides a compact view of the
topology and design of the SOS network, pinpointing the specific functional
role of each of the regulatory processes. In particular, we suggest that the
recently observed second peak in the activity of promoters in the SOS regulon
(Friedman et al., 2005, PLoS Biol. 3, e238) is the result of a positive
feedback from Pol V to RecA filaments.

(""which-way"") experiment, obtaining fully visible interference pattern should
lead to the destruction of the path knowledge. Here I report a failure for this
prediction in an optical interferometry experiment. Coherent laser light is
passed through a dual pinhole and allowed to go through a converging lens,
which forms well-resolved images of the respective pinholes, providing complete
path knowledge. A series of thin wires are then placed at previously measured
positions corresponding to the dark fringes of the interference pattern
upstream of the lens. No reduction in the resolution and total radiant flux of
either image is found in direct disagreement with the predictions of the
principle of complementarity. In this paper, a critique of the current
measurement theory is offered, and a novel nonperturbative technique for
ensemble properties is introduced. Also, another version of this experiment
without an imaging lens is suggested, and some of the implications of the
violation of complementarity for another suggested experiment to investigate
the nature of the photon and its ""empty wave"" is briefly discussed.

system is proposed in terms of a series of $(k,n)$ threshold classical secret
sharing protocols ($2\le k\le n$). The total correlation is shown to be the sum
of independent correlations of 2-, 3-,$...$, $n$-parties. Our result unifies
several earlier scattered works, and shines new light at the important topic of
multi-party quantum entanglement. As an application, we explicitly construct
the hierarchy of correlations in an $n$-qubit graph state.

GHZ-class and W-class.
  In this paper, the states of W-class are considered for teleportation and
superdense coding, and are generalized to multi-particle systems. First we
describe two transformations of the shared resources for teleportation and
superdense coding, which allow many new protocols from some known ones for
that. As an application of these transformations, we obtain a sufficient and
necessary condition for a state of W-class being suitable for perfect
teleportation and superdense coding. As another application, we find that state
  $|W>_{123}={1/2}(|100>_{123}+|010>_{123}+\sqrt{2}|001>_{123})$ can be used to
transmit three classical bits by sending two qubits, which was considered to be
impossible by P. Agrawal and A. Pati [Phys. Rev. A to be published]. We
generalize the states of W-class to multi-qubit systems and multi-particle
systems with higher dimension. We propose two protocols for teleportation and
superdense coding by using W-states of multi-qubit systems that generalize the
protocols by using $|W>_{123}$ proposed by P. Agrawal and A. Pati. We obtain an
optimal way to partition some W-states of multi-qubit systems into two
subsystems, such that the entanglement between them achieves maximum value.
