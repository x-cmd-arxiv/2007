This paper aims to estimate a maximum production of both secondary relativistic
electrons, SRE, and gamma rays, GR, from the relativistic protons, RP, that
have supposedly accumulated throughout the entire history of a cluster. The
production rate is normalized by adopting a reference value of 0.3 for the
ratio of RP to thermal pressure. The SRE content which obtains, when
constrained to reproduce the observed radio brightness profile, yields
univocally B(r), if the presence of primary RE were negligible. This procedure
is applied to four radio halo clusters (Coma, A2163, A2255, A2319). In these
objects, the central value B_0 required is consistent with typical, albeit
rather uncertain, values derived from FR. On the other hand, B(r) typically
increases beyond the thermal core, a hardly acceptable condition. This problem
is alleviated by assuming a mix of SRE and of primary RE, with the latter
becoming the dominant component beyond the thermal core. These results suggest
that in clusters without a radio halo detected so far a diffuse radio emission
should also be observable due to SRE alone, and therefore more centrally
condensed. To encourage deeper radio observations of such clusters, some
examples were selected that seem rather promising. Efforts in this direction,
if accompanied by FR measurements, could provide highly significant constraints
on the CR content in clusters, even before the GLAST mission will have
accomplished the hard task of detecting the GR. A complementary result concerns
the excess far UV in the Coma cluster, that some authors have attributed to IC
emission from SRE. It is shown that this hypothesis can be excluded, because it
requires a RP energy content in excess of the thermal one.

one-sixth of the total matter in the Universe. The remainder is a mysterious
""dark matter"" component, which does not interact via electromagnetism and thus
neither emits nor reflects light. As dark matter cannot be seen directly using
traditional observations, very little is currently known about its properties.
It does interact via gravity, and is most effectively probed through
gravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by the
gravitational attraction of foreground mass concentrations. This is a purely
geometrical effect that is free of astrophysical assumptions and sensitive to
all matter -- whether baryonic or dark. Here we show high fidelity maps of the
large-scale distribution of dark matter, resolved in both angle and depth. We
find a loose network of filaments, growing over time, which intersect in
massive structures at the locations of clusters of galaxies. Our results are
consistent with predictions of gravitationally induced structure formation, in
which the initial, smooth distribution of dark matter collapses into filaments
then into clusters, forming a gravitational scaffold into which gas can
accumulate, and stars can be built.

the theoretical SFR in a wide range of the global gas density ($10 - 10^4

It turns out that the tangent sheaf multiplication has a cohomological origin,
while the Levi-Civita connection is related to 1-dimensional isomonodromic

a) that the number of ``dots'' this multidimensional structure should have is
not obvious, and b) that the notion of the multidimensional permutation needs
some clarification. After proposing various alternatives for the generalization
of the definition of the Costas property, based on the definitions of the

the main one of which is based on the idea of reshaping Costas arrays into

under the frequentist Kullback-Leibler risk function.
  Firstly, we consider the multivariate Normal model with an unknown mean and a
known covariance. While the unknown mean is fixed, the covariance of future
samples can be different from training samples. We show that the Bayesian
predictive distribution based on the uniform prior is dominated by that based
on a class of priors if the prior distributions for the covariance and future
covariance matrices are rotation invariant.
  Then, we consider a class of priors for the mean parameters depending on the
future covariance matrix. With such a prior, we can construct a Bayesian
predictive distribution dominating that based on the uniform prior.
  Lastly, applying this result to the prediction of response variables in the
Normal linear regression model, we show that there exists a Bayesian predictive
distribution dominating that based on the uniform prior. Minimaxity of these
Bayesian predictions follows from these results.

long-standing puzzle. A generic solution for this problem is suggested here.
The stabilizing mechanism involves the combined effect of spatial migration,
amplitude-dependent frequency, and noise: small differences between spatial
patches, induced by the noise, are amplified by the frequency gradient.
Migration among desynchronized regions then stabilizes the oscillations in the
vicinity of the homogenous manifold. A simple model of diffusively coupled
oscillators allows the derivation of quantitative results, like the dependence
of the desynchronization upon diffusion strength and frequency differences. For
an unstable system, a noise-induced transition is demonstrated, from extinction
for small noise to stability if the noise exceeds some threshold. The coupled
oscillator model is shown to reproduce all previously suggested stabilizing
mechanisms. Accordingly, we suggest using this model as a standard tool for
identification and classification of population oscillations on spatial
domains.
