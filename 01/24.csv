in real time as LISA observes the gradual inspiral of a supermassive black hole

Fourier decomposition of the time-dependent, LISA-modulated gravitational-wave
signal, to study this intricate problem. The method is faster than standard
Monte Carlo simulations by orders of magnitude. By surveying the parameter
space of potential LISA sources, we find that counterparts to SMBH binary
mergers with total mass M~10^5-10^7 M_Sun and redshifts z<~3 can be localized
to within the field of view of astronomical instruments (~deg^2) typically
hours to weeks prior to coalescence. This will allow targeted searches for
variable electromagnetic counterparts as the merger proceeds, as well as
monitoring of the most energetic coalescence phase. A rich set of astrophysical
and cosmological applications would emerge from the identification of
electromagnetic counterparts to these gravitational-wave standard sirens.

in [O III] and there exists a thin outer shell with a high [O III] / H-alpha
flux ratio. This outer shell probably originates in the collisionally excited
atoms close to the front of the bow shock. Its presence indicates that the gas
is shock excited as opposed to photoionised, supporting the jet-powered

here we show that v >= 100 km/s (1 sigma confidence) based on a comparison of
the observed [O III] / H-alpha ratio in the bow shock with a number of
radiative shock models. From this we further constrain the time-averaged power
of the jet: P_Jet = (4 - 14)*10^36 erg/s. The H-alpha flux behind the shock
front is typically 4*10^-15 erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2, and we estimate an upper limit
of ~8*10^-15 erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2 (3 sigma) to the optical (R-band) continuum
flux of the nebula. The inferred age of the structure is similar to the time
Cyg X-1 has been close to a bright H II region (due to the proper motion of the

with the 1720 MHz OH maser line. The velocity range of the maser emission
suggests that the water maser sources may be divided into two groups. The
detection rates and velocity range of the OH and Class II methanol masers
support the idea that there is a spatial association of the OH and Class II

maser peak flux to OH 1665 MHz maser peak flux, however there are only a few
sources with intermediate values of R, 8<R<32, which has characterised previous

redder [100um-12um] IRAS colours than those without masers. However, there is
no evidence for different maser species tracing different stages in the
evolution of these young high mass sources. Previous observations which have
shown that the OH maser emission from similar sources traces the circumstellar
disks around the objects. This combined with the sensitivity of the OH emission
to the magnetic field, make the newly detected sources interesting candidates
for future follow-up at high angular resolution.

field and fluctuating fields. We also assumed that the azimuthally averaged
Maxwell stress is proportional to the total pressure. The radial advection rate
of the azimuthal magnetic flux $\dot \Phi$ is prescribed as being proportional
to $\varpi^{- \zeta}$, where $\varpi$ is the radial coordinate and $\zeta$ is a
parameter which parameterizes the radial variation of $\dot \Phi$. We found
that when accretion rate $\dot M$ exceeds the threshold for the onset of the
thermal instability, a magnetic pressure dominated new branch appears. Thus the
thermal equilibrium curve of optically thin disk has a 'Z'-shape in the plane
of surface density and temperature. This indicates that as the mass accretion
rate increases, a gas pressure dominated optically thin hot accretion disk
undergoes a transition to a magnetic pressure dominated, optically thin cool
disk. This disk corresponds to the X-ray hard, luminous disk in black hole
candidates observed during the transition from a low/hard state to a high/soft
state. We also obtained global steady transonic solutions containing such a

unaccompanied by magnification, is an effective way of probing the content and
state of the foreground Universe, because light rays do not have to pass
through mass structures in order to be sheared. It is shown that the delay in
the arrival times between two simultaneously emitted photons that appear to be
arriving from a pair of images of a strongly lensed cosmological source
contains not only information about the Hubble constant, but also the long
range gravitational effect of galactic scale mass clumps located away from the
light paths in question. This is therefore also a method of detecting shear.
Data on time delays among a sample of strongly lensed sources can provide
crucial information about whether extra dynamics beyond gravity and dark energy
are responsible for the global flatness of space. If the standard $\Lambda CDM$
model is correct, there should be a large dispersion in the value of $H_0$ as
inferred from the delay data by (the usual procedure of) ignoring the effect of
all other mass clumps except the strong lens itself. The fact that there has
not been any report of a significant deviation from the $h =$ 0.7 mark during
any of the $H_0$ determinations by this technique may already be pointing to
the absence of the random effect discussed here.

High-Dispersion Spectrograph on the Subaru telescope and Medium-Resolution
Spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. The purpose was to study the narrow
absorption lines (NALs). We use time variability as well as coverage fraction
analysis to separate intrinsic absorption lines, which are physically related
to the quasar, from intervening absorption lines. By fitting models to the line
profiles, we derive the parameters of the respective absorbers as a function of
time. Only the mini-BAL system at z_abs ~ 2.43 (v_off ~ 9,500 km/s) shows both
partial coverage and time variability, although two NAL systems possibly show
evidence of partial coverage. We find that all the troughs of the mini-BAL
system vary in concert and its total equivalent width variations resemble those
of the coverage fraction. However, no other correlations are seen between the
variations of different model parameters. Thus, the observed variations cannot
be reproduced by a simple change of ionization state nor by motion of a
homogeneous parcel of gas across the cylinder of sight. We propose that the
observed variations are a result of rapid continuum fluctuations, coupled with
coverage fraction fluctuations caused by a clumpy screen of variable optical
depth located between the continuum source and the mini-BAL gas. An alternative
explanation is that the observed partial coverage signature is the result of
scattering of continuum photons around the absorber, thus the equivalent width
of the mini-BAL can vary as the intensity of the scattered continuum changes.

and the high density (comparing to the cosmological mean) solar system
environment can excite a viable $\gamma=1$ solution for some $f(R)$ gravity
models. Although for $f(R)\propto -1/R$, it is not the case; for $f(R)\propto
-\exp(-R/\lambda_2H_0^2)$, such $\gamma=1$ solution does exist. This solution
is virtually indistinguishable from that in general relativity (GR) and the
value of the associated curvature approaches the GR limit, which is much higher
than value in the $\gamma=1/2$ solution. We show that for some forms of $f(R)$
gravity, this solution is physically stable in the solar system and can
smoothly connect to the surface of the Sun.
  The derived field equations can be applied directly to gravitational lensing
of galaxies and clusters. We find that, despite significant difference in the
environments of galaxies and clusters comparing to that of the solar system,
gravitational lensing of galaxies and clusters can be virtually identical to
that in GR, for some forms of $f(R)$ gravity. Fortunately, galaxy rotation

initial condition, a clam-shell instability ensues which is similar to the
freely-evolving cases studied previously. After the initial nonlinear
saturation, the residual mean fields are apparently too weak to sustain the
instability indefinitely. However, when a mean poloidal field is imposed in
addition to the rotational shear, a statistically-steady state is achieved in
which the clam-shell instability is operating continually. This state is
characterized by a quasi-periodic exchange of energy between the mean toroidal

extra-galactic UV-background. For large star formation rates and levels of the
UV-background, absorption in the IGM does not result in a Lya line that is
asymmetric as is common among known high-redshift Lya emitters. For models in
which the lines do show the observed strong asymmetry, the IGM typically
transmits only 10-30% of the Lya flux. The increase in the ionising background
that accompanied the completion of reionisation barely increased the IGM
transmission, which suggests that LAEs of comparable luminosity should not
appear to be significantly dimmer prior to overlap. In this light, we briefly
discuss the potential of Lya emitters as a probe into the epoch of
reionisation.

from Halpha-emitting field galaxies detected in a narrow-band imaging survey
with the Subaru Telescope. The Anglo-Australian Telescope was used to obtain
precise optical redshifts for these galaxies. We then coadded the HI 21 cm
emission signal for all the galaxies within the GMRT spectral line data cube.
  From the coadded signal of 121 galaxies, we measure an average atomic
hydrogen gas mass of (2.26 +- 0.90)*10^9 solar masses. We translate this HI
signal into a cosmic density of neutral gas at z = 0.24 of Omega_gas = (0.91 +-
0.42)*10^-3. This is the current highest redshift at which Omega_gas has been
constrained from 21 cm emission and our value is consistent with that estimated
from damped Lyman-alpha systems around this redshift. We also find that the
correlations between the Halpha luminosity and the radio continuum luminosity
and between the star formation rate and the HI gas content in star-forming
galaxies at z = 0.24 are consistent with the correlations found at z = 0. These
two results suggest that the star formation mechanisms in field galaxies ~3 Gyr
ago were not substantially different from the present, even though the star
formation rate is 3 times higher.

y-parameter has an average value of (1.19 +/- 0.32) 10^-6 and is lognormally

galaxies. The high resolution Millennium Simulation is used to specify the
positions and the velocities of the model galaxies. The stellar mass of a
galaxy is assumed to depend only on M_{infall}, the halo mass when the galaxy
was last the central dominant object of its halo. Star formation histories are
parametrized using two additional quantities that are measured from the
simulation for each galaxy: its formation time (t_{form}), and the time when it
first becomes a satellite (t_{infall}). Central galaxies begin forming stars at
time t_{form} with an exponential time scale tau_c. If the galaxy becomes a
satellite, its star formation declines thereafter with a new time scale tau_s.
We compute 4000 \AA break strengths for our model galaxies using stellar
population synthesis models. By fitting these models to the observed abundances
and projected correlations of galaxies as a function of break strength in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we constrain tau_c and tau_s as functions of galaxy
stellar mass. We find that central galaxies with large stellar masses have
ceased forming stars. At low stellar masses, central galaxies display a wide
range of different star formation histories, with a significant fraction
experiencing recent starbursts. Satellite galaxies of all masses have declining
star formation rates, with similar e-folding times, tau_s ~ 2.5Gyr. One
consequence of this long e-folding time is that the colour-density relation is
predicted to flatten at redshifts > 1.5, because star formation in the majority
of satellites has not yet declined by a significant factor. This is consistent
with recent observational results from the DEEP and VVDS surveys.

barred galaxies are complex objects where dynamical instabilities play a
leading role in shaping any spatial distribution. The age distribution of
stellar populations should thus be analyzed from the two points of view of
stellar population evolution and dynamical secular evolution. Chemodynamical
simulations of single barred galaxies with simple but realistic star formation
and feedback recipes are used to produce face-on mass-weighted maps of stellar
population ages. Luminosity-weighted maps in V-band are also displayed after
calibrating the simulation with mass-to-light ratios provided by a synthesis

diametrically opposed regions display a mean age lower than the surrounding
average. These two low-age regions are due to the accumulation of young stellar
populations trapped on elliptical-like orbits along the bar, near the
ultra-harmonic resonance. Age gradients along the bar major-axis are comparable

sources of very high energetic gamma-rays (VHE gamma-rays). Methods: VHE
gamma-rays are attenuated by the photons of the EBL via pair production, which
leaves an imprint in the measured spectra from distant sources. In this paper
we present a new method to derive constraints on the EBL. Hereby, we use only
very basic assumptions about TeV blazar physics and no pre-defined EBL model,
but rather a large number of generic shapes constructed from a grid in EBL
density vs. wavelength. In our study we utilize spectral data from all known
TeV blazars, making this the most complete study so far. Results: We derive
limits on the EBL for three individual TeV blazar spectra (Mkn 501, H1426+428,
1ES1101-232) and for all spectra combined. Combining the results from
individual spectra leads to significantly stronger constraints over a wide
wavelength range from the optical (~ 1 micron) to the far-infrared (~ 80
microns). The limits are only a factor of 2 to 3 above the absolute lower
limits derived from source counts. In the mid-infrared our limits are the
strongest constraints derived from TeV blazar spectra so far. A high density of
the EBL around 1 micron, reported by direct detection experiments, can be
excluded. Conclusions: Our results can be interpreted in two ways: (i) The EBL
is almost resolved by source counts, leaving only little room for additional
components by e.g. the first stars or (ii) the assumptions about the underlying
physics are not valid, which would require substantial changes in the standard
emission models of TeV blazars.

by the grammage of the disk that modulates the optical depth. The
electromagnetic cascades initiated by photons absorbed in the disk are
explored, making use of the so-called ""Approximation A"" to solve the cascade
equations. Very high energy photons induce Inverse Compton cascades in the
photon field of the massive star. We implemented Monte Carlo simulations of
these cascades, in order to estimate the characteristics of the resulting

single ethylene molecule can form stable complexes with light transition metals

14 wt % hydrogen for n=1 and 2, respectively. Here we extend this study to
include a large number of other metals and different isomeric structures. We
obtained interesting results for light metals such as Li. The ethylene molecule
is able to complex with two Li atoms with a binding energy of 0.7 eV/Li which
then binds up to two H2 molecules per Li with a binding energy of 0.24 eV/H2
and absorption capacity of 16 wt %, a record high value reported so far. The
stability of the proposed metal-ethylene complexes was tested by extensive
calculations such as normal-mode analysis, finite temperature first-principles
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and reaction path calculations. The phonon
and MD simulations indicate that the proposed structures are stable up to 500
K. The reaction path calculations indicate about 1 eV activation barrier for
the TM2-ethylene complex to transform into a possible lower energy
configuration where the ethylene molecule is dissociated. Importantly, no
matter which isometric configuration the TM2-ethylene complex possesses, the TM
atoms are able to bind multiple hydrogen molecules with suitable binding energy
for room temperature storage. These results suggest that co-deposition of
ethylene with a suitable precursor of TM or Li into nanopores of light-weight
host materials may be a very promising route to discovering new materials with
high-capacity hydrogen absorption properties.

This opens the way to derive dynamic localization conditions serving to
applications in several areas, like the time dependent electron transport in

of the different coordination and superexchange angles of the oxalate ligands

magnetic field driven ground state changes which at very low temperatures lead
to a multistep behaviour in the magnetization curves. In the Co and Fe

made in the paper Stochastic feedback, nonlinear families of Markov processes,
and nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations by T. D. Frank. Our comment centers on
the claims of a nonlinear Markov process and a nonlinear Fokker-Planck
equation. First, memory in transition densities is misidentified as a Markov
process. Second, Frank assumes that one can derive a Fokker-Planck equation
from a Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, but no proof was given that a
Chapman-Kolmogorov equation exists for memory-dependent processes. A nonlinear
Markov process is claimed on the basis of a nonlinear diffusion pde for a
1-point probability density. We show that, regardless of which initial value
problem one may solve for the 1-point density, the resulting stochastic
process, defined necessarily by the transition probabilities, is either an
ordinary linearly generated Markovian one, or else is a linearly generated
nonMarkovian process with memory. We provide explicit examples of diffusion
coefficients that reflect both the Markovian and the memory-dependent cases. So
there is neither a nonlinear Markov process nor nonlinear Fokker-Planck
equation for a transition density. The confusion rampant in the literature
arises in part from labeling a nonlinear diffusion equation for a 1-point
probability density as nonlinear Fokker-Planck, whereas neither a 1-point
density nor an equation of motion for a 1-point density defines a stochastic
process, and Borland misidentified a translation invariant 1-point density
derived from a nonlinear diffusion equation as a conditional probability

tradeoff between energy efficiency and spectral efficiency (known as the power-
bandwidth tradeoff) in meaningful asymptotic regimes of signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and network size. We design linear distributed multi-antenna relay
beamforming (LDMRB) schemes that exploit the spatial signature of multi-user
interference and characterize their power-bandwidth tradeoff under a system
wide power constraint on source and relay transmissions. The impact of multiple
users, multiple relays and multiple antennas on the key performance measures of

possible reduction in power and bandwidth requirements through the usage of
such practical relay cooperation techniques. Our results indicate that
point-to-point coded multi-user networks supported by distributed relay
beamforming techniques yield enhanced energy efficiency and spectral
efficiency, and with appropriate signaling and sufficient antenna degrees of

more than four dimensions. Thus, in these theories the effective 4-dimensional
picture allows the existence of different possible, non-Schwarzschild,
scenarios for the description of the spacetime outside of a spherical star,
contrary to general relativity in 4D. We investigate the exterior spacetime of
a spherically symmetric star in the context of Kaluza-Klein gravity. We take a
well-known family of static spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein
equations in an empty five-dimensional universe, and analyze possible stellar
exteriors that are conformal to the metric induced on four-dimensional
hypersurfaces orthogonal to the extra dimension. All these exteriors are
continuously matched with the interior of the star. Then, without making any
assumptions about the interior solution, we prove the following statement: the
condition that in the weak-field limit we recover the usual Newtonian physics
singles out an unique exterior. This exterior is ""similar"" to Scharzschild
vacuum in the sense that it has no effect on gravitational interactions.
However, it is more realistic because instead of being absolutely empty, it is
consistent with the existence of quantum zero-point fields. We also examine the
question of how would the deviation from the Schwarzschild vacuum exterior
affect the parameters of a neutron star. In the context of a model star of
uniform density, we show that the general relativity upper limit M/R < 4/9 is
significantly increased as we go away from the Schwarzschild vacuum exterior.
We find that, in principle, the compactness limit of a star can be larger than
1/2, without being a black hole. The generality of our approach is also
discussed.

for high $E$. It is only for stationary world-lines that the response function
decays faster than any power-law, in keeping with the known exponential
behavior for some stationary cases. Under some conditions the (time dependent)

dimensions where all of the Standard Model fields are allowed to propagate in
the bulk, known as Universal Extra Dimensions (UED). UED make for an
interesting TeV-scale physics scenario, featuring a tower of Kaluza-Klein (KK)
states approximately degenerate in mass at the scale set by the inverse size of
the compactification radius. KK parity, the four-dimensional remnant of
momentum conservation in the extra dimensions, implies two basic consequences:
(1) contributions to Standard Model observables arise only at loop level, and
KK states can only be pair-produced at colliders, and (2) the lightest KK
particle (LKP) is stable, providing a suitable particle dark matter candidate.
After a theoretical overview on extra dimensional models, and on UED in
particular, we introduce the model particle spectrum and the constraints from
precision electroweak tests and current colliders data. We then give a detailed
overview of the LKP dark matter phenomenology, including the LKP relic
abundance, and direct and indirect searches. We then discuss the physics of UED
at colliders, with particular emphasis on the signatures predicted for the
Large Hadron Collider and at a future Linear Collider, as well as on the
problem of discriminating between UED and other TeV-scale new physics
scenarios, particularly supersymmetry. We propose a set of reference benchmark
models, representative of different viable UED realizations. Finally, we
collect in the Appendix all the relevant UED Feynman rules, the scattering
cross sections for annihilation and coannihilation processes in the early
universe and the production cross section for strongly interacting KK states at
hadron colliders.

for a smooth transition to a radiation dominated Universe without a separate
reheating stage and a modification of the slow roll evolution, as the heat-bath
backreacts on the inflaton through friction. In order to study this from first
principles, we investigate the dynamics of a scalar field coupled to the
inflaton and N light scalar boson fields, using the 2PI-1/N expansion for
nonequilibrium quantum fields. As a first step we restrict ourselves to
Minkowski spacetime, interpret the inflaton as a time-dependent background, and
use vacuum initial conditions. We find that the dominant effect is particle
creation at late stages of the evolution due to the effective time-dependent
mass. The further transfer of energy to the light degrees of freedom and
subsequent equilibration only occurs after the end of inflation. As a
consequence, the adiabatic constraint, which is assumed in most studies of warm
inflation, is not satisfied when starting from an initial vacuum state.

it turns out that such a system can be described in terms of a gluon condensate

mass decrease with increasing temperature. Then we analyze QCD with finite
quark masses. In this case the numerical lattice data for energy density and
pressure can be fitted assuming that the system consists of a mixture of gluon
quasiparticles, fermion quasiparticles, boson correlated pairs (corresponding
to in-medium mesonic states) and gluon condensate. We find that the effective

blowups and their gauge bundles are given explicitly. We investigate ten
dimensional SO(32) super Yang-Mills theory coupled to supergravity on these

finite number of U(1) bundle models. We describe how the orbifold gauge shift
vector can be read off from the gauge background. In this way we can assert
that in the blow down limit these models correspond to heterotic C^2/Z_2 and
C^3/Z_3 orbifold models. (Only the Z_3 model with unbroken gauge group SO(32)
cannot be reconstructed in blowup without torsion.) This is confirmed by
computing the charged chiral spectra on the resolutions. The construction of
these blowup models implies that the mismatch between type-I and heterotic
models on T^6/Z_3 does not signal a complication of S-duality, but rather a
problem of type-I model building itself: The standard type-I orbifold model
building only allows for a single model on this orbifold, while the blowup
models give five different models in blow down.

such that if $\phi^k(x) = x$ for some $k$ and $x$, then $\phi(x) = x$.
Equivalently, $\phi^\ell = \phi^{\ell+1} = ...$ for $\ell$ sufficiently large.
We investigate the behavior as $n \to \infty$ of a Markov chain on the
collection of such mappings. At each step of the chain, a point in the $n$
element set is chosen uniformly at random and the current mapping is modified
by replacing the current image of that point by a new one chosen independently
and uniformly at random, conditional on the resulting mapping being again
acyclic. We can represent an acyclic mapping as a directed graph (such a graph
will be a collection of rooted trees) and think of these directed graphs as
metric spaces with some extra structure. Heuristic calculations indicate that
the metric space valued process associated with the Markov chain should, after
an appropriate time and ``space'' rescaling, converge as $n \to \infty$ to a
real tree ($\R$-tree) valued Markov process that is reversible with respect to
a measure induced naturally by the standard reflected Brownian bridge. The
limit process, which we construct using Dirichlet form methods, is a Hunt
process with respect to a suitable Gromov-Hausdorff-like metric. This process
is similar to one that appears in earlier work by Evans and Winter as the limit
of chains involving the subtree prune and regraft tree (SPR) rearrangements
from phylogenetics.

equally likely; there, the asymptotic threshold is $\mu_m\approx m^{-1/4}$. We
obtain corresponding results for trees (where the threshold is of order 1 and
independent of the size of the tree), for distributions other than the Gaussian
and for other graphs. The concept of the predictability profile, first
introduced by Benjamini, Pemantle and Peres, plays a crucial role in our
analysis.

computation. It is an important capability in many symbolic and algebraic
computation. There are two type of factorization of polynomials. One is
convention polynomial factorization, and the other approximate polynomial
factorization.
  Conventional factorization algorithms use symbolic methods to get exact
factors of a polynomial while approximate factorization algorithms use
numerical methods to get approximate factors of a polynomial. Symbolic
computation often confront intermediate expression swell problem, which lower
the efficiency of factorization. The numerical computation is famous for its
high efficiency, but it only gives approximate results. In this paper, we
present an algorithm which use approximate method to get exact factors of a
multivariate polynomial. Compared with other methods, this method has the
numerical computation advantage of high efficiency for some class of

the method is more efficient than {\it factor} in Maple 9.5 for polynomials

Data were measured in kinematics centred on a super-parallel geometry at energy
and momentum transfers of 215 MeV and 316 MeV/c. The experimental resolution
was sufficient to distinguish groups of states in the residual nucleus but not
good enough to separate individual states. The data show a strong dependence on
missing momentum and this dependence appears to be different for two groups of
states in the residual nucleus. Theoretical calculations of the reaction using
the Pavia code do not reproduce the shape or the magnitude of the data.

Beginning with x-independent drift coefficients R(t) we show that Martingale
stochastic processes generate uncorrelated, generally nonstationary increments.
Generally, a test for a martingale is therefore a test for uncorrelated
increments. A detrended process with an x- dependent drift coefficient is
generally not a martingale, and so we extend our analysis to include the class
of (x,t)-dependent drift coefficients of interest in finance. We explain why
martingales look Markovian at the level of both simple averages and 2-point
correlations. And while a Markovian market has no memory to exploit and
presumably cannot be beaten systematically, it has never been shown that
martingale memory cannot be exploited in 3-point or higher correlations to beat
the market. We generalize our Markov scaling solutions presented earlier, and
also generalize the martingale formulation of the efficient market hypothesis
(EMH) to include (x,t)-dependent drift in log returns. We also use the analysis
of this paper to correct a misstatement of the fair game condition in terms of

significant differences between the hydroxylated (100) and (001) surface
structures and reactivities. Density functional theory structures and energies
clarify these differences. Using relaxed surface energies, a Wulff construction
yields a prism crystal shape exposing long (100) sides and much smaller (001)
faces. This is consistent with the BeO prisms observed when beryllium metal is
oxidized. A water oxygen atom binds to a single surface beryllium ion in the
preferred adsorption geometry on either surface. The water oxygen/beryllium
bonding is stronger on the surface with greater beryllium atom exposure, namely
the less-stable (001) surface. Water/beryllium coordination facilitates water
dissociation. On the (001) surface, the dissociation products are a hydroxide
bridging two beryllium ions and a metal coordinated hydride with some surface
charge depletion. On the (100) surface, water dissociates into a hydroxide
ligating a Be atom and a proton coordinated to a surface oxygen but the lowest
energy water state on the (100) surface is the undissociated metal-coordinated
water. The (100) fully hydroxylated surface structure has a hydrogen bonding
network which facilitates rapid proton shuffling within the network. The
corresponding (001) hydroxylated surface is fairly open and lacks internal
hydrogen bonding. This supports previous experimental interpretations of the
step in water adsorption isotherms. Further, when the (100) surface is heated
to 1000 K, hydroxides and protons associate and water desorbs. The more open
(001) hydroxylated surface is stable at 1000 K. This is consistent with the
experimental disappearance of the isotherm step when heating to 973 K.

behaviors change as a result of working on multi-faceted, context-rich
problems. During the semester, groups of two to three students work on several
problems that require more than one concept and hence cannot be readily solved
with simple plug-and-chug strategies. The problems are presented to students in
a data-rich, online problem-solving environment that tracks which information
items are selected by students as they attempt to solve the problem. The
students also complete a variety of tasks, such as entering their qualitative
analysis into an online form. Students are not constrained to complete these
tasks in any order. As they gain more experience in solving multifaceted
physics problems, the student groups show some progression towards expert-like
behavior: earlier qualitative analysis and more selective requests for
information. However, there is room for more improvement as approximately half
of the groups still complete the qualitative analysis task towards the end of
the solution instead of earlier when it would be most useful to their work.

introduced in two earlier papers under the title A Dust Universe Solution to
the Dark Energy Problem. The model introduced in this theory has existence
before time zero so that it is not necessary to interpret it as of big-bang
origin. The location of the Cosmic Microwave Background, within the theoretical
structure gives a closing of the fundamentals of the model in terms of the
definitions of Temperature, Entropy and other Thermodynamic aspects. Thus
opening up a research tool in cosmology in exact agreement with experiment that
can compete with the so-called Standard Big Bang Model as a
mathematical-physical description of our universe based rigorously on
Einstein's general relativity. It is suggested that the singularity at time
zero involves a population inversion in the statistical mechanics sense and so
justifies the use of negative temperature for the CMB at negative times. This
also has the satisfactory consequence that the Universe's evolution involves
entropy steadily increasing over all time from minus infinity through the
singularity to plus infinity.An appendix with its own abstract contains an
alternative simple classical physics derivation of this model and an extended
discussion about how it can be used in the astrophysical context of galactic
motions. A cosmological Schroedinger equation of great generality is derived
which unites cosmology and the quantum description of cosmological objects

  Network","to appear in PNAS",,"10.1073/pnas.0609023104",,"q-bio.MN q-bio.QM",,"  The E.coli transcription network has an essentially feedforward structure,
with, however, abundant feedback at the level of self-regulations. Here, we
investigate how these properties emerged during evolution. An assessment of the
role of gene duplication based on protein domain architecture shows that (i)
transcriptional autoregulators have mostly arisen through duplication, while
(ii) the expected feedback loops stemming from their initial cross-regulation
are strongly selected against. This requires a divergent coevolution of the
transcription factor DNA-binding sites and their respective DNA cis-regulatory
regions. Moreover, we find that the network tends to grow by expansion of the
existing hierarchical layers of computation, rather than by addition of new
layers. We also argue that rewiring of regulatory links due to
mutation/selection of novel transcription factor/DNA binding interactions
appears not to significantly affect the network global hierarchy, and that
horizontally transferred genes are mainly added at the bottom, as new target
nodes. These findings highlight the important evolutionary roles of both
duplication and selective deletion of crosstalks between autoregulators in the
emergence of the hierarchical transcription network of E.coli.

unitary evolution operator to a Hilbert space corresponding to the graph. If
this unitary evolution operator has an associated group of symmetries, then for
certain initial states the walk will be confined to a subspace of the original
Hilbert space. Symmetries of the original graph, given by its automorphism
group, can be inherited by the evolution operator. We show that a quantum walk
confined to the subspace corresponding to this symmetry group can be seen as a
different quantum walk on a smaller quotient graph. We give an explicit
construction of the quotient graph for any subgroup of the automorphism group
and illustrate it with examples. The automorphisms of the quotient graph which
are inherited from the original graph are the original automorphism group
modulo the subgroup used to construct it. We then analyze the behavior of
hitting times on quotient graphs. Hitting time is the average time it takes a
walk to reach a given final vertex from a given initial vertex. It has been
shown in earlier work [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 74}, 042334 (2006)] that the hitting
time can be infinite. We give a condition which determines whether the quotient
graph has infinite hitting times given that they exist in the original graph.
We apply this condition for the examples discussed and determine which quotient
graphs have infinite hitting times. All known examples of quantum walks with
fast hitting times correspond to systems with quotient graphs much smaller than
the original graph; we conjecture that the existence of a small quotient graph
with finite hitting times is necessary for a walk to exhibit a quantum
speed-up.
