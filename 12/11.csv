'breaks smoothly' into a fast power-law decline. Very energetic GRBs,
contrariwise, appear not to have a 'break', their AG declines like a power-law

the tail of the prompt emission, or it occurs too early to be recorded. We also
verify that the spectral index of the unabsorbed AGs and the temporal index of

variables, and the goal is to assign values to the variables that maximises the
number of satisfied constraints. Max CSP captures many well-known problems
(such as Max k-SAT and Max Cut) and is consequently NP-hard. Thus, it is
natural to study how restrictions on the allowed constraint types (or
constraint languages) affect the complexity and approximability of Max CSP. The
PCP theorem is equivalent to the existence of a constraint language for which
Max CSP has a hard gap at location 1, i.e. it is NP-hard to distinguish between
satisfiable instances and instances where at most some constant fraction of the
constraints are satisfiable. All constraint languages, for which the CSP
problem (i.e., the problem of deciding whether all constraints can be
satisfied) is currently known to be NP-hard, have a certain algebraic property.
We prove that any constraint language with this algebraic property makes Max
CSP have a hard gap at location 1 which, in particular, implies that such
problems cannot have a PTAS unless P = NP. We then apply this result to Max CSP
restricted to a single constraint type; this class of problems contains, for
instance, Max Cut and Max DiCut. Assuming P $\neq$ NP, we show that such
problems do not admit PTAS except in some trivial cases. Our results hold even

candidate galaxies, drawn from two fields of the Leiden Berkeley Deep Survey,

lower resolution radio observations (both previously published in Paper I and,
for a subset of sources, also presented here) these are used to morphologically
classify the sample. Sources which are clearly resolved are classified by
morphology alone, whereas barely or unresolved sources were classified using a
combination of morphology and flux density loss in the higher resolution data,
indicative of resolved out extended emission. The space densities of the FRIs
are then calculated as a function of redshift, and compared to both
measurements of the local value and the behaviour of the more powerful FRIIs.
The space density of FRI radio sources with luminosities (at 1.4 GHz) > 10^25
W/Hz is enhanced by a factor of 5-9 by z ~ 1, implying moderately strong
evolution of this population; this enhancement is in good agreement with models
of FRII evolution at the same luminosity. There are also indications that the
evolution is luminosity dependent, with the lower powered sources evolving less

over the years. They ranged from dust grains to free molecules of different
kinds, and to more exotic specimens, like hydrogen negative ion. Unfortunately,
none of them is responsible for observed DIBs. Furthermore, it was shown that a
single carrier cannot be responsible for all known DIBs. It is hard to estimate
how many carriers can participate in producing these bands. The problem is
further complicated by the fact that to this day it is still impossible to find
any laboratory spectrum of any substance which would match the astrophysical
spectra. Here, a historical outline concerning DIBs is followed by a brief

explore the cosmological degradation vs the size of the spectroscopic survey
required to calibrate the photo-z probability distribution. Previous work has
assumed a simple Gaussian distribution of photo-z errors; here we describe a
method for constraining an arbitrary parametric photo-z error model. As an
example we allow the photo-z probability distribution to be the sum of $N_g$
Gaussians. To limit cosmological degradation to a fixed level, photo-z models
with multiple Gaussians require up to 5 times larger calibration sample than
one would estimate from assuming a single-Gaussian model. This degradation
saturates at $N_g\approx 4$. Assuming a single Gaussian when the photo-z
distribution has multiple parameters underestimates cosmological parameter
uncertainties by up to 35%. The size of required calibration sample also
depends upon the shape of the fiducial distribution, even when the RMS photo-z
error is held fixed. The required calibration sample size varies up to a factor
of 40 among the fiducial models studied, but this is reduced to a factor of a
few if the photo-z parameters are forced to be slowly varying with redshift.
Finally we show that the size of the required calibration sample can be
substantially reduced by optimizing its redshift distribution. We hope this
study will help stimulate work on better understanding of photo-z errors.

cluster-like haloes, we study the mass loss rates of dark matter subhaloes, and
interpret the mass function of subhaloes at redshift zero in terms of the
evolution of the mass function of systems accreted by the main halo progenitor.
When expressed in terms of the ratio between the mass of the subhalo at the
time of accretion and the present day host mass the unevolved subhalo mass
function is found to be universal. However, the subhalo mass function at
redshift zero clearly depends on $M_0$, in that more massive host haloes host
more subhaloes. To relate the unevolved and evolved subhalo mass functions, we
measure the subhalo mass loss rate as a function of host mass and redshift. We
find that the average, specific mass loss rate of dark matter subhaloes depends
mainly on redshift. These results suggest a pleasingly simple picture for the
evolution and mass dependence of the evolved subhalo mass function. Less
massive host haloes accrete their subhaloes earlier, which are thus subjected
to mass loss for a longer time. In addition, their subhaloes are typically
accreted by denser hosts, which causes an additional boost of the mass loss
rate. To test the self-consistency of this picture, we use a merger trees
constructed using the extended Press-Schechter formalism, and evolve the
subhalo populations using the average mass loss rates obtained from our
simulations, finding the subhalo mass functions to be in good agreement with
the simulations. [abridged]

adapt the cross-correlation statistic for periodic GW searches by taking into
account both the non-stationarity and the long term-phase coherence of the
signal. We study the statistical properties and sensitivity of this search, its
relation to existing periodic wave searches, and describe the precise way in
which the cross-correlation statistic interpolates between semi-coherent and
fully-coherent methods. Depending on the maximum duration over we wish to
preserve phase coherence, the cross-correlation statistic can be tuned to go
from a standard cross-correlation statistic using data from distinct detectors,
to the semi-coherent time-frequency methods with increasing coherent time
baselines, and all the way to a full coherent search. This leads to a unified
framework for studying periodic wave searches and can be used to make informed
trade-offs between computational cost, sensitivity, and robustness against

relaxation time decrease rapidly with increasing current (and phase-slip rate),

cluster system of the Milky Way, taking the effect of residual gas expulsion
into account. We assume that gas embedded star clusters start with a power-law
mass function with slope \beta=2. The dissolution of the clusters is then
studied under the combined influence of residual gas expulsion driven by energy
feedback from massive stars, stellar mass-loss, two-body relaxation and an
external tidal field. The influence of residual gas expulsion is studied by
applying results from a large grid of N-body simulations computed by Baumgardt
& Kroupa (2007).
  In our model, star clusters with masses less than 10^5 M_sun lose their
residual gas on timescales much shorter than their crossing time and residual
gas expulsion is the main dissolution mechanism for star clusters, destroying
about 95% of all clusters within a few 10s of Myr. We find that in this case
the final mass function of globular clusters is established mainly by the gas
expulsion and therefore nearly independent of the strength of the external
tidal field, and that a power-law mass function for the gas embedded star
clusters is turned into a present-day log-normal one.
  Another consequence of residual gas expulsion and the associated strong
infant mortality of star clusters is that the Galactic halo stars come from
dissolved star clusters. Since field halo stars would come mainly from
low-mass, short-lived clusters, our model provides an explanation for the
observed abundance variations of light elements among globular cluster stars
and the absence of such variations among the halo field stars.

Like previous authors, we find that fully convective stars can generate
kG-strength magnetic fields (in rough equipartition with the convective flows)
without the aid of a tachocline of shear. Although our model stars are
everywhere unstably stratified, the amplitudes and typical pattern sizes of the
convective flows vary strongly with radius, with the outer regions of the stars
hosting vigorous convection and field amplification while the deep interiors
are more quiescent. Modest differential rotation is established in hydrodynamic
calculations, but -- unlike in some prior work --strongly quenched in MHD
simulations because of the Maxwell stresses exerted by the dynamo-generated
magnetic fields. Despite the lack of strong differential rotation, the magnetic
fields realized in the simulations possess significant mean (axisymmetric)

density with first-order derivatives. For a time-independent system the
Principle of Least Action reduces to the energy variational principle. For
time-dependent systems the Principle of Least Action gives time-dependent
approximations. Using a Hartree product trial wave function for a
time-dependent many-boson system, we apply the Principle of Least Action to
obtain the Gross-Pitaevskii equation that describes a Bose-Einstein condensate.

  Aug, 2008. Re-revised on Sept. 2009. Accepted fpr piblication in the IEEE
  Transactions on Signal Processing with mandatory revisions",,,,"cs.MA cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper studies the problem of distributed average consensus in sensor
networks with quantized data and random link failures. To achieve consensus,
dither (small noise) is added to the sensor states before quantization. When
the quantizer range is unbounded (countable number of quantizer levels),
stochastic approximation shows that consensus is asymptotically achieved with
probability one and in mean square to a finite random variable. We show that
the meansquared error (m.s.e.) can be made arbitrarily small by tuning the link
weight sequence, at a cost of the convergence rate of the algorithm. To study
dithered consensus with random links when the range of the quantizer is
bounded, we establish uniform boundedness of the sample paths of the unbounded
quantizer. This requires characterization of the statistical properties of the
supremum taken over the sample paths of the state of the quantizer. This is
accomplished by splitting the state vector of the quantizer in two components:
one along the consensus subspace and the other along the subspace orthogonal to
the consensus subspace. The proofs use maximal inequalities for submartingale
and supermartingale sequences. From these, we derive probability bounds on the
excursions of the two subsequences, from which probability bounds on the
excursions of the quantizer state vector follow. The paper shows how to use
these probability bounds to design the quantizer parameters and to explore
tradeoffs among the number of quantizer levels, the size of the quantization
steps, the desired probability of saturation, and the desired level of accuracy
$\epsilon$ away from consensus. Finally, the paper illustrates the quantizer
design with a numerical study.

stronger than that expected from the average SED of the local quasars given the

observations at longer wavelengths, the temperatures of the FIR-emitting warm

magnitudes indicate that the YSOs are massive (<= 10 Msun) pre-main-sequence
stars at the same distance to the SNR, i.e., 8 kpc, which supports the
association of the star-forming loop with the SNR. The dereddened spectral
energy distributions are similar to eraly Herbig Be stars, which are early

confinement to a loop structure indicates that the YSOs are young, i.e., <= 2
Myr. We propose that their formation is triggered by the progenitor star of
G54.1+0.3, which has a mass of <= 15 Msun. The triggering must have occurred
near the end of the progenitor's life, possibly after it had evolved off the

possible solution of this problem is proposed and a mechanism for crossover,
consistent with the principle of QCD, is constructed. The essence of this
mechanism is the appearance and growing up of a kind of grape-shape
perturbative vacuum inside the physical one. A dynamical percolation model
based on a simple dynamics for the delocalization of partons is constructed to
exhibit this mechanism. The crossover from hadronic matter to sQGP as well as
the transition from sQGP to wQGP in the increasing of temperature is
successfully described by using this model with a temperature dependent

baryon mass. In this paper we introduce ""cluster hypothesis"" into the model by
which mass of a complex hadron is given by the sum of masses of clusters
composing it. The hypothesis guarantees the established picture that mass
differences of hadrons of the same string junction structure are due to those
of the constituent quarks. A candidate for penta-quark baryon $\Theta$(1530

sheet cutoff) of the partition function - which is first normalized by dividing
by the integral of the two point function of a marginal operator - is a
candidate for the action. Applied to the zero-momentum tachyon it gives a
tachyon potential that is similar to those that have been obtained using
Witten's background independent formalism. This procedure is easily made gauge
invariant in the loop variable formalism by replacing $ln a$ by $\Sigma$ which
is the generalization of the Liouville mode that occurs in this formalism. We
also describe a method of resumming the Taylor expansion that is done in the
loop variable formalism. This allows one to see the pole structure of string
amplitudes that would not be visible in the original loop variable formalism.

technology, developed first for games but now deployed in virtual worlds like
Second Life, is beginning to make it possible for astrophysicists to enter
their virtual labs themselves, in virtual form as avatars. This has several
advantages, from new possibilities to explore the results of the simulations to
a shared presence in a virtual lab with remote collaborators on different

  Approaches for Bounded Channel Uncertainties","Submitted to IEEE Transaction of Signal Processing",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  We consider the downlink of a cellular system in which the base station
employs multiple transmit antennas, each receiver has a single antenna, and the
users specify. We consider communication schemes in which the users have
certain Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. We study the design of robust
broadcasting schemes that minimize the transmission power necessary to
guarantee that the QoS requirements are satisfied for all channels within
bounded uncertainty regions around the transmitter's estimate of each user's
channel. Each user's QoS requirement is formulated as a constraint on the mean
square error (MSE) in its received signal, and we show that these MSE
constraints imply constraints on the received SINR. Using the MSE constraints,
we present a unified design approach for robust linear and non-linear
transceivers with QoS requirements. The proposed designs overcome the
limitations of existing approaches that provide conservative designs or are
only applicable to the case of linear precoding. Furthermore, we provide
computationally-efficient design formulations for a rather general model of
channel uncertainty that subsumes many natural choices for the uncertainty
region. We also consider the problem of the robust counterpart to precoding
schemes that maximize the fidelity of the weakest user's signal subject to a
power constraint. For this problem, we provide quasi-convex formulations, for
both linear and non-linear transceivers, that can be efficiently solved using a
one-dimensional bisection search. Our numerical results demonstrate that in the
presence of CSI uncertainty, the proposed designs provide guarantees for a
larger range of QoS requirements than the existing approaches, and consume
require less transmission power in providing these guarantees.

(QD's) by a configuration interaction method using confinement potentials with
different profiles. The confinement potential has been parametrized by a
two-centre power-exponential function, which allows us to investigate various
types of QD's described by either soft or hard potentials of different range.
For the soft (Gaussian) confinement potential the exchange energy decreases
with increasing interdot distance due to the decreasing interdot tunnelling.
For the hard (rectangular-like) confinement potential we have found a
non-monotonic behaviour of the exchange interaction as a function of distance
between the confinement potential centres. In this case, the exchange
interaction energy exhibits a pronounced maximum for the confinement potential
profile which corresponds to the nanostructure composed of the small inner QD
with a deep potential well embedded in the large outer QD with a shallow
potential well. This effect results from the strong localization of electrons
in the inner QD, which leads to the large singlet-triplet splitting.
Implications of this finding for quantum logic operations have been discussed.

Phys",,"10.1063/1.2841128",,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  Recently, the intrinsic sampling method has been developed in order to
obtain, from molecular simulations, the intrinsic structure of the liquid-vapor
interface that is presupposed in the classical capillary wave theory. Our
purpose here is to study dynamical processes at the liquid-vapor interface,
since this method allows tracking down and analyzing the movement of surface
molecules, thus providing, with great accuracy, dynamical information on
molecules that are ""at"" the interface. We present results for the coefficients
for diffusion parallel and perpendicular to the liquid-vapor interface of the
Lennard-Jones fluid, as well as other time and length parameters that
characterize the diffusion process in this system. We also obtain statistics of
permanence and residence time. The generality of our results is tested by
varying the system size and the temperature; for the later case, an existing
model for alkali metals is also considered. Our main conclusion is that, even
if diffusion coefficients can still be computed, the turnover processes, by
which molecules enter and leave the intrinsic surface, are as important as
diffusion. For example, the typical time required for a molecule to traverse a
molecular diameter is very similar to its residence time at the surface.

confirmed to be perfectly invisible to the external incident wave. The

to the fields in the original space via coordinate transformation functions. At
the exterior boundary of the cloak, it is shown that no reflection is excited
even though the permittivity and permeability do not always have a perfect
matched layer form. While at the inner boundary, no reflection is excited
either, and in particular no field can penetrate into the cloaked region.
However, for the inner boundary of any line transformed cloak, the permittivity
and permeability in a specific tangential direction are always required to be
infinitely large. Furthermore, the field discontinuity at the inner boundary
always exists; the surface current is induced to make this discontinuity
self-consistent. For a point transformed cloak, it does not experience such
problems. The tangential fields at the inner boundary are all zero, implying no
field discontinuity exists

  pages, 8 figures",,"10.1016/j.optcom.2008.03.023","DESY 07-221","physics.acc-ph physics.optics",,"  We propose a technique, to be used for time-resolved pump-probe experiments,
for timing an x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) to a high-power conventional
laser with femtosecond accuracy. Our method takes advantage of the same
electron bunch to produce both an XFEL pulse and an ultrashort optical pulse
with the help of an optical radiator downstream of the x-ray undulator. Since
both pulses are produced by the same electron bunch, they are perfectly
synchronized. Application of cross-correlation techniques will allow to
determine relative jitter between the optical pulse (and, thus, the XFEL pulse)
and a pulse from an external pump-laser with femtosecond resolution. Technical
realization of the proposed timing scheme uses an optical replica synthesizer
(ORS) setup to be installed after the final bunch-compression stage of the
XFEL. The electron bunch is modulated in the ORS setup by an external optical
laser. Subsequently, it travels through the main undulator, and produces the
XFEL pulse. Finally, a powerful optical pulse of coherent edge radiation is
generated as the bunch passes through a long straight section and a separation
magnet downstream of the main undulator. Our study shows that at a moderate
(about 10%) density modulation of the electron bunch at the location of the
optical radiator allows production of high power x-ray and optical pulses.
Relative synchronization of these pulses is preserved by using the same
mechanical support for both x-ray and optical elements transporting radiation
down to the experimental area, where single-shot cross-correlation between
optical pulse and pump-laser pulse is performed. We illustrate the potential of
the proposed timing technique with numerical examples referring to the European
XFEL facility.

The observed low-lying rotational transitions trace a much more extended

transitions. We resolve the hollow quasi-spherical distribution of the
molecular emissions into a number of clumpy shells. These molecular shells
coincide spatially with dust arcs seen in deep optical images of the IRC+10216
envelope, allowing us to study for the first time the kinematics of these

enhancements in the envelope separated in time by $\sim$120 to $\sim$360 yrs.
From the angular size and velocity spread of the shells, we estimate that each
shell typically covers about 10% of the stellar surface at the time of
ejection. The distribution of the shells seems to be random in space. The good
spatial correspondance between HC$_3$N and HC$_5$N emissions is in qualitative
agreement with a recent chemical model that takes into account the presence of

the stresses that are due to non-singular screw dislocation. The stress
distribution of second order around the screw dislocation is classically known
for the hollow circular cylinder with traction-free external and internal
boundaries. The inner boundary surrounds the dislocation's core, which is not
captured by the conventional solution. The present gauge approach enables us to
continue the classically known quadratic stresses inside the core. The gauge
equation is chosen in the Hilbert--Einstein form, and it plays the role of
non-conventional incompatibility law. The stress function method is used, and
it leads to the modified stress potential given by two constituents: the
conventional one, say, the `background' and a short-ranged gauge contribution.
The latter just causes additional stresses, which are localized. The asymptotic
properties of the resulting stresses are studied. Since the gauge contributions
are short-ranged, the background stress field dominates sufficiently far from
the core. The outer cylinder's boundary is traction-free. At sufficiently
moderate distances, the second order stresses acquire regular continuation
within the core region, and the cut-off at the core does not occur. Expressions
for the asymptotically far stresses provide self-consistently new length scales
dependent on the elastic parameters. These lengths could characterize an
exteriority of the dislocation core region.

Under our cold plasma assumption, we have considered two types of wave
propagation: fast magnetoacoustic and Alfv\'en waves. We find that the fast
magnetoacoustic wave experiences refraction towards the magnetic null point,
and that the effect of this refraction depends upon the Alfv\'en speed profile.
The wave, and thus the wave energy, accumulates at the null point. We have
found that current build up is exponential and the exponent is dependent upon
$\epsilon$. Thus, for the fast wave there is preferential heating at the null
point. For the Alfv\'en wave, we find that the wave propagates along the
fieldlines. For an Alfv\'en wave generated along the fan-plane, the wave
accumulates along the spine. For an Alfv\'en wave generated across the spine,
the value of $\epsilon$ determines where the wave accumulation will occur:
fan-plane ($\epsilon=1$), along the $x-$axis ($0<\epsilon <1$) or along the
$y-$axis ($\epsilon>1$). We have shown analytically that currents build up
exponentially, leading to preferential heating in these areas. The work
described here highlights the importance of understanding the magnetic topology
of the coronal magnetic field for the location of wave heating.

charged particles, which initially spiral into the BH hole along the equatorial

power of anisotropic electromagnetic emission from an UHECR source near a
supermassive BH should be at least 10-100 times larger then UHECR power of the
source. This implies that if the number of UHECR sources within the 100 Mpc
sphere is ~100, the power of electromagnetic emission which accompanies proton
acceleration in each source, $10^{42-43}$ erg/s, is comparable to the typical
luminosities of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the local Universe. We also
explore the acceleration of heavy nuclei, for which the constraints on the
electromagnetic luminosity and on the alignment of magnetic field in the gap

study in detail one of them, HD 200775, to determine if its magnetic topology
is similar to that of the main sequence magnetic stars. With this aim, we
monitored this star in Stokes I and V over more than two years, using the new
spectropolarimeters ESPaDOnS at CFHT, and Narval at TBL. Using our data, we
find that HD 200775 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, whose
secondary seems similar, in temperature, to the primary. We determine the
luminosity ratio of the system, and using the luminosity of the system found in
literature, we derive the luminosity of both stars. From our measurements of
the radial velocities of both stars we determine the ephemeris and the orbital
parameters of the system. We have fitted 30 Stokes V profiles simultaneously,
using a chi2 minimisation method, with a decentered-dipole model. The best-fit
model provides a rotation period of 4.3281 d an inclination angle of 60
degrees, and a magnetic obliquity angle of 125 degrees. The polar strength of
the magnetic dipole field is 1000 G, which is decentered by 0.05 R* from the
center of the star. The derived magnetic field model is qualitatively identical
to those commonly observed in the Ap/Bp stars, which bring strong argument in
favour of the fossil field hypothesis, to explain the origin of the magnetic
fields in the main sequence Ap/Bp stars. Our determination of the inclination
of the rotation axis leads to a radius of the primary which is smaller than
that derived from the HR diagram position. This can be explained by a larger
intrinsic luminosity of the secondary relative to the primary, due to a larger
circumstellar extinction of the secondary relative to the primary.

theory the choice of exchange and correlation functional may dramatically
affect the results. In particular local and semi-local functionals tend to
over-delocalize the molecular levels thus artificially increasing their
broadening. In addition the same molecular levels are usually misplaced with
respect to the Fermi level of the electrodes. These shortfalls are reminiscent
of the inability of local functionals to describe Mott-Hubbard insulators, but
they can be corrected with a simple and computationally undemanding
self-interaction correction scheme. We apply such a scheme, as implemented in
our transport code Smeagol, to a variety of phenyl-based molecular junctions
attached to gold electrodes. In general the corrections reduce the current,
since the resonant Kohn-Sham states of the molecule are shifted away from the
contact Fermi level. In contrast, when the junction is already described as
insulating by local exchange and correlation potentials, the corrections are
minimal and the I-V is only weakly modified.

  clusters","12 pages, 10 figures, accepted by A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20078897",,"astro-ph",,"  The total mass of distant star clusters is often derived from the virial
theorem, using line-of-sight velocity dispersion measurements and half-light
radii. Although most stars form in binary systems, this is mostly ignored when
interpreting the observations. The components of binary stars exhibit orbital
motion, which may increase the measured velocity dispersion, and may therefore
result in a dynamical mass overestimation. In this paper we quantify the effect
of neglecting the binary population on the derivation of the dynamical mass of
a star cluster. We simulate star clusters numerically, and study the dependence
of the derived dynamical mass on the properties of the binary population. We
find that the presence of binaries plays a crucial role for very sparse
clusters with a stellar density comparable to that of the field star population
(~0.1 stars/pc3), as the velocity dispersion is fully dominated by the binary
orbital motion. For such clusters, the dynamical mass may overestimate the true
mass by up to an order of magnitude. For very dense clusters (>10^7 stars/pc3),
binaries do not affect the dynamical mass estimation significantly. For
clusters of intermediate density (0.1-10^7 stars/pc3), the dynamical mass can
be overestimated by 10-100%, depending on the properties of the binary
population.
