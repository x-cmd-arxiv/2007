different galaxy types and redshifts. We find that the surface brightness prior
eliminates a large fraction of outliers by lifting the degeneracy between the

of 2 with the prior for both the ground and space data. Ongoing and planned

can be realized in the context of the racetrack-based Kallosh-Linde model (KL)

slow-rolling down from a flat hill-top or inflection point of the scalar
potential. This situation can be quite generic in the landscape, where by
uplifting one of the two adjacent minima one can turn the barrier either to a
flat saddle point or to an inflection point supporting eternal inflation. The
resulting spectral index is tunable in the range of 0.93 < n_s < 1, and there
is only negligible production of primordial gravitational waves r < 10^{-6}.
The flatness of the potential in this scenario requires fine-tuning, which may
be justified taking into account the exponential reward by volume factors
preferring the regions of the universe with the maximal amount of slow-roll
inflation. This consideration leads to a tentative prediction of the spectral
index $n_s\approx 0.95$ or $n_s \approx 0.93$ depending on whether the

  figures and 4 tables",,"10.1086/527553",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a numerical study of the evolution of galaxy clustering when
galaxies flow passively from high redshift, respecting the continuity equation
throughout. While passive flow is a special case of galaxy evolution, it allows
a well-defined study of galaxy ancestry and serves as an interesting limit to
be compared to non-passive cases. We use dissipationless N-body simulations,
assign galaxies to massive halos at z=1 and z=2 using various HOD models, and
trace these galaxy particles to lower redshift while conserving their number.
We find that passive flow results in an asymptotic convergence at low redshift
in the HOD and in galaxy clustering on scales above ~3Mpc/h for a wide range of
initial HODs. As galaxies become less biased with respect to mass
asymptotically with time, the HOD parameters evolve such that M1/Mm decreases
while alpha converges toward unity, where Mm is the characteristic halo mass to
host a central galaxy, M1 is the halo mass to host one satellite galaxy, and
alpha is the power-law index in the halo-mass dependence of the average number
of satellites per halo. The satellite populations converge toward the Poisson
distribution at low redshift. The convergence is robust for different number
densities and is enhanced when galaxies evolve from higher redshift. We compare
our results with the observed LRG sample from Sloan Digital Sky Survey that has
the same number density. We claim that if LRGs have experienced a strict
passive flow, their <N_g(M)> should be close to a power law with an index of
unity in halo mass. Discrepancies could be due to dry galaxy merging or new
members arising between the initial and the final redshifts. The spatial
distribution of passively flowing galaxies within halos appears on average more
concentrated than the halo mass profile at low redshift. (abridged)

canonical quantization beginning from first quantization of the Dirac
Hamiltonian constraints up to the second quantization by the Von

show that using of the Bogoliubov-Heinsenberg static operator basis leads to

large number of configurations. We have considered reconstructions restricted
to the topmost bilayer and studied two types: i) ""flat"" surface-bilayer models,
where atoms at the topmost bilayer present different coordinations and
registries with the underlying bulk, and ii) nine different models based on the
substitution of a silicon atom by a gold atom in different positions of a
$\pi$-bonded chain reconstruction of the Si(553) surface. We have developed a
compact notation that allows us to label and identify all these structures.
This is very useful for the automatic generation of trial geometries and
counting the number of inequivalent structures, i.e., structures having
different bonding topologies. The most stable models are those that exhibit a
honeycomb-chain structure at the step edge. One of our models (model f2)
reproduces the main features of the room temperature photoemission and

C18O(1-0), and HC3N(12-11) to map the core towards IRAS 20050+2720. The

three sources, labeled OVRO 1, OVRO 2, and OVRO 3. Two of them, OVRO 1 and OVRO
2, have also been detected at 7 mm. OVRO 3, which is located close to the C18O
emission peak, could be associated with IRAS 20050+2720. The mass of the
sources, estimated from the dust continuum emission, is 6.5 Msun for OVRO 1,
1.8 Msun for OVRO 2, and 1.3 Msun for OVRO 3. The CO(1-0) emission traces two
bipolar outflows within the OVRO field of view, a roughly east-west bipolar
outflow, labeled A, driven by the intermediate-mass source OVRO 1, and a
northeast-southwest bipolar outflow, labeled B, probably powered by a YSO
engulfed in the circumstellar envelope surrounding OVRO 1.

main-sequence life. While the solar photospheric luminosity was about 30% lower
4.6 Gyr ago when the Sun arrived on the main sequence compared to present-day
levels, its faster rotation generated enhanced magnetic activity; magnetic
heating processes in the chromosphere, the transition region, and the corona
induced ultraviolet, extreme-ultraviolet, and X-ray emission about 10, 100, and
1000 times, respectively, the present-day levels, as inferred from young
solar-analog stars. Also, the production rate of accelerated, high-energy
particles was orders of magnitude higher than in present-day solar flares, and
a much stronger wind escaped from the Sun, permeating the entire solar system.
The consequences of the enhanced radiation and particle fluxes from the young
Sun were potentially severe for the evolution of solar-system planets and
moons. Interactions of high-energy radiation and the solar wind with upper
planetary atmospheres may have led to the escape of important amounts of
atmospheric constituents. The present dry atmosphere of Venus and the thin
atmosphere of Mars may be a product of early irradiation and heating by solar
high-energy radiation. High levels of magnetic activity are also inferred for
the pre-main sequence Sun. At those stages, interactions of high-energy
radiation and particles with the circumsolar disk in which planets eventually
formed were important. Traces left in meteorites by energetic particles and
anomalous isotopic abundance ratios in meteoritic inclusions may provide
evidence for a highly active pre-main sequence Sun. The present article reviews
these various issues related to the magnetic activity of the young Sun and the
consequent interactions with its environment.

for example, the LMC and SMC may be approaching the Milky Way for the first
time; they might not have been in a binary system; and the origin of the
Magellanic Stream needs to be re-examined. Motivated by these implications, we
have reanalyzed the original data in order to check the validity of these
measurements. Our work has produced a proper motion for the LMC that is in
excellent agreement with that of Kallivayalil et al., and for the SMC that is
in acceptable agreement.
  We have detected a dependence between the brightness of stars and their mean
measured motion in a majority of the fields in both our reduction and that of
Kallivayalil et al. Correcting for this systematic error and for the errors
caused by the decreasing charge transfer efficiency of the detector produces
better agreement between the measurements from different fields. With our
improved reduction, we do not need to exclude any fields from the final
averages and, for the first time using proper motions, we are able to detect
the rotation of the LMC. The best-fit amplitude of the rotation curve at a
radius of 275 arcmin in the disk plane is $120 \pm 15$ km s$^{-1}$. This value
is larger than the 60--70 km s$^{-1}$ derived from the radial velocities of HI

even). This transform is in some sense the unique and natural unitary operator
on L^2(C), as is the case with the Euclidean Fourier transform.
  Inspired by recent developments of algebraic representation theory of
reductive groups, we shed new light on classical analysis on the one hand, and
give the global formulas for the L^2-model of the minimal representation of the
simple Lie group G=O(n_1+1,n_2+1) on the other hand.
  The transform F_C expands functions on C into joint eigenfunctions of the n
commuting, self-adjoint, second order differential operators. We decompose F_C
into the singular Radon transform and the Mellin--Barnes integral, find its
distribution kernel, and establish the inversion and the Plancherel formula.
F_C reduces to the Hankel transform if G is O(n,2) or O(3,3).
  The unitary operator F_C together with the simple action of the conformal
transformation group generates the minimal representation of the indefinite
orthogonal group G. Various different models of the same representation have

Torasso, Brylinski, and Kobayashi-Orsted, and others. Among them, our model
built on L^2(C) generalizes the classic Schrodinger model of the Weil
representation.
  Yet another motif is special functions. Large group symmetries in the minimal

the cosmological horizon of a certain class of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
backgrounds. Those properties are generalised to a larger class of expanding
spacetimes $M$ admitting a geodesically complete cosmological horizon $\scrim$
common to all co-moving observers. This structure is later exploited in order
to recast, in a cosmological background, some recent results for a linear
scalar quantum field theory in spacetimes asymptotically flat at null infinity.
Under suitable hypotheses on $M$, encompassing both the cosmological de Sitter
background and a large class of other FRW spacetimes, the algebra of
observables for a Klein-Gordon field is mapped into a subalgebra of the algebra
of observables $\cW(\scrim)$ constructed on the cosmological horizon. There is
exactly one pure quasifree state $\lambda$ on $\cW(\scrim)$ which fulfils a
suitable energy-positivity condition with respect to a generator related with
the cosmological time displacements. Furthermore $\lambda$ induces a preferred
physically meaningful quantum state $\lambda_M$ for the quantum theory in the
bulk. If $M$ admits a timelike Killing generator preserving $\scrim$, then the
associated self-adjoint generator in the GNS representation of $\lambda_M$ has
positive spectrum (i.e. energy). Moreover $\lambda_M$ turns out to be invariant
under every symmetry of the bulk metric which preserves the cosmological
horizon. In the case of an expanding de Sitter spacetime, $\lambda_M$ coincides
with the Euclidean (Bunch-Davies) vacuum state, hence being Hadamard in this
case. Remarks on the validity of the Hadamard property for $\lambda_M$ in more
general spacetimes are presented.

behavior of an ensemble of cold atoms interacting with a coherent
electromagnetic field. The atomic motion along the self-generated
spatially-periodic force field can be interpreted as the rotation of a phase
oscillator. This suggests a relationship with synchronization transitions
occurring in globally coupled rotators. In fact, we show that whenever the
field dynamics can be adiabatically eliminated, the model reduces to a
self-consistent equation for the probability distribution of the atomic
""phases"". In this limit, there exists a formal equivalence with the Kuramoto
model, though with important differences in the self-consistency conditions.
Depending on the field-cavity detuning, we show that the onset of synchronized
behavior may occur through either a first- or second-order phase transition.
Furthermore, we find a secondary threshold, above which a periodic self-pulsing
regime sets in, that is immediately followed by the unlocking of the
forward-field frequency. At yet higher, but still experimentally meaningful,
input intensities, irregular, chaotic oscillations may eventually appear.
Finally, we derive a simpler model, involving only five scalar variables, which
is able to reproduce the entire phenomenology exhibited by the original model.

the thorax, without the commonly adopted assumption of repeatable breath
cycles. The model describes the motion of a volume of interest within the
patient, based on a reference 3-dimensional image (at end-expiration), and the
diaphragm positions at different time points. The input data are
respiration-correlated CT images of patients treated for nonsmall cell lung
cancer, consisting of 3D images, including the diaphragm positions, at 10
phases of the respiratory cycle. A deformable image registration algorithm
calculates the deformation field that maps each 3D image to the reference 3D
image. A principle component analysis is performed to parameterize the 3D
deformation field in terms of the diaphragm motion. We show that the first two
principal components are adequate to accurately and completely describe the
organ motion in the data of 4 patients. Artifacts in the RCCT images that
commonly occur at the mid-respiration states are reduced in the model-generated
images. Further validation of the model is demonstrated in the successful
application of the parameterized 3D deformation field to RCCT data of the same
patient but acquired several days later. We have developed a method for
predicting respiration-induced organ motion in patients that has potential for
improving the accuracy of dose calculation in radiotherapy.

nature of fast magnetoacoustic and Alfv\'en waves is investigated in a 2D
$\beta=0$ plasma in the neighbourhood of two dipoles. We use both numerical
simulations (two-step Lax-Wendroff scheme) and analytical techniques (WKB
approximation). It is found that the propagation of the linear fast wave is
dictated by the Alfv\'en speed profile and that close to the null, the wave is
attracted to the neutral point. However, it is also found that in this magnetic
configuration some of the wave can escape the refraction effect; this had not
been seen in previous investigations by the authors. The wave split occurs near
the regions of very high Alfv\'en speed (found near the loci of the two
dipoles). Also, for the set-up investigated it was found that 40% of the wave
energy accumulates at the null. Ohmic dissipation will then extract the wave
energy at this point. The Alfv\'en wave behaves in a different manner in that
part of the wave accumulates along the separatrices and part escapes. Hence,
the current density will accumulate at this part of the topology and this is
where wave heating will occur. The phenomenon of wave accumulation at a
specific place is a feature of both wave types, as is the result that a
fraction of the wave can now escape the numerical box when propagating in this
magnetic configuration.

due to the single particle excitation across the CDW gap and the Drude weight.
We establish that the gap decreases upon compressing the lattice, while the
Drude weight increases. This signals a reduction in the quality of nesting upon
applying pressure, therefore inducing a lesser impact of the CDW condensate on
the electronic properties of LaTe$_2$. The consequent suppression of the CDW
gap leads to a release of additional charge carriers, manifested by the shift
of weight from the gap feature into the metallic component of the optical
response. On the contrary, the power-law behavior, seen in the optical
conductivity at energies above the gap excitation and indicating a weakly

fast wave is attracted to that point and the front of the wave slows down as it
approaches the null point, causing the current density to accumulate there and
rise rapidly. Ohmic dissipation will extract the energy in the wave at this
point. This illustrates that null points play an important role in the rapid
dissipation of fast magnetoacoustic waves and suggests the location where wave
heating will occur in the corona. The Alfv\'en wave behaves in a different
manner in that the wave energy is dissipated along the separatrices. For
Alfv\'en waves that are decoupled from fast waves, the value of the plasma

controlling light propagation and nonlinear wave mixing in atomic gases with
potential applications ranging from quantum computing to table top tests of
general relativity. Here we consider EIT in an atomic Bose-Einstein Condensate
(BEC) trapped in a double well potential. A weak probe laser propagates through
one of the wells and interacts with atoms in a three-level $\Lambda$
configuration. The well through which the probe propagates is dressed by a
strong control laser with Rabi frequency $\Omega_{\mu}$, as in standard EIT
systems. Tunneling between the wells at the frequency $g$ provides a coherent
coupling between identical electronic states in the two wells, which leads to
the formation of inter-well dressed states. The tunneling in conjunction with
the macroscopic interwell coherence of the BEC wave function, results in the
formation of two ultra-narrow absorption resonances for the probe field that
are inside of the ordinary EIT transparency window. We show that these new
resonances can be interpreted in terms of the inter-well dressed states and the
formation of a novel type of dark state involving the control laser and the
inter-well tunneling. To either side of these ultra-narrow resonances there is
normal dispersion with very large slope controlled by $g$. For realistic values
of $g$, the large slope of this dispersion yields group velocities for the
probe field that are two orders of magnitude slower than standard EIT systems.
We discuss prospects for observing these ultra-narrow resonances and the
corresponding regions of high dispersion experimentally.

McLaughlin & Hood (2004). It is found that the fast wave is attracted to the
null points and that the front of the wave slows down as it approaches the null
point pair, with the wave splitting and part of the wave accumulating at one
null and the rest at the other. Current density will then accumulate at these
points and ohmic dissipation will then extract the energy in the wave at these
points. This suggests locations where wave heating will occur in the corona.
The Alfv\'en wave behaves in a different manner in that the wave accumulates
along the separatrices. Hence, the current density will accumulate at this part
of the topology and this is where wave heating will occur. However, the
phenomenon of wave accumulation at a specific place is a feature of both wave

is a proton superconductor and a neutron superfluid, but our treatment is
general and simple, modeling the interactions as a Ginzburg-Landau effective
theory with four-fermion couplings, including only s-wave pairing. We
numerically solve the field equations for flux tubes with an arbitrary number
of flux quanta, and compare their energies. This allows us to map the
type-I/type-II transition in the superconductor, which occurs at the
conventional kappa = 1/sqrt(2) if the condensates are uncoupled.
  We find that a density coupling between the condensates raises the critical
kappa and, for a sufficiently high neutron density, resolves the type-I/type-II
transition line into an infinite number of bands corresponding to
``type-II(n)'' phases, in which n, the number of quanta in the favored flux
tube, steps from 1 to infinity. For lower neutron density, the coupling creates
spinodal regions around the type-I/type-II boundary, in which metastable flux
configurations are possible. We find that a gradient coupling between the
condensates lowers the critical kappa and creates spinodal regions. These
exotic phenomena may not occur in nuclear matter, which is thought to be deep

concrete models of gauge mediation. Generation of gaugino masses requires that
R-symmetry be broken in this vacuum. In general, there are two possible ways to
break R-symmetry, explicitly or spontaneously. We find that the MSSM
phenomenology depends crucially on how this breaking occurs in the Hidden
Sector. Explicit R-symmetry breaking models can lead to fairly standard gauge
mediation, but we argue that in the context of ISS-type models this only makes
sense if B=0 at the mediation scale, which leads to high tan(beta). If on the
other hand, R-symmetry is broken spontaneously, then R-symmetry violating soft
terms tend to be suppressed with respect to R-symmetry preserving ones, and one
is led to a scenario with large scalar masses. These models interpolate between
standard gauge mediation and split SUSY models. We provide benchmark points for
the two scenarios. They demonstrate that the specific dynamics of the Hidden
Sector -- the underlying nature of supersymmetry and R-symmetry breaking --
affects considerably the mass spectrum of the MSSM, and vice versa.

the sign of its dimensionally reduced, $T$-duality invariant, part is conserved
when the energy density of the universe is positive. Thus, many interesting
solutions for which this sign is positive end up in a future curvature
singularity. Because of this, some of the thermodynamic phases of the usual
gravitating string gases behave like superselection sectors. For example, a
past-regular Hagedorn phase and an expanding FRW phase dominated by string
momentum modes cannot be smoothly connected in the framework of string
cosmology with positive sources. The singularity separates them like a
geometric precipice in the moduli space, preventing the dynamics of the theory
from bridging across. Sources which simultaneously violate the positivity of
energy and NEC could modify these conclusions. We provide a quantitative
measure of positivity of energy and NEC violations that would be necessary for
such transitions. These effects must dominate the universe at the moment of
transition, altering the standard gas pictures. At present, it is not known how

galaxies'' (UCDs), was discovered in the last decade. Recent studies show that
their dynamical mass-to-light ratios (M/L) tend to be too high to be explained
by canonical stellar populations, being on average about twice as large as
those of Galactic globular clusters of comparable metallicity. If this offset
is caused by dark matter in UCDs, it would imply dark matter densities as
expected for the centers of cuspy dark matter halos, incompatible with cored
dark matter profiles. Investigating the nature of the high M/L ratios in UCDs
therefore offers important constraints on the phase space properties of dark
matter particles. Here we describe an observational method to test whether a
bottom-heavy IMF may cause the high M/L ratios of UCDs. We propose to use the
CO index at 2.3mu -- which is sensitive to the presence of low-mass stars -- to
test for a bottom heavy IMF. In the case that the high M/L ratios are caused by
a bottom-heavy IMF, we show that the equivalent width of the CO index will be
up to 30% weaker in UCDs compared to sources with similar metallicity that have
canonical IMFs. We find that these effects are well detectable with current
astronomical facilities in a reasonable amount of time (a few hours to nights).
Measuring the CO index of UCDs hence appears a promising tool to investigate
the origin of their high M/L ratios.

compactness parameter, C, which characterizes the specific intensity of the
radiation field at ionization fronts in HII regions, and which controls the
shape of the far-IR dust re-emission, often referred to loosely as the dust
``temperature''. We also investigate the effect of metallicity on the overall
SED and in particular, on the strength of the PAH features. We provide
templates for the mean emission produced by the young compact HII regions, the
older (10 - 100 Myr) stars and for the wavelength-dependent attenuation
produced by a foreground screen of the dust used in our model. We demonstrate
that these components may be combined to produce a excellent fit to the
observed SEDs of star formation dominated galaxies which are often used as
templates (Arp 220 and NGC 6240). This fit extends from the Lyman Limit to
wavelengths of about one mm. The methods presented in both this paper and in
the previous papers of this series allow the extraction of the physical
parameters of the starburst region (star formation rates, star formation rate
history, mean cluster mass, metallicity, dust attenuation and pressure) from

delayed enrichment from Type Ia SNe and stellar (AGB) mass loss, and we
individually track C, O, Si, and Fe. Following on the successes of the
momentum-driven wind scalings, we improve our implementation with an on-the-fly
galaxy finder to derive wind properties based on host galaxy masses. By
tracking wind particles in a suite of simulations, we find: (1) Wind material
reaccretes onto a galaxy on a recycling timescale that varies inversely with
galaxy mass. Hence metals driven into the IGM by galactic superwinds cannot be
assumed to leave their galaxy forever. Wind material is typically recycled
several times; the median number of ejections for a given wind particle is 3,
so by z=0 the total mass ejected in winds exceeds 0.5\Omega_b. (2) The physical
distance winds travel is fairly independent of redshift and galaxy mass (60-100
physical kpc). For sizable galaxies at later epochs, winds typically do not
escape the galaxy halo, and rain back down in a halo fountain. High-z galaxies
enrich a significantly larger comoving volume of the IGM, with metals migrating
back into galaxies to lower z. (3) The energy imparted into winds scales with
M_{gal}^{1/3}, and energy from another source besides SNe (such as photons from
young stars) may be required to distributed cosmic metals as observed. (4) The
production of all 4 metals tracked is globally dominated by Type II SNe at all
epochs. However, intracluster gas iron content triples as a result of non-Type
II sources, and the low-z IGM carbon content is boosted by AGB feedback.

absorbers known in the spectra of high redshift QSOs, using new and archival
observations obtained with UV-sensitive echelle spectrographs on the Keck and

lines in these systems allows us to measure the abundances of several elements,
and in particular those of C, N, and O, a group that is difficult to study in
DLAs of more typical metallicities. We find that when the oxygen abundance is
less than about 1/100 of solar, the C/O ratio in high redshift DLAs and
sub-DLAs matches that of halo stars of similar metallicity and shows higher
values than expected from galactic chemical evolution models based on
conventional stellar yields. Furthermore, there are indications that at these
low metallicities the N/O ratio may also be above simple expectations and may
exhibit a minimum value, as proposed by Centurion and her collaborators in
2003. Both results can be interpreted as evidence for enhanced production of C
and N by massive stars in the first few episodes of star formation, in our
Galaxy and in the distant proto-galaxies seen as QSO absorbers. The higher
stellar yields implied may have an origin in stellar rotation which promotes
mixing in the stars' interiors, as considered in some recent model

complex ways over 3--6 yr. Variation occurs in discrete regions which are only
a few thousand km/s wide, and the distribution of the change in absorption
equivalent width broadens over time. We constrain the typical CIV BAL lifetime
to be at least a few decades. While we do not find evidence to support a
scenario in which the variation is primarily driven by photoionization on
multi-year time scales, there is some indication that the variation is produced
by changes in outflow geometry. We do not observe significant changes in the
BAL onset velocity, indicating that the absorber is either far from the source
or is being continually replenished and is azimuthally symmetric.
  It is not possible in a human lifetime to expand the time scales in our study
by more than a factor of a few using optical spectroscopy. However, the strong
variation we have observed in some BALs indicates that future studies of large

recent observations of early X-ray afterglows of long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB)
with the Swift satellite. This is a three-stage model within the context of a
core-collapse supernova. STAGE 1 is an accreting (proto-) neutron star leading
to a possible delay between the core collapse and the GRB. STAGE 2 is accretion
onto a quark-star, launching an ultrarelativistic jet generating the prompt
GRB. This jet also creates the afterglow as the jet interacts with the
surrounding medium creating an external shock. Slower shells ejected from the
quark star (during accretion), can re-energize the external shock leading to a
flatter segment in the X-ray afterglow. STAGE 3, which occurs only if the
quark-star collapses to form a black-hole, consists of an accreting black-hole.
The jet launched in this accretion process interacts with the preceding quark
star jet, and could generate the flaring activity frequently seen in early
X-ray afterglows. Alternatively, a STAGE 2b can occur in our model if the quark
star does not collapse to a black hole. The quark star in this case can then
spin down due to magnetic braking, and the spin down energy may lead to
flattening in the X-ray afterglow as well. This model seems to account for both
the energies and the timescales of GRBs, in addition to the newly discovered
early X-ray afterglow features.

enable statistically significant measurements of spatial organization within
the brain such as nearest-neighbor and microcolumnarity measurements. In this
paper, we introduce an Automated Neuron Recognition Algorithm (ANRA) which
obtains the (x,y) location of individual neurons within digitized images of
Nissl-stained, 30 micron thick, frozen sections of the cerebral cortex of the
Rhesus monkey. Identification of neurons within such Nissl-stained sections is
inherently difficult due to the variability in neuron staining, the overlap of
neurons, the presence of partial or damaged neurons at tissue surfaces, and the
presence of non-neuron objects, such as glial cells, blood vessels, and random
artifacts. To overcome these challenges and identify neurons, ANRA applies a
combination of image segmentation and machine learning. The steps involve
active contour segmentation to find outlines of potential neuron cell bodies
followed by artificial neural network training using the segmentation
properties (size, optical density, gyration, etc.) to distinguish between
neuron and non-neuron segmentations. ANRA positively identifies 86[5]% neurons
with 15[8]% error (mean[st.dev.]) on a wide range of Nissl-stained images,
whereas semi-automatic methods obtain 80[7]%/17[12]%. A further advantage of
ANRA is that it affords an unlimited increase in speed from semi-automatic
methods, and is computationally efficient, with the ability to recognize ~100
neurons per minute using a standard personal computer. ANRA is amenable to
analysis of huge photo-montages of Nissl-stained tissue, thereby opening the
door to fast, efficient and quantitative analysis of vast stores of archival
material that exist in laboratories and research collections around the world.

  Wireless Networks",,,,,"cs.NI cs.PF",,"  This work started out with our accidental discovery of a pattern of
throughput distributions among links in IEEE 802.11 networks from experimental
results. This pattern gives rise to an easy computation method, which we term
back-of-the-envelop (BoE) computation, because for many network configurations,
very accurate results can be obtained within minutes, if not seconds, by simple
hand computation. BoE beats prior methods in terms of both speed and accuracy.
While the computation procedure of BoE is simple, explaining why it works is by
no means trivial. Indeed the majority of our investigative efforts have been
devoted to the construction of a theory to explain BoE. This paper models an
ideal CSMA network as a set of interacting on-off telegraph processes. In
developing the theory, we discovered a number of analytical techniques and
observations that have eluded prior research, such as that the carrier-sensing
interactions among links in an ideal CSMA network result in a system state
evolution that is time-reversible; and that the probability distribution of the
system state is insensitive to the distributions of the ""on"" and ""off""
durations given their means, and is a Markov random field. We believe these
theoretical frameworks are useful not just for explaining BoE, but could also
be a foundation for a fundamental understanding of how links in CSMA networks
interact. Last but not least, because of their basic nature, we surmise that
some of the techniques and results developed in this paper may be applicable to
not just CSMA networks, but also to other physical and engineering systems
consisting of entities interacting with each other in time and space.

a fitting model in which the effective temperature profile obeys the relation
$T_{\rm eff} \propto r^{-p}$, with $r$ being the disk radius and $p$ being
treated as a fitting parameter. We first numerically calculate the theoretical
flow structure and its spectra for a given black-hole mass, $M$, and accretion
rate, $\dot{M}$. Through fitting to the theoretical spectra by the extended DBB
model, we can estimate the black-hole mass, $M_{\rm x}$, assuming that the
innermost disk radius is $r_{\rm in}=3r_{\rm g} (\propto M_{\rm x})$, where
$r_{\rm g}$ is the Schwarzschild radius. We find, however, that the estimated
mass deviates from that adopted in the spectral calculations, $M$, even for
low-$\dot{M}$ cases. We also find that the deviations can be eliminated by
introducing a new correction for the innermost radius. Using this correction,
we calculate mass correction factors, $M/M_{\rm x}$, in the super-critical
regimes for some sets of $M$ and $\dot M$, finding that a mass correction
factor ranges between $M/M_{\rm x} \sim$ 1.2 -- 1.6. The higher is $\dot{M}$,
the larger does the mass correction factor tend to be. Since the correction is
relatively small, we can safely conclude that the black holes in ULXs which
Vierdayanti et al. (2006, PASJ, 58, 915) analyzed are stellar-mass black holes
with the mass being $< 100M_{\odot}$.

mantle, but maintains its pristine crust of submicron-sized carbonaceous
grains; (2) Primordial materials are accessible already at a depth of several
tens of cm with abundant silicate grains of submicrometer sizes. In this study,
we demonstrate that a standard model of cometary nuclei explains well available
observational data: (1) A dust mantle with a thickness of ~1-2 m builds up on
the surface, where compact aggregates larger than tens of micrometers dominate;
(2) Large fluffy aggregates are embedded in chemically differentiated layers as

theory, we shed light on this question. We examine spin states of zigzag-edged

a triplet ground state for a Mobius cyclacene, while the corresponding

the total magnetization of the ground state is found to increase with the
ribbon length. For example, a quintet ground state is found for a ZMGNR. Local
magnetic moments on the edge carbon atoms form domains of majority and minor

  Mass X-ray binary X1916-053","accepted by ApJ",,"10.1086/527549",,"astro-ph",,"  The ultra-compact Low Mass X-ray Binary (LMXB) X1916-053, composed of a
neutron star and a semi-degenerated white dwarf, exhibits periodic X-ray dips
with variable width and depth. We have developed new methods to parameterize
the dip to systematically study its variations. This helps to further
understand binary and accretion disk behaviors. The RXTE 1998 observations
clearly show a 4.87d periodic variation of the dip width. This is probably due
to the nodal precession of the accretion disk, although there are no
significant sidebands in the spectrum from the epoch folding search. From the
negative superhump model (Larwood et. al. 1996), the mass ratio can be
estimated as q = 0.045. Combined with more than 24 years of historical data, we
found an orbital period derivative of $\dot{P}_{orb}/P_{orb}=(1.62 \pm
0.48)\times 10^{-7} yr^{-1}$ and established a quadratic ephemeris for the
X-ray dips. The period derivative seems inconsistent with the prediction of the
standard model of binary orbital evolution proposed by Rappaport et. al.
(1987). On the other hand, the radiation-driven model (Tavani et. al. 1991) may
properly interpret the period derivative even though the large mass outflow
predicted by this model has never been observed in this system. With the best
ephemeris, we obtained that the standard deviation of primary dips are smaller
than that of secondary dips. This means that the primary dips are more stable
than the secondary dips. Thus, we conclude that the primary dips of X1916-053
occur from the bulge at the rim instead of the ring of the disk proposed by
Frank et. al. (1987).

depend on a scale parameter which balances a fit to data and a regularising

Within this framework, the scale is often defined implicitly as the height in

readily associated to the global optimum of an energy or a global criterion on
the base level graph. This last drawback is addressed by the scale set
framework designed by Guigues. The methods designed by this author allow to
build a hierarchy and to design cuts within this hierarchy which globally
minimise an energy. This paper studies the influence of the construction scheme
of the initial hierarchy on the resulting optimal cuts. We propose one
sequential and one parallel method with two variations within both. Our
sequential methods provide partitions near the global optima while parallel
methods require less execution times than the sequential method of Guigues even

properties depend sensitively on effective temperature, surface gravity, and
metallicity. Several physical properties of brown dwarfs in binary systems can
be well inferred from the primary, and therefore allow to better constrain
their atmospheres.
  Aims: We want to constrain atmospheric models of brown dwarfs in binary
systems using narrow-band mid-infrared photometry.
  Methods: High spatial resolution and sensitivity is required to resolve the
components. Therefore we have obtained deep mid-infrared images of four close
binary systems with brown dwarf companions using VISIR at the VLT in three
narrow-band filters at 8.6, 10.5 and 11.25 micron.
  Results: Three brown dwarfs companions (GJ 229B, HD 130948BC and HR 7329B)
were detected at 8.6micron. HD 130948BC was also observed at 10.5micron. We
finally place upper flux limits for the other narrow band filters with null
detections.
  Conclusions: Our results are in general compatible with previous observations
and model expectations for these objects. For HD 130948BC, we conclude
photometric variability on a significance level of 2.8sigma based on repeated
observations. The bandpass around 10.5micron appears specifically well suited
for variability studies, and we speculate that either inhomogeneities in the
atmospheric NH3 distribution, or silicate absorption might cause its
time-variability.

halo of our Galaxy. Such stars are thought to be ejected through dynamical
interactions near the massive black hole (MBH) in the Galactic center. Three
scenarios have been suggested for their ejection; binary disruption by a MBH,
scattering by inspiraling IMBH and scattering by stellar BHs close to MBH.
These scenarios involve different stellar populations in the Galactic center.
Here we use observations of the Galactic center stellar population together
with dynamical and evolutionary arguments to obtain strong constraints on the
nature and origin of HVSs. We show that the IMBH inspiral scenario requires too
many (O(10^3)) main sequence B stars to exist close to the MBH (<0.01 pc) at
the time of inspiral, where current observations show O(10) such stars.
Scattering by SBHs also require too many B stars to be observed in the GC, but
it may contribute a small fraction of the currently observed HVSs. The binary
disruption scenario is still consistent with current observations. In addition
it is shown that recently suggested signatures for HVSs origin such as
hypervelocity binaries and slow rotating HVSs are much weaker than suggested
and require too large statistics. In addition, we show that due to the
conditions close to the MBH most binary star systems are not expected to
survive for long in this region. Consequently, unique stellar populations that
require long evolution in binaries are not expected to be ejected as HVSs in
the BHs scattering mechanisms (this may also be related to to the recently
observed asymmetry in the velocity distribution of HVSs).

Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 335. The 0.5-40 keV spectrum contains a broad Fe line, a
strong soft excess below about 2 keV and a Compton hump around 20-30 keV. We
find that a model consisting of a power law and two reflectors provides the
best fit to the time-averaged spectrum. In this model, an ionized, heavily
blurred, inner reflector produces most of the soft excess, while an almost
neutral outer reflector (outside ~40 r_g) produces most of the Fe line
emission. The spectral variability of the observation is characterised by
spectral hardening at very low count rates. In terms of our power-law +
two-reflector model it seems like this hardening is mainly caused by pivoting
of the power law. The rms spectrum of the entire observation has the curved
shape commonly observed in AGN, although the shape is significantly flatter
when an interval which does not contain any deep dip in the lightcurve is
considered. We also examine a previous 133 ks XMM-Newton observation of Mrk
335. We find that the XMM-Newton spectrum can be fitted with a similar
two-reflector model as the Suzaku data and we confirm that the rms spectrum of
the observation is flat. The flat rms spectra, as well as the high-energy data
from the Suzaku PIN detector, disfavour an absorption origin for the soft

under the influence of a resonant perturbation, with a much lower frequency
dependent on the perturbation amplitude. These serve as one of the signatures
of quantum coherent evolution in mesoscopic systems. It was shown recently [N.
Gronbech-Jensen and M. Cirillo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 067001 (2005)] that in
phase qubits (current-biased Josephson junctions) this effect can be mimicked
by classical oscillations arising due to the anharmonicity of the effective
potential. Nevertheless, we find qualitative differences between the classical
and quantum effect. First, while the quantum Rabi oscillations can be produced
by the subharmonics of the resonant frequency (multiphoton processes), the
classical effect also exists when the system is excited at the overtones.
Second, the shape of the resonance is, in the classical case,
characteristically asymmetric; while quantum resonances are described by
symmetric Lorentzians. Third, the anharmonicity of the potential results in the
negative shift of the resonant frequency in the classical case, in contrast to
the positive Bloch-Siegert shift in the quantum case. We show that in the
relevant range of parameters these features allow to confidently distinguish
the bona fide Rabi oscillations from their classical Doppelganger.

feedback prescriptions (suppression and filtering) resulting in a different
suppression of star formation in low-mass halos. The models imply different
ionization and thermal histories and 21 cm background signals. The derived
Comptonization, u, and free-free distortion, y_B, parameters are below current
observational limits for both models. However, the value of u = 1.69 * 10^-7

range of the next generation of CMB spectrum experiments. Through the dedicated
Boltzmann code CMBFAST, modified to include the above ionization histories, we
compute the CMB angular power spectrum (APS) of the TT, TE, and EE modes. For
the EE mode the differences between these models are significantly larger than
the cosmic and sampling variance over the multipole range l = 5-15, leaving a
good chance of discriminating between these feedback mechanisms with
forthcoming/future CMB polarization experiments. The main limitations come from
foreground contamination: it should be subtracted at per cent level in terms of
APS, a result potentially achievable by novel component separation techniques
and mapping of Galactic foreground.

qualitative properties as a bulk ($L_1 \to \infty$) quantum Hall hierarchy

that the exact solutions generically, for odd $q$, are continuously connected

is no phase transition as $L_1 \to \infty$ for filling factors where such

occurs as $L_1$ increases. For $\nu=1/2$ this leads to the system being mapped

then develops continuously into the composite fermion wave function that is
believed to describe the bulk $\nu=1/2$ system. The analysis generalizes to
non-abelian quantum Hall states.

|Phi_r>. The method is applied to the difficult F2 molecule, which is unbound
within unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF). With a UHF |Phi_r>, spin contamination
causes large systematic errors and long equilibration times in AFQMC in the
intermediate, bond-breaking region. The spin-projection method eliminates these
problems, and delivers an accurate potential energy curve from equilibrium to
the dissociation limit using the UHF |Phi_r>. Realistic potential energy curves
are obtained with a cc-pVQZ basis. The calculated spectroscopic constants are
in excellent agreement with experiment.

biological and biomedical research, such as studies of human genetic variation
or of the genetic etiology of heritable traits. As genetic data becomes
increasingly available, investigators face a dilemma: when should data from
other studies and population subgroups be pooled with the primary data? Pooling
additional samples will generally reduce the variance of the frequency
estimates; however, used inappropriately, pooled estimates can be severely
biased due to population stratification. Because of this potential bias, most
investigators avoid pooling, even for samples with the same ethnic background
and residing on the same continent. Here, we propose an empirical Bayes
approach for estimating allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms.
This procedure adaptively incorporates genotypes from related samples, so that
more similar samples have a greater influence on the estimates. In every
example we have considered, our estimator achieves a mean squared error (MSE)
that is smaller than either pooling or not, and sometimes substantially
improves over both extremes. The bias introduced is small, as is shown by a
simulation study that is carefully matched to a real data example. Our method
is particularly useful when small groups of individuals are genotyped at a
large number of markers, a situation we are likely to encounter in a
genome-wide association study.

the question need not be intractable. We will present the results with emphasis

by Michelson Doppler Images (MDI) on-board the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SoHO). The method is tuned and tested on synthetic data, it is
shown that the method is capable of measuring of horizontal velocity fields
with an accuracy of 15 \mps. It is also shown that the method provides the
measurements comparable with time-distance local helioseismology. The method is
applied to real data sets. It reproduces well known properties of solar
photospheric velocity fields. Moreover, the case studies show an evidence about
the influence of the changes in the flow field topology on the stability of the
eruptive filament and support the theory of the dynamical disconnection of
bipolar sunspots from their magnetic roots. The method has a great perspective
in the future use. The meridional flux transportation speed is also studied and
it is shown that the direct measurement may differ from time-distance local
helioseimology in the areas occupied by the strong magnetic field. This result
has an impact to the flux transport dynamo models, which use the meridional

derivations, statistical models and simulations used in field studies. However,
when it comes to the bid arrivals, empirical research has shown that the
process is far from Poisson, with early bidding and last-moment bids taking
place. An additional feature that has been reported by various authors is an
apparent self-similarity in the bid arrival process. Despite the wide evidence
for the changing bidding intensities and the self-similarity, there has been no
rigorous attempt at developing a model that adequately approximates bid
arrivals and accounts for these features. The goal of this paper is to
introduce a family of distributions that well-approximate the bid time
distribution in hard-close auctions. We call this the BARISTA process (Bid
ARrivals In STAges) because of its ability to generate different intensities at
different stages. We describe the properties of this model, show how to
simulate bid arrivals from it, and how to use it for estimation and inference.
We illustrate its power and usefulness by fitting simulated and real data from
eBay.com. Finally, we show how a Poisson bidder arrival process relates to a
BARISTA bid arrival process.
