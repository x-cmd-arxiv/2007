calculate the number of subgraphs isomorphic to a given graph in other graphs.
These subgraphs counting invariants are not algebraically independent. In our
view the most important problem in graph theory of unlabeled graphs is the
problem of determining graphic values of arbitrary sets of graph invariants.
This corresponds to explaining the syzygy of the graph invariants when the
number of vertices is unbounded. We introduce two methods to explore this
complicated structure. Sets of graphs with a small number of vertices impose
constraints on larger sets. We describe families of inequalities of graph
invariants. These inequalities allow to loop over all values of graph
invariants which look like graphic from the small sets point of view. We also
develop strong notion of graphic values where the existence of the
corresponding graphs is guaranteed once the constraints are satisfied by the
basic graph invariants. These constraints are necessary and sufficient for
graphs whose local neighborhoods are generated by a finite set of locally
connected graphs. The reconstruction of the graph from the basic graph
invariants is shown to be NP-complete in this restricted case. Finally we apply
these results to formulate the problem of Ramsey numbers as an integer
polyhedron problem of moderate and adjustable dimension.

3d states belonging to different atoms do not overlap considerably. Therefore
an indirect exchange interaction between Mn atoms should play a crucial role in
the ferromagnetism of the systems. To study the nature of the ferromagnetism of
various Mn-based semi- and full-Heusler alloys we perform a systematic
first-principles calculation of the exchange interactions in these materials.
The calculation of the exchange parameters is based on the frozen-magnon
approach. The calculations show that the magnetism of the Mn-based Heusler
alloys depends strongly on the number of conduction electrons, their spin
polarization and the position of the unoccupied Mn 3d states with respect to
the Fermi level. Various magnetic phases are obtained depending on the
combination of these characteristics. The Anderson's s-d model is used to
perform a qualitative analysis of the obtained results. The conditions leading
to diverse magnetic behavior are identified. If the spin polarization of the
conduction electrons at the Fermi energy is large and the unoccupied Mn 3d
states lie well above the Fermi level, an RKKY-type ferromagnetic interaction
is dominating. On the other hand, the contribution of the antiferromagnetic
superexchange becomes important if unoccupied Mn 3d states lie close to the
Fermi energy. The resulting magnetic behavior depends on the competition of
these two exchange mechanisms. The calculational results are in good
correlation with the conclusions made on the basis of the Anderson s-d model
which provides useful framework for the analysis of the results of
first-principles calculations and helps to formulate the conditions for high
Curie temperature.

$\sim$20 Myr using the classical equipartition fields. Using the magnetic field
estimates from the Beck & Krause formalism the spectral ages range from $\sim$5

older than smaller sources. In all but one source (J1313+6937) the spectral age
gradually increases with distance from the hotspot regions, confirming that
acceleration of the particles mainly occurs in the hotspots. Most of the GRSs

we solve the deposition process and describe the deposit density profile in
different asymptotic regimes. In particular, near the contact line the density
profile follows a scaling law that is proportional to the square root of the
concentration ratio, and the maximal deposit density/thickness occurs at about
2/3 of the total drying time for uniform evaporation and 1/2 for
diffusion-controlled evaporation. Away from the contact line, we for the first

presence of a hidden late-type companion. While this hypothesis can be shown to
be correct in some cases, there is also evidence suggesting that low-mass

the X-ray emission for magnetic Ap/Bp stars, focusing on the A0p star IQ Aur.
We test if this theoretical model is capable to explain the observed X-ray

magnetic field strength we measured the circular polarization in the wings of

Despite reports of a structural transition from a cubic phase to a rhombohedral
phase for fields E $>$ 1.7 kV/cm, we find that the bulk unit cell remains cubic
(within a sensitivity of 90$^{\circ}$-$\alpha$ =0.03$^{\circ}$)for fields up to
8 kV/cm. Furthermore, we observe a structural transition confined to the near
surface volume or `skin' of the crystal where the cubic cell is transformed to
a rhombohedral unit cell at T$_{c}$=210 K for E $>$ 4 kV/cm, for which
90$^{\circ}$-$\alpha$=0.08 $\pm$ 0.03$^{\circ}$ below 50 K. While the bulk unit
cell remains cubic, a suppression of the diffuse scattering and concomitant
enhancement of the Bragg peak intensity is observed below T$_{c}$=210 K,
indicating a more ordered structure with increasing electric field yet an
absence of a long-range ferroelectric ground state in the bulk. The electric
field strength has little effect on the diffuse scattering above T$_{c}$,
however below T$_{c}$ the diffuse scattering is reduced in intensity and adopts
an asymmetric lineshape in reciprocal space. The absence of hysteresis in our
neutron measurements (on the bulk) and the presence of two distinct temperature
scales suggests that the ground state of PMN is not a frozen glassy phase as
suggested by some theories but is better understood in terms of random fields
introduced through the presence of structural disorder. Based on these results,
we also suggest that PMN represents an extreme example of the two-length scale
problem, and that the presence of a distinct skin maybe necessary for a relaxor
ground state.

lower limit of the geometrical albedo can be estimated as 0.14. The phase
dependence of polarization indicates that the planetary orbit is oriented
almost in a north-south direction with a longitude of ascending node
$\Omega$=(16\degr or 196\degr)$\pm$8\degr. We obtain independent estimates of
the orbit inclination $i$=98\degr$\pm$8\degr and eccentricity $e$=0.0 (with an
uncertainty of 0.05) which are in excellent agreement with values determined
previously from transits and radial velocities. Our findings clearly
demonstrate the power of polarimetry and open a new dimension in exploring
exoplanetary atmospheres even for systems without transits.

applied to computing the CMB power spectra and the WMAP likelihood. For this
release, we have made improvements to the algorithm as well as the data sets
used to train Pico, leading to a significant improvement in accuracy. For the 9
parameter nonflat case presented here Pico can on average compute the TT, TE

$\ell$ values over a large region of parameter space. Performing a cosmological
parameter analysis of current CMB and large scale structure data, we show that
these power spectra give very accurate 1 and 2 dimensional parameter
posteriors. We have extended Pico to allow computation of the tensor power
spectrum and the matter transfer function. Pico runs about 1500 times faster
than CAMB at the default accuracy and about 250,000 times faster at high
accuracy. Training Pico can be done using massively parallel computing
resources, including distributed computing projects such as Cosmology@Home. On
the homepage for Pico, located at http://cosmos.astro.uiuc.edu/pico, we provide

from the FCSS and vice versa. We consider the intersection (2.9 square degrees
on the sky) of our data set with the infra-red 2 Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS),
using both the 2MASS Extended Source Catalogue (XSC) and the Point Source
Catalogue (PSC). We match all the XSC objects to FCSS counterparts by position
and also extract a sample of galaxies, selected by their FCSS redshifts, from
the PSC. We confirm that all 114 XSC objects in the overlap sample are
galaxies, on the basis of their FCSS velocities. A total of 23 Fornax Cluster
galaxies appear in the matched data, while, as expected, the remainder of the
sample lie at redshifts out to z = 0.2 (the spectra show that 61% are early
type galaxies, 18% are intermediate types and 21% are strongly star
forming).The PSC sample turns out to contain twice as many galaxies as does the
XSC. However, only one of these 225 galaxies is a (dwarf) cluster member. On
the other hand, galaxies which are unresolved in the 2MASS data (though almost
all are resolved in the optical) amount to 71% of the non-cluster galaxies with
2MASS detections and have redshifts out to z=0.32.

theory of them for ferromagnetic metals with dilute impurities at the zero

T-matrix approximation. With the Fermi energy E_F and the spin-orbit
interaction energy E_{SO} being fixed (E_F > E_{SO}), three regimes are found
as a function of the scattering rate \hbar/\tau. (i) In the superclean case
\hbar/\tau < u_{imp} E_{SO}D, the skew scattering from the vertex correction
dominates the anomalous Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy}, where u_{imp} is the
impurity potential strength and D is the density of states. With increasing
\hbar/\tau, this extrinsic skew-scattering contribution rapidly decays. (ii) In
the moderately dirty regime u_{imp}E_{SO}D < \hbar/\tau < E_{SO}, \sigma_{xy}
is dominated by the intrinsic dissipationless Berry-phase contribution, which
is resonantly enhanced to the order of e^2/\hbar when an accidental degeneracy
of band dispersions around the Fermi level is lifted by the spin-orbit
interaction. (iii) Further increasing \hbar/\tau, a
\sigma_{xy}\propto\sigma_{xx}^{1.6} scaling appears, which has been verified by
recent experiments. The themal and thermoelectric Hall conductivities are also
discussed.

members to establish an age based on the LDB. Employing the FLAMES multi-object
spectrograph on VLT/UT2, we have obtained intermediate-resolution spectra of
the cluster candidates. The spectra were used to measure radial velocities and
to infer the presence of the Li I 670.8 nm doublet and Halpha emission. We have
identified 39 bona fide cluster members based on radial velocity, Halpha
emission, and Li absorption. The mean radial velocity of IC 4665 is found to be
vrad=-15.95 +/- 1.13 km/s. Confirmed cluster members display a sharp transition
in magnitude between stars with and without lithium, both in the Im vs. Im-z
and in the Ks vs. Im-Ks diagrams.From this boundary, we deduce a cluster age of
27.7^(+4.2)_(-3.5) +/- 1.1 +/- 2 Myr. IC 4665 is the fifth cluster for which an
LDB age has been determined, and it is the youngest cluster among these five.
Thus, the LDB is established from relatively bright stars still in the
contracting pre-main sequence phase. The mass of the boundary is M*=0.24 +/-
0.04 Msun. The LDB age agrees well with the ages derived from isochrone fitting
of both low and high mass, turn-off stars, a result similar to what is found in

the flow between two topologically-equivalent curves or surfaces which
minimises some metric defined on the vector fields, \emph{i.e.} the flow

are very natural for this problem because Lagrangian particles (particles
moving with the flow) can represent the movement of the shape whereas the
vector field is Eulerian and hence best represented on a static mesh. We

discrete method has a set of conserved momenta corresponding to the
particle-relabelling symmetry which converge to conserved quantities in the

derivation of the incremental equations, of the tensors of magnetoelastic
moduli and of the incremental boundary conditions at a magnetoelastic/vacuum
interface. The problem of surface stability for a solid half-space under plane
strain with a magnetic field normal to its surface is used to illustrate the
general results. The analysis involved leads to the simultaneous resolution of
a bicubic and vanishing of a 7x7 determinant. In order to provide specific
demonstration of the effect of the magnetic field, the material model is
specialized to that of a ""magnetoelastic Mooney-Rivlin solid"". Depending on the
magnitudes of the magnetic field and the magnetoelastic coupling parameters,
this shows that the half-space may become either more stable or less stable
than in the absence of a magnetic field.

turbulent diffusion)calculated with the Montreal code. A spectral synthesis
iterative procedure has been applied to derive the abundances from selected
high quality lines in high resolution high signal-to-noise echelle spectra
obtained with ELODIE at the Observatoire de Haute Provence. The chemical
pattern found for the A and F dwarfs in Coma Berenices is reminiscent of that
found in the Hyades and the UMa moving group. In graphs representing the
abundances [X/H] versus the effective temperature, the A stars often display
abundances much more scattered around their mean values than the F stars do.
Large star-to-star variations are detected for A stars in their abundances
which we interpret as evidence of transport processes competing with radiative
diffusion. The F stars have solar abundances for almost all elements except for
Mg, Si, V and Ba. The derived abundances patterns, [X/H] versus atomic number,
for the slow rotator HD108642 (A2m) and the moderately fast rotator HD106887
(A4m) were compared to the predictions of self consistent evolutionary model
codes including radiative and different amounts of turbulent diffusion. None of
the models reproduces entirely the overall shape of the abundance pattern.
While part of the discrepancies between derived and predicted abundances may be
accounted for by non-LTE effects, the inclusion of competing processes such as
rotational mixing in the radiative zones of these stars seems necessary to
improve the agreement between observed and predicted abundance patterns.

galaxy formation model in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. There is some evidence in the
literature for SMBHBs in AGNs, but there are few observational constraints on
the evolution of SMBHBs in inactive galaxies and gas-poor mergers. On the
theoretical front, it is unclear how long is needed for a SMBHB in a typical
galaxy to coalesce. In this paper we investigate the tidal interaction between
stars and binary BHs and calculate the tidal disruption rates of stellar
objects by the BH components of binary. We derive the interaction cross
sections between SMBHBs and stars from intensive numerical scattering
experiments with particle number $\sim10^7$ and calculate the tidal disruption
rates by both single and binary BHs for a sample of realistic galaxy models,
taking into account the general relativistic effect and the loss cone refilling
because of two-body interaction. We estimate the frequency of tidal flares for
different types of galaxies using the BH mass function in the literature. We
find that because of the three-body slingshot effect, the tidal disruption rate
in SMBHB system is more than one order of magnitude smaller than that in single
SMBH system. The difference is more significant in less massive galaxies and
does not depend on detailed stellar dynamical processes. Our calculations
suggest that comparisons of the calculated tidal disruption rates for both
single and binary BHs and the surveys of X-ray or UV flares at galactic centers
could tell us whether most SMBHs in nearby galaxies are single and whether the
SMBHBs formed in gas-poor galaxy mergers coalesce rapidly.

asymptotic giant branch stars of low metallicity. In this work, the whole main

explicitly taken into account both in the opacities and equation of state. The
target of this work is to provide a basis to test the reliability of the AGB
self-enrichment scenario for Globular Clusters of intermediate metallicity.
These Globular Clusters exhibit well defined abundance patterns, which have
often been interpreted as a consequence of the pollution of the interstellar
medium by the ejecta of massive AGBs. We calculated a grid of intermediate mass
models with metallicity Z=0.001; the evolutionary sequences are followed from
the pre-Main sequence along the whole AGB phase. We focus our attention on
those elements largely studied in the spectroscopic investigations of Globular
Clusters stars, i.e. oxygen, sodium, aluminum, magnesium and fluorine.} The
predictions of our models show an encouraging agreement with the demand of the
self-enrichment scenario for what concerns the abundances of oxygen, aluminum,
fluorine and magnesium. The question of sodium is more tricky, due to the large
uncertainties of the cross-sections of the Ne-Na cycle. The present results
show that only a relatively small range of initial masses (M=5,6 solar masses)
can be responsible for the self enrichment.

borrowed from statistical mechanics and information theory, stemming from the
PACBayesian approach pioneered by David McAllester and applied to a conception
of statistical learning theory forged by Vladimir Vapnik. Using convex analysis
on the set of posterior probability measures, we show how to get local measures
of the complexity of the classification model involving the relative entropy of
posterior distributions with respect to Gibbs posterior measures. We then
discuss relative bounds, comparing the generalization error of two
classification rules, showing how the margin assumption of Mammen and Tsybakov
can be replaced with some empirical measure of the covariance structure of the
classification model.We show how to associate to any posterior distribution an
effective temperature relating it to the Gibbs prior distribution with the same
level of expected error rate, and how to estimate this effective temperature
from data, resulting in an estimator whose expected error rate converges
according to the best possible power of the sample size adaptively under any
margin and parametric complexity assumptions. We describe and study an
alternative selection scheme based on relative bounds between estimators, and
present a two step localization technique which can handle the selection of a
parametric model from a family of those. We show how to extend systematically
all the results obtained in the inductive setting to transductive learning, and
use this to improve Vapnik's generalization bounds, extending them to the case
when the sample is made of independent non-identically distributed pairs of
patterns and labels. Finally we review briefly the construction of Support
Vector Machines and show how to derive generalization bounds for them,
measuring the complexity either through the number of support vectors or
through the value of the transductive or inductive margin.

towards 60 background extragalactic source components through the -6 deg < l <6
deg, -2 deg < b < 2 deg region of the Galaxy using the 4.8 and 8.5 GHz bands of
the ATCA and VLA. Here we use the measured RMs to estimate the systematic and
the random components of the magnetic fields. The measured RMs are found to be
mostly positive for the sample sources in the region. This is consistent with
either a large scale bisymmetric spiral magnetic fields in the Galaxy or with
fields oriented along the central bar of the Galaxy. The outer scale of the RM
fluctuation is found to be about 40 pc, which is much larger than the observed
RM size scales towards the non-thermal filaments (NTFs). The RM structure
function is well-fitted with a power law index of 0.7 +/- 0.1 at length scales
of 0.3 to 100 pc. If Gaussian random processes in the ISM are valid, the power
law index is consistent with a two dimensional Kolmogorov turbulence. If there
is indeed a strong magnetic field within 1 degree (radius 150 pc) from the GC,
the strength of the random field in the region is estimated to be 20
microGauss. Given the highly turbulent magnetoionic ISM in this region, the
strength of the systematic component of the magnetic fields would most likely
be close to that of the random component. This suggests that the earlier
estimated milliGauss magnetic field near the NTFs is localised and does not
pervade the central 300 pc of the Galaxy.

which is sub-Eddington for ionized gas in the usual sense can appear
super-Eddington for cold dusty gas. The radiation-pressure enhancement factor
depends on the AGN spectrum but ranges between unity and about 500, depending
on the column density. It means that an AGN for which the absorption is
long-lived should have a column density N_H>5x10^23 lambda cm^-2, where lambda
is its Eddington fraction L_bol/L_Edd, provided that N_H}>5x10^21 cm^-2. We
have compared the distribution of several samples of AGN - local, CDFS and

keV and a luminosity of ~3x10^{34} erg s^{-1} (2.0--8.0 keV) at 8 kpc. The
absorption, temperature, luminosity, and the 6.7 keV line intensity were
confirmed with the archived XMM-Newton data. The source has a very red
(J-Ks=8.2 mag) infrared spectral energy distribution (SED), which was fitted by
a blackbody emission of ~1000 K attenuated by a visual extinction of ~31 mag.
The high plasma temperature and the large X-ray luminosity are consistent with

(active galactic nucleus) and SB (starburst) signatures. In order to study the
molecular gas properties in active galaxies and search for differences between

HCO+(J=1-0) and HCO+(J=3-2), emission with the IRAM 30m in the centre of 12
nearby active galaxies which either exhibit nuclear SB and/or AGN signatures.
Consistent with previous results, we find a significant difference of the
HCN(J=2-1)-to-HCN(J=1-0), HCN(J=3-2)-to-HCN(J=1-0), HCO+(J=3-2)-to-HCO+(J=3-2),
and HCO+-to-HCN intensity ratios between the sources dominated by an AGN and
those with an additional or pure central SB: the HCN, HCO+ and HCO+-to-HCN
intensity ratios tend to be higher in the galaxies of our sample with a central
SB as opposed to the pure AGN cases which show rather low intensity ratios.
Based on an LVG analysis of these data, i.e., assuming purely collisional
excitation, the (average) molecular gas densities in the SB dominated sources
of our sample seem to be systematically higher than in the AGN sources. The LVG
analysis seems to further support systematically higher HCN and/or lower HCO+
abundances as well as similar or higher gas temperatures in AGN compared to the
SB sources of our sample. Also, we find that the HCN-to-CO ratios decrease with
increasing rotational number J for the AGN while they stay mostly constant for

investigate the electric and magnetostatic fields generated by a point-like
electrical charge at rest in an inertial frame. The results show a rich
internal structure for the charge. Analytical solutions have also been found.
Such findings have been interpreted in terms of vacuum polarization and
magnetic-like charges produced by the very high strengths of the electric field
considered. Apparently non-linearity is to be accounted for the emergence of an
anomalous magnetostatic field suggesting a possible connection to that created
by a magnetic dipole composed of two mognetic charges with opposite signals.
Consistently in situations where the Born-Infeld field strength parameter is
free to become infinite, Maxwell`s regime takes over, the magnetic sector
vanishes and the electric field assumes a Coulomb behavior with no trace of a
magnetic component. The connection to other monopole solutions, like Dirac`s,
t' Hooft`s or Poliakov`s types, are also discussed. Finally some speculative
remarks are presented in an attempt to explain such fields.

the semiclassical WKB approximation using different approaches to the tunneling
problem is performed. The differences between the available improved formulae
for tunneling near the top and the bottom of the barrier are investigated.
Though the simple WKB method gives the right order of magnitude of the decay
widths, a small number of parameters are often fitted. The need to perform the
fitting procedure remaining consistently within the WKB framework is emphasized
in the context of the fission model based calculations. Calculations for the
decay widths of some recently found super heavy nuclei using microscopic
alpha-nucleus potentials are presented to demonstrate the importance of a
consistent WKB calculation. The half-lives are found to be sensitive to the
density dependence of the nucleon-nucleon interaction and the implementation of
the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition inherent in the WKB approach.

delay-coupled maps, focusing on the interplay of the network topology and the
delay times that take into account the finite velocity of propagation of
interactions. We assume that the elements of the network are identical ($N$
logistic maps in the regime where the individual maps, without coupling, evolve
in a chaotic orbit) and that the coupling strengths are uniform throughout the
network. We show that if the delay times are sufficiently heterogeneous, for
adequate coupling strength the network synchronizes in a spatially homogeneous
steady-state, which is unstable for the individual maps without coupling. This
synchronization behavior is referred to as ``suppression of chaos by random
delays'' and is in contrast with the synchronization when all the interaction
delay times are homogeneous, because with homogeneous delays the network
synchronizes in a state where the elements display in-phase time-periodic or
chaotic oscillations. We analyze the influence of the network topology
considering four different types of networks: two regular (a ring-type and a
ring-type with a central node) and two random (free-scale Barabasi-Albert and
small-world Newman-Watts). We find that when the delay times are sufficiently
heterogeneous the synchronization behavior is largely independent of the
network topology but depends on the networks connectivity, i.e., on the average
number of neighbors per node.

of motility in cells ranging from \textit{Escherichia coli} to sperm. Here we
use experiments and theory to study the shape transition of a flexible rod
rotating in a viscous fluid driven either by constant torque or at constant
speed. The rod is tilted relative to the rotation axis. At low applied torque,
the rod bends gently and generates small propulsive force. At a critical
torque, the rotation speed increases abruptly and the rod forms a helical shape
with much greater propulsive force. We find good agreement between theory and
experiment.

uncertainty from renormalization scale variations is reduced by a factor of

consequences of this Theorem are discussed: using this Theorem we find, eg.,
that diagonal matrix elements of the exact effective Hamiltonian for the
neutral meson complex can not be equal if CPT symmetry holds and CP symmetry is
violated. The Properties of time evolution governed by a time--independent
effective Hamiltonian acting in the neutral mesons subspace of states are
considered. By means of the Khalfin's Theorem we show that if such Hamiltonian
is time--independent then the evolution operator for the total system
containing neutral meson complex can not be a unitary operator. Within a given
specific model we examine numerically the Khalfin's Theorem. We show for this
model in a graphic form how the Khalfin's Theorem works. We also show for this
model how the difference of the mentioned diagonal matrix elements of the
effective Hamiltonian varies in time.
