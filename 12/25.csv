solution to the problem of dark energy in cosmology. The proposal yields a
model universe which appears to be quantitatively viable, in terms of its fit
to supernovae luminosity distances, the angular scale of the sound horizon in
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy spectrum, and the baryon
acoustic oscillation scale. It may simultaneously resolve key anomalies
relating to primordial lithium abundances, CMB ellipticity, the expansion age
of the universe and the Hubble bubble feature. The model uses only general
relativity, and matter obeying the strong energy condition, but revisits
operational issues in interpreting average measurements in our presently
inhomogeneous universe, from first principles. The present overview examines
both the foundational issues concerning the definition of gravitational energy
in a dynamically expanding space, the quantitative predictions of the new model
and its best-fit cosmological parameters, and the prospects for an era of new
observational tests in cosmology.

  Theory on Dec. 19, 2007",,"10.1109/TIT.2008.926415",,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  Precise characterization of the mutual information of MIMO systems is
required to assess the throughput of wireless communication channels in the
presence of Rician fading and spatial correlation. Here, we present an
asymptotic approach allowing to approximate the distribution of the mutual
information as a Gaussian distribution in order to provide both the average
achievable rate and the outage probability. More precisely, the mean and
variance of the mutual information of the separatelycorrelated Rician fading
MIMO channel are derived when the number of transmit and receive antennas grows
asymptotically large and their ratio approaches a finite constant. The
derivation is based on the replica method, an asymptotic technique widely used
in theoretical physics and, more recently, in the performance analysis of
communication (CDMA and MIMO) systems. The replica method allows to analyze
very difficult system cases in a comparatively simple way though some authors
pointed out that its assumptions are not always rigorous. Being aware of this,
we underline the key assumptions made in this setting, quite similar to the
assumptions made in the technical literature using the replica method in their
asymptotic analyses. As far as concerns the convergence of the mutual
information to the Gaussian distribution, it is shown that it holds under some
mild technical conditions, which are tantamount to assuming that the spatial
correlation structure has no asymptotically dominant eigenmodes. The accuracy
of the asymptotic approach is assessed by providing a sizeable number of
numerical results. It is shown that the approximation is very accurate in a
wide variety of system settings even when the number of transmit and receive
antennas is as small as a few units.

out the preferred defect locations as a function of elastic anisotropy. We
establish the existence of a one-parameter family of degenerate ground states

isolated Herbig Ae stars that exhibit signs of active accretion, including
driving bipolar flows with embedded Herbig-Haro (HH) objects. HD 163296 was
found to be relatively quiescent photometrically in its inner disk region, with
the exception of a major increase in emitted flux in a broad wavelength region
centered near 3 microns in 2002. In contrast, HD 31648 has exhibited sporadic
changes in the entire 3-13 micron region throughout this span of time. In both
stars the changes in the 1-5 micron flux indicate structural changes in the

distance from the star to vary with time. Repeated thermal cycling through this

increase in the degree of crystallinity. The variability observed in these
objects has important consequences for the interpretation of other types of

excitation by a single pulse or by two non-collinear pulses is that the Rabi
oscillations of the multi-wave mixing response are characterized by two

we found that there are three invariant spin classes, which do not mix with the

electrons and holes and the Coulomb interaction describing the semiconductor by
the semiconductor Bloch equation (SBE). We show that if initially the system is
in the ground state then the SBE preserves the invariant spin classes thus
proving absence of the dark excitons in the framework of this description. We
found that due to the mass difference between holes of different kind
additional Rabi frequencies, two of those present in the operator dynamics,

conundrum. Inspired by the discovery of multiple stellar populations in the
{\it most massive} Galactic GC, $\omega$ Centauri, we investigate the
possibility that two distinct populations may coexist and are responsible for
the bimodal HBs in the {\it third} and {\it fifth} brightest GCs, NGC 6388 and
NGC 6441. Using the population synthesis technique, we examine two different
chemical ``self-enrichment'' hypotheses in which a primordial GC was
sufficiently massive to contain two or more distinct populations as suggested
by the populations found in $\omega$ Cen: (1) the age-metallicity relation
scenario in which two populations with different metallicity and age coexist,
following an internal age-metallicity relation, and (2) the super-helium-rich
scenario in which GCs contain a certain fraction of helium-enhanced stars, for
instance, the second generation stars formed from the helium-enriched ejecta of
the first. The comparative study indicates that the detailed color-magnitude
diagram morphologies and the properties of the RR Lyrae variables in NGC 6388
and NGC 6441 support the latter scenario; i.e., the model which assumes a minor
fraction ($\sim$ 15 %) of helium-excess (Y $\simeq$ 0.3) stars. The results
suggest that helium content is the main driver behind the HB bimodality found
most often in massive GCs. If confirmed, the GC-to-GC variation of helium
abundance should be considered a {\it local} effect, further supporting the
argument that age is the {\it global} second parameter of HB morphology.

density dependence on time is a product of a number of temporal variations
caused by solar radiation, magnetic activity, Earth orientation and unknown
additional periodical processes (not a sum, as they suppose sometimes when
making such models). A multiranges modulation principle is also suggested, that
allows automatically extend the set of parameters by using new ones, obtained
by filtration (or averaging) of basic set of parameters over the time. In the

that a non-optimal choice of the number of model parameters could increase
prediction error, inspite the error over the set, used for analysis, will
decrease. It is shown that one year prediction has accuracy about 9-23%
depending on the height, and the highest error corresponds to the height about
200km. From the modelling we could also see that with increasing of the height
the number of parameters increases, and this could be caused by inaccuracy of

function as a polynomial of fugacity. The results show that zeros are
distributed in a wide region in the complex field plane. Nevertheless we
observe that zeros on the imaginary axis play dominant roles in the critical
behaviour since zeros on the imaginary axis are in closer proximity to the real
axis. We estimate the density of zeros on the imaginary axis by an
importance-sampling Monte Carlo algorithm, which enables us to sample very rare
events. Our result suggests that the density has an essential singularity at
the origin. This observation is consistent with the existence of Griffiths
singularities in the present systems. This is the first evidence for Griffiths

seek for solutions in which the electric field is regular everywhere as well as
asymptotically Coulombian, and the metric potentials are regular at the center

an exactly integrable one-parameter model, with $q_1\equiv -q$, $q_2=q$,

For large anharmonicities, on the other hand, the spatial motion of the ions
itself represents a spin-1/2 model with frustrated dipolar XY interactions. We
illustrate the latter setup with three systems: the linear chain, the zig-zag
ladder, and the triangular lattice. In the frustrated zig-zag ladder with
dipolar interactions we find chiral ordering beyond what was predicted
previously for a next-nearest-neighbor model. In the frustrated anisotropic
triangular lattice with nearest-neighbor interactions we find that the
transition from the one-dimensional gapless spin-liquid phase to the
two-dimensional spiraling ordered phase passes through a gapped spin-liquid
phase, similar to what has been predicted for the same model with Heisenberg
interactions. Further, a second gapped spin-liquid phase marks the transition
to the two-dimensional Neel-ordered phase.

bursting, the random perturbations in the slow dynamics play a dominant role.
We propose two classes of randomly perturbed slow-fast systems that realize

The analysis of the linearized Poincare maps of the randomly perturbed systems

and quite often demand users to obtain global optimal solutions rather than
local optimal ones. Optimization problems are inherent in machine learning
algorithms and hence many methods in machine learning were inherited from the
optimization literature. Popularly known as the initialization problem, the
ideal set of parameters required will significantly depend on the given
initialization values. The recently developed TRUST-TECH (TRansformation Under
STability-reTaining Equilibria CHaracterization) methodology systematically
explores the subspace of the parameters to obtain a complete set of local
optimal solutions. In this thesis work, we propose TRUST-TECH based methods for
solving several optimization and machine learning problems. Two stages namely,
the local stage and the neighborhood-search stage, are repeated alternatively
in the solution space to achieve improvements in the quality of the solutions.
Our methods were tested on both synthetic and real datasets and the advantages
of using this novel framework are clearly manifested. This framework not only
reduces the sensitivity to initialization, but also allows the flexibility for
the practitioners to use various global and local methods that work well for a
particular problem of interest. Other hierarchical stochastic algorithms like
evolutionary algorithms and smoothing algorithms are also studied and
frameworks for combining these methods with TRUST-TECH have been proposed and
evaluated on several test systems.
