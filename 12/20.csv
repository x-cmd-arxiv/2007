field lines, and the condition for stability to convection is modified from the
standard Schwarzschild criterion. We present local two and three-dimensional
simulations of a new heat flux driven buoyancy instability (the HBI) that
occurs when the temperature in a plasma decreases in the direction of gravity.
We find that the HBI drives a convective dynamo that amplifies an initially
weak magnetic field by a factor of ~20. In simulations that begin with the
magnetic field aligned with the temperature gradient, the HBI saturates by
rearranging the magnetic field lines to be almost purely perpendicular to the
initial temperature gradient. This magnetic field reorientation results in a
net heat flux through the plasma that is less than 1% of the field-free
(Spitzer) value. We show that the HBI is likely to be present in the cool cores
of clusters of galaxies between ~0.1-100 kpc, where the temperature increases
outwards. The saturated state of the HBI suggests that inward thermal
conduction from large radii in clusters is unlikely to solve the cooling flow
problem. Finally, we also suggest that the HBI may contribute to suppressing
conduction across cold fronts in galaxy clusters.

instruction sets in a scalable way. Enlarging the toolbox of universal gates by
optimised complex multi-qubit instruction sets thus paves the way to fight
decoherence for realistic settings.
  Compiling a quantum module into the machine code for steering a concrete
quantum hardware device lends itself to be tackled by means of optimal quantum
control. To this end, there are two opposite approaches: (i) one may use a
decomposition into the restricted instruction set (RISC) of universal one- and
two-qubit gates, which in turn have prefabricated translations into the machine
code or (ii) one may prefer to generate the entire target module directly by a
complex instruction set (CISC) of available controls. Here we advocate direct
compilation up to the limit of system size a classical high-performance
parallel computer cluster can reasonably handle. For going beyond these limits,
i.e. for large systems we propose a combined way, namely (iii) to make
recursive use of medium-sized building blocks generated by optimal control in
the sense of a quantum CISC compiler.
  The advantage of the method over standard RISC compilations into one- and
two-qubit universal gates is explored on the parallel cluster HLRB-II (with a
total LINPACK performance of 63.3 TFlops/s) for the quantum Fourier transform,
the indirect SWAP gate as well as for multiply-controlled CNOT gates.
Implications for upper limits to time complexities are also derived.

turnoff. Both stars are very enriched in carbon and in neutron-capture elements
that can be created in the s-process, including lead. The primary star also
possesses an abundance of lithium close to the value of the ``Spite-Plateau''.
The simplest interpretation is that the binary members seen today were the
recipients of these anomalous abundances from a third star that was losing mass
as part of its AGB evolution. We compare the observed CS 22964-161 abundance
set with nucleosynthesis predictions of AGB stars, and discuss issues of
envelope stability in the observed stars under mass transfer conditions, and
consider the dynamical stability of the alleged original triple star. Finally,
we consider the circumstances that permit survival of lithium, whatever its
origin, in the spectrum of this extraordinary system.

We show how the ideals for general trees can be determined from the ideals for

ideal, not just an ideal defining the model set-theoretically. A corollary of
theoretical importance is that the ideal for a general tree is generated by the
ideals of its flattenings at vertices.

understood, both empirically and theoretically. We study this distribution
using a version of Fisher's geometrical model without pleiotropy, such that
each mutation affects only a single trait. We are motivated by the notion of an
organism's chemotype, the set of biochemical reaction constants that govern its
molecular constituents. From physical considerations, we expect the chemotype
to be of high dimension and to exhibit very little pleiotropy. Our model
generically predicts striking cusps in the distribution of the fitness effects
of arising and fixed mutations. It further predicts that a single element of
the chemotype should comprise all mutations at the high-fitness ends of these
distributions. Using extreme value theory, we show that the two cusps with the
highest fitnesses are typically well-separated, even when the chemotype
possesses thousands of elements; this suggests a means to observe these cusps
experimentally. More broadly, our work demonstrates that new insights into
evolution can arise from the chemotype perspective, a perspective between the
genotype and the phenotype.

of a dirty and inhomogeneous superconducting wire. In particular, we account
for random spatial fluctuations of arbitrary size in the wire thickness. For a
typical wire thickness above the critical value for superconductor--insulator
transition, phase--slips processes can be treated perturbatively. We use a
memory formalism approach, which underlines the role played by weak violation
of conservation laws in the mechanism for generating finite resistivity. Our
calculations yield an expression for $\rho(T)$ which exhibits a smooth
crossover from a homogeneous to a ``granular'' limit upon increase of $T$,
controlled by a ``granularity parameter'' $D$ characterizing the size of
thickness fluctuations. For extremely small $D$, we recover the power--law
dependence $\rho(T)\sim T^\alpha$ obtained by unbinding of quantum
phase--slips. However in the strongly inhomogeneous limit, the exponent
$\alpha$ is modified and the prefactor is {\em exponentially enhanced}. We
examine the dependence of the exponent $\alpha$ on an external magnetic field
applied parallel to the wire. Finally, we show that the power--law dependence
at low $T$ is consistent with a series of experimental data obtained in a
variety of long and narrow samples. The values of $\alpha$ extracted from the
data, and the corresponding field dependence, are consistent with known
parameters of the corresponding samples.

finite covers which fiber over the circle in arbitrarily many ways. More
precisely, it has a tower of finite covers where the number of fibered faces of
the Thurston norm ball goes to infinity, in fact faster than any power of the
logarithm of the degree of the cover, and we give a more precise quantitative
lower bound. The example manifold M is arithmetic, and the proof uses detailed
number-theoretic information, at the level of the Hecke eigenvalues, to drive a
geometric argument based on Fried's dynamical characterization of the fibered
faces. The origin of the basic fibration of M over the circle is the modular
elliptic curve E=X_0(49), which admits multiplication by the ring of integers
of Q[sqrt(-7)]. We first base change the holomorphic differential on E to a
cusp form on GL(2) over K=Q[sqrt(-3)], and then transfer over to a quaternion
algebra D/K ramified only at the primes above 7; the fundamental group of M is
a quotient of the principal congruence subgroup of level 7 of the
multiplicative group of a maximal order of D. To analyze the topological
properties of M, we use a new practical method for computing the Thurston norm,
which is of independent interest. We also give a non-compact finite-volume

resonances by the Jupiter. The stability of the resulting resonant system in
which the Super-Earth is on the internal orbit relatively to the Jupiter has
been studied numerically by means of full 2D hydrodynamical simulations. Our
main motivation is to determine the Super-Earth behaviour in the presence of
the gas giant in the system. It has been found that the Jupiter captures the
Super-Earth into the interior 3:2 or 4:3 mean motion resonances and the
stability of such configurations depends on the initial planet positions and
eccentricity evolution. If the initial separation of planet orbits is larger or
close to that required for the exact resonance than the final outcome is the
migration of the pair of planets with the rate similar to that of the gas giant
at least for time of our simulations. Otherwise we observe a scattering of the
Super-Earth from the disc. The evolution of planets immersed in the gaseous

  Atoms A@C60","25 pages, 29 figures",,,,"physics.atm-clus physics.atom-ph",,"  It is demonstrated that in photoabsorption by endohedral atoms some atomic
Giant resonances are almost completely destroyed while the others are totally
preserved due to different action on it of the fullerenes shell. As the first
example we discuss the 4d10 Giant resonance in Xe@C60 whereas as the second
serves the Giant autoionization resonance in Eu@C60. The qualitative difference
comes from the fact that photoelectrons from the 4d Giant resonance has small
energies (tens of eV) and are strongly reflected by the C60 fullerenes shell.
As to the Eu@C60, Giant autoionization leads to fast photoelectrons (about
hundred eV) that go out almost untouched by the C60 shell. As a result of the
outgoing electrons energy difference the atomic Giant resonances will be
largely destroyed in A@C60 while the Giant autoionization resonance will be
almost completely preserved. Thus, on the way from Xe@C60 Giant resonance to
Eu@C60 Giant autoionization resonance the oscillation structure should
disappear. Similar will be the decrease of oscillations on the way from pure
Giant to pure Giant autoionization resonances for the angular anisotropy
parameters. At Giant resonance frequencies the role of polarization of the
fullerenes shell by the incoming photon beam is inessential. Quite different is
the situation for the outer electrons in Eu@C60, the photoionization of which
will be also considered.

function as a function of cluster membership, cross-correlating z<0.12 2PIGG
clusters and groups with the full 2dF galaxy catalogue. We have made estimates
of the dynamical infall parameter beta and new estimates of the group velocity
dispersions. We first find that the amplitude of the full 3-D redshift space
cross-correlation function, xi_{cg}, rises monotonically with group membership.
We use a simple linear-theory infall model to fit xi(sigma, pi) in the range
5<s<40h^{-1}Mpc. We find that the beta versus membership relation for the data
shows a minimum at intermediate group membership n~20 or L~2x10^11h^-2Lsun,
implying that the bias and hence M/L ratios rise by a significant factor (~5x)
both for small groups and rich clusters. However, the mocks show a systematic
shift between the location of the beta minimum and the M/L minimum at
L~10^10h^-2Lsun given by direct calculation using the known DM distribution.
Our overall conclusion is that bias estimates from dynamical infall appear to
support the minimum in star-formation efficiency at intermediate halo masses.
Nevertheless, there may still be significant systematic problems arising from
measuring beta~1/b using large-scale infall rather than M/L using small-scale
velocity dispersions.

progressively towards the phonons at lower frequencies, resulting in a
soft-mode behavior only for the lowest frequency phonon near the transition
temperature. Moreover, in the proximity of the phase transition, the

060607A shows a remarkable broad and strong peak with a rapid rise and a
relatively slow power-law decay. It is not coincident with the strong
early-time flares seen in the X-ray and gamma-ray energy bands. There is weak
evidence for variability superposed on this dominant component in several
optical bands that can be related to flares in high energy bands. While for a
small number of GRBs, well-sampled optical flares have been observed
simultaneously with X-ray and gamma ray pulses, GRB 060607A is one of the few
cases where the early optical emission shows no significant evidence for
correlation with the prompt emission. In this work we first report in detail
the broad band observations of this burst by Swift. Then by applying a simple
model for the dynamics and the synchrotron radiation of a relativistic shock,
we show that the dominant component of the early emissions in optical
wavelengths has the same origin as the tail emission produced after the main
gamma ray activity. The most plausible explanation for the peak in the optical
light curve seems to be the cooling of the prompt after the main collisions,
shifting the characteristic synchrotron frequency to the optical bands. It
seems that the cooling process requires a steepening of the electron energy
distribution and/or a break in this distribution at high energies. The sharp
break in the X-ray light curve at few thousands of seconds after the trigger,
is not observed in the IR/optical/UV bands, and therefore can not be a jet
break. Either the X-ray break is due to a change in the spectrum of the
accelerated electrons or the lack of an optical break is due to the presence of
a related delayed response component (Abbreviated).

  over Fading Channels",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  In this paper, the capacity and energy efficiency of training-based
communication schemes employed for transmission over a-priori unknown Rayleigh
block fading channels are studied. In these schemes, periodically transmitted
training symbols are used at the receiver to obtain the minimum
mean-square-error (MMSE) estimate of the channel fading coefficients.
Initially, the case in which the product of the estimate error and transmitted
signal is assumed to be Gaussian noise is considered. In this case, it is shown
that bit energy requirements grow without bound as the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) goes to zero, and the minimum bit energy is achieved at a nonzero SNR
value below which one should not operate. The effect of the block length on
both the minimum bit energy and the SNR value at which the minimum is achieved
is investigated. Flash training and transmission schemes are analyzed and shown
to improve the energy efficiency in the low-SNR regime.
  In the second part of the paper, the capacity and energy efficiency of
training-based schemes are investigated when the channel input is subject to
peak power constraints. The capacity-achieving input structure is characterized
and the magnitude distribution of the optimal input is shown to be discrete
with a finite number of mass points. The capacity, bit energy requirements, and
optimal resource allocation strategies are obtained through numerical analysis.
The bit energy is again shown to grow without bound as SNR decreases to zero
due to the presence of peakedness constraints. The improvements in energy
efficiency when on-off keying with fixed peak power and vanishing duty cycle is
employed are studied. Comparisons of the performances of training-based and
noncoherent transmission schemes are provided.

for infinite plane and cylindrical fluid layers are performed. We investigated
simple case of the fluid response-thermal vibrational convection in a
cylindrical fluid layer with rigid conducting boundaries. It is found that
steady modes of thermal vibrational convection are subjected to various
bifurcations. Bifurcations cause sharp changes in heat transfer. The Lorenz
model is generalized (GLM) and used to conduct the analysis of bifurcations
caused by the changing of the cavity shape and vibrational Rayleigh number. The
shape of steady-state surface in 3D space of the streamfunction of mean flow,
vibrational Rayleigh number and the cavity curvature is found. The numerical 2D
solution is performed for plane and cylindrical fluid layers. The results of
the analysis based on the GLM model are compared with the data obtained by
direct numerical simulation. The bifurcation curve with extremum is found.

developing high resolution models of the ISM and formulate the conditions
required for its realistic functionality: formation of multi-phase medium with
hot chimneys, super-bubbles, cold molecular phase, and very slow consumption of
gas. Another important ingredient is the runaway stars. They greatly facilitate
the feedback. Once these effects are implemented into cosmological simulations,
we do not have the overcooling problem and the angular momentum problem
(resulting in a too massive bulge) is also reduced substantially: the rotation
curves are nearly flat. Just as it is often observed in QSO absorption lines,
our models produce substantial outflows from forming and active galaxies. At
high redshifts we routinely find gas with few hundred km/s and occasionally
1000-2000 km/s. The density profile of dark matter is still consistent with a
cuspy profile. The simulations reproduce this picture only if the resolution is
very high: better than 50 pc, which is much better than the typical resolution
in previous cosmological simulations. Our simulations of galaxy formation reach
the resolution of 35 pc. (Abridged)

accretion and merging in the development of galactic morphologies, the link
between colour and morphology evolution, the effect of AGN feedback on the
photometry of early type galaxies, the redshift evolution in the properties of
quasar hosts, and the impact of AGN winds on the chemical enrichment of the
intergalactic medium (IGM). We have found that the early phases of galaxy
formation are driven by the accretion of cold filamentary flows, which form a
disc at the centre of the dark matter halo. When the dark matter halo is
sufficiently massive to support the propagation of a stable shock, cold
accretion is shut down, and the star formation rate begins to decline. Mergers
transform the disc into an elliptical galaxy, but also bring gas into the
galaxy. Without a mechanism that removes gas from the merger remnants, the
galaxy ends up with blue colours, atypical for its elliptical morphology. AGN
feedback can solve this problem even with a fairly low heating efficiency. We
have also demonstrated that AGN winds are potentially important for the metal
enrichment of the IGM a high redshift.(abridged)

scatter generally observed in the M-T relation derived from lensing masses,
tight constraints on both its slope and normalisation $M_*$ can be obtained
with a moderate number of sources provided that the covered mass range is large
enough. Adding clusters from Bardeau et al. (2007) to our sample, we measure
$M_* = 2.71_{-0.61}^{+0.79} 10^{14} h^{-1} M_\odot$. Although they are
dominated by shot noise and sample variance, our measurements are consistent
with currently favoured values, and set the stage for future surveys. We thus
investigate the dependence of those estimates on survey size, depth, and
integration time, for joint weak lensing and X-ray surveys. We show that deep
surveys should be dedicated to the study of the physics of clusters and groups
of galaxies. For a given exposure time, wide surveys provide a larger number of
detected clusters and are therefore preferred for the measurement of
cosmological parameters such as $\sigma_8$ and $M_*$. We show that a wide

mutation-selection balance for the asexual and sexual replication pathways in
{\it Saccharomyces cerevisiae}. We assume diploid genomes consisting of two
chromosomes, and we assume that each chromosome is functional if and only if
its base sequence is identical to some master sequence. The growth and
replication of the yeast cells is modeled as a first-order process, with
first-order growth rate constants that are determined by whether a given genome
consists of zero, one, or two functional chromosomes. In the asexual pathway,
we assume that a given diploid cell divides into two diploids. In the sexual
pathway, we assume that a given diploid cell divides into two diploids, each of
which then divide into two haploids. The resulting four haploids enter a
haploid pool, where they grow and replicate until they meet another haploid
with which to fuse. When the cost for sex is low, we find that the selective
mating strategy leads to the highest mean fitness of the population, when
compared to all of the other strategies. We also show that, at low to
intermediate replication fidelities, sexual replication with random mating has
a higher mean fitness than asexual replication, as long as the cost for sex is
low. This is consistent with previous work suggesting that sexual replication
is advantageous at high population densities, low replication rates, and
intermediate replication fidelities. The results of this paper also suggest
that {\it S. cerevisiae} switches from asexual to sexual replication when
stressed, because stressful growth conditions provide an opportunity for the
yeast to clear out deleterious mutations from their genomes.

Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in all (odd) $D\geq5$ dimensions. In
particular, we show that horizons on the corresponding phase space satisfy the
zeroth and first laws of black-hole mechanics. We show that the existence of a
Killing spinor on an isolated horizon in four dimensions (when the Chern-Simons
term is dropped) and in five dimensions requires that the induced (normal)
connection on the horizon has to vanish, and this in turn implies that the
surface gravity and rotation one-form are zero. This means that the
gravitational component of the horizon angular momentum is zero, while the
electromagnetic component (which is attributed to the bulk radiation field) is
unconstrained. It follows that an isolated horizon is supersymmetric only if it
is extremal and nonrotating. A remarkable property of these horizons is that
the Killing spinor only has to exist on the horizon itself. It does not have to
exist off the horizon. In addition, we find that the limit when the surface
gravity of the horizon goes to zero provides a topological constraint.
Specifically, the integral of the scalar curvature of the cross sections of the
horizon has to be positive when the dominant energy condition is satisfied and
the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is zero or positive, and in particular
rules out the torus topology for supersymmetric isolated horizons (unless
$\Lambda<0$) if and only if the stress-energy tensor $T_{ab}$ is of the form
such that $T_{ab}\ell^{a}n^{b}=0$ for any two null vectors $\ell$ and $n$ with

population (binaries with almost equal mass stars, q = M2/M1 > 0.95) for the
production of double compact objects and some resulting consequences, including
LIGO inspiral rate and some properties of short-hard gamma-ray bursts. We
employ very optimistic assumptions on the twin fraction (50%) among all
binaries, and therefore our calculations place an upper limits on the influence
of twins on double compact object populations. We show that for LIGO the effect
of including twins is relatively minor: although the merger rates does indeed
increase when twins are considered, the rate increase is fairly small (1.5).
Also, chirp mass distribution for double compact objects formed with or without
twins are almost indistinguishable. If double compact object are short-hard GRB
progenitors, including twins in population synthesis calculations does not
alter significantly the earlier rate predictions for the event rate. However,
for one channel of binary evolution, introducing twins more than doubles the
rate of ``very prompt'' NS-NS mergers (time to merger less than 1 Myr) compared
to models with the ``flat'' q distribution. In that case, 70% of all NS-NS
binaries merge within 100 Myr after their formation, indicating a possibility
of a very significant population of ``prompt'' short-hard gamma-ray bursts,
associated with star forming galaxies. We also point out that, independent of
assumptions, fraction of such prompt neutron star mergers is always high,
35--70%. We note that recent observations (e.g., Berger et al.) indicate that
fraction of short-hard GRBs found in young hosts is at least 40% and possibly
even 80%.

correction leads to a decrease/increase of the spin relaxation time in the
strong/weak scattering limit. At high spin polarization, it reduces the
Hartree-Fock term and consequently tends to decrease the spin relaxation time.
The modification of the spin relaxation time by the local field correction is
more or less moderate either due to the coexistence of scattering other than
the Coulomb scattering at low spin polarization and/or due to the competing
effects from the Coulomb scattering and the Coulomb Hartree-Fock term at high

level so that disorder effects to nonlinear and nonequilibrium quantum
transport can be calculated from atomic first principles in a self-consistent
and efficient manner. We implemented the NVC into a Keldysh non-equilibrium
Green's function (NEGF) based density functional theory (DFT) and applied the
NEGF-DFT-NVC formalism to magnetic tunnel junctions with interface roughness
disorder. Our results show that disorder has dramatic effects to nonlinear spin
injection and tunnel magneto-resistance ratio.

properties of metric spaces in terms of their doubling dimension. This line of
research has not only enhanced our understanding of finite metrics, but has
also resulted in many algorithmic applications. However, we still do not
understand the interaction between various graph-theoretic (topological)
properties of graphs, and the doubling (geometric) properties of the
shortest-path metrics induced by them. For instance, the following natural
question suggests itself: \emph{given a finite doubling metric $(V,d)$, is
there always an \underline{unweighted} graph $(V',E')$ with $V\subseteq V'$
such that the shortest path metric $d'$ on $V'$ is still doubling, and which
agrees with $d$ on $V$.} This is often useful, given that unweighted graphs are
often easier to reason about.
  We show that for any metric space $(V,d)$, there is an \emph{unweighted}
graph $(V',E')$ with shortest-path metric $d':V'\times V' \to \R_{\geq 0}$ such
that
  -- for all $x,y \in V$, the distances $d(x,y) \leq d'(x,y) \leq (1+\eps)
\cdot d(x,y)$, and
  -- the doubling dimension for $d'$ is not much more than that of $d$, where
this change depends only on $\e$ and not on the size of the graph.
  We show a similar result when both $(V,d)$ and $(V',E')$ are restricted to be
trees: this gives a simpler proof that doubling trees embed into constant
dimensional Euclidean space with constant distortion. We also show that our
results are tight in terms of the tradeoff between distortion and dimension
blowup.

rises rapidly and remains at a constant value before returning to the resting
value, a phenomenon known as an action potential. When the pacing rate of a
periodic train of stimuli is increased above a critical value, the action
potential undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation, where the resulting
alternation of the action potential duration is known as alternans in the
medical literature. Existing cardiac models treat alternans either as a smooth
or as a border-collision bifurcation. However, recent experiments in paced
cardiac tissue reveal that the bifurcation to alternans exhibits hybrid
smooth/nonsmooth behaviors, which can be qualitatively described by a model of
so-called unfolded border-collision bifurcation. In this paper, we obtain
analytical solutions of the unfolded border-collision model and use it to
explore the crossover between smooth and nonsmooth behaviors. Our analysis
shows that the hybrid smooth/nonsmooth behavior is due to large variations in
the system's properties over a small interval of the bifurcation parameter,
providing guidance for the development of future models.

young dense stellar systems with a massive star evolution handler that accounts
in a realistic way for the effects of stellar wind mass loss. We discuss two
topics:
  1. The formation and the evolution of very massive stars (with a mass >120
Mo) is followed in detail. These very massive stars are formed in the cluster
core as a consequence of the successive (physical) collison of 10-20 most
massive stars of the cluster (the process is known as runaway merging). The
further evolution is governed by stellar wind mass loss during core hydrogen
burning and during core helium burning (the WR phase of very massive stars).
Our simulations reveal that as a consequence of runaway merging in clusters
with solar and supersolar values, massive black holes can be formed but with a
maximum mass of 70 Mo. In small metallicity clusters however, it cannot be
excluded that the runaway merging process is responsible for pair instability
supernovae or for the formation of intermediate mass black holes with a mass of
several 100 Mo.
  2. Massive runaways can be formed via the supernova explosion of one of the
components in a binary (the Blaauw scenario) or via dynamical interaction of a
single star and a binary or between two binaries in a star cluster. We explore
the possibility that the most massive runaways (e.g., zeta Pup, lambda Cep,
BD+433654) are the product of the collision and merger of 2 or 3 massive stars.

instrumental calibration and the recognition of small instrumental drifts and
calibration systematics. In particu lar, radial velocity drifts due to non
uniform slit illumination and slit optica l misalignment in the two UVES
spectrograph arms can be investigated. The positi on of the solar spectrum
reflected by the asteroids are compared with the solar wavelength positions or
with that of asteroid observations at other epochs or wi th the twilight to
asses UVES instrumental accuracy . Radial velocities offsets in the range
10--50 m/s are generally observed likely due to a non uniform slit
illumination. However, no radial velocity patterns with wavelength are detected
and the two UVES arms provide consistent radial velocities. These results
suggest that the detected alpha variability by Levshakov et al. (2007) deduced
from a drift of -180 (+/- 85) m/s at z =1.84, between two sets of FeII lines
falling in the two UVES arms may be real or induced by other kinds of
systematics than those investigated here. The proposed technique allows real
time quality check of the spectrograph and should be followed for very accurate
measurements.

intrinsic difficulty of their detection, and a new class of observatories such
as the Pan-STARRS and LSST are coming up specifically to observe these
energetic events. In this paper we discuss the UV transient events from two
specific sources, such as possible collisions in extrasolar planetary systems
and M dwarf flares, to find the probability of their detection by space UV
observatories, in particular, by the Tel Aviv University Explorer (TAUVEX).
TAUVEX is an UV imaging experiment that will image large parts of the sky in
the wavelength region between 120 and 350 nm. TAUVEX is a collaborative effort
between the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) and Tel Aviv University, and
is scheduled for an early-2009 launch with at least three years of operations.
The scientific instrument has been fabricated at El-Op in Israel, with the
satellite interfaces, launch and flight operations provided by the Indian Space
Research Organization (ISRO). The ground-based software development is the
responsibility of the IIA while other aspects of the mission are the joint
responsibility of IIA and Tel Aviv University. TAUVEX Science Team (TST) have
created a coherent observing program to address several Key Areas science
objectives, one of them is a program to study short-scale UV transient events.
We have estimated that in one year of TAUVEX observations we can expect about
90-350 short-scale transient events. Because we obtain real-time telemetry with
TAUVEX, we will be able to catch transients early in their evolution and to
alert other observatories. We also present a description of TAUVEX mission,
including instrument design and its estimated performance.

spin-glasses) in their disorder-dominated phases, where the free-energy cost
$F(L)$ of an excitation of length $L$ presents fluctuations that grow as a
power-law $\Delta F(L) \sim L^{\theta}$ with the 'droplet' exponent $\theta$.
Within the droplet theory, the energy and entropy of such excitations present
fluctuations that grow as $\Delta E(L) \sim \Delta S(L) \sim L^{d_s/2}$ where
$d_s$ is the dimension of the surface of the excitation. These systems usually
present a positive 'chaos' exponent $\zeta=d_s/2-\theta>0$, meaning that the
free-energy fluctuation of order $L^{\theta}$ is a near-cancellation of much
bigger energy and entropy fluctuations of order $L^{d_s/2}$. Within the
standard droplet theory, the dynamics is characterized by a barrier exponent
$\psi$ satisfying the bounds $\theta \leq \psi \leq d-1$. In this paper, we
argue that a natural value for this barrier exponent is $\psi=d_s/2$ : (i) for
the directed polymer where $d_s=1$, this corresponds to $\psi=1/2$ in all
dimensions; (ii) for disordered ferromagnets where $d_s=d-1$, this corresponds
to $\psi=(d-1)/2$; (iii) for spin-glasses where interfaces have a non-trivial
dimension $d_s$ known numerically, our conjecture $\psi=d_s/2$ gives numerical
predictions in $d=2$ and $d=3$. We compare these values with the available
numerical results for each case, in particular with the measure $\psi \simeq
0.49$ of Kolton, Rosso, Giamarchi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 180604 (2005) for the

trafficking is a key step of gene delivery. Based on the main physical
properties of the cellular transport machinery such as microtubules, motor

movement are necessary for a virus to reach the cell nucleus, by taking into
account the complex interactions of the virus with the microtubules, we derive
here an estimate of the mean time a virus reaches the nucleus. In particular,
we present a mathematical procedure in which the complex viral movement,
oscillating between pure diffusion and a deterministic movement along
microtubules, can be approximated by a steady state stochastic equation with a
constant effective drift. An explicit expression for the drift amplitude is
given as a function of the real drift, the density of microtubules and other
physical parameters. The present approach can be used to model viral
trafficking inside the cytoplasm, which is a fundamental step of viral
infection, leading to viral replication and in some cases to cell damage.

binary V505 Per are derived by means of Echelle high resolution, high S/N
spectroscopy and B, V photometry. Effective temperatures, gravities, rotational
velocities and metallicities are obtained from atmospheric chi^2 analysis. An
E(B-V)<=0.01 mag reddening is derived from interstellar NaI and KI lines. The
distance to the system computed from orbital parameters (60.6 +/- 1 pc) is
identical to the newly re-reduced Hipparcos parallax (61.5 +/- 1.9 pc). The
masses of the two components (M(1) = 1.2693 +/- 0.0011 and M(2) = 1.2514 +/-
0.0012 Msun) place them in the transition region between convective and
radiative stellar cores of the HR diagram, with the more massive of the two
showing already the effect of evolution within the Main Sequence band (T(1) =
6512 +/- 21 K, T(2) = 6462 +/- 12 K, R(1) = 1.287 +/- 0.014, R(2) = 1.266 +/-
0.013 Rsun). This makes this system of particular relevance to theoretical
stellar models, as a test on the overshooting. We compare the firm
observational results for V505 Per component stars with the predictions of
various libraries of theoretical stellar models (BaSTI, Padova, Granada,
Yonsei-Yale, Victoria-Regina) as well as BaSTI models computed specifically for
the masses and chemical abundances of V505 Per. We found that the overshooting
at the masses of V505 Per component stars is already pretty low, but not null,
and described by efficiencies lambda(OV)=0.093 and 0.087 for the 1.27 and 1.25
Msun components, respectively. According to the computed BaSTI models, the age
of the system is about 0.9 Gyr and the element diffusion during this time has
reduced the surface metallicity from the initial [M/H]=-0.03 to the current
[M/H]=-0.13, in excellent agreement with observed [M/H]=-0.12 +/- 0.03.

accretion disk with an amplitude measured by the disk magnetization $\mu(r,t)
=B_z^2/(\mu_o P_{tot})$, where $P_{tot}$ is the total, gas and radiation,
pressure.
  Below a transition radius $r_J$, a jet emitting disk (the JED) is settled and
drives self-collimated non relativistic jets. Beyond $r_J$, no jet is produced
despite the presence of the magnetic field and a standard accretion disc (the
SAD) is established. The radial distribution of the disk magnetization $\mu$
adjusts itself to any change of the disk accretion rate $\dot m$, thereby
modifying the transition radius $r_J$.
  We propose that a SAD-to-JED transition occurs locally, at a given radius, in
a SAD when $\mu=\mu_{max} \simeq 1$ while the reverse transition occurs in a
JED only when $\mu=\mu_{min}\simeq 0.1$. This bimodal behavior of the accretion
disk provides a promising way to explain the hysteresis cycles followed by
X-ray binaries during outbursts.

temperature insulator-to-metal (MI) transition. In the 1.8-2.0 GPa range, where
the MI transition is below $\approx$20 K, one can observe a sudden collapse of
the MI phase boundary upon increasing pressure and at fixed pressure a magnetic
field induced insulator to metal transition. In high quality samples these
features are accompanied by hysteresis in all measured physical quantities as a
function of temperature and magnetic field. We ascribe these observations to
the crossing of the MI and the magnetic phase boundaries upon increasing
pressure.

We confirm the results obtained in cartesian geometry that flux tubes that are

instability due to an unbalanced magnetic curvature force which gives the tube
a poleward motion both in the non-rotating and in the rotating case. This
poleward drift is found to be more pronounced on tubes originally located at
high latitudes. Finally, rotation is found to decrease the rise velocity of the
flux tubes through the convection zone, especially when the tube is introduced
at low latitudes.

classically defined geometry in the form of ``holographic noise'' whose spatial
character, absolute normalization, and spectrum are predicted with no
parameters. The noise has a distinctive transverse spatial shear signature, and
a flat power spectral density given by the Planck time. An interferometer
signal displays noise due to the uncertainty of relative positions of
reflection events. The noise corresponds to an accumulation of phase offset
with time that mimics a random walk of those optical elements that change the
orientation of a wavefront. It only appears in measurements that compare
transverse positions, and does not appear at all in purely radial position
measurements. A lower bound on holographic noise follows from a covariant upper
bound on gravitational entropy. The predicted holographic noise spectrum is
estimated to be comparable to measured noise in the currently operating
interferometer GEO600. Because of its transverse character, holographic noise
is reduced relative to gravitational wave effects in other interferometer

  Behavior of Threshold Values in Mandelbrot's Fractal Percolation Process","24 pages, 2 figures",,,,"math.PR math-ph math.MP",,"  We study Mandelbrot's percolation process in dimension $d \geq 2$. The
process generates random fractal sets by an iterative procedure which starts by
dividing the unit cube $[0,1]^d$ in $N^d$ subcubes, and independently retaining
or discarding each subcube with probability $p$ or $1-p$ respectively. This
step is then repeated within the retained subcubes at all scales. As $p$ is
varied, there is a percolation phase transition in terms of paths for all $d
\geq 2$, and in terms of $(d-1)$-dimensional ""sheets"" for all $d \geq 3$.
  For any $d \geq 2$, we consider the random fractal set produced at the
path-percolation critical value $p_c(N,d)$, and show that the probability that
it contains a path connecting two opposite faces of the cube $[0,1]^d$ tends to
one as $N \to \infty$. As an immediate consequence, we obtain that the above
probability has a discontinuity, as a function of $p$, at $p_c(N,d)$ for all
$N$ sufficiently large. This had previously been proved only for $d=2$ (for any
$N \geq 2$). For $d \geq 3$, we prove analogous results for sheet-percolation.
  In dimension two, Chayes and Chayes proved that $p_c(N,2)$ converges, as $N
\to \infty$, to the critical density $p_c$ of site percolation on the square
lattice. Assuming the existence of the correlation length exponent $\nu$ for
site percolation on the square lattice, we establish the speed of convergence
up to a logarithmic factor. In particular, our results imply that
$p_c(N,2)-p_c=(\frac{1}{N})^{1/\nu+o(1)}$ as $N \to \infty$, showing an
interesting relation with near-critical percolation.

for producing primary nitrogen in metal-poor massive stars. Chemical evolution
models computed with the inclusion of the yields of fast rotating models at a
metallicity $Z=10^{-8}$ can account for the high N/O abundances observed in
normal metal-poor halo stars. If, as believed, intermediate mass stars did not
have enough time to contribute to the interstellar medium enrichment at such
low metallicities, the above result constitutes a strong case for the existence
of fast rotators in the primordial Universe. An important result of stellar
models of fast rotators is that large quantities of primary 13C are produced.
Hence, our goal is to investigate the consequence of fast rotation on the
evolution of the 12C/13C ratio in the interstellar medium at low metallicity.
We predict that, if fast rotating massive stars were common phenomena in the
early Universe, the primordial interstellar medium of galaxies with a star
formation history similar to the one inferred for our galactic halo should have
12C/13C ratios between 30-300. Without fast rotators, the predicted 12C/13C
ratios would be $\sim$ 4500 at [Fe/H]=-3.5, increasing to $\sim$ 31000 at
around [Fe/H]=-5.0. Current data on very metal-poor giant normal stars in the
galactic halo agree better with chemical evolution models including fast
rotators. To test our predictions, challenging measurements of the 12C/13C in
more extremely metal-poor giants and turnoff stars are required.

experiment of Haljan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett., 87, 21043 (2001)]. In contrast
to stirring a vortex-free condensate, where topological constraints require
that vortices enter from the edge of the condensate, we find that phase defects
in the initial non-condensed cloud are trapped en masse in the emerging
condensate. Bose-stimulated condensate growth proceeds into a disordered vortex
configuration. At sufficiently low temperature the vortices then order into a
regular Abrikosov lattice in thermal equilibrium with the rotating cloud. We
calculate the effect of thermal fluctuations on vortex ordering in the final
gas at different temperatures, and find that the BEC transition is accompanied
by lattice melting associated with diminishing long range correlations between
vortices across the system.

potential angular momentum channels invoving s, p, and d states. For most
channels there are one or more combinations of Zeeman levels that have
extremely small dipole-dipole interactions and are therefore poor candidates
for effective blockade experiments. Channels with promising properties are
identified and discussed. We also present numerical calculations of Rb and Cs
dipole matrix elements and relevant energy levels using quantum defect theory,
allowing for convenient quantitative estimates of the van der Waals
interactions to be made for principal quantum numbers up to 100. Finally, we

234. Optical spectropolarimetric data have demonstrated the presence of a
hidden broad-line region in this powerful (M_V <~ -24.2 after reddening and
starlight correction) narrow-line FRII radio galaxy. Our analysis is aimed at
investigating the X-ray spectral properties of this peculiar source which have
remained poorly known so far. We analyze the 0.5--10 keV spectroscopic data
collected by the EPIC cameras in 2006. The X-ray spectrum of this radio-loud
quasar is typical of a local Compton-thin Seyfert 2 galaxy. It exhibits strong
absorption (Nh~3.5 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}) and a narrow, neutral Fe Kalpha emission
line with an equivalent width of ~140+/-40 eV. Our observation also reveals
that the soft portion of the spectrum is characterized by strong emission lines
with a very low level of scattered primary continuum. A possible explanation of
these features in terms of thermal emission from a two-temperature
collisionally ionized plasma emission seems to be unlikely due to the high
luminosity estimated for this component (L(0.5-2) ~ 6 x 10^{42} erg/s). It is
likely that most of the soft X-ray emission originates from a photoionized
plasma as commonly observed in obscured, radio-quiet Seyfert-like AGNs. This
X-ray observation has definitively confirmed the presence of a hidden quasar in
3C 234. The line-rich spectrum and the steepness of the hard X-ray continuum
(Gamma ~ 1.7) found in this source weaken the hypothesis that the bulk ofthe
X-ray emission in radio-loud AGNs with high excitation optical lines arises
from jet non-thermal emission.

due to vortex depinning. However, near the critical temperature, this
phenomenon does not occur because the vortex activation energy is near zero. We
also show how the current at the transition to the normal state can be computed
from the current-voltage curves measured at low currents. The predictions of

  the electron acceleration problem","31 pages, 6 figures",,"10.1086/527044",,"astro-ph",,"  The impulsive phase of a solar flare marks the epoch of rapid conversion of
energy stored in the pre-flare coronal magnetic field. Hard X-ray observations
imply that a substantial fraction of flare energy released during the impulsive
phase is converted to the kinetic energy of mildly relativistic electrons
(10-100 keV). The liberation of the magnetic free energy can occur as the
coronal magnetic field reconfigures and relaxes following reconnection. We
investigate a scenario in which products of the reconfiguration - large-scale
Alfven wave pulses - transport the energy and magnetic-field changes rapidly
through the corona to the lower atmosphere. This offers two possibilities for
electron acceleration. Firstly, in a coronal plasma with beta < m_e/m_p, the
waves propagate as inertial Alfven waves. In the presence of strong spatial
gradients, these generate field-aligned electric fields that can accelerate
electrons to energies on the order of 10 keV and above, including by repeated
interactions between electrons and wavefronts. Secondly, when they reflect and
mode-convert in the chromosphere, a cascade to high wavenumbers may develop.
This will also accelerate electrons by turbulence, in a medium with a locally
high electron number density. This concept, which bridges MHD-based and
particle-based views of a flare, provides an interpretation of the
recently-observed rapid variations of the line-of-sight component of the
photospheric magnetic field across the flare impulsive phase, and offers
solutions to some perplexing flare problems, such as the flare ""number problem""
of finding and resupplying sufficient electrons to explain the impulsive-phase
hard X-ray emission.

different by a factor $\sim\sqrt{m_C/ m_H}$ what indicates the domination of
the thermal broadening and high degree of relaxation for majority of the
observed metal systems. The analysis of the mean separation of the metal
systems confirms that they can be located in regions with the typical proper
size $R_{cl}\sim 0.1 - 0.25h^{-1}$ Mpc what corresponds to the typical sizes of
protogalaxies with the baryonic masses $M_b\approx 10^9-10^{10}M_\odot$. The
metal abundances observed at redshifts $z=3 - 6$ within both IGM and galaxies
are found to be quite similar to each other what indicates the strong
interaction of young galaxies with the IGM and the important role of dwarf
satellites of host galaxies in such interaction. On the other hand, this metal
abundance can be considered as the integral measure of nuclear reactions within
any stars what in turn restricts the contribution of the stars to the creation
of ionizing UV background. Available now estimates of these abundances
demonstrate that attempts to explain the reionization of the Universe as a
byproduct of the process of synthesis of metals only are problematic and a
significant contribution of unobserved and/or non thermal UV sources seems to
be required.

depth of our ignorance of the fundamental properties of nature. It is commonly
assumed that the explanation for acceleration must come from a new form of
energy dominating the cosmos - dark energy - or a modification of Einstein's
theory of Relativity. It is often overlooked, however, that a currently viable
alternative explanation of the data is radial inhomogeneity which alters the
Hubble diagram without any acceleration. This explanation is often ignored for
two reasons: radial inhomogeneity significantly complicates analysis and
predictions, and so the full details have not been investigated; and it is a
philosophically highly controversial idea, revoking as it does the long-held
Copernican Principle. To date, there has not been a general way of determining
the validity if the Copernican Principle -- that we live at a typical position
in the universe -- significantly weakening the foundations of cosmology as a
scientific endeavour. Here we present an observational test for the Copernican
assumption which can be automatically implemented while we search for dark
energy in the coming decade. Our test is entirely independent of any model for

Furthermore, our result is quite surprising: the regularization occurs for

superstring models is the uplifting of Anti-de Sitter supersymmetric critical
points in the moduli sector to metastable Minkowski or de Sitter vacua with
broken supersymmetry. In all cases described so far, uplifting results in a
displacement of the potential minimum away from the critical point and, if the
uplifting is large, can lead to the disappearance of the minimum altogether. We
propose a variant of F-term uplifting which exactly preserves supersymmetric
critical points and shift symmetries at tree level. In spite of a direct
coupling, the moduli do not contribute to supersymmetry breaking. We analyse
the stability of the critical points in a toy one-modulus sector before and
after uplifting, and find a simple stability condition depending solely on the
amount of uplifting and not on the details of the uplifting sector. There is a
region of parameter space, corresponding to the uplifting of local AdS {\em
maxima} --or, more importantly, local minima of the Kahler function-- where the
critical points are stable for any amount of uplifting. On the other hand,
uplifting to (non- supersymmetric) Minkowski space is special in that all SUSY
critical points, that is, for all possible compactifications, become stable or
neutrally stable.

"0712.3470","Stanislaw Spiez","A. Koyama, J. Krasinkiewicz, and S. Spiez","Embedding compacta into products of curves","71 pages",,,,"math.GT math.AT",,"  We present some results on n-dimensional compacta lying in n-dimensional
products of compacta, in particular, in products of n 1-dimensional compacta.
Most of our basic results are proven under the assumption that the compacta X
admit essential maps into the n-sphere. The results of the present paper may be
viewed as an extension of the theory developed so far by other authors.
  First, we prove that if X is an n-dimensional compactum with $H^n(X) \neq 0$
that embeds in either a product of n curves or the nth symmetric product of a
curve, then there exists an algebraically essential map of X into the n-torus.
Consequently, there exist elements $a_1,...,a_n$ in $H^1(X)$ whose cup product
is non-zero. Therefore, the rank of $H^1(X)$ is at least n, and the category of
X exceeds n. Next, we introduce some new classes of n-dimensional continua and
show that embeddability of locally connected quasi n-manifolds into products of
n curves also implies that the rank of $H^1(X)$ is at least n. It follows that
some 2-dimensional contractible polyhedra are not embeddable in products of two
curves. On the other hand, we show that any collapsible 2-dimensional
polyhedron can be embedded in a product of two trees. We answer a question
posed by Cauty proving that closed surfaces embeddable in products of two
curves can be also embedded in products of two graphs. We prove that no closed
surface, different from the 2-torus, lying in a product of two curves is a
retract of that product.

analyzed as a function of interaction strength, population imbalance, filling
fraction and tunneling parameters. It is shown that population imbalanced
Fermi-Fermi mixtures reduce to strongly interacting Bose-Fermi mixtures in the
molecular limit, in sharp contrast to homogeneous or harmonically trapped
systems where the resulting Bose-Fermi mixture is weakly interacting.
Furthermore, insulating phases are found in optical lattices of Fermi-Fermi
mixtures in addition to the standard phase-separated or coexisting
superfluid/excess fermion phases found in homogeneous systems. The insulating
states can be a molecular Bose-Mott insulator (BMI), a Fermi-Pauli insulator
(FPI), a phase-separated BMI/FPI mixture or a Bose-Fermi checkerboard (BFC).

properties of the chemical composition gradient that develops near the core of
main-sequence stars and, therefore, on the transport processes that are able to
modify the \mu profile in the central regions. We show that in main-sequence
models, similarly to the case of white dwarfs, the periods of high-order
gravity modes are accurately described by a uniform period spacing superposed
to an oscillatory component. The periodicity and amplitude of such component
are related, respectively, to the location and sharpness of the \mu gradient.
We briefly discuss and interpret, by means of this simple approximation, the
effect of turbulent mixing near the core on the periods of both high-order and
low-order g modes, as well as of modes of mixed pressure-gravity character.
