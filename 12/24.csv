among themselves, giving rise to collective flavor conversion effects that are
significant near the neutrinosphere. We develop a formalism to analyze these
collective effects in the complete three-flavor framework. It naturally
generalizes the spin-precession analogy to three flavors and is capable of
analytically describing phenomena like vacuum/MSW oscillations, synchronized
oscillations, bipolar oscillations and spectral split. Using the formalism, we
demonstrate that the flavor conversions may be ""factorized"" into two-flavor
oscillations with hierarchical frequencies. We explicitly show how the
three-flavor solution may be constructed by combining two-flavor solutions. For
a typical supernova density profile, we identify an approximate separation of
regions where distinctly different flavor conversion mechanisms operate, and
demonstrate the interplay between collective and MSW effects. We pictorialize
our results in terms of the ""e_3 - e_8 triangle"" diagram, which is a tool that
can be used to visualize three-neutrino flavor conversions in general, and
offers insights into the analysis of the collective effects in particular.

completely blocked when the flux threading the ring becomes equal to half the
fundamental flux quantum. A transmission resonance then occurs immediately as
the coupling between the ring and the impurity cluster is switched 'on'. It is
shown that the delta-like transmission resonances occur precisely at the
eigenvalues of the side coupled chain of atoms.Thw 'switching' effect can be
observed either for all the eigenvalues of the isolated atomic cluster, or for
a selected set of them, depending on the number of scatterers in the arms of
the ring. The ring-dot coupling can be gradually increased to suppress the
oscillations in the magneto-transmission completely. However, the suppression
can lead either to a complete transparency or no transmission at all,
occasionally accompanied by a reversal of phase at special values of the

which is amenable to the vertical CNT growth process and offers the potential
for a parallel CNT array channel, is simulated using a self-consistent

electrode (required for isolation between electrodes) is advantageous for
transistor operation because it suppresses ambipolar conduction. A vertical
CNTFET with a gate length that covers only 1/6 of the channel length has a much
smaller minimum leakage current than one without underlap, while maintaining
comparable on current. Both n-type and p-type transistor operations with
balanced performance metrics can be achieved on a single partial gate FET by
using proper bias schemes. Even with a gate underlap, it is demonstrated that
increasing the CNT diameter still leads to a simultaneous increase of on
current and minimum leakage current. Along with a partial gate, the simulated
transistor features a significant amount of air between the surface of the
channel CNT and the gate insulator, as is caused by the vertical CNT growth
process. Filing this pore with a high-k insulator is shown to have the
potential to decrease the on current, due to electrostatic phenomena at the

turn, coronal energy release leads to chromospheric evaporation, increasing the
density and thus inhibiting subsequent reconnection of the newly-reconnected
loops. As a result, statistically, the density fluctuates around some critical
level, comparable to that observed in the corona. In the long run, coronal
heating can be represented by repeating cycles of fast reconnection events

build-up and radiative cooling of the coronal plasma.

different models and choose the correct ones. Inevitably, this progress calls
for revisions in the picture of cosmic ray (CR) transport. It also shed light
on the problems with the present day numerical modeling of CR. In this paper we
focus on the analytical way of describing CR propagation and scattering, which
should be used in synergy with the numerical studies. In particular, we use
recently established scaling laws for MHD modes to obtain the transport
properties for CRs. We include nonlinear effects arising from large scale
trapping, to remove the 90 degree divergence. We determine how the efficiency
of the scattering and CR mean free path depend on the characteristics of
ionized media, e.g. plasma $\beta$, Coulomb collisional mean free path.
Implications for particle transport in interstellar medium and solar corona are
discussed. We also examine the perpendicular transport of CRs. Perpendicular
transport depends on the comparison of parallel mean free path and the
injection scale of the turbulence, as well as the Alfv\'enic Mach number.
Normal turbulence does not allow subdiffusion unless there are slab waves. The
critical scale below which subdiffusion applies is provided. These results can
be used to compare with the numerical calculations, provided that these
calculations use the structure of magnetic field which is consistent with the
numerical studies of MHD turbulence.

the lower end of the spectral gap of the Dirac-Coulomb operator for a certain

field in a Landau level ansatz. In both cases, when the charge Z of the nucleus
is not too small, these critical magnetic fields are huge when measured in
Tesla, but not so big when the equation is written in dimensionless form. When
computed in the Landau level ansatz, orders of magnitude of the critical field
are correct, as well as the dependence in Z. The computed value is however
significantly too big for a large Z, and the wave function is not well
approximated. Hence, accurate numerical computations involving the Dirac

Pauli paramagnetic limit are considered within the framework of the
Gorkov-Ginzburg-Landau approach in the lowest Landau level approximation for
both s and d-wave electron pairing. Simple analytical expressions for the
quadratic and quartic coefficients in the order parameter expansion of the
superconducting free energy are derived without relying on gradient or
wavenumber expansions. The existence of a changeover from continuos to
discontinuos superconducting phase transitions predicted to occur in the clean
limit is shown to depend only on the dimensionality of the underlying
electronic band structure. Such a changeover can take place in the quasi 2D
regime below a critical value of a 3D-2D crossover parameter.

some preliminary experimental evidence, led to the expectations of relatively
sizeable strange vector form factors of the proton. For example, it seemed that
the contribution of the fluctuating strange quark-antiquark pairs accounts for
as much as one tenth of the proton's magnetic moment. By the same token, baryon
models which failed to produce the ""vector strangeness"" of the nucleon seemed
disfavored. Recently, however, more accurate measurements and more
sophisticated data analysis, as well as lattice simulations, revealed that the
form factors associated with the vector strangeness of the nucleon are much
smaller than thought previously; in fact, due to the experimental
uncertainties, the measured strange vector-current proton form factors may be
consistent with zero. In the light of that, we re-asses the merit of the baryon
models leading to little or no vector strangeness of the nucleon. It is done on
the concrete example of the baryon model which essentially amounts to the MIT
bag enriched by the diluted instanton liquid.

the main source of irregularity in the solar cycle. The random nature of this
process may make the poloidal field in one hemisphere stronger than that in the
other hemisphere at the end of a cycle. We expect this to induce an asymmetry
in the next sunspot cycle. We look for evidence of this in the observational
data and then model it theoretically with our dynamo code. Since actual polar
field measurements exist only from 1970s, we use the polar faculae number data
recorded by Sheeley (1991) as a proxy of the polar field and estimate the
hemispheric asymmetry of the polar field in different solar minima during the
major part of the twentieth century. This asymmetry is found to have a
reasonable correlation with the asymmetry of the next cycle. We then run our
dynamo code by feeding information about this asymmetry at the successive
minima and compare with observational data. We find that the theoretically
computed asymmetries of different cycles compare favourably with the
observational data, the correlation coefficient being 0.73. Due to the coupling
between the two hemispheres, any hemispheric asymmetry tends to get attenuated
with time. The hemispheric asymmetry of a cycle either from observational data
or from theoretical calculation statistically tends to be less than the
asymmetry in the polar field (as inferred from the faculae data) in the
preceding minimum. This reduction factor turns out to be 0.38 and 0.60
respectively in observational data and theoretical simulation.
