filtering (SA-CF). By using the opinion spreading process, the similarity
between any users can be obtained. The algorithm has remarkably higher accuracy
than the standard collaborative filtering (CF) using Pearson correlation.
Furthermore, we introduce a free parameter $\beta$ to regulate the
contributions of objects to user-user correlations. The numerical results
indicate that decreasing the influence of popular objects can further improve
the algorithmic accuracy and personality. We argue that a better algorithm
should simultaneously require less computation and generate higher accuracy.
Accordingly, we further propose an algorithm involving only the top-$N$ similar
neighbors for each target user, which has both less computational complexity
and higher algorithmic accuracy.

  2008 data, slightly revised mass limits. Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1086/587832",,"astro-ph",,"  We report the results of 19 years of Arecibo timing for two pulsars in the
globular cluster NGC 5904 (M5), PSR B1516+02A (M5A) and PSR B1516+02B (M5B).
This has resulted in the measurement of the proper motions of these pulsars
and, by extension, that of the cluster itself. M5B is a 7.95-ms pulsar in a
binary system with a > 0.13 solar mass companion and an orbital period of 6.86
days. In deep HST images, no optical counterpart is detected within ~2.5 sigma
of the position of the pulsar, implying that the companion is either a white
dwarf or a low-mass main-sequence star. The eccentricity of the orbit (e =
0.14) has allowed a measurement of the rate of advance of periastron: (0.0142
+/-0.0007) degrees per year. We argue that it is very likely that this
periastron advance is due to the effects of general relativity, the total mass
of the binary system then being 2.29 +/-0.17 solar masses. The small measured
mass function implies, in a statistical sense, that a very large fraction of
this total mass is contained in the pulsar: 2.08 +/- 0.19 solar masses (1
sigma); there is a 5% probability that the mass of this object is < 1.72 solar
masses and a 0.77% probability that is is between 1.2 and 1.44 solar masses.
Confirmation of the median mass for this neutron star would exclude most
``soft'' equations of state for dense neutron matter. Millisecond pulsars
(MSPs) appear to have a much wider mass distribution than is found in double
neutron star systems; about half of these objects are significantly more
massive than 1.44 solar masses. A possible cause is the much longer episode of
mass accretion necessary to recycle a MSP, which in some cases corresponds to a
much larger mass transfer.

generation of colliders. For an understanding of the model structure and the
mechanism(s) of symmetry breaking, it is important to know the masses of the
new particles precisely. In this article the measurement of the mass of the
scalar partner of the top quark (stop) at an e+e- collider is studied. A
relatively light stop is motivated by attempts to explain electroweak
baryogenesis and can play an important role in dark matter relic density. A
method is presented which makes use of cross-section measurements near the
pair-production threshold as well as at higher center-of-mass energies. It is
shown that this method not only increases the statistical precision, but also
greatly reduces the systematic uncertainties, which can be important. Numerical
results are presented, based on a realistic event simulation, for two signal
selection strategies: using conventional selection cuts, and using an Iterative
Discriminant Analysis (IDA). Our studies indicate that a precision of
$\Delta\mstop = 0.42$ GeV can be achieved, representing a major improvement
over previous studies. While the analysis of stops is particularly challenging
due to the possibility of stop hadronization, the general procedure could be
applied to the mass measurement of other particles as well. We also comment on
the potential of the IDA to discover a stop quark in this scenario, and we
revisit the accuracy of the theoretical predictions for the neutralino relic
density

would induce a rotation of linear polarization of electromagnetic wave
propagating with cosmological/astrophysical distance. In 2002, DASI
successfully observed the polarization of the cosmological microwave background
radiation. In 2003, WMAP observed the correlation of polarization with
temperature anisotropy at more than 10 sigma in the cosmological microwave
background. From this high polarization-temperature correlation in WMAP
observation, we put a limit of 0.1 rad on the rotation of linear polarization
of cosmological microwave background (CMB) propagation. Pseudoscalar-photon
interaction is proportional to the gradient of the pseudoscalar field. From
phenomenological point of view, this gradient could be neutrino number
asymmetry current, other density current, or a constant vector. In these
situations, Lorentz invariance or CPT may or may not effectively be violated.
In this paper, we review and compile various results. Better accuracy in CMB
polarization observation is expected from PLANCK mission to be launched next
year. A dedicated CMB polarization observer in the future would probe this

pure quantum states of $N$ elementary subsystems, they are defined as the
distances from the sets of $K$-separable states ($K=2,...,N$). The entire set
of generalized geometric measures provides a quantification and hierarchical
ordering of the different bipartite and multipartite components of the global
geometric entanglement, and allows to discriminate among the different
contributions. The extended measures are applied to the study of entanglement
in different classes of $N$-qubit pure states. These classes include $W$ and
$GHZ$ states, and their symmetric superpositions; symmetric multi-magnon
states; cluster states; and, finally, asymmetric generalized $W$-like
superposition states. We discuss in detail a general method for the explicit
evaluation of the multipartite components of geometric entanglement, and we
show that the entire set of geometric measures establishes an ordering among
the different types of bipartite and multipartite entanglement. In particular,
it determines a consistent hierarchy between $GHZ$ and $W$ states, clarifying
the original result of Wei and Goldbart that $W$ states possess a larger global
entanglement than $GHZ$ states. Furthermore, we show that all multipartite
components of geometric entanglement in symmetric states obey a property of
self-similarity and scale invariance with the total number of qubits and the
number of qubits per party.

inequality, spectral gap of the Neumann Laplacian, exponential concentration of
Lipschitz functions, and the a-priori weakest requirement that Lipschitz
functions have \emph{arbitrarily slow} uniform tail-decay, are all
quantitatively equivalent (to within universal constants, independent of the
dimension). This substantially extends previous results of Maz'ya, Cheeger,
Gromov--Milman, Buser and Ledoux. As an application, we conclude a sharp
quantitative stability result for the spectral gap of convex domains under
convex perturbations which preserve volume (up to constants) and under maps
which are ``on-average'' Lipschitz. We also provide a new characterization (up
to constants) of the spectral gap of a convex domain, as one over the square of
the average distance from the ``worst'' subset having half the measure of the

have examined matrix element fluctuations in realistic chaotic geometries, and
shown that at energies of experimental interest these fluctuations generically
exceed by a factor of about 3-4 the predictions of the random wave model. Even
larger fluctuations occur in geometries with a mixed chaotic-regular phase

Hartree-Fock picture and experiment. Among other findings, we show that the

the increase in the number of haloes of mass m from mergers of less massive
objects, and a destruction term, which describes the decrease in the number of
m-haloes as these merge with other haloes, creating more massive haloes as a
result. In models where haloes form from a spherical collapse, the distribution
of halo creation times can be estimated from the same formalism which is used

origin and basic properties of the massive modes are addressed in the general
context involving an arbitrary tensor vacuum value. Special attention is given
to the case of bumblebee models, which are gravitationally coupled vector
theories with spontaneous local Lorentz and diffeomorphism violation. Mode
expansions are presented in both local and spacetime frames, revealing the

The class of bumblebee models with kinetic terms of the Maxwell form is used as
a focus for more detailed study. The nature of the associated conservation laws
and the interpretation as a candidate alternative to Einstein-Maxwell theory
are investigated. Explicit examples involving smooth and Lagrange-multiplier
potentials are studied to illustrate features of the massive modes, including
their origin, nature, dispersion laws, and effects on gravitational
interactions. In the weak static limit, the massive mode and
Lagrange-multiplier fields are found to modify the Newton and Coulomb

(WDW) equation for the noncommutative system. The Seiberg-Witten map is used to
transform the noncommutative equation into a commutative one, i.e. into an
equation with commutative variables, which depend on the noncommutative
parameters, $\theta$ and $\eta$. Numerical solutions are found both for the
classical and the quantum formulations of the system. These solutions are used
to characterize the dynamics and the state of the universe. From the classical
solutions we obtain the behavior of quantities such as the volume expansion,
the shear and the characteristic volume. However the analysis of these
quantities does not lead to any restriction on the value of the noncommutative
parameters, $\theta$ and $\eta$. On the other hand, for the quantum system, one
can obtain, via the numerical solution of the WDW equation, the wave function
of the universe both for commutative as well as for the noncommutative models.
Interestingly, we find that the existence of suitable solutions of the WDW
equation imposes bounds on the values of the noncommutative parameters.
Moreover, the noncommutativity in the momenta leads to damping of the wave
function implying that this noncommutativity can be of relevance for the
selection of possible initial states of the early universe.
