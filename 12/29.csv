a sample of r positions selected at random. Then, except with (exponentially in
r) small probability, the min-entropy of the sample is not smaller than,
roughly, a fraction r/n of the total min-entropy of all positions X_1, ...,
X_n, which is optimal. Here, we show that this statement, originally proven by
Vadhan [LNCS, vol. 2729, Springer, 2003] for the purely classical case, is
still true if the min-entropy is measured relative to a quantum system. Because
min-entropy quantifies the amount of randomness that can be extracted from a
given random variable, our result can be used to prove the soundness of locally
computable extractors in a context where side information might be
quantum-mechanical. In particular, it implies that key agreement in the
bounded-storage model (using a standard sample-and-hash protocol) is fully
secure against quantum adversaries, thus solving a long-standing open problem.

"0712.4297","Xiaolei Zhang","Xiaolei Zhang","On the Nature of Quantum Phenomena",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  It is shown that a coherent understanding of all quantized phenomena,
including those governed by unitary evolution equations as well as those
related to irreversible quantum measurements, can be achieved in a scenario of
successive nonequilibrium phase transitions, with the lowest hierarchy of these
phase transitions occurring in a ``resonant cavity'' formed by the entire
matter and energy content of the universe. In this formalism, the physical laws
themselves are resonantly-selected and ordered in the universe cavity in a
hierarchical manner, and the values of fundamental constants are determined
through a Generalized Mach's Principle. The existence of a preferred reference
frame in this scenario is shown to be consistent with the relational nature of
the origin of physical laws. Covariant unitary evolution is shown to connect
smoothly with the reduction of wavefunction in the preferred frame during
quantum measurement. The superluminal nature of quantum processes in the lowest
hierarchy coexists with the universal speed limit obeyed by processes in higher
hierarchies. A natural quantum-to-classical transition is also obtained which
is stable against the diffusive tendency of the unitary quantum evolution
processes. In this formalism a realistic quasi-classical ontology is
established for the foundations of quantum mechanics.

  Times",,,,,"q-bio.GN q-bio.PE",,"  Estimation of molecular evolutionary divergence times requires models of rate
change. These vary with regard to the assumption of what quantity is penalized.
The possibilities considered are the rate of evolution, the log of the rate of
evolution and the inverse of the rate of evolution. These models also vary with
regard to how time affects the expected variance of rate change. Here the
alternatives are not at all, linearly with time and as the product of rate and
time. This results in a set of nine models, both random walks and Brownian
motion. A priori any of these models could be correct, yet different
researchers may well prefer, or simply use, one rather than the others. Another
variable is whether to use a scaling factor to take account of the variance of
the process of rate change being unknown and therefore avoid minimizing the
penalty function with unrealistically large times. Here the difference these
models and assumptions make on a tree of mammals, with the root fixed and with
a single internal node fixed, is measured. The similarity of models is measured
as the correlation of their time estimates and visualized with a least squares
tree. The fit of model to data is measured and Q-Q plots are shown. Comparing
model estimates with each other, the age of clades within Laurasiatheria are
seen to vary far more across models than those within Supraprimates (informally
called Euarchontoglires). Especially problematic are the often-used fossil
calibrated nodes of horse/rhino and whale/hippo clashing with times within
Supraprimates and in particular no fossil rodent teeth older than ~60 mybp. A
scaling factor in addition to penalizing rate change is seen to yield
consistent relative time estimates irrespective of exactly where the
calibration point is placed.

as the minimum base length of any quantum input which makes a quantum Turing
machine (QTM) halt and output \rho, up to some error tolerance.
  First, we prove that there is a QTM which is universal in the sense of input
base length. Furthermore, we show several general properties of QTMs, including
a result on mutually orthogonal ``halting spaces'', and a way to transform
every almost-halting input into a deterministically-halting input by adding at
most a constant number of qubits.
  Afterwards, we apply these results to QC. In particular, we show that QC is
invariant, incompressible, agrees with classical Kolmogorov complexity for
classical strings, and is closely related to von Neumann entropy for ergodic
quantum information sources.

  Alan Moorwood editor",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Only astronomical observations can effectively probe in space-time the
variabil ity of the physical dimensionless constants such as the fine structure
constant and proton-to-electron mass ratio, \mu, which are related to fund
amental forces of nature. Several theories beyond the Standard Model (SM) allow
fundamental constants to vary, but they cannot make quantitative predictions so
that only laboratory experiments and astronomical observations can show if th
is is the case or set the allowed bounds. At the moment of writing there are c
laims for a variability of both \alpha and \mu at 5 and 4\sigma of C.L.,
respectively, although for \alpha they are contrasted by null results. The
observations are challenging and a new spectrograph such as ESPRESSO at the
combined incoherent focus of 4 VLT units (a potential 16 m equivalent
telescope) will allow for a significant improvement in the precision
measurement clearing up the controversy. If the variations will be confirmed,
the implications are far reaching, revealing new physics beyond the SM and
pointing a direction for GUTs theories. A most exciting ossibility is that a
variation of \alpha is induced by quintessence through its coupling with the
electromagnetic field. If this is the case an accurate measurement of the
variability could provide a way for reconstructing the equation of state of
Dark Energy (Avelino et al 2006).

heteroclinic or homoclinic orbits. Thus, R1 rings are associated to the
presence of heteroclinic orbits, while R1R2 rings are associated to the
presence of homoclinic orbits. Spiral arms and R2 rings, however, appear when
there exist neither heteroclinic nor homoclinic orbits. We examine the
parameter space of three realistic, yet simple, barred galaxy models and
discuss the formation of the different morphologies according to the properties

(X,f,L), where X is a countable semigroup, f : X --> N_0 \cup {\infty} a
function, L : a_1 x_1 + ... + a_h x_h an X-linear form and asks for a subset A
\subseteq X such that there are f(x) solutions (counted appropriately) to
L(x_1,...,x_h) = x for every x \in X, or a proof that no such subset exists.
  This paper represents the first systematic study of this problem for
arbitrary linear forms when X = Z, the setting which in many respects is the
most natural one. Having first settled on the ""right"" way to count
representations, we prove that every primitive form has a unique representation
basis, i.e.: a set A which represents the function f \equiv 1. We also prove
that a partition regular form (i.e.: one for which no non-empty subset of the
coefficients sums to zero) represents any function f for which {f^{-1}(0)} has
zero asymptotic density. These two results answer questions recently posed by
Nathanson.
  The inverse problem for partition irregular forms seems to be more
complicated. The simplest example of such a form is x_1 - x_2, and for this

singular part of the retarded field is first analytically identified and
removed, yielding a finite, differentiable remainder from which the self-force
is easily calculated. This regular remainder solves a wave equation which
enjoys the benefit of having a non-singular source. Solving this wave equation
for the remainder completely avoids the calculation of the singular retarded

modeling a delta function source. From this differentiable remainder one may
compute the self-force, the energy flux, and also a waveform which reflects the

repulsive interactions on the transition temperature $T_c$ of a Bose gas. This
problem provides indeed a beautiful illustration of many of the techniques
which have been discussed at this school on effective theories and
renormalization group. Effective theories are used first in order to obtain a
simple hamiltonian describing the atomic interactions: because the typical
atomic interaction potentials are short range, and the systems that we consider
are dilute, these potentials can be replaced by a contact interaction whose
strength is determined by the s-wave scattering length. Effective theories are
used next in order to obtain a simple formula for the shift in $T_c$: one
exploits there the fact that near $T_c$ the physics is dominated by low
momentum modes whose dynamics is most economically described in terms of
classical fields; the ingredients needed to calculate the shift of $T_c$ can be
obtained from this classical field theory. Finally the renormalization group is
used both to obtain a qualitative understanding, and also as a non perturbative
tool to evaluate quantitatively the shift in $T_c$.

In neuronal networks, the
mechanisms of synchronization have been extensively studied from both
physiological and computational viewpoints. The functional role of
synchronization has also attracted much interest and debate. In particular,
synchronization may allow distant sites in the brain to communicate and
cooperate with each other, and therefore it may play a role in temporal binding
and in attention and sensory-motor integration mechanisms.
  In this article, we study another role for synchronization: the so-called
""collective enhancement of precision."" We argue, in a full nonlinear dynamical
context, that synchronization may help protect interconnected neurons from the
influence of random perturbations -- intrinsic neuronal noise -- which affect
all neurons in the nervous system. This property may allow reliable
computations to be carried out even in the presence of significant noise (as
experimentally found e.g., in retinal ganglion cells in primates), as
mathematically it is key to obtaining meaningful downstream signals, whether in
terms of precisely-timed interaction (temporal coding), population coding, or
frequency coding. Using stochastic contraction theory, we show how
synchronization of nonlinear dynamical systems helps protect these systems from
random perturbations.
  Our main contribution is a mathematical proof that, under specific quantified
conditions, the impact of noise on each individual system and on the spatial
mean can essentially be cancelled through synchronization. Similar concepts may
be applicable to questions in systems biology.

in supernova remnants -- where high collision rates are to be expected -- is
only recently being addressed. Modeling of collisional excitation of OH
demonstrates that 1720, 4765 and 6049 MHz masers can occur under similar
conditions in regions of shocked gas. In particular, the 6049 and 4765 MHz
masers become more significant at increased OH column densities where the 1720
MHz masers begin to be quenched. In supernova remnants, the detection of
excited-state OH line maser emission could therefore serve as a probe of
regions of higher column densities. Using the Very Large Array, we searched for
excited-state OH in the 4.7, 7.8, 8.2 and 23.8 GHz lines in four well studied
supernova remnants with strong 1720 MHz maser emission (SgrAEast, W28, W44 and
IC443). No detections were made, at typical detection limits of around 10
mJy/beam. The search for the 6 GHz lines were done using Effelsberg since the
VLA receivers did not cover those frequencies, and are reported on in an
accompanying letter (Fish, Sjouwerman & Pihlstrom 2007). We also
cross-correlated the positions of known supernova remnants with the positions
of 1612 MHz maser emission obtained from blind surveys. No probable
associations were found, perhaps except in the SgrAEast region. The lack of
detections of excited-state OH indicates that the OH column densities suffice
for 1720 MHz inversion but not for inversion of excited-state transitions,
consistent with the expected results for C-type shocks.

by using the standard finite-size scaling analysis. In the presence of diagonal
disorder all states are localized as predicted by the scaling theory for
two-dimensional systems. In the case of OD disorder, the states at the Dirac
point (E=0) are shown to be delocalized due to the specific chiral symmetry,
although other states ($E \neq 0$) are still localized. In OD disorder the
conductance at E=0 in an $M\times L$ rectangular system at the thermodynamical
limit is calculated with the transfer-matrix technique for various values of
ratio $M/L$ and different types of distribution functions of the OD elements
$t_{nn'}$. It is found that if all the $t_{nn'}$'s are positive the conductance
is independent of $L/M$ as restricted by 2 delocalized channels at E=0. If the
distribution function includes the sign randomness of elements $t_{nn'}$, the
conductivity, rather than the conductance, becomes $L/M$ independent. The
calculated value of the conductivity is around $\frac{4e^2}{h}$, in consistence

momentum space: the adiabatic region where the geometric phase can be
approximated by the Berry phase and the chaotic region where the geometric

to vibrations shows spikes in the chaotic region. The results suggest a
possible dephasing mechanism which may cause classical-like transport

reconstruction. The novel test was applied to the problem of detecting the
myelin signal, which is believed to have a time constant below 40ms, in T2
decays from MRI's of the human brain. It was demonstrated that the test allowed
the detection of a signal in a relaxation spectrum using only the information
in the data, thus avoiding any potentially unreliable prior information. The
test was implemented both explicitly and implicitly for simulated T2
measurements. For the explicit implementation, the null hypothesis was that a
relaxation spectrum existed that had no signal below 40ms and that was
consistent with the T2 decay. The confidence level by which the null hypothesis
could be rejected gave the confidence level that there was signal below the
40ms time constant. The explicit implementation assessed the test's performance
with and without prior information where the prior information was the
nonnegative relaxation spectrum assumption. The test was also implemented
implicitly with a data conserving multiexponential reconstruction algorithm
that used left invertible matrices and that has been published previously. The
implicit and explicit implementations demonstrated similar characteristics in
detecting the myelin signal in both the simulated and experimental T2 decays,
providing additional evidence to support the close link between the two tests.

that can achieve the maximum possible rate of $k=n-\mu$ packets that are
information-theoretically secure from the adversary. A distinctive feature of
our scheme is that it is universal: it can be applied on top of any
communication network without requiring knowledge of or any modifications on
the underlying network code. In fact, even a randomized network code can be
used. Our approach is based on Rouayheb-Soljanin's formulation of a wiretap
network as a generalization of the Ozarow-Wyner wiretap channel of type II.
Essentially, the linear MDS code in Ozarow-Wyner's coset coding scheme is
replaced by a maximum-rank-distance code over an extension of the field in

surface brightness distribution and rotation curve from the emission lines in
NGC 5077, we found that the observed kinematics of the circumnuclear gas can be
accurately reproduced by adding to the stellar mass component a black hole mass
of M_bh = 6.8 (-2.8,+4.3) 10**8 M_sun (uncertainties at a 1 sigma level); the
radius of its sphere of influence (R_sph ~ 0"".34) is well-resolved at the HST
resolution. The BH mass estimate in NGC 5077 is in fairly good agreement with
both the M_bh-M_bul (with an upward scatter of ~ 0.4 dex) and M_bh-sigma
correlations (with an upward scatter of 0.5 dex in the Tremaine et al. form and
essentially no scatter using the Ferrarese et al. form) and provides further
support for the presence of a connection between the ``residuals'' from the
M_bh-sigma correlation and the bulge effective radius. This indicates the
presence of a black hole's ``fundamental plane'' in the sense that a
combination of at least sigma and R_e drives the correlations between M_bh and
host bulge properties.
