direction in the sky) for several WIMP velocity distributions including the
standard dark halo and anisotropic models such as Sikivie's late-infall halo
model and logarithmic-ellipsoidal models. Since some detectors may be unable to
distinguish the beginning of the recoil track from its end (lack of head-tail
discrimination), we introduce a ``folded'' directional recoil rate
${dR}/{d|\cos\theta|}$, where $|\cos\theta|$ does not distinguish the head from
the tail of the track. We compute the CS$_2$ and CF$_4$ exposures required to
distinguish a signal from an isotropic background noise, and find that
${dR}/{d|\cos\theta|}$ is effective for the standard dark halo and some but not
all anisotropic models.

quantum stabilizer codes to the construction of classical parity-check matrices
that satisfy a specific commutative condition. The quantum stabilizer codes
from this construction have a larger set of correctable error operators than
expected. Its (asymptotic) coding efficiency is comparable to that of CSS

involving just one type of proliferating cell that may divide both
symmetrically and asymmetrically. Curiously, these simple rules provide
excellent predictions of the cell population dynamics without having to address
their spatial distribution. Yet, if the spatial behaviour of cells is addressed
by allowing cells to diffuse at random, one deduces that density fluctuations
destroy tissue confluence, implying some hidden degree of spatial regulation in
the physical system. To infer the mechanism of spatial regulation, we consider
a two-dimensional model of cell fate that preserves the overall population
dynamics. By identifying the resulting behaviour with a three-species variation
of the ""Voter"" model, we predict that proliferating cells in the basal layer
should cluster. Analysis of empirical correlations of cells stained for
proliferation activity confirms that the expected clustering behaviour is
indeed seen in nature.

Feshbach-Villars transformation. The creation of pairs is predicted from the
boundary condition of the charge density.

called top-pions and at loop level they can induce the FCNC top quark decay
t->cgg which is extremely suppressed in the Standard Model (SM). We find that
in the allowed parameter space the TC2 model can greatly enhance such a FCNC
decay and push the branching ratio up to 10^{-3}, which is much larger than the
predictions in the SM (10^{-9}) and in the minimal supersymmetric model
(10^{-4}). We also compare the result with the two-body FCNC decay t-> cg and
find that the branching ratio of t-> cgg is slightly larger than t-> cg. Such
enhanced FCNC top quark decays may serve as a good probe of TC2 model at the
future top quark factory.

  https://edms.cern.ch/document/787414/2",,,"UCBL N d'ordre: 163-2005","physics.acc-ph physics.med-ph",,"  In the last ten years the use of proton beams in radiation therapy has become
a clinical tool for treatment of deep-seated tumours. LIBO is a RF compact and
low cost proton linear accelerator (SCL type) for hadrontherapy. It is
conceived by TERA Foundation as a 3 GHz Linac Booster, to be mounted downstream
of an existing cyclotron in order to boost the energy of the proton beam up to
200 MeV, needed for deep treatment (~25 cm) in the human body. With this
solution it is possible to transform a low energy commercial cyclotron,
normally used for eye melanoma therapy, isotope production and nuclear physics
research, into an accelerator for deep-seated tumours. A prototype module of
LIBO has been built and successfully tested with full RF power at CERN and with
proton beam at INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Sud (LNS) in Catania, within an
international collaboration between TERA Foundation, CERN, the Universities and
INFN groups of Milan and Naples. The mid-term aim of the project is the
technology transfer of the accumulated know-how to a consortium of companies
and to bring this novel medical tool to hospitals. The design, construction and
tests of the LIBO prototype are described in detail.
