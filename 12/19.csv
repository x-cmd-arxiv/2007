provides a simple yet powerful way to understand aspects of binary black hole
(BBH) merger. This approach relies on the symmetry properties of initial and
final quantities like the black hole mass m, kick velocity {\bf k}, and spin
vector {\bf s}, rather than a detailed understanding of the merger dynamics. In
this paper, we expand on this proposal, examine how well its predictions agree
with current simulations, and discuss several future directions that would make
it an even more valuable tool. The spin expansion yields many new predictions,
including several exact results that may be useful for testing numerical codes.
Some of these predictions have already been confirmed, while others await
future simulations. We explain how a relatively small number of simulations --
10 equal-mass simulations, and 16 unequal-mass simulations -- may be used to
calibrate all of the coefficients in the spin expansion up to second order at
the minimum computational cost. For a more general set of simulations of given
covariance, we derive the minimum-variance unbiased estimators for the spin
expansion coefficients. We discuss how this calibration would be interesting
and fruitful for general relativity and astrophysics. Finally, we sketch the
extension to eccentric orbits.

  introduction","Phys.Rev.D77:064033,2008","10.1103/PhysRevD.77.064033",,"hep-th gr-qc",,"  Matched asymptotic expansion is a useful technique in General Relativity and
other fields whenever interaction takes place between physics at two different
length scales. Here matched asymptotic expansion is argued to be equivalent
quite generally to Classical Effective Field Theory (CLEFT) where one (or more)
of the zones is replaced by an effective theory whose terms are organized in
order of increasing irrelevancy, as demonstrated by Goldberger and Rothstein in
a certain gravitational context. The CLEFT perspective has advantages as the
procedure is clearer, it allows a representation via Feynman diagrams, and
divergences can be regularized and renormalized in standard field theoretic
methods. As a side product we obtain a wide class of classical examples of
regularization and renormalization, concepts which are usually associated with
Quantum Field Theories.
  We demonstrate these ideas through the thermodynamics of caged black holes,
both simplifying the non-rotating case, and computing the rotating case. In
particular we are able to replace the computation of six two-loop diagrams by a
single factorizable two-loop diagram, as well as compute certain new three-loop
diagrams. The results generalize to arbitrary compactification manifolds. For
caged rotating black holes we obtain the leading correction for all
thermodynamic quantities. The angular momentum is found to non-renormalize at
leading order.

"0712.2873","Sean Lee","Sean Lee","Towards a Physical Theory of Subjective Mental States","Submitted to Foundations of Physics Oct.8, 2007",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Any complete theory of physical reality must allow for the ubiquitous
phenomenon of subjective experience at some level, or risk being conceptually
incoherent. However, as long as the ontological status of subjectivity itself
remains unresolved, the topic will be seen as more within the purview of
philosophy than of physics. Towards a resolution of this issue within
empirically motivated physical theory, this article introduces an operational
definition that ultilizes the general consensus that subjective mental states,
whatever else is controversial about them, at least correlate in some way to
physical states. It is shown here that implementing this underappreciated
assumption within the framework of a physical theory in fact leads to
wide-ranging consequences. In particular, a correlation requires there exist a
well-defined mapping from a space of subjective mental states onto a space of
information-bearing elements of some physical theory. Given the peculiar nature
of subjective states as inherently private appearances, any empirical
identification of states must be performed by the experiencing subject. It is
argued that such an operationally defined 'self-measuring' act leads
unavoidably to an 'uncertainty principle' that is analogous in some intriguing
ways to Heisenberg's principle for quantum mechanics. A model is then
introduced for subjective states as algorithmically incomputable numbers.
Additionaally, an inequality similar to Bell's theorem may be derived,
indicating an analogy with the violations of local reality and the ontology of
observables within quantum mechanics.

gates in a model of interacting two-level particles. One particle (the qubit)
serves as the quantum information processor, whose evolution is controlled by a
time-dependent external field. The other particles are not directly controlled
and serve as an effective environment, coupling to which is the source of
decoherence. The control objective is to generate target one-qubit gates in the
presence of strong environmentally-induced decoherence and under physically
motivated restrictions on the control field. It is found that interactions
among the environmental particles have a negligible effect on the gate fidelity
and require no additional adjustment of the control field. Another interesting
result is that optimally controlled quantum gates are remarkably robust to
random variations in qubit-environment and inter-environment coupling
strengths. These findings demonstrate the utility of optimal control for
management of quantum-information systems in a very precise and specific
manner, especially when the dynamics complexity is exacerbated by inherently
uncertain environmental coupling.

the survival probability and a decrease of the amplitude of oscillations in the
Earth, reflecting the transition to a more adiabatic propagation inside the
star. These changes affect the lower energy neutrinos first; they are faster
and more sizable for larger theta_13. They are unique of ONeMg-core supernovae,
and give the possibility to test the speed of the shock wave. The time
modulation of the Earth effect and its negative sign at the neutronization peak
are the most robust signatures in a detector.

Collisions range from being elastic to completely destructive due to the onset

map out the role of relative phase, impact speed and interaction strength. In
particular, we identify the importance of the collapse time in the onset of

significantly reduced in the future. For the low dilepton invariant mass

modification (e.g., phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in MAPK cascades).
Our paper explores the kind of information processing and filtering that can be
accomplished by this simple biochemical circuit.
  Signaling cycles are particularly known for exhibiting a highly sigmoidal
(ultrasensitive) input-output characteristic in a certain steady-state regime.
Here we systematically study the cycle's steady-state behavior and its response
to time-varying stimuli. We demonstrate that the cycle can actually operate in
four different regimes, each with its specific input-output characteristics.
These results are obtained using the total quasi-steady-state approximation,
which is more generally valid than the typically used Michaelis-Menten
approximation for enzymatic reactions. We invoke experimental data that
suggests the possibility of signaling cycles operating in one of the new
regimes.
  We then consider the cycle's dynamic behavior, which has so far been
relatively neglected. We demonstrate that the intrinsic architecture of the
cycles makes them act - in all four regimes - as tunable low-pass filters,
filtering out high-frequency fluctuations or noise in signals and environmental
cues. Moreover, the cutoff frequency can be adjusted by the cell. Numerical
simulations show that our analytical results hold well even for noise of large
amplitude. We suggest that noise filtering and tunability make signaling cycles
versatile components of more elaborate cell signaling pathways.

1.8 mm/s observed near closest approach during the Earth flybys of the Galileo,
NEAR, Cassini and Rosetta spacecraft. Here, these flybys are modelled using a
theory that assumes that inertia is caused by a form of Unruh radiation,
modified by a Hubble-scale Casimir effect. This theory predicts that when the
craft's accelerations relative to the galactic centre approached zero near
closest approach, their inertial masses reduced for about 10^-7 s causing
Earthward jumps of 2.6, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.9 mm/s respectively, and, to conserve
angular momentum, increases in orbital velocity of a few mm/s that, except
NEAR's, were quite close to those observed. However, these results were
extremely sensitive to the Hubble constant used. As an experimental test of
these ideas, it is proposed that metamaterials could be used to bend Unruh
radiation around objects, possibly reducing their inertial mass.

to time-dependent mean-field equations - that allows for a comparison with more
familiar and used generator coordinate (GCM) and adiabatic time-dependent
Hartree-Fock (ATDHF) methods. It is shown that the action functional whose
value for the instanton is the quasiclassical estimate of the decay exponent
fulfils the minimum principle when additional constraints are imposed on trial
fission paths. In analogy with mechanics, these are conditions of energy
conservation and the velocity-momentum relations. In the adiabatic limit the
instanton method reduces to the time-odd ATDHF equation, with collective mass
including the time-odd Thouless-Valatin term, while the GCM mass completely
ignores velocity-momentum relations. This implies that GCM inertia generally
overestimates instanton-related decay rate.
  The very existence of the minimum principle offers a hope for a variational
search for instantons. After the inclusion of pairing, the instanton equations
and the variational principle can be expressed in terms of the
imaginary-time-dependent Hartree-Fock- Bogolyubov (TDHFB) theory. The adiabatic

are a few QMA-complete problems, most notably the ``Local Hamiltonian'' problem
introduced by Kitaev. In this dissertation we show some new QMA-complete
problems.
  The first one is ``Consistency of Local Density Matrices'': given several
density matrices describing different (constant-size) subsets of an n-qubit
system, decide whether these are consistent with a single global state. This
problem was first suggested by Aharonov. We show that it is QMA-complete, via
an oracle reduction from Local Hamiltonian. This uses algorithms for convex
optimization with a membership oracle, due to Yudin and Nemirovskii.
  Next we show that two problems from quantum chemistry, ``Fermionic Local
Hamiltonian'' and ``N-representability,'' are QMA-complete. These problems
arise in calculating the ground state energies of molecular systems.
N-representability is a key component in recently developed numerical methods
using the contracted Schrodinger equation. Although these problems have been
studied since the 1960's, it is only recently that the theory of quantum
computation has allowed us to properly characterize their complexity.
  Finally, we study some special cases of the Consistency problem, pertaining
to 1-dimensional and ``stoquastic'' systems. We also give an alternative proof
of a result due to Jaynes: whenever local density matrices are consistent, they
are consistent with a Gibbs state.

a subject of interest. Furthermore, recent work indicates that quantum chaos
may well be significant in quantum information processing. In this paper we
discuss the quantum to classical crossover of a superconducting quantum
inference device (SQUID) ring. Such devices comprise of thick superconducting
loop enclosing a Josephson weak link. These devices are currently strong
candidates for many applications in quantum technologies. The weak link brings
with it a non-linearity such that semi-classical models of this system can
exhibit chaotic dynamics. For many similar systems an application of the
correspondence principle together with the inclusion of environmental degrees
of freedom through a quantum trajectories approach can be used to effectively
recover classical dynamics. Here we show (i) that the standard expression of
the correspondence principle is incompatible with the ring Hamiltonian and we
present a more pragmatic and general expression which finds application here
and (ii) that practical limitations to circuit parameters of the SQUID ring
prevent arbitrarily accurate recovery of classical chaotic dynamics.

not confined to the galactic nucleus. For the eight sources with redshifts we
measure linear sizes between 1 and 8 kpc with a median of 5 kpc. Therefore,
they are in general larger than local ULIRGs which may support an early-stage
merger scenario for the starburst trigger. X-rays betray AGN in six of the 33

suggesting a lower incidence of AGN amongst the submm-luminous galaxies which
is, in turn, consistent with increased X-ray absorption in these dust-obscured

constrains models of galaxies and their evolution. Dust attenuation and star
formation history (SFH) are the dominant factors affecting the color of
galaxies. Here we explore the empirical relation between SFH, attenuation, and
color for a wide range of galaxies, including early types. These galaxies have
been observed by GALEX, SDSS, and Spitzer, allowing the construction of
measures of dust attenuation from the ratio of infrared (IR) to ultraviolet
(UV) flux and measures of SFH from the strength of the 4000A break. The
empirical relation between these three quantities is compared to models that
separately predict the effects of dust and SFH on color. This comparison
demonstrates the quantitative consistency of these simple models with the data
and hints at the power of multiwavelength data for constraining these models.
The UV color is a strong constraint; we find that a Milky Way extinction curve
is disfavored, and that the UV emission of galaxies with large 4000A break
strengths is likely to arise from evolved populations. We perform fits to the
relation between SFH, attenuation, and color. This relation links the
production of starlight and its absorption by dust to the subsequent reemission
of the absorbed light in the IR. Galaxy models that self-consistently treat
dust absorption and emission as well as stellar populations will need to
reproduce these fitted relations in the low-redshift universe.

the turbulence in observed star-forming clouds is driven or decaying. Comparing
our simulations with observed cores in the Perseus and $\rho$ Ophiuchus clouds
shows reasonably good agreement between the observed and simulated core-to-core

that the linewidths through protostellar cores in both simulations are too
large compared to the observations. The disagreement is noticably worse for the
decaying simulation, in which cores show highly supersonic infall signatures in
their centers that decrease toward their edges, a pattern not seen in the

ergodicity is also a key component for using batch means methods to
consistently estimate the variance of the asymptotic normal distribution.
Together, our results give practitioners the tools to be as confident in

frustration of the $Sm^{3+}$ spins on the pyrochlore lattice. The ground state
of $Sm^{3+}$ ions in both pyrochlores is a well-isolated Kramer's doublet. The

``central spin'' problem) at low temperature is believed to be dominated by
interactions with nuclear spins in the lattice. This decoherence is partially
suppressed through the application of a large magnetic field that splits the
energy levels of the electron spin and prevents depolarization. However,
dephasing decoherence resulting from a dynamical nuclear spin bath cannot be
removed in this way. Fluctuations of the nuclear field lead to uncertainty of
the electron's precessional frequency in a process known as spectral diffusion.
This article considers the effect of the electron's wavefunction shape upon
spectral diffusion and provides wavefunction dependent decoherence time
formulas for free induction decay as well as spin echoes and concatenated
dynamical decoupling schemes for enhancing coherence. We also discuss dephasing
of a qubit encoded in singlet-triplet states of a double quantum dot. A central
theoretical result of this work is the development of a continuum approximation
for the spectral diffusion problem which we have applied to GaAs and InAs
materials specifically.

electronic structure approaches. It employs stochastic techniques for solving
the stationary Schr\"" odinger equation and for evaluation of expectation

correlated wave functions, which allow the study of many-body effects beyond
the reach of mean-field methods. The most important limit on QMC accuracy is
the fixed-node approximation, which comes from necessity to circumvent the
fermion sign problem. The size of resulting fixed-node errors depends on the
quality of the nodes (the subset of position space where the wave function
vanishes) of a used wave function. In this dissertation, we analyze the nodal
properties of the existing fermionic wave functions and offer new types of
variational wave functions with improved nodal structure.

models have led to the discovery of new phenomena in the supernova core, for
example a generic hydrodynamic instability of the stagnant supernova shock
against low-mode nonradial deformation and the excitation of gravity-wave
activity in the surface and core of the nascent neutron star. Both can have
supportive or decisive influence on the inauguration of the explosion, the
former by improving the conditions for energy deposition by neutrino heating in
the postshock gas, the latter by supplying the developing blast with a flux of
acoustic power that adds to the energy transfer by neutrinos. While recent
two-dimensional models suggest that the neutrino-driven mechanism may be viable
for stars from about 8 solar masses to at least 15 solar masses, acoustic
energy input has been advocated as an alternative if neutrino heating fails.
Magnetohydrodynamic effects constitute another way to trigger explosions in
connection with the collapse of sufficiently rapidly rotating stellar cores,
perhaps linked to the birth of magnetars. The global explosion asymmetries seen
in the recent simulations offer an explanation of even the highest measured
kick velocities of young neutron stars.

observed even at 1073 K substrate temperature which is much higher that the
bulk anatase to rutile phase transformation temperature. The deposited TiO2

obtained from the thin films prepared at substrate temperature of 873K.
Combining the results from XPS and PEC studies, we conclude that the deposition
pressure affects the concentration of the oxygen vacancies which changes the
electronic structure of the TiO2. With reference to photoelectrochemical
catalytic performance, our results suggest that it is possible to adjust the
Fermi energy level and structure of TiO2 thin films by controlling the buffer
gas pressure and temperature to align the energy of the flatband potential

solved analytically for any massive mode with m^2>0, in contrast with numerical

Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations and to compute the corrections to Newton's law in
the thin brane limit. In the first case we consider a solution with a mass gap
in the spectrum of KK fluctuations with two bound states - the massless 4D
graviton free of tachyonic instabilities and a massive KK excitation - as well
as a tower of continuous massive KK modes which obey a Legendre equation. The
mass gap is defined by the inverse of the brane thickness, allowing us to get
rid of the potentially dangerous multiplicity of arbitrarily light KK modes. It
is shown that due to this lucky circumstance, the solution of the mass
hierarchy problem is much simpler and transparent than in the (thin)

smooth version of the RS model with a single massless bound state, which
accounts for the 4D graviton, and a sector of continuous fluctuation modes with

kinds of edge elimination: edge deletion, edge contraction and deletion of
edges together with their end points. Like in the case of deletion and
contraction only (W. Tutte, 1954), it turns out that there is a most general
polynomial satisfying such recurrence relations, which we call $\xi(G,x,y,z)$.
We show that the new polynomial simultaneously generalizes the Tutte
polynomial, the matching polynomial, and the recent generalization of the
chromatic polynomial proposed by K.Dohmen, A.P\""{o}nitz and P.Tittman (2003),
including also the independent set polynomial of I. Gutman and F. Harary,
(1983) and the vertex-cover polynomial of F,M. Dong, M.D. Hendy, K.T. Teo and
C.H.C. Little (2002). We establish two definitions of the new polynomial:
first, the most general confluent recursive definition, and then an explicit
one, using a set expansion formula, and prove their identity. We further expand
this result to edge-labeled graphs as was done for the Tutte polynomial by T.
Zaslavsky (1992) and B. Bollob\'as and O. Riordan (1999). The edge labeled
polynomial $\xi_{lab}(G,x,y,z, \bar{t})$ also generalizes the chain polynomial
of R.C. Read and E.G. Whitehead Jr. (1999). Finally, we discuss the complexity
of computing $\xi(G,x,y,z)$.

  Programming Environments (WLPE2007)",,,,"cs.PL cs.SE",,"  The SINTAGMA information integration system is an infrastructure for
accessing several different information sources together. Besides providing a
uniform interface to the information sources (databases, web services, web
sites, RDF resources, XML files), semantic integration is also needed. Semantic
integration is carried out by providing a high-level model and the mappings to
the models of the sources. When executing a query of the high level model, a
query is transformed to a low-level query plan, which is a piece of Prolog code
that answers the high-level query. This transformation is done in two phases.
First, the Query Planner produces a plan as a logic formula expressing the
low-level query. Next, the Query Optimizer transforms this formula to
executable Prolog code and optimizes it according to structural and statistical
information about the information sources.
  This article discusses the main ideas of the optimization algorithm and its
implementation.

of 58 X-ray selected AGN in the GOODS portion of the Chandra Deep Field South
(CDF-S) region at z~0.5-1.4. The AGN are selected such that their rest-frame UV
to near-IR SEDs are dominated by stellar emission, i.e., they show a prominent
1.6micron bump, thus minimizing the AGN emission 'contamination'. This AGN
population comprises approximately 50% of the X-ray selected AGN at these
redshifts. Using models of stellar and dust emission we model their SEDs to
derive stellar masses (M*) and total (UV+IR) star formation rates (SFR). AGN
reside in the most massive galaxies at the redshifts probed here. Their
characteristic stellar masses (M*~7.8x10^10 Msun and M*~1.2x10^11 Msun at
median z of 0.67 and 1.07, respectively) appear to be representative of the
X-ray selected AGN population at these redshifts, and are intermediate between
those of local type 2 AGN and high redshift (z~2) AGN. The inferred black hole
masses (MBH~ 2x10^8 Msun) of typical AGN are similar to those of optically
identified quasars at similar redshifts. Since the AGN in our sample are much
less luminous (L(2-10keV)<10^44 erg/s) than quasars, typical AGN have low
Eddington ratios (eta~0.01-0.001). This suggests that, at least at intermediate
z, the cosmic AGN 'downsizing' is due to both a decrease in the characteristic
stellar mass of typical host galaxies, and less efficient accretion. Finally
there is no strong evidence in AGN host galaxies for either highly suppressed
SF (expected if AGN played a role in quenching SF) or elevated SF when compared
to mass selected (i.e., IRAC-selected) galaxies of similar stellar masses and
redshifts. This may be explained by the fact that galaxies with M*~5x 10^10 -
5x10^11 Msun are still being assembled at the redshifts probed here.

protein-protein assemblies in many different cells. A quantitative
characterization of the mechanisms intertwining structure, chemistry and
dynamics with the PDZ function represent a challenge in molecular biology. Here
we investigated the influence of native state topology on the thermodynamics
and the dissociation kinetics for a complex PDZ-peptide via Molecular Dynamics
simulations based on a coarse-grained description of PDZ domains. Our
native-centric approach neglects chemical details but incorporates the basic
structural information to reproduce the protein functional dynamics as it
couples to the binding. We found that at physiological temperatures the
unbinding of a peptide from the PDZ domain becomes increasingly diffusive
rather than thermally activated, as a consequence of the significant reduction
of the free energy barrier with temperature. In turn, this results in a
significant slowing down of the process of two orders of magnitude with respect
to the conventional Arrhenius extrapolation from low temperature calculations.
Finally, a detailed analysis of a typical unbinding event based on the rupture
times of single peptide-PDZ contacts allows to shed further light on the
dissociation mechanism and to elaborate a coherent picture of the relation
between function and dynamics in PDZ domains.

The character of such algorithm gives rise to a continuous phase transition
which distinguishes a phase where the algorithm is able to reduce the whole
system of numbers into primes and a phase where the system reaches a frozen
state with low prime density. In this paper we firstly pretend to give a broad
characterization of this phase transition, both in terms of analytical and
numerical analysis. Critical exponents are calculated, and data collapse is
provided. Further on we redefine the model as a search problem, fitting it in
the hallmark of computational complexity theory. We suggest that the system
belongs to the class NP. The computational cost is maximal around the
threshold, as common in many algorithmic phase transitions, revealing the
presence of an easy-hard-easy pattern. We finally relate the nature of the
phase transition to an average-case classification of the problem.

results show that this resonance can be obtained by a differential planetary
migration. The moderate initial eccentricities, relatively slower migration and
suitable eccentricity damping rate increase significantly the probability of
being trapped in this resonance. Otherwise, the system crosses the 3:1
commensurability avoiding resonance capture, to be eventually captured into a
2:1 resonance or some other higher-order resonances. After the resonance
capture, the system could jump from one orbital configuration to another one if
the migration continues, making a large region of the configuration space
accessible for a resonance system. These investigations help us understand the
diversity of resonance configurations and put some constrains on the early
dynamical evolution of orbits in the extra-solar planetary systems.

scope of the Galactic Emission Mapping (GEM) project, an observational program
conceived and developed to reveal the large-scale properties of Galactic
synchrotron radiation through a set of self-consistent surveys of the radio
continuum between 408 MHz and 10 GHz. The GEM experiment uses a portable and
double-shielded 5.5-m radiotelescope in altazimuthal configuration to map
60-degree-wide declination bands from different observational sites by
circularly scanning the sky at zenithal angles of 30 deg from a constantly
rotating platform. The observations were accomplished with a total power
receiver, whose front-end High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) amplifier
was matched directly to a cylindrical horn at the prime focus of the parabolic
reflector. The Moon was used to calibrate the antenna temperature scale and the
preparation of the map required direct subtraction and destriping algorithms to
remove ground contamination as the most significant source of systematic error.
We used 484 hours of total intensity observations from two locations in
Colombia and Brazil to yield 66% sky coverage from DEC = -51.73 deg to DEC =
+34.78 deg. The zero-level uncertainty of the combined survey is 103 mK with a
temperature scale error of 5% after direct correlation with the Rhodes/HartRAO
survey at 2326 MHz on a T-T plot. The sky brightness distribution into regions
of low and high emission in the GEM survey is consistent with the appearance of
a transition region as seen in the Haslam 408 MHz and WMAP K-band surveys.
Preliminary results also show that the temperature spectral index between 408
MHz and the 2.3 GHz band of the GEM survey has a weak spatial correlation with
these regions; but it steepens significantly from high to low emission regions
with respect to the WMAP K-band survey.

passed through the apertures not by the surface waves, but by the constructive
interference of diffracted waves (beams generated by the apertures) at the

problem in optics, follow naturally from the interference properties of our
model. The new point is the prediction of the Wood anomaly in a classical
Young-type two-source system. The new mechanism could be interpreted as a
non-quantum analog of the superradiance emission of a subwavelength ensemble of

near-infrared, and X-ray counterpart Sagittarius A* (SgrA*). The goal is the
investigation and understanding of the physical processes responsible for the
variable emission from SgrA*. The observations have been carried out using the
NACO adaptive optics (AO) instrument at the European Southern Observatory's
Very Large Telescope (July 2005, May 2007) and the ACIS-I instrument aboard the
Chandra X-ray Observatory (July 2005). We find that for the July 2005 flare the
variable and polarized NIR emission of SgrA* occurred synchronous with a
moderately bright flare event in the X-ray domain with an excess 2 - 8 keV
luminosity of about 8x10^33erg/s. We find no time lag between the flare events
in the two wavelength bands with a lower limit of less than 10 minutes. The May
2007 flare shows the highest sub-flare to flare contrast observed until now. It
provides evidence for a variation in the profile of consecutive sub-flares. We
confirm that highly variable and NIR polarized flare emission is non-thermal
and that there exists a class of synchronous NIR/X-ray flares. We find that the
flaring state can be explained via the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) process
involving up-scattered sub-millimeter photons from a compact source component.
The observations can be interpreted in a model involving a temporary disk with
a short jet. In the disk component the flux density variations can be explained
due to spots on relativistic orbits around the central super massive black hole
(SMBH). The profile variations for the May 2007 flare are interpreted as a
variation of the spot structure due to differential rotation within the disk.

to reproduce the irregular Stokes profiles in the penumbra. I studied the
averaged and individual properties of the two components. By integrating the
field inclination to the surface, I developed a 3-D model of the spot from
inversion results without intrinsic height information. I find that the
Evershed flow is harbored by the weaker of the two field components. This
component forms flow channels that show upstreams in the inner and mid
penumbra, continue horizontally as slightly elevated loops throughout the
penumbra, and finally bend down in the outer penumbra. I find several examples,
where two or more flow channels are found along a radial cut from the umbra to
the outer boundary of the spot. I find that a model of horizontal flow channels
in a static background field is in good agreement with the observed spectra.
The properties of the flow channels correspond very well to the simulations of
Schlichenmaier et al. (1998). From the temporal evolution in intensity images
and the properties of the flow channels in the inversion, I conclude that
interchange convection of rising hot flux tubes in a thick penumbra still seems
a possible mechanism for maintaining the penumbral energy balance.

additional matter sectors with different conformal factors are added, the late

reduced expansion rate in the past can be driven. For suitable choices of the

reside entirely in the lowest two-dimensional Landau level (LLL). For small
enough filling factor of the LLL, one may have formation of fractional quantum
Hall states. We investigate the case of bosons with dipolar interactions as may
be realized with Chromium-52 atoms. We show that at filling factor equal to
unity the ground state is a Moore-Read (a.k.a Pfaffian) paired state as is the
case of bosons with purely s-wave scattering interactions. This Pfaffian state
is destabilized when the interaction in the s-wave channel is small enough and
the ground state is a stripe phase with unidimensional density modulation. For
filling factor 1/3, we show that there is formation of a Fermi sea of
``composite fermions''. These composites are made of one boson bound with three
vortices. This phase has a wide range of stability and the effective mass of
the fermions depends essentially only of the scattering amplitude in momentum
channels larger or equal to 2. The formation of such a Fermi sea opens up a new
possible route to detection of the quantum Hall correlations.

multicellular flows in the solar convection zone, we seek to characterise the
influence of various profiles of circulation on the behaviour of solar
mean-field dynamo models. We are using 2-D mean field flux transport
Babcock-Leighton numerical models in which we test several types of meridional
flows: 1 large single cell, 2 cells in radius and 4 cells per hemisphere. We
confirm that adding cells in latitude tends to speed up the dynamo cycle
whereas adding cells in radius more than triples the period. We find that the
cycle period in the four cells model is less sensitive to the flow speed than
in the other simpler meridional circulation profiles studied. Moreover, our
studies show that adding cells in radius or in latitude seems to favour the
parity switching to a quadrupolar solution. According to our numerical models,
the observed 22-yr cycle and dipolar parity is easily reproduced by models
including multicellular meridional flows. On the contrary, the resulting
butterfly diagram and phase relationship between the toroidal and poloidal
fields are affected to a point where it is unlikely that such multicellular
meridional flows persist for a long period of time inside the Sun, without
having to reconsider the model itself.

summing to $E$. The \textit{density} $d$ of an SSP instance is defined by the
ratio of $n$ to $m$, where $m$ is the logarithm of the largest integer within
$A$. Based on the structural and statistical properties of subset sums, we
present an improved enumeration scheme for SSP, and implement it as a complete
and exact algorithm (EnumPlus). The algorithm always equivalently reduces an
instance to be low-density, and then solve it by enumeration. Through this
approach, we show the possibility to design a sole algorithm that can
efficiently solve arbitrary density instance in a uniform way. Furthermore, our
algorithm has considerable performance advantage over previous algorithms.
Firstly, it extends the density scope, in which SSP can be solved in expected
polynomial time. Specifically, It solves SSP in expected $O(n\log{n})$ time
when density $d \geq c\cdot \sqrt{n}/\log{n}$, while the previously best
density scope is $d \geq c\cdot n/(\log{n})^{2}$. In addition, the overall
expected time and space requirement in the average case are proven to be
$O(n^5\log n)$ and $O(n^5)$ respectively. Secondly, in the worst case, it
slightly improves the previously best time complexity of exact algorithms for
SSP. Specifically, the worst-case time complexity of our algorithm is proved to
be $O((n-6)2^{n/2}+n)$, while the previously best result is $O(n2^{n/2})$.

(1996)]. Whereas the sign of absorption at low and zero frequencies is
sensitive to the ac fields, the gain profile in the vicinity of gain maximum is
robust. We suggest to use this ac-induced effect in a starter for THz Bloch
oscillator. Our analysis demonstrates that the application of a short THz pulse
to a superlattice allows to suppress the undesirable formation of electric
domains and reach a sustained large-amplitude operation of the dc-biased Bloch
scillator.

  Astrophysical Journal (Letters)","Astrophys.J.673:L163-L166, 2008","10.1086/528796",,"astro-ph",,"  RX J1856.5-3754 is the X-ray brightest among the nearby isolated neutron
stars. Its X-ray spectrum is thermal, and is reproduced remarkably well by a
black-body, but its interpretation has remained puzzling. One reason is that
the source did not exhibit pulsations, and hence a magnetic field
strength--vital input to atmosphere models--could not be estimated. Recently,
however, very weak pulsations were discovered. Here, we analyze these in
detail, using all available data from the XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray
observatories. From frequency measurements, we set a 2-sigma upper limit to the
frequency derivative of \dot\nu<1.3e-14 Hz/s. Trying possible phase-connected
timing solutions, we find that one solution is far more likely than the others,
and we infer a most probable value of \dot\nu=(-5.98+/-0.14)e-16 Hz/s. The
inferred magnetic field strength is 1.5e13 G, comparable to what was found for
similar neutron stars. From models, the field seems too strong to be consistent
with the absence of spectral features for non-condensed atmospheres. It is
sufficiently strong, however, that the surface could be condensed, but only if
it is consists of heavy elements like iron. Our measurements imply a
characteristic age of about 4 Myr. This is longer than the cooling and
kinematic ages, as was found for similar objects, but at almost a factor ten,
the discrepancy is more extreme. A puzzle raised by our measurement is that the
implied rotational energy loss rate of about 3e30 erg/s is orders of magnitude
smaller than what was inferred from the H-alpha nebula surrounding the source.

Kolmogorov type for the numerical solution. We then understand that the error

around the characteristics of the flow. We show, in various situations, that
the fluctuations are of diffusive type. As a by-product, we prove that the
scheme is of order 1/2 for an initial datum in BV and of order 1/2-a, for all
a>0, for a Lipschitz continuous initial datum. Our analysis provides a new
interpretation of the numerical diffusion phenomenon.
