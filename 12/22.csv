achievable rates for a mixed strategy used in a four-terminal network with

show that the cutoff enters the gluon production cross section in the argument

effects are negligible, through a finite size technique. The latter consists of
steps extrapolated to the continuum limit, where the b-region is reached
through interpolations guided by the effective theory.
  With the lattice spacing given in terms of the Sommer's scale r0 and the
experimental Bs and K masses, we get the final results for the renormalization
group invariant mass Mb = 6.88(10) GeV, translating into mb(mb) = 4.42(6) GeV

a non-perturbative computation involving a large range of renormalization
scales and no valence quarks.
  The two-loop expression of the corresponding anomalous dimension in the

confirmed by non-perturbative quenched computations to be negligible for the

that these modules with iterative connection (and also the modules with
integrable iterative connection) form a Tannakian category, assuming some nice
properties for the underlying ring, and we show how this generalises to modules
over schemes. We also relate these notions to stratifications on modules, as
introduced by A. Grothendieck in order to extend integrable (ordinary)
connections to finite characteristic. Over smooth rings, we obtain an
equivalence of stratifications and integrable iterative connections.
Furthermore, over a regular ring in positive characteristic, we show that the
category of modules with integrable iterative connection is also equivalent to
the category of flat bundles as defined by D. Gieseker. In the second part of
this article, we set up a Picard-Vessiot theory for fields of solutions. For
such a Picard-Vessiot extension, we obtain a Galois correspondence, which takes
into account even nonreduced closed subgroup schemes of the Galois group scheme
on one hand and inseparable intermediate extensions of the Picard-Vessiot
extension on the other hand. Finally, we compare our Galois theory with the
Galois theory for purely inseparable field extensions.

of high-energy cosmic rays by detecting the secondary particle flux of the
Extensive Air Showers (EAS) induced by the primary cosmic rays. Electromagnetic
particles and muons constitute the dominant contribution to the ground detector
signals. In this paper, we show that the ground signal deposit of an EAS can be
described in terms of only very few parameters: the primary energy E, the
zenith angle theta, the distance of the shower maximum X_max to the ground, and
a muon flux normalization N_mu. This set of physical parameters is sufficient
to predict the average particle fluxes at ground level to around 10% accuracy.
We show that this is valid for hadronic air showers, using the two standard
hadronic interaction models used in cosmic ray physics, QGSJetII and Sibyll,
and for primaries from protons to iron. Based on this model, a new approach to
calibrating the energy scale of ground array experiments is developed, which
factors out the model dependence inherent in such calibrations up to now.
Additionally, the method yields a measurement of the average number of muons in
EAS. The measured distribution of N_mu of cosmic ray air showers can then be
analysed, in conjunction with measurements of X_max from fluorescence
detectors, to put constraints on the cosmic ray composition and hadronic
interaction models.

emerges, for example, from effective higher-dimensional Kahler potential

contrast to previous studies we find that the necessary procedure of redefining
the fields in order to restore canonically normalised kinetic terms, i.e.
canonical normalisation, can lead to significant corrections to the fermion
mixing angles (as determined from the superpotential). Such potentially large
effects are characteristic of flavour models based on non-Abelian family
symmetries, where some of the possible Kahler potential (and superpotential)

mildly suppressed. We investigate under which conditions the messenger sector
of such flavour models generates such Kahler potential operators for which the
canonical normalisation effects are sizeable, and under which conditions these
operators may be absent and canonical normalisation effects are small. As
explicit examples for potentially relevant CN effects, we will discuss the
corrections to the CKM matrix element |V_{cb}| as well as corrections to

to be transmitted does not alter the passive characteristics of the channel

its capacity. To shed light into this matter, we show, among other results, how

scientific community for their potential in sub-wavelength optics, light
generation and non-destructive sensing. Given that they cannot be directly
excited by freely propagating light due to their intrinsical binding to the
metal surface, the light-plasmon coupling efficiency becomes of crucial
importance for the success of any plasmonic device. Here we present a
comprehensive study on the modulation (enhancement or suppression) of such
coupling efficiency by means of one-dimensional surface corrugation. Our
approach is based on simple wave interference and enables us to make
quantitative predictions which have been experimentally confirmed at both the
near infra-red and telecom ranges.

initial data can be constructed by simply placing a brane on a constant time
surface of Schwarzschild anti-de Sitter space. By this method, we unambiguously
confirm that initial data with an arbitrarily large AH area do exist. We
compare the ADM mass and the horizon area of our initial data with that of the
black string (BS) solution, and find that any initial data constructed by this
method do not have a smaller mass than the BS solution when the horizon area is
larger than the size determined by the bulk curvature scale. We further
investigate what kind of configuration realizes the minimum mass for the same
AH area. The configuration that realizes the smallest mass turns out to be the
one close to the BS truncated by a cap. We also demonstrate that the same
method applies to construct initial data in (3+1)-dimensional RS-II brane
world. In this case an exact solution of a brane-localized BH exists but BS
solution does not. Nevertheless, the behavior of the initial data is quite
similar in both cases. We find that the known exact solution always has a
smaller mass than our initial data with the same horizon area. This result
enforces the standard belief that the exact BH solution is the most stable
black object in the four-dimensional RS-II model. These results are all
consistent with the classical BH evaporation conjecture, but unfortunately it
turns out that they do not provide a strong support of it.

formation. In contrast to most other merger-tree algorithms, ours takes
discrete steps in mass rather than time. This allows us to quantify effects
which arise from the fact that outputs from numerical simulations are usually
in discrete time bins. In addition, it suggests a natural set of scaling
variables for describing the abundance of halo progenitors; this scaling is not
as general as that associated with a spherical collapse. We test our algorithm
by comparing its predictions with measurements in numerical simulations. The
progenitor mass fractions and mass functions are in good agreement, as is the
predicted scaling law. We also test the formation-redshift distribution, the
mass distribution at formation, and the redshift distribution of the most
recent major merger; all are in reasonable agreement with N-body simulation
data, over a broad range of masses and redshifts. Finally, we study the effects
of sampling in discrete time snapshots. In all cases, the improvement over
algorithms based on the spherical collapse assumption is significant.

The CIRs are caused by irregularities on the stellar surface that change the

these irregularities by circular symmetric spots on the stellar surface. We use
the Zeus3D code to model the stellar wind and the CIRs, limited to the
equatorial plane. We constrain the properties of large-scale wind structures

unequal brightness and size on opposite sides of the equator, with opening
angles of 20 +/- 5 degr and 30 +/- 5 degr diameter, and that are 20 +/- 5 % and
8 +/- 5 % brighter than the stellar surface, respectively, provides the best
fit to the observed DACs. The recurrence time of the DACs compared to the
estimated rotational period corresponds to spot velocities that are 5 times
slower than the rotational velocity. The mass-loss rate of the structured wind
model for HD 64760 does not exceed the rate of the spherically symmetric smooth
wind model by more than 1 %. The fact that DACs are observed in a large number

of strong coupling, a semitransparent boundary becomes a Dirichlet one.) After
applying the method to rederive the Casimir force between two semitransparent
plates and the Casimir self-stress on a semitransparent sphere, we obtain
expressions for the Casimir energies between disjoint parallel semitransparent

for weak and strong coupling. In particular, after performing a power series
expansion in the ratio of the radii of the objects to the separation between

explicit closed forms for the Casimir interaction energy. The same can be done
for the interaction of a weak-coupling sphere or cylinder with a Dirichlet

arbitrary field K that satisfy condition R_l of Serre. Our characterization is
in terms of the face lattice of the positive cone pos(S) of S. We start by
reviewing some basic facts about the faces of pos(S) and consequences for the
monomial primes of K[S]. After proving our characterization we turn our
attention to the Rees algebras of a special class of monomial ideals in a
polynomial ring over a field. In this special case, some of the characterizing
criteria are always satisfied. We give examples of nonnormal affine semigroup

suggest that the transition will be taken to occur when the ratio of the

maximum value. Time average values are used for the different quantities, as
the criterion does not refer to the short time-scale variations occurring on
the AGB and post-AGB, e.g., thermal pulses (helium shell flashes) and magnetic
activity. Along the entire AGB the value of Q increases, even when the star
starts to contract. Only when a rapid contraction starts does the value of Q
start to decrease. This criterion captures the essence of the transition from
the AGB to the post AGB phase, because Q is connected to the stellar effective
temperature, reaching its maximum value at T~4000-6000 K, it is related to the
mass loss properties, and it reaches its maximum value when rapid contraction
starts and envelope mass is very low.

generalize this latter construction and present ground state wave functions for
all quantum Hall hierarchy states that are obtained by successive condensation
of quasielectrons (as opposed to quasiholes) in the original hierarchy

they approach the exact ground states, the Tao-Thouless states, when the

consisting of a free electron and one mode of the quantized radiation field are
used for studying the physical meaning of a class of number-phase minimum
uncertainty states. The states of the mode which minimize the uncertainty
product of the photon number and the Susskind and Glogower (1964) cosine
operator have been obtained by Jackiw (1968). However, these states have so far
been remained mere mathematical constructions without any physical
significance. It is proved that the most fundamental interaction in quantum
electrodynamics - namely the interaction of a free electron with a mode of the
quantized radiation field - leads quite naturally to the generation of the
mentioned minimum uncertainty states. It is shown that from the entangled
photon-electron states developing from a highly excited number state, due to
the interaction with a Gaussian electronic wave packet, the minimum uncertainty
states of Jackiw's type can be constructed. In the electron's coordinate
representation the physical meaning of the expansion coefficients of these
states are the joint probability amplitudes of simultaneous detection of an
electron and of a definite number of photons. The joint occupation
probabilities in these states preserve their functional form as time elapses,
but they vary from point to point in space-time, depending on the location of
the detected electron. An analysis of the entanglement entropies derived from
the photon number distribution and from the electron's density operator is
given.

  For historical reasons, integers such as 6 or 5 that are (the squarefree part
of) the area of some Pythagorean triangle are called `\emph{congruent
numbers}'. These numbers actually are interesting for the following reason:
Notice the sequence $\frac14$, $6\frac14$, $12\frac14$. It is an arithmetic
progression with common difference 6, consisting of squares $(\frac12)^2$,
$(\frac52)^2$, $(\frac72)^2$ of rational numbers. Indeed the common difference
of three rational squares in AP is a congruent number and every congruent
number is the common difference of three rational squares in arithmetic
progression.
  The triangle given by $9^{2}+40^{2}=41^{2}$ has area $180=5\cdot6^{2}$ and
the numbers $x-5$, $x$ and $x+5$ all are rational squares if $x=11{97/144}$.
Recall one obtains all Pythagorean triangles with relatively prime integer
sides by taking $x=4uv$, $y=\pm(4u^{2}-v^{2})$, $z=4u^{2}+v^{2}$ where $u$ and

different twist are carried out in a computational domain spanning the upper

Code to solve the full MHD equations with non-grey and non-LTE radiative
transfer and thermal conduction along the magnetic field lines. The emergence
of the magnetic flux tube input at the bottom boundary into a weakly magnetized
atmosphere is presented. The photospheric and chromospheric response is
described with magnetograms, synthetic images and velocity field distributions.
The emergence of a magnetic flux tube into such an atmosphere results in varied
atmospheric responses. In the photosphere the granular size increases when the
flux tube approaches from below. In the convective overshoot region some 200km
above the photosphere adiabatic expansion produces cooling, darker regions with
the structure of granulation cells. We also find collapsed granulation in the
boundaries of the rising flux tube. Once the flux tube has crossed the
photosphere, bright points related with concentrated magnetic field, vorticity,
high vertical velocities and heating by compressed material are found at
heights up to 500km above the photosphere. At greater heights in the magnetized
chromosphere, the rising flux tube produces a cool, magnetized bubble that
tends to expel the usual chromospheric oscillations. In addition the rising
flux tube dramatically increases the chromospheric scale height, pushing the
transition region and corona aside such that the chromosphere extends up to 6Mm
above the photosphere. The emergence of magnetic flux tubes through the
photosphere to the lower corona is a relatively slow process, taking of order 1
hour.

stacks. This machinery allows us to treat on an equal footing free loops in
stacks and hidden loops. In particular, we give a good notion of a free loop
stack, and of a mapping stack $\map(Y,\XX)$, where $Y$ is a compact space and
$\XX$ a topological stack, which is functorial both in $\XX$ and $Y$ and
behaves well enough with respect to pushouts. We also construct a bivariant (in
the sense of Fulton and MacPherson) theory for topological stacks: it gives us
a flexible theory of Gysin maps which are automatically compatible with
pullback, pushforward and products. Further we prove an excess formula in this
context. We introduce oriented stacks, generalizing oriented manifolds, which
are stacks on which we can do string topology. We prove that the homology of
the free loop stack of an oriented stack and the homology of hidden loops
(sometimes called ghost loops) are a Frobenius algebra which are related by a
natural morphism of Frobenius algebras. We also prove that the homology of free
loop stack has a natural structure of a BV-algebra, which together with the
Frobenius structure fits into an homological conformal field theories with
closed positive boundaries. Using our general machinery, we construct an
intersection pairing for (non necessarily compact) almost complex orbifolds
which is in the same relation to the intersection pairing for manifolds as
Chen-Ruan orbifold cup-product is to ordinary cup-product of manifolds. We show
that the hidden loop product of almost complex is isomorphic to the orbifold
intersection pairing twisted by a canonical class. Finally we gave some
examples including the case of the classifying stacks $[*/G]$ of a compact Lie

algorithms for the maximum flow problem can be modified to obtain algorithms
for the BNFP with the property that these variations and the corresponding
