electron pressure in groups and clusters of galaxies. In the near future SZ
surveys will map hundreds of systems, shedding light on the pressure
distribution in the systems. The thermal energy is related to the total mass of
a system of galaxies, but it is only a projection that is observed through the
SZ effect. A model for the 3D distribution of pressure is needed to link the SZ
signal to the total mass of the system. In this work we construct an empirical
model for the 2D and 3D SZ profile, and compare it to a set of realistic high
resolution SPH simulations of galaxy clusters and groups, and to a stacked SZ
profile for massive clusters derived from WMAP data. Furthermore, we combine
observed temperature profiles with dark matter potentials to yield an
additional constraint, under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. We find
a very tight correlation between the characteristic scale in the model, the
integrated SZ signal, and the total mass in the systems with a scatter of only
4%. The model only contains two free parameters, making it readily applicable
even to low resolution SZ observations of galaxy clusters. A fitting routine

naturalness problem. In addition to the well-known case of the cosmological
constant, we argue that nuclear stability and electroweak symmetry breaking
(EWSB) represent significant observer naturalness problems. The naturalness
probability associated with nuclear stability is conservatively estimated as
P_nuc < 10^{-(3-2)}, and for simple EWSB theories P_EWSB < 10^{-(2-1)}. This
pattern of unnaturalness in three different arenas, cosmology, nuclear physics,
and EWSB, provides evidence for the multiverse. In the nuclear case the problem
is largely solved even with a flat multiverse distribution, and with nontrivial
distributions it is possible to understand both the proximity to neutron
stability and the values of m_e and m_d - m_u in terms of the electromagnetic
contribution to the proton mass. It is reasonable that multiverse distributions
are strong functions of Lagrangian parameters due to their dependence on
various factors. In any EWSB theory, strongly varying distributions typically
lead to a little or large hierarchy, and in certain multiverses the size of the
little hierarchy is enhanced by a loop factor. Since the correct theory of EWSB
is unknown, our estimate for P_EWSB is theoretical. The LHC will determine
P_EWSB more robustly, which may remove or strengthen the observer naturalness
problem of EWSB. For each of the three arenas, the discovery of a natural
theory would eliminate the evidence for the multiverse; but in the absence of
such a theory, the multiverse provides a provisional understanding of the data.

inflationary cosmology in the framework where inflation is described by a
universally evolving scalar field, with the Lagrangian ${\cal

that inflaton attains a nearly constant velocity, during inflation, $m_P^{-1}
(d\phi/dN)\equiv \alpha$ (where $N\equiv \ln a$ is the e-folding time), we find
the conditions that have to satisfied by the (reconstructed) scalar potential
to be consistent with the WMAP inflationary data. In the second part of this
paper, we introduce a novel approach of constructing dark energy within the
context of the standard scalar-tensor gravity. The assumption that a scalar
field might roll with a nearly constant velocity, during inflation, can also be
applied to {\it quintessence} or dark energy models. For the minimally coupled
quintessence, $\alpha_Q\equiv dA(Q)/d(\kappa Q)=0$ (where $A(Q)$ is the
standard matter-quintessence coupling), the dark energy equation of state in
the range $-1\le w_{DE} < -0.82$ can be obtained for $0\le \alpha < 0.63$. For
$\alpha<0.1$, the model allows for only modest evolution of dark energy density
with redshift. The effect of the matter-quintessence coupling can be
significant only if $|\alpha_Q| \gtrsim 0.1$, while a small coupling
$|\alpha_Q|< 0.1$ will have almost no effect on cosmological parameters. The
best fit value of $\alpha_Q$ in our model is found to be $\alpha_Q \simeq
0.06$, but it may contain significant numerical errors, viz $\alpha_Q=0.06\pm
0.35$, which thereby implies the consistency of our model with general
relativity (for which $\alpha_Q=0$) at $1\sigma$ level.

attention in the astrophysics and laboratory. In the case of solar flares the
problem of reliable beam detection and diagnostics is of exceptional
importance. This paper explores the fact that the electron beams moving oblique
to the magnetic field or along the field with some angular scatter around the
beam propagation direction can generate microwave continuum bursts via
gyrosynchrotron mechanism. The characteristics of the microwave bursts produced
by beams differ from those in case of isotropic or loss-cone distributions,
which suggests a new tool for quantitative diagnostics of the beams in the
solar corona. To demonstrate the potentiality of this tool, we analyze here a
radio burst occurred during an impulsive flare 1B/M6.7 on 10 March 2001 (AR
9368, N27W42). Based on detailed analysis of the spectral, temporal, and
spatial relationships, we obtained firm evidence that the microwave continuum
burst is produced by electron beams. For the first time we developed and
applied a new forward fitting algorithm based on exact gyrosynchrotron formulae
and employing both the total power and polarization measurements to solve the
inverse problem of the beam diagnostics. We found that the burst is generated
by a oblique beam in a region of reasonably strong magnetic field ($\sim
200-300$ G) and the burst is observed at a quasi-transverse viewing angle. We
found that the life time of the emitting electrons in the radio source is
relatively short, $\tau_l \approx 0.5$ s, consistent with a single reflection
of the electrons from a magnetic mirror at the foot point with the stronger
magnetic field. We discuss the implications of these findings for the electron
acceleration in flares and for beam diagnostics.

general attention recently, and has been considered a promising methodology to

conventional design with separate channel estimation and error protection
modules under the same code rate. Nevertheless, the major obstacle that
prevents from the practice of the codes is that the existing codes are mostly
searched by computers, and hence exhibit no good structure for efficient
decoding. Hence, the time-consuming exhaustive search becomes the only decoding
choice, and the decoding complexity increases dramatically with the codeword
length. In this paper, by optimizing the signal-tonoise ratio, we found a
systematic construction for the codes for combined channel estimation and error
protection, and confirmed its equivalence in performance to the
computer-searched codes by simulations. Moreover, the structural codes that we
construct by rules can now be maximum-likelihoodly decodable in terms of a
newly derived recursive metric for use of the priority-first search decoding
algorithm. Thus,the decoding complexity reduces significantly when compared
with that of the exhaustive decoder. The extension code design for fast-fading

oscillation in the critical temperature of a large-radius, thin-walled

the binding of electrons into Cooper pairs. On the other hand, the
single-electron Aharonov-Bohm oscillation in the resistance or persistent
current for a clean (i.e. ballistic) normal-state system having the same
topological structure has a period given by $h/e$. A basic question is whether
the Little-Parks oscillation changes its character, as the radius of the
superconducting structure becomes smaller, and even comparable to the
zero-temperature coherence length. We supplement the argument that the $h/e$
oscillations should also be exhibited via a microscopic analysis of this
regime, formulated in terms of the Gor'kov approach of BCS theory. We see that
as the radius of the ring becomes smaller, an oscillation of critical
temperature in the period of $h/e$ emerges in addition to the usual
Little-Parks dependence. We argue that in the clean limit there is a
superconductor-normal transition, at nonzero flux, as the ring radius becomes
sufficiently small, and that the transition can be either continuous or
discontinuous, depending on the radius and the external flux. In the dirty
limit, we argue that the transition is rendered continuous, which results in
continuous quantum phase transitions tuned by flux and radius.

seen at optical wavelengths, at precisely known positions. There is an unknown
time delay between the optical and gravitational transient, but knowing the
source location precisely specifies the corresponding time delays across the
gravitational antenna network as a function of the GW-to-optical arrival time
difference. Optical searches should detect virtually all supernovae that are
plausible gravitational radiation sources. The transient optical signature
expected from merging compact objects is not as well understood, but there are
good reasons to expect detectable transient optical/IR emission from most of
these sources as well. The next generation of deep wide-field surveys (for
example PanSTARRS and LSST) will be sensitive to subtle optical variability,
but we need to fill the ``blind spots'' that exist in the Galactic plane, and
for optically bright transient sources. In particular, a Galactic plane
variability survey at 2 microns seems worthwhile. Science would benefit from
closer coordination between the various optical survey projects and the gravity

important clues to the nature of GRB progenitors and crucial for dereddening,
is still poorly known. Here we propose a straightforward method to determine
the extinction of GRB host galaxies by comparing the observed optical spectra
to the intrinsic ones extrapolated from the X-ray spectra. The rationale for
this method is from the standard fireball model: if the optical flux decay
index equals to that of the X-ray flux, then there is no break frequency
between the optical and X-ray bands, therefore we can derive the intrinsic
optical flux from the X-ray spectra. We apply this method to three GRBs of
which the optical and X-ray fluxes have the same decay indices and another one
with inferred cooling break frequency, and obtain the rest-frame extinction
curves of their host galaxies. The derived extinction curves are gray and do
not resemble any extinction curves of local galaxies (e.g. the Milk Way, the
Small/Large Magellanic Clouds, or nearby starburst galaxies). The amount of
extinction is rather large (with visual extinction $A_V$ $\sim$
1.6--3.4$\magni$). We model the derived extinction curves in terms of the
silicate-graphite interstellar grain model. As expected from the ``gray''
nature of the derived extinction curve, the dust size distribution is skewed to
large grains. We determine, for the first time, the local dust-to-gas ratios of
GRB host galaxies using the model-derived dust parameters and the hydrogen
column densities determined from X-ray absorptions.

that each item i \in V has the production cost d_i and each customer e_j \in E
has the valuation v_j on the bundle e_j \subseteq V of items. When the store
sells an item i \in V at the price r_i, the profit for the item i is
p_i=r_i-d_i. The goal of the store is to decide the price of each item to

so, especially in two and three dimensions. Recently, significant improvements
were made in higher dimensions, leading to new methods to reconstruct large
classes of compact subsets of Euclidean space $\R^d$. However, the complexities

medium or high dimensions, even for handling low-dimensional submanifolds. In
this paper, we introduce a novel approach that stands in-between classical
reconstruction and topological estimation, and whose complexity scales up with
the intrinsic dimension of the data. Specifically, when the data points are
sufficiently densely sampled from a smooth $m$-submanifold of $\R^d$, our
method retrieves the homology of the submanifold in time at most $c(m)n^5$,
where $n$ is the size of the input and $c(m)$ is a constant depending solely on
$m$. It can also provably well handle a wide range of compact subsets of

  version",,,,"math-ph math.MP",,"  Demonstrating the completeness of wave functions solutions of the radial
Schrodinger equation is a very difficult task. Existing proofs, relying on
operator theory, are often very abstract and far from intuitive comprehension.
However, it is possible to obtain rigorous proofs amenable to physical insight,
if one restricts the considered class of Schrodinger potentials. One can
mention in particular unbounded potentials yielding a purely discrete spectrum
and short-range potentials. However, those possessing a Coulomb tail, very
important for physical applications, have remained problematic due to their
long-range character. The method proposed in this paper allows to treat them
correctly, provided the non-Coulomb part of potentials vanishes after a finite
radius. Non-locality of potentials can also be handled. The main idea in the
proposed demonstration is that regular solutions behave like sine/cosine
functions for large momenta, so that their expansions verify Fourier transform
properties. The highly singular point at k = 0 of long-range potentials is
dealt with properly using analytical properties of Coulomb wave functions.
Lebesgue measure theory is avoided, rendering the demonstration clear from a
physical point of view.

weakly coupled systems. Estimations of the extinction times and survival
chances are also given. We show that before the extinction the fraction of
highly-connected species (""omnivores"") is increasing. Viable food webs exhibit
a pyramidal structure, where the density of occupied niches is higher at lower
trophic levels, and moreover the occupations of adjacent levels are closely
correlated. We also demonstrate that the distribution of the lengths of food
chains has an exponential character and changes weakly with the parameters of
the model. On the contrary, the distribution of avalanche sizes of the extinct
species depends strongly on the connectedness of the web. For rather loosely

decomposing the variation in the data into predetermined and interpretable

account the curvature of the space of variation. We discuss, in the general
case, consistency of our estimates of variation, using mathematical tools from
differential geometry and shape statistics. We successfully applied our method

Sun. This process seems to take vertical magnetic fields from the solar
interior to the photosphere, where they appear above granular convection cells.
High-cadence time series of spectropolarimetric measurements obtained by Hinode
in a quiet region near disk center are analyzed. We extract line parameters
from the observed Stokes profiles and study their evolution with time. The
circular polarization maps derived from the observed \ion{Fe}{i} 630 nm lines
show clear magnetic signals emerging at the center of granular cells. We do not
find any evidence for linear polarization signals associated with these events.
The magnetic flux patches grow with time, occupying a significant fraction of
the granular area. The signals then fade until they disappear completely. The
typical lifetime of these events is of the order of 20 minutes. No significant
changes in the chromosphere seem to occur in response to the emergence, as
revealed by co-spatial \ion{Ca}{ii} H filtergrams. The Stokes I and V profiles
measured in the emerging flux concentrations show strong asymmetries and
Doppler shifts. The origin of these events is unclear at present, but we

of $\pi/(3\sqrt{2}) \sim 0.7405$. Much more recently, an unusually high density
packing of approximately 0.770732 was achieved for congruent ellipsoids. Such

packing fraction of $\pi/4$. For truncated cones, there are two distinct
regimes, characterized by different packing arrangements, depending on the

  Complexity and System Science",,,,"physics.soc-ph cond-mat.stat-mech physics.comp-ph",,"  Graph vertices are often organized into groups that seem to live fairly
independently of the rest of the graph, with which they share but a few edges,
whereas the relationships between group members are stronger, as shown by the
large number of mutual connections. Such groups of vertices, or communities,
can be considered as independent compartments of a graph. Detecting communities
is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines
where systems are often represented as graphs. The task is very hard, though,
both conceptually, due to the ambiguity in the definition of community and in
the discrimination of different partitions and practically, because algorithms
must find ``good'' partitions among an exponentially large number of them.
Other complications are represented by the possible occurrence of hierarchies,
i.e. communities which are nested inside larger communities, and by the
existence of overlaps between communities, due to the presence of nodes
belonging to more groups. All these aspects are dealt with in some detail and
many methods are described, from traditional approaches used in computer
science and sociology to recent techniques developed mostly within statistical
physics.

  relaminarisation and localised `edge' states","21 pages, 9 figures; as accepted, J. Fluid Mech",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fully 3-dimensional computations of flow through a long pipe demand a huge
number of degrees of freedom, making it very expensive to explore parameter
space and difficult to isolate the structure of the underlying dynamics. We
therefore introduce a `2+epsilon' dimensional model of pipe flow which is a
minimal 3-dimensionalisation of the axisymmetric case: only sinusoidal
variation in azimuth plus azimuthal shifts are retained, yet the same dynamics
familiar from experiments are found. In particular the model retains the
subcritical dynamics of fully resolved pipe flow, capturing realistic localised
`puff'-like structures which can decay abruptly after long times, as well as
global `slug' turbulence. Relaminarisation statistics of puffs reproduce the
memoryless feature of pipe flow and indicate the existence of a Reynolds number
about which lifetimes diverge rapidly, provided that the pipe is sufficiently
long. Exponential divergence of the lifetime is prevalent in shorter periodic
domains. In a short pipe, exact travelling-wave solutions are found nearby to
flow trajectories on the boundary between laminar and turbulent flow. In a long
pipe, the attracting state on the laminar-turbulent boundary is a localised
structure which resembles a smoothened puff. This `edge' state remains
localised even for Reynolds numbers where the turbulent state is global.

two-dimensional (2D) anyon gas in the quantum limit of a perpendicular magnetic
field (Landau level filling factor \nu_L\le 1). These formulas, for the cases
without and with Coulomb interaction, are obtained by applying the harmonic
potential regularization for vanishing confinement to the harmonically confined
Coulomb anyon gas as in our previous paper for the case without magnetic field.
For the case without Coulomb interaction our analytic expression is exact. It
contains a contribution deriving from the anyon gauge field (characterizing the
fractional statistics by the anyon parameter \nu) and depends on \nu and \nu_L.
For the case with Coulomb interaction we introduce a function, depending on
\nu, \nu_L and the density parameter r_s, which is determined by fitting to the
interpolation formula of Fano and Ortolani in the fractional quantum Hall
regime for spin-polarized fermions in conjunction with results of Yoshioka for
the ground state energy of the 2D Coulomb boson gas in high magnetic fields.
With their dependence on \nu, our formulas apply not only to fermions (\nu=1)
but quite generally to anyons (0\le \nu\le 1).

network model recently introduced in
\citep{koenig07:_effic_stabil_dynam_innov_networ}. In the model, the set of
efficient graphs ranges, depending on the cost for maintaining a link, from the
complete graph to the (quasi-) star, varying within a well defined class of
graphs. However, the interplay between dynamics on the nodes and topology of
the network leads to equilibrium networks which are typically not efficient and
are characterized, as observed in empirical studies of R&D networks, by
sparseness, presence of clusters and heterogeneity of degree. In this paper, we
analyze the relation between the growth rate of the knowledge stock of the
agents from R&D collaborations and the properties of the adjacency matrix
associated with the network of collaborations. By means of computer simulations
we further investigate how the equilibrium network is affected by increasing
the evaluation time $\tau$ over which agents evaluate whether to maintain a
link or not. We show that only if $\tau$ is long enough, efficient networks can
be obtained by the selfish link formation process of agents, otherwise the
equilibrium network is inefficient. This work should assist in building a
theoretical framework of R&D networks from which policies can be derived that
aim at fostering efficient innovation networks.
