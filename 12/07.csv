$\Bbb{C}$. Our main result is that an irreducible algebraic variety $Y$ (may be
singular) of dimension $d$ ($d\geq 1$) defined over $\Bbb{C}$ is an affine
variety if and only if $Y$ contains no complete curves, $H^i(Y,
{\mathcal{O}}_Y)=0$ for all $i>0$ and the boundary $X-Y$ is support of a big
divisor, where $X$ is a projective variety containing $Y$. We construct three
examples to show that a variety is not affine if it only satisfies two
conditions among these three conditions. We also give examples to demonstrate
the difference between the behavior of the boundary divisor $D$ and the
affineness of $Y$. If $Y$ is an affine variety, then the ring $\Gamma (Y,
{\mathcal{O}}_Y)$ is noetherian. However, to prove that $Y$ is an affine
variety, we do not start from this ring. We explain why we do not need to check
the noetherian property of the ring $\Gamma (Y, {\mathcal{O}}_Y)$ directly but
use the techniques of sheaf and cohomology.

It is derived from ~1500 square degress worth of imaging data, which represents
80 percent of the final IPHAS survey area. The electronic version of the
catalogue will be updated once the full survey data becomes available. In
total, the present catalogue contains 4853 point sources that exhibit strong
photometric evidence for Halpha emission. We have so far analyzed spectra for
~300 of these sources, confirming more than 95 percent of them as genuine
emission-line stars. A wide range of stellar populations are represented in the
catalogue, including early-type emission line stars, active late-type stars,
interacting binaries, young stellar objects and compact nebulae.
  The spatial distribution of catalogue objects shows overdensities near sites
of recent or current star formation, as well as possible evidence for the warp
of the Galactic plane. Photometrically, the incidence of Halpha emission is
bimodally distributed in r'-i'. The blue peak is made up mostly of early-type
emission line stars, whereas the red peak may signal an increasing contribution
from other objects, such as young/active low-mass stars. We have cross-matched
our Halpha-excess catalogue against the emission-line star catalogue of
Kohoutek & Wehmeyer, as well as against sources in SIMBAD. We find that fewer
than 10 per cent of our sources can be matched to known objects of any type.

dependences of the conductivity $\sigma(T,n)$ around the Fermi temperature and
found that the corresponding $T \to 0$ extrapolation $\sigma_0(n)$ exhibits a

al., it is shown that this sharp bend is related to a peculiarity of
$\sigma(T=const.,n)$ clearly detectable in the whole $T$ range up to 4 K, the
highest measuring temperature in that work. Since this peculiarity seems not to
be smoothed out with increasing $T$ it may indicate a sharp continuous phase
transition between the regions of apparent metallic and activated conduction to
be present at finite temperature. Hints from the literature of such a behavior
are discussed. Finally, a scaling analysis illuminates similarities to previous

M(bulge) for these two NLS1s using CO channel map and CO line widths, we found
M(H2) amount to 0.13--0.35 of these masses. Taking account the star formation
efficiency (~ 0.1), the increase in M(bulge) in those NLS1s in the near future
(~< 10^{7.5} yr) is expected not to be a huge fraction (1--5% of the
preexisting stars). Bulge growth may have finished before BH growth, or
bulge--BH coevolution may proceed with many, occasional discrete events, where
one coevolution event produces only a small amount of mass growth of BHs and of
bulges. We also discuss the ratios of star-formation rate--to--gas accretion
rate onto BHs, finding that two NLS1s have very small ratios (~ 1) compared
with the M(bulge)/M(BH) ratios found in active and inactive galaxies (~ 700).
This huge difference suggests either the non-overlapped coevolution, long star

problems in approaches using standard statistical ensembles. As an example, we
analyze is the problem of boundary conditions, which in the framework of
information theory must also be treated statistically. We recall that out of
the thermodynamical limit the different ensembles are not equivalent and in
particular they may lead to dramatically different equation of states, in the
region of a first order phase transition. We recall the recent progresses
achieved in the understanding of first-order phase transition in finite

bimodalities in the intensive ensemble and the presence of inverted curvatures

the linearized modified field equations and find that axial and polar modes are
coupled, in contrast to general relativity. The divergence of the modified

Cunningham-Price-Moncrief master function associated with axial modes. We
analyze the structure of these equations and find that the appearance of the

are detected for the first time in the circumstellar envelope around an AGB

in the course of a 3 mm line survey carried out with the IRAM 30-m telescope.
The molecular column densities are derived by constructing rotational
temperature diagrams. A detailed chemical model of the circumstellar envelope
is used to analyze the formation of these molecular species. We have found
column densities in the range 5 x 10^(12)- 2 x 10^(13) cm^(-2), which
translates to abundances relative to H2 of several 10^(-9). The chemical model
is reasonably successful in explaining the derived abundances through gas phase
synthesis in the cold outer envelope. We also find that some of these

to excited vibrational states. The detection of these species stresses the
similarity between the molecular content of cold dark clouds and C-rich

for short gamma-ray bursts. Indeed such a merger can produce a black hole with
a transient accreting torus of nuclear matter (Lee & Ramirez-Ruiz 2007,
Oechslin & Janka 2006), and the conversion of a fraction of the torus
mass-energy to radiation can power a gamma-ray burst (Nakar 2006). Using
available binary pulsar observations supported by our extensive evolutionary
calculations of double neutron star formation, we demonstrate that the fraction
of mergers that can form a black hole -- torus system depends very sensitively
on the (largely unknown) maximum neutron star mass. We show that the available
observations and models put a very stringent constraint on this maximum mass
under the assumption that a black hole formation is required to produce a short
gamma-ray burst in a double neutron star merger. Specifically, we find that the
maximum neutron star mass must be within 2 - 2.5 Msun. Moreover, a single
unambiguous measurement of a neutron star mass above 2.5 Msun would exclude a
black hole -- torus central engine model of short gamma-ray bursts in double
neutron star mergers. Such an observation would also indicate that if in fact
short gamma-ray bursts are connected to neutron star mergers, the gamma-ray
burst engine is best explained by the lesser known model invoking a highly
magnetized massive neutron star (e.g., Usov 1992; Kluzniak & Ruderman 1998; Dai

signal in the inner Galaxy, and argue that it does not follow a free-free
spectrum as first thought, but instead is synchrotron emission from a hard
electron cosmic-ray population. 3. In a departure from previous work, we allow
the spectrum of Halpha-correlated emission (which is used to trace the
free-free component) to float in the fit, and find that it does not follow the
expected free-free spectrum. Instead there is a bump near 50 GHz, modifying the
spectrum at the 20% level, which we speculate is caused by spinning dust in the
warm ionized medium. 4. The derived cross-correlation spectra are not sensitive
to the map zero points, but are sensitive to the choice of CMB estimator. In
cases where the CMB estimator is derived by minimizing variance of a linear
combination of the WMAP bands, we show that a bias proportional to the
cross-correlation of each template and the true CMB is always present. This
bias can be larger than any of the foreground signals in some bands. 5. Lastly,
we consider the frequency coverage and sensitivity of the Planck mission, and
suggest linear combination coefficients for the CMB template that will reduce
both the statistical and systematic uncertainty in the synchrotron and haze

poses a constraint on the initial rotational energy of the embedded pulsars,
via the L_X-dot{E}_{rot} correlation found for radio pulsars, and under the
assumption that this relation continues to hold beyond the observed range. We
have extracted X-ray luminosities (or limits) for a large sample of historical
SNe observed with Chandra, XMM and Swift, that have been firmly classified as
core-collapse supernovae. We have then compared these observational limits with
the results of Monte Carlo simulations of the pulsar X-ray luminosity

quantum phase transition takes place through a nodal superconducting state at a

a possible explanation for the unconventional superconducting state of

on an open superconducting graphene. In particular, we investigate how
dissipation and nonequilibrium effects modify the semi-metal-BCS quantum phase
transition that occurs at half-filling in equilibrium graphene with attractive
interactions. Our system consists of a graphene sheet sandwiched by two
semi-infinite three-dimensional Fermi liquid reservoirs, which act both as a
particle pump/sink and a source of decoherence. A steady-state charge current
is established in the system by equilibrating the two reservoirs at different,
but constant, chemical potentials. The nonequilibrium BCS superconductivity in
graphene is formulated using the Keldysh path integral formalism, and we obtain
generalized gap and number density equations valid for both zero and finite
voltages. The behaviour of the gap is discussed as a function of both
attractive interaction strength and electron densities for various
graphene-reservoir couplings and voltages. We discuss how tracing out the
dissipative environment (with or without voltage) leads to decoherence of
Cooper pairs in the graphene sheet, hence to a general suppression of the gap
order parameter at all densities. For weak enough attractive interactions we
show that the gap vanishes even for electron densities away from half-filling,
and illustrate the possibility of a dissipation-induced metal-superconductor
quantum phase transition. We find that the application of small voltages does
not alter the essential features of the gap as compared to the case when the
system is subject to dissipation alone (i.e. zero voltage).

Using this technique in surveys of galaxies outside the Local Group could have
many interesting applications. Aims: The goal of this paper is to test
difference imaging photometry on Centaurus A, the nearest giant elliptical
galaxy, at a distance of 4 Mpc. Methods: We obtained deep photometric data with
the Wide Field Imager at the ESO/MPG 2.2m at La Silla spread over almost two
months. Applying the difference imaging photometry package DIFIMPHOT, we
produced high-quality difference images and detected variable sources. The
sensitivity of the current observational setup was determined through
artificial residual tests. Results: In the resulting high-quality difference
images, we detect 271 variable stars. We find a difference flux detection limit
corresponding to m_R~24.5. Based on a simple model of the halo of Centaurus A,
we estimate that a ground-based microlensing survey would detect in the order
of 4 microlensing events per year due to lenses in the halo. Conclusions:
Difference imaging photometry works very well at the distance of Centaurus A
and promises to be a useful tool for detecting and studying variable stars in
galaxies outside the local group. For microlensing surveys, a higher
sensitivity is needed than achieved here, which would be possible with a large

through a strongly-coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma is analyzed in terms of
first-order Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics. It is shown that the hydrodynamical
description of the near quark region worsens with increasing quark velocities.
For realistic quark velocities, $v=0.99$, the non-hydrodynamical region is
located at a narrow band surrounding the quark with a width of approximately
$3/\pi T$ in the direction parallel to the quark's motion and with a length of
roughly $10/\pi T$ in the perpendicular direction. Our results can be
interpreted as an indication of the presence of coherent Yang-Mills fields
where deviation from hydrodynamics is at its maximum. In the region where
hydrodynamics does provide a good description of the system's dynamics, the
flow velocity is so small that all the nonlinear terms can be dropped. Our
results, which are compatible with the thermalization timescales extracted from
elliptic flow measurements, suggest that if AdS/CFT provides a good description
of the RHIC system, the bulk of the quenched jet energy has more than enough
time to locally thermalize and become encoded in the collective flow. The
resulting flow pattern close to the quark, however, is shown to be considerably
different than the superposition of Mach cones and diffusion wakes observed at
large distances.

factors Q of the mantle and crust materials scale as the tidal frequency to a
positive fractional power (Karato 2007, Efroimsky and Lainey 2007). In
astronomy, there exists an equally common belief that such rheological models
introduce discontinuities into the equations and thus are unrealistic at low
frequencies. We demonstrate that, while such models indeed make the
conventional expressions for the tidal torque diverge for vanishing
frequencies, the emerging infinities reveal not the impossible nature of one or
another rheology, but a subtle flaw in the underlying mathematical model of
friction. Flawed is the common misassumption that the tidal force and torque
are inversely proportional to the quality factor. In reality, they are
proportional to the sine of the tidal phase lag, while the inverse quality
factor is commonly identified with the tangent of the lag. The sine and tangent
of the lag are close everywhere {\it{except in the vicinity of the zero
frequency}}. Reinstating of this detail tames the fake infinities and
rehabilitates the ""impossible"" scaling law (which happens to be the actual law
the mantles obey). This preprint is a pilot paper. A more comprehensive
treatise on tidal torques is to be published (Efroimsky and Williams 2009).

result in the experiment bear a strong resemblance to linear force-fee
extrapolations of the SOHO/MDI magnetograms. A thin current sheet is formed at
the boundary of the emerging plasma. A jet is launched upward along the open
reconnected field lines with values of temperature, density and velocity in
agreement with the XRT and EIS observations. Below the jet, a split-vault

field loops and a growing one with loops produced by the reconnection. The
ongoing reconnection leads to a horizontal drift of the vault-and-jet

  Qubits","4 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con",,"  We study decoherence effects in a dc SQUID phase qubit caused by an isolation
circuit with a resonant frequency. The coupling between the SQUID phase qubit
and its environment is modeled via the Caldeira-Leggett formulation of quantum
dissipation/coherence, where the spectral density of the environment is related
to the admittance of the isolation circuit. When the frequency of the qubit is
at least two times larger than the resonance frequency of the isolation
circuit, we find that the decoherence time of the qubit is two orders of
magnitude larger than the typical ohmic regime, where the frequency of the
qubit is much smaller than the resonance frequency of the isolation circuit.
Lastly, we show that when the qubit frequency is on resonance with the
isolation circuit, an oscillatory non-Markovian decay emerges, as the dc SQUID
phase qubit and its environment self-generate Rabi oscillations of
characteristic time scales shorter than the decoherence time.

produced from randomly-formed X-ray bursts (flashes) by plasma interior to the
ergosphere of a rapidly-rotating black hole. We show by direct computation of
their orbits that the photons comprising the observed X-ray light curves, if
due to a multitude of such flashes, are affected significantly by the black
hole's dragging of inertial frames; the photons of each such burst arrive to an
observer at infinity in multiple (double or triple), distinct ""bunches""
separated by a roughly constant time lag of t/M~14, regardless of the bursts'
azimuthal position. We argue that every other such ""bunch"" represents photons
that follow trajectories with an additional orbit around the black hole at the
photon circular orbit radius (a photon ""echo""). The presence of this constant
lag in the response function of the system leads to a QPO feature in its power
density spectra, even though the corresponding light curve consists of a
totally stochastic signal. This effect is by and large due to the black hole
spin and is shown to gradually diminish as the spin parameter a decreases or
the radial position of the burst moves outside the static limit surface
(ergosphere). Our calculations indicate that for a black hole with Kerr
parameter of a/M=0.99 and mass of M=10*Msun the QPO is expected at a frequency

and characterization of exo-solar terrestrial planets are actively being
pursued by the astronomical community. Typical coronagraphs have internal
shaped focal plane and/or pupil plane occulting masks which block and/or
diffract starlight thereby increasing the planet's contrast with respect to its
parent star. Past studies have shown that any internal technique is limited by
the ability to sense and control amplitude, phase (wavefront) and polarization
to exquisite levels - necessitating stressing optical requirements. An
alternative and promising technique is to place a starshade, i.e. external
occulter, at some distance in front of the telescope. This starshade suppresses
most of the starlight before entering the telescope - relaxing optical
requirements to that of a more conventional telescope. While an old technique
it has been recently been advanced by the recognition that circularly symmetric
graded apodizers can be well approximated by shaped binary occulting masks.
Indeed optimal shapes have been designed that can achieve smaller inner working
angles than conventional coronagraphs and yet have high effective throughput
allowing smaller aperture telescopes to achieve the same coronagraphic
resolution and similar sensitivity as larger ones.
  Herein we report on our ongoing modeling, simulation and optimization of
external occulters and show sensitivity results with respect to number and
shape errors of petals, spectral passband, accuracy of Fresnel propagation, and
show results for both filled and segmented aperture telescopes and discuss

sample we extracted from the pool a subset of control QSOs that are closest in
redshift and magnitude. The mean color of this subset was used as a zero point
to measure the ""deviation from the mean color"" of individual DLA-QSOs, Delta_i.
The colors were measured using ""BEST"" ugriz SDSS imaging data. The mean color

color deviations Delta_i. We find <E(r-z)> = 27 +/- 9 x 10**(-3) mag and

reddening of DLA systems at z_a ~ 2.7 in SDSS QSOs with limiting magnitude r
=/~ 20.2. The detection of the mean reddening is confirmed by several
statistical tests. Analysis of the results suggests an origin of the reddening
in dust embedded in the DLA systems, with an SMC-type extinction curve. By
converting the reddening into rest-frame extinction, we derive a mean

rotation curves, without needing to invoke dark matter. Whereas other theories
have been proposed in the past which realize the same, the present theory rests
on basic physical principles, in contrast to for instance the MOND theory. The
key to arrive at this new theory is to consider from the start the energy
density of the vacuum. The way to calculate the effect of the corresponding
vacuum pressure on a mass has previously been laid down by Van Nieuwenhove
(1992). We obtain a modification of Newton's law of gravitation with some
peculiar properties such as the occurrence of regions of repulsive gravity.
Based on a newly derived equation of state of the vacuum, the Tully-Fisher
relation is derived. The theory can make detailed predictions about galaxy
rotation curves and is also able to explain to the Pioneer anomaly, the foamy
distribution of galaxies and the observed accelerated expansion of the

we can obtain an integrable NC SG with factorized S matrix. Of the two models
we study, the second NC SG -- derived by dimensional reduction from the stringy

required by integrability in 2D, while the first one does not. As a second
topic, a particular brane-world model is analyzed both from the cosmological
point of view and in the spirit of holography, after introducing conventional
cosmology, brane-worlds and AdS/CFT. The 7D RS set-up with brane-bulk energy
exchange we propose leads to a non conventional cosmological evolution where
all fixed points have positive acceleration and are found to be stable for a
wide range of choices for the parameters. We construct the holographic dual

matching of parameters on the two sides of the duality is then achieved in

anomalous Cold Spot (CS) at galactic latitude b=-57deg and longitude l=209deg.
We have examined the properties of the CS in some detail in order to assess its
cosmological significance. We have performed a cluster analysis of the local
extrema in the CMB signal to show that the CS is actually associated with a
large group of extrema rather than just one. In the light of this we have
re-examined the properties of the WMAP ILC and co-added ""cleaned"" WCM maps,
which have previously been used for the analysis of the properties of the
signal in the vicinity of the CS. These two maps have remarkably similar
properties on equal latitude rings for |b|>30deg, as well as in the vicinity of
the CS. We have also checked the idea that the CMB signal has a non-Gaussian
tail, localized in the low multipole components of the signal. For each ring we
apply a linear filter with characteristic scale R, dividing the CMB signal in
two parts: the filtered part, with characteristic scale above that of the
filter R, and the difference between the initial and filtered signal. Using the
filter scale as a variable, we can maximize the skewness and kurtosis of the
smoothed signal and minimize these statistics for the difference between
initial and filtered signal. We have discovered that the shape of the CS is
formed primarily by the components of the CMB signal represented by multipoles
between 10<=L<=20, with a corresponding angular scale about 5-10 degs. This
signal leads to modulation of the whole CMB sky, clearly seen at |b|>30deg in
both the ILC and WCM maps, rather than a single localized feature. After
subtraction of this modulation, the remaining part of the CMB signal appears to
be consistent with statistical homogeneity and Gaussianity.

measurements taken on independent samples, in one biological group, at a small
number of irregularly spaced time points, and exhibiting patterns of temporal
nonstationarity. To analyze this CD8 T-cell experiment, we develop a
hierarchical state space model so that we can: (1) detect temporally
differentially expressed genes, (2) identify the direction of successive
changes over time, and (3) assess the magnitude of successive changes over
time. We incorporate hidden Markov models into our model to utilize the

state space model in an empirical Bayes framework to utilize the population
information from the large-scale data. Analysis of the CD8 T-cell experiment
using the proposed model results in biologically meaningful findings. Temporal

is appropriate for describing the end point of realistic collapse. Indeed if
semiclassical physics were in some cases to prevent formation of the trapping
horizon, then this suggests the possibility of new collapsed objects which can
be much less problematic, making it unnecessary to confront the information

NGC 6388, it has been recently proposed that it harbors a central
intermediate-mass black hole with mass $\simeq 5.7\times 10^3$ M$_{\odot}$. We
expect that the compact object in the center of NGC 6388 emits radiation in the
$X$-ray band as a consequence of the accretion from the surrounding matter. We
searched for $XMM$-Newton and $Chandra$ observations towards NGC 6388 to test
this hypothesis. The $Chandra$ satellite disentangles several point-like
$X$-ray sources, probably low mass $X$-ray binaries, well within the core
radius of the globular cluster. However, three of them, coinciding with the
cluster center of gravity, remain unresolved. Their total luminosity is
$L_X^{Obs}\simeq 2.7\times 10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$. If one of these sources is
the $X$-ray counterpart of the intermediate-mass black hole in NGC 6388, the
corresponding upper limit on the accretion efficiency, with respect to the
Eddington luminosity, is $3\times 10^{-9}$. This measurement could be tightened
if moderately deep radio observations of the field were performed.

imaging of the two lensed images at 1.7 GHz with the VLBA and at 5 GHz with
global VLBI. Compact and extended emission is detected from the two lensed
images, which provides additional constraints to the lensing mass model. We
find that the data are consistent with either a single lensing galaxy, or a two
galaxy lens model that takes account of a nearby companion to the main lensing
galaxy within the Einstein radius of the system. However, for an ensemble of
global power-law mass models, those with density profiles steeper than
isothermal are a better fit. The best-fitting profile for a single spherical
mass model has a slope of $\gamma=$~2.45$_{-0.18}^{+0.19}$. The system also has
a third radio component which is coincident with the main lensing galaxy. This
component is detected at milli-arcsecond scales for the first time by the 1.7
GHz VLBA and 5 GHz global VLBI imaging. However, the third radio component is
found not to be consistent with a core lensed image because the radio spectrum
differs from the two lensed images, and its flux-density is too high when
compared to what is expected from simple mass models with a variable power-law
density profile and/or a reasonable core radius. Furthermore, 1.4 GHz imaging
of the system with the MERLIN finds extended lobe emission on either side of
the main lensing galaxy. Therefore, the radio emission from the third radio
component is almost certainly from an AGN within the main lensing galaxy, which
is classified as an FR I type radio source.

narrower lightcurves being redder up to about one month past lightcurve

lightcurve shape differences in intrinsic colour, that is well described by a

we present the analytical expressions for the orbital and rotational evolution

interaction. General formulas are given which do not depend on any assumption
linking the tidal lags to the frequencies of the corresponding tidal waves
(except that equal frequency harmonics are assumed to span equal lags).
Emphasis is given to the cases of companions having reached one of the two
possible final states: (1) the super-synchronous stationary rotation resulting
from the vanishing of the average tidal torque; (2) the capture into a 1:1
spin-orbit resonance (true synchronization). In these cases, the energy
dissipation is controlled by the tidal harmonic with period equal to the
orbital period (instead of the semi-diurnal tide) and the singularity due to
the vanishing of the geometric phase lag does not exist. It is also shown that
the true synchronization with non-zero eccentricity is only possible if an
extra torque exists opposite to the tidal torque. The theory is developed
assuming that this additional torque is produced by an equatorial permanent
asymmetry in the companion. The results are model-dependent and the theory is
developed only to the second degree in eccentricity and inclination
(obliquity). It can easily be extended to higher orders, but formal accuracy
will not be a real improvement as long as the physics of the processes leading
to tidal lags is not better known.

cosmological application that follows the parallel propagation of Ly_alpha and
ionizing photons. CRASH_alpha is a version of the continuum radiative transfer
code CRASH with a new algorithm to follow the propagation of Ly_alpha photons
through a gas configuration whose ionization structure is evolving. The
implementation introduces the time evolution for Ly_alpha photons (a feature
commonly neglected in line radiative transfer codes) and, to reduce the
computational time needed to follow each scattering, adopts a statistical
approach to the Ly_alpha treatment by making extensive use of pre-compiled
tables. With this statistical approach we experience a drastic increase of the
computational speed and, at the same time, an excellent agreement with the full
Ly_alpha radiative transfer computations of the code MCLy_alpha. We find that
the emerging spectra keep memory of the ionization history which generates a
given ionization configuration of the gas and, to properly account for this
effect, a self-consistent joint evolution of line and ionizing continuum
radiation as implemented in CRASH_alpha is necessary. A comparison between the
results from our code and from Ly_alpha scattering alone on a fixed HI density
field shows that the extent of the difference between the emerging spectra
depends on the particular configuration considered, but it can be substantial
and can thus affect the physical interpretation of the problem at hand. These
differences should furthermore be taken into account when computing the impact
of the Ly_alpha radiation on e.g. the observability of the 21 cm line from
neutral hydrogen at epochs preceeding complete reionization.

and helium burning shell in the AGB phases, we are able to model the entire
thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase. The helium
luminosities of the thermal pulses are significantly lower than in higher
metallicity stars so there is no third dredge-up. The envelope is enriched in
nitrogen by hot-bottom burning of carbon that was previously mixed in during
second dredge-up. There is no s-process enrichment owing to the lack of third
dredge up. The thermal pulses grow weaker as the core mass increases and they
eventually cease. From then on the star enters a quiescent burning phase which
lasts until carbon ignites at the centre of the star when the CO core mass is
1.36 solar mass. With such a high degeneracy and a core mass so close to the
Chandrasekhar mass, we expect these stars to explode as type 1.5 supernovae,
very similar to Type Ia supernovae but inside a hydrogen rich envelope.

  Physical Review D","Phys.Rev.D77:043527,2008","10.1103/PhysRevD.77.043527",,"astro-ph",,"  Fry (1996) showed that galaxy bias has the tendency to evolve towards unity,
i.e. in the long run, the galaxy distribution tends to trace that of matter.
Generalizing slightly Fry's reasoning, we show that his conclusion remains
valid in theories of modified gravity (or equivalently, complex clustered dark
energy). This is not surprising: as long as both galaxies and matter are
subject to the same force, dynamics would drive them towards tracing each
other. This holds, for instance, in theories where both galaxies and matter
move on geodesics. This relaxation of bias towards unity is tempered by cosmic
acceleration, however: the bias tends towards unity but does not quite make it,
unless the formation bias were close to unity. Our argument is extended in a
straightforward manner to the case of a stochastic or nonlinear bias. An
important corollary is that dynamical evolution could imprint a scale
dependence on the large scale galaxy bias. This is especially pronounced if
non-standard gravity introduces new scales to the problem: the bias at
different scales relaxes at different rates, the larger scales generally more
slowly and retaining a longer memory of the initial bias. A consistency test of
the current (general relativity + uniform dark energy) paradigm is therefore to
look for departure from a scale independent bias on large scales. A simple way
is to measure the relative bias of different populations of galaxies which are
at different stages of bias relaxation. Lastly, we comment on the possibility
of directly testing the Poisson equation on cosmological scales, as opposed to
indirectly through the growth factor.

insight into their coarse-grained organization. Several approaches based on the
optimization of a quality function, e.g., the modularity, have been proposed.
We present here a multistep extension of the greedy algorithm (MSG) that allows
the merging of more than one pair of communities at each iteration step. The
essential idea is to prevent the premature condensation into few large
communities. Upon convergence of the MSG a simple refinement procedure called
""vertex mover"" (VM) is used for reassigning vertices to neighboring communities
to improve the final modularity value. With an appropriate choice of the step
width, the combined MSG-VM algorithm is able to find solutions of higher
modularity than those reported previously. The multistep extension does not
alter the scaling of computational cost of the greedy algorithm.

  Execution of Memory Operations","Submitted to ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers
  2008, http://www.computingfrontiers.org/, 20 pages",,,,"cs.AR cs.DC",,"  The WaveScalar is the first DataFlow Architecture that can efficiently
provide the sequential memory semantics required by imperative languages. This
work presents an alternative memory ordering mechanism for this architecture,
the Transaction WaveCache. Our mechanism maintains the execution order of
memory operations within blocks of code, called Waves, but adds the ability to
speculatively execute, out-of-order, operations from different waves. This
ordering mechanism is inspired by progress in supporting Transactional
Memories. Waves are considered as atomic regions and executed as nested
transactions. If a wave has finished the execution of all its memory
operations, as soon as the previous waves are committed, it can be committed.
If a hazard is detected in a speculative Wave, all the following Waves
(children) are aborted and re-executed. We evaluate the WaveCache on a set
artificial benchmarks. If the benchmark does not access memory often, we could
achieve speedups of around 90%. Speedups of 33.1% and 24% were observed on more
memory intensive applications, and slowdowns up to 16% arise if memory
bandwidth is a bottleneck. For an application full of WAW, WAR and RAW hazards,
a speedup of 139.7% was verified.

variables {Xi}. The uncertainties {ui} of measuring {Xi} are generally a priori
ensured as acceptable. However, there is no general method for assessing
uncertainty (em) in the desired Ym, i.e. irrespective of whatever might be its
system-specific-relationship (SSR) with {Xi}, and/ or be the causes of {ui}. We
here therefore study the behaviors of different typical SSRs. The study shows
that any SSR is characterized by a set of parameters, which govern em. That is,
em is shown to represent a net SSR-driven (purely systematic) change in ui(s);
and it cannot vary for whether ui(s) be caused by either or both statistical
and systematic reasons. We thus present the general relationship of em with
ui(s), and discuss how it can be used to predict a priori the requirements for
an evaluated Ym to be representative, and hence to set the guidelines for
designing experiments and also really appropriate evaluation models. Say: Y_m=
f_m ({X_i}_(i=1)^N), then, although: e_m= g_m ({u_i}_(i=1)^N), ""N"" is not a key
factor in governing em. However, simply for varying ""fm"", the em is
demonstrated to be either equaling a ui, or >ui, or even <ui. Further, the
limiting error (d_m^(Lim.)) in determining an Ym is also shown to be decided by
""fm"" (SSR). Thus, all SSRs are classified into two groups: (I) the SSRs that
can never lead ""d_m^(Lim.)"" to be zero; and (II) the SSRs that enable
""d_m^(Lim.)"" to be zero. In fact, the theoretical-tool (SSR) is by pros and
cons no different from any discrete experimental-means of a study, and has
resemblance with chemical reactions as well.
