quantum phases. For one, extreme phase change determines a conventional
classical trajectory and four-momentum, i.e. mass times four-velocity. The
other phase occurs in an effective particle state, with the effective energy
and momentum being the rate of change of the phase with respect to time and
distance. A cosmic ray proton moves along a classical trajectory, but exists in
an effective particle state with an effective energy that depends on the local
gravitational potential. Assumptions are made so that a cosmic ray proton in an
ultra-high energy state detected near the Earth was in a much less energetic
state in interstellar space. A 300 EeV proton incident on the Earth was a 2 PeV
proton in interstellar space. The model predicts such protons are in states
with even more energy near the Sun than when near the Earth.

coefficients for such operator could result in emergence of localized waves -
eigenfunctions with corresponding eigenvalues lying in the gaps of the

B 77, 184504 (2008)","10.1103/PhysRevB.77.184504",,"cond-mat.supr-con",,"  Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) measurements find that the surface of
Bi-2212 is characterized by nanoscale sized regions, ""gap patches,"" which have
different magnitudes for the d-wave energy gap. Recent studies have shown that
the tunnelling conductance can be fit using a BCS-type density of states for a
d-wave superconductor with a local quasiparticle scattering rate. The fit is
made with a scattering rate which varies linearly with energy and has a slope
that is positively correlated with the local value of the gap. We revisit a
model of quasiparticle scattering by impurities and spin fluctuations which was
previously used to describe the lifetimes of nodal quasiparticles measured by
angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES). We argue that the broadening of the local
density of states is in general determined by the imaginary part of the
self-energy of the system averaged over a small region. The size of this region
is set by a mean free path which depends upon the energy. At low energies, this
region is found to be significantly larger than a gap ""patch"", so that the
density of states measured by STS is homogeneous in this energy range. At
higher energies where the mean free path is comparable with the patch size, the
density of states is inhomogeneous. We show that a local self-energy in the
impurity-plus-spin fluctuation model, while not strictly linear, yields a local
density of states (LDOS) nearly identical to the full theory, and argue that it
is consistent with the STS data as well as the phenomenological linear
scattering rate extracted from experiment. We also explore the qualitative
consequences of this phenomenology for the spectral widths observed in ARPES
and predict the existence of Fermi arcs in the superconducting state.

multiplet is 'dual' to the conventional D-field with 0 on-shell or 1 off-shell
degree of freedom. The dilaton \phi is absorbed into one longitudinal component
of A_\mu, making it massive. Initially, B_{\mu\nu} has 1 on-shell or 3

turbulent flows this latter ratio depends on the energy spectra and approaches
unity in a steady state. To generalize for flows of arbitrary spectra we define
an effective magnetic dissipation number, R_{M,e}, as the ratio of the
advection to microphysical dissipation terms in the total magnetic energy
equation, incorporating the full spectrum of scales, arbitrary magnetic Prandtl

hydrodynamic turbulence,energy dissipation of large scale structures in
turbulent flows via a cascade can be much faster than the dissipation of large
scale structures in laminar flows. This illustrates that the rate of energy
dissipation by magnetic reconnection is much faster in turbulent flows, and
much less sensitive to microphysical reconnection rates compared to laminar
flows.

weakly affected. The velocities depend on the effective mass and degeneracy of
the dispersions. The [110] and secondly the [100] oriented 3nm thick nanowires
examined, indicate the best ON-current performance compared to [111] wires. The
dispersion features are strong functions of quantization. Effects such as
valley splitting can lift the degeneracies especially for wires with cross
section sides below 3nm. The effective masses also change significantly with
quantization, and change differently for different transport orientations. For
the cases of [100] and [111] wires the masses increase with quantization,
however, in the [110] case, the mass decreases. The mass variations can be
explained from the non-parabolicities and anisotropies that reside in the first
Brillouin zone of silicon.

effects in short-period binaries. We review the evidence for ellipsoidal
variability and for the observational manifestation of apsidal motion in
eclipsing binaries. Among the long-term effects, circularization was studied
the most, and a transition period between circular and eccentric orbits has
been derived for eight coeval samples of binaries. As binaries are supposed to
reach synchronization before circularization, one can expect finding eccentric
binaries in pseudo-synchronization state, the evidence for which is reviewed.
The paper reviews the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and its potential to study
spin-orbit alignment. We discuss the tidal interaction in close binaries that
are orbited by a third distant companion, and review the effect of pumping the
binary eccentricity by the third star. We then discuss the idea that the tidal
interaction induced by the eccentricity modulation can shrink the binary
separation.
  The paper discusses the extrasolar planets and the observational evidence for
tidal interaction with their parent stars which can induce radial drift of
short-period planets and circularization of planetary orbits. The paper reviews
the revolution of the study of binaries that is currently taking place, driven
by large-scaled photometric surveys that are detecting many thousands of new
binaries and tens of extrasolar planets. In particular, we review several
studies that have been used already thousands of lightcurves of eclipsing
binaries to study tidal circularization of early-type stars in the LMC.

object driven over a random substrate, and mutually interacting through a
viscous coupling. For this model, the mean-field theory (i.e. a fully connected
model) predicts a transition from elastic depinning to hysteretic plastic
depinning as disorder or viscous coupling is increased. A functional RG
analysis shows that any small inter-layer viscous coupling destablizes the
standard (decoupled) elastic depinning FRG fixed point for d <= 4, while for d
> 4 most aspects of the mean-field theory are recovered. A one-loop study at
non-zero velocity indicates, for d<4, coexistence of a moving state and a
pinned state below the elastic depinning threshold, with hysteretic plastic
depinning for periodic and non-periodic driven layers. A 2-loop analysis of
quasi-statics unveils the possibility of more subtle effects, including a new
universality class for non-periodic objects. We also study the model in d=0,
i.e. two coupled particles, and show that hysteresis does not always exist as
the periodic steady state with coupled layers can be dynamically unstable. It
is also proved that stable pinned configurations remain dynamically stable in
presence of a viscous coupling in any dimension d. Moreover, the layer model
for periodic objects is stable to an infinitesimal commensurate density
coupling. Our work shows that a careful study of attractors in phase space and
their basin of attraction is necessary to obtain a firm conclusion for
dimensions d=1,2,3.

described, which is called the concept-oriented data model (CODM). It is
supposed that items represent data units, which are stored in concepts. A
concept is a combination of superconcepts, which determine the concept's
dimensionality or properties. An item is a combination of superitems taken by
one from all the superconcepts. An item stores a combination of references to
its superitems. The references implement inclusion relation or attribute-value
relation among items. A concept-oriented database is defined by its concept
structure called syntax or schema and its item structure called semantics. The
model defines formal transformations of syntax and semantics including the
canonical semantics where all concepts are merged and the data semantics is
represented by one set of items. The concept-oriented data model treats
relations as subconcepts where items are instances of the relations.
Multi-valued attributes are defined via subconcepts as a view on the database
semantics rather than as a built-in mechanism. The model includes
concept-oriented query language, which is based on collection manipulations. It
also has such mechanisms as aggregation and inference based on semantics
propagation through the database schema.

examined as well, and it is found that the conventional Higgs mechanism (giving
rise to massive gauge fields) does not occur in a Riemann spacetime. However,
in a Riemann-Cartan spacetime a Higgs mechanism involving the spin connection
is possible. Despite the lack of a conventional Higgs mechanism in Riemann
spacetime, additional massive modes involving the metric can appear through
unconventional processes that have no analogue in nonabelian gauge theory. The
effects of these types of processes are illustrated using a specific model,

equation of evolution is a linear partial pseudo-differential equation with
fractional derivatives in time and in space, the orders being equal to the
