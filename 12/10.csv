term requires a modified counterterm when background fields, needed to generate
the full set of currents, are introduced. The modified counterterm plays an
essential role in properly defining covariant global currents and their
anomalies. For example, it is required in order to correctly derive the gauge
invariant baryon number current and its anomalous divergence. The background
fields can also be promoted to a description of the physical spin-1 vector and
axial-vector mesons in QCD and the counterterm leads to novel interactions.
These are (pseudo-) Chern-Simons terms, such as $\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}
\omega_\mu Z_\nu \partial_\rho A_\sigma$ and $\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}
\rho^{\pm}_\mu W^{\mp}_\nu \partial_\rho A_\sigma$ that mediate new

resource allocation for energy efficiency in wireless CDMA networks. In
particular, assuming that a linear multiuser detector is adopted in the uplink
receiver, the case considered is that in which each terminal is allowed to vary
its transmit power, spreading code, and uplink receiver in order to maximize
its own utility, which is defined as the ratio of data throughput to transmit
power. Resorting to a game-theoretic formulation, a non-cooperative game for
utility maximization is formulated, and it is proved that a unique Nash
equilibrium exists, which, under certain conditions, is also Pareto-optimal.
Theoretical results concerning the relationship between the problems of SINR
maximization and MSE minimization are given, and, resorting to the tools of
large system analysis, a new distributed power control algorithm is
implemented, based on very little prior information about the user of interest.
The utility profile achieved by the active users in a large CDMA system is also
computed, and, moreover, the centralized socially optimum solution is analyzed.
Considerations on the extension of the proposed framework to a multi-cell
scenario are also briefly detailed. Simulation results confirm that the
proposed non-cooperative game largely outperforms competing alternatives, and
that it exhibits a quite small performance loss with respect to the socially
optimum solution, and only in the case in which the users number exceeds the
processing gain. Finally, results also show an excellent agreement between the
theoretical closed-form formulas based on large system analysis and the outcome
of numerical experiments.

semantical platform and research program for redeveloping logic as a formal
theory of computability, as opposed to the formal theory of truth which it has
more traditionally been. Formulas in CL stand for (interactive) computational
problems, understood as games between a machine and its environment; logical
operators represent operations on such entities; and ""truth"" is understood as
existence of an effective solution, i.e., of an algorithmic winning strategy.
  The formalism of CL is open-ended, and may undergo series of extensions as
the study of the subject advances. The main groups of operators on which CL has
been focused so far are the parallel, choice, branching, and blind operators.
The present paper introduces a new important group of operators, called
sequential. The latter come in the form of sequential conjunction and
disjunction, sequential quantifiers, and sequential recurrences. As the name
may suggest, the algorithmic intuitions associated with this group are those of
sequential computations, as opposed to the intuitions of parallel computations
associated with the parallel group of operations: playing a sequential
combination of games means playing its components in a sequential fashion, one
after one.
  The main technical result of the present paper is a sound and complete
axiomatization of the propositional fragment of computability logic whose
vocabulary, together with negation, includes all three -- parallel, choice and
sequential -- sorts of conjunction and disjunction. An extension of this result
to the first-order level is also outlined.

tensor of gravitation and matter. We show that the conformal transformation
rules for the matter parts of both the Einstein complex and the

their gravitational parts are more complicated. We also find that the
transformational rules of the superenergy tensor of matter and the superenergy

In such a special case the superenergy density as well as the sum of the
superenergy density and the matter energy density are invariants of the
conformal transformation. Besides, in that case, a conformal invariant is also
the Bel-Robinson tensor which is a part of the superenergy tensor. As for the
angular supermomentum tensor of gravity - it emerges that its transformational
rule even for a pure gravity is quite complicated but this is not the case for
the angular supermomentum tensor of matter. Having investigated some
technicalities of the conformal transformations, we also find the conformal
transformation rule for the curvature invariants and, in particular, for the
Gauss-Bonnet invariant in a spacetime of arbitrary dimension.

measurement matrix is an N by d matrix with N much smaller than d. Our
algorithm, Regularized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (ROMP), seeks to close the
gap between two major approaches to sparse recovery. It combines the speed and
ease of implementation of the greedy methods with the strong guarantees of the
convex programming methods. For any measurement matrix that satisfies a Uniform
Uncertainty Principle, ROMP recovers a signal with O(n) nonzeros from its
inaccurate measurements x in at most n iterations, where each iteration amounts
to solving a Least Squares Problem. The noise level of the recovery is
proportional to the norm of the error, up to a log factor. In particular, if
the error vanishes the reconstruction is exact. This stability result extends
naturally to the very accurate recovery of approximately sparse signals.

increased at low bias consistent with Kondo assisted tunneling. In the same

fluctuations near threshold. This was accomplished in 1965. After Bose-Einstein

Green's functions and self-energies of semi-infinite quasi-onedimensional
systems. Our work extends the results of Sanvito et al. [1] generating a robust
algorithm to be used in conjunction with ab initio electronic structure
methods. We perform a detailed error analysis of the scheme and find that the
highest accuracy is found if no inversion of the usually ill conditioned
hopping matrix is involved. Even in this case however a transformation of the
hopping matrix that decreases its condition number is needed in order to limit
the size of the imaginary part of the wave-vectors. This is done in two
different ways, either by applying a singular value decomposition and setting a
lowest bound for the smallest singular value, or by adding a random matrix of
small amplitude. By using the first scheme the size of the Hamiltonian matrix
is reduced, making the computation considerably faster for large systems. For
most energies the method gives high accuracy, however in the presence of
surface states the error diverges due to the singularity in the self-energy. A
surface state is found at a particular energy if the set of solution
eigenvectors of the infinite system is linearly dependent. This is then used as
a criterion to detect surface states, and the error is limited by adding a
small imaginary part to the energy.

  UMTCs encode topological properties of anyonic quantum systems and can be

only finitely many equivalence classes of MTCs for any given rank, and a UMTC
is universal for anyonic quantum computation if and only if its global quantum

  Discovery of non-abelain anyons in Nature will be a landmark in condensed

simplest, and, therefore, are most likely to be found. G. Moore and N. Read
proposed that non-abelian statistics could occur in fractional quantum Hall

related to $SU(2)_k$ in FQH liquids at filling fractions $\nu=2+\frac{k}{k+2}$
for $k=1,2,3$. For $\nu={5/2}$ and $SU(2)_2$, there is a numerical proof and
experimental evidence for this conjecture. The Ising anyons might exist in

$\sigma_{\Delta{}RR}$ of the heartbeat intervals RR and their increments
$\Delta{}RR$; (3) the long-range correlations in RR as measured by the scaling

linear and nonlinear properties as represented by the scaling exponents
$\alpha^{sign}$ and $\alpha^{mag}$ for the time series of the sign and
magnitude of $\Delta{}RR$; (5) the nonlinear fractal dimension $D(k)$ of $RR$
using the Fractal Dimension Analysis. We find: (1) No significant difference in
$\left<RR\right>$ (P>0.05); (2) a significant difference in $\sigma_{RR}$ and
$\sigma_{\Delta{}RR}$ for the Fantasia groups (P<10^{-4}) but no significant

indeed show a reduced SD of heartbeat fluctuations with advanced age, the
inherent temporal fractal and nonlinear organization of these fluctuations

  Results from this meta-study: (1) confirm previous findings that the number
of GCs normalized by host galaxy stellar mass increases with host stellar mass.
Spiral galaxies in the sample show smaller relative GC numbers than those of
massive ellipticals, suggesting the GC systems of massive ellipticals were not

per unit galaxy baryon mass increases with host baryon mass and that GC
formation efficiency may not be universal as previously thought; (3) suggest
previously reported trends with environment may be incorrect due to sample bias

environmentally dependent GC formation efficiencies should be revisited; (4) in
combination with weak-lensing halo mass estimates, suggest that GCs formed in
direct proportion to the halo mass; (5) are consistent with theoretical

nanowires with ab initio quantum transport calculations. The aim is to gain a
thorough understanding of the interplay between electrical conduction and
magnetism in atomic-size conductors and how it is affected by different aspects
as e.g. the atomic structure and the chemical composition of the conductor. To
this end our ab initio quantum transport program ALACANT which combines the
non-equilibrium Green's function formalism (NEGF) with density functional
theory (DFT) calculations has been extended to describe spin-polarized systems.
We present calculations on nanocontacts made of Ni as a prototypical magnetic
material. We find that atomic disorder in the contact region strongly reduces
the a priori high spin-polarization of the conductance leading to rather
moderate values of the so-called ballistic magnetoresistance (BMR). On the
other hand, we show that the adsorption of oxygen in the contact region could
strongly enhance the spin-polarization of the conduction electrons and thus BMR
by eliminating the spin-unpolarized s-channel. Finally, we show that short
atomic Pt chains suspended between the tips of a nanocontact are magnetic in
contrast to bulk Pt. However, this emergent nanoscale magnetism barely affects
the overall conductance of the nanocontact making it thus difficult to
demonstrate by simple conductance measurements. In conclusion, we find that
spin-transport through atomic-scale conductors is quite sensitive to the actual
atomic structure as well as to the chemical composition of the conductor. This
presents both, opportunities and challenges for the realization of future
nanoscale spintronics devices.

the tunneling of a wall from one lattice site to another (tunneling of the kink

chirality). Both of these elementary processes are suppressed for kinks in
one-dimensional ferromagnets with half-integer spin. The dispersion law (i.e.,
the domain wall energy versus momentum) is essentially different for chains
with either integer or half-integer spins. The predicted quantum effects could
be observed for mesoscopic magnetic structures, e.g., chains of magnetic

  Observations and Algorithms","14 pages, 0 figures",,,,"cs.CC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Markov random fields are used to model high dimensional distributions in a
number of applied areas. Much recent interest has been devoted to the
reconstruction of the dependency structure from independent samples from the
Markov random fields. We analyze a simple algorithm for reconstructing the
underlying graph defining a Markov random field on $n$ nodes and maximum degree
$d$ given observations. We show that under mild non-degeneracy conditions it
reconstructs the generating graph with high probability using $\Theta(d
\epsilon^{-2}\delta^{-4} \log n)$ samples where $\epsilon,\delta$ depend on the
local interactions. For most local interaction $\eps,\delta$ are of order
$\exp(-O(d))$.
  Our results are optimal as a function of $n$ up to a multiplicative constant
depending on $d$ and the strength of the local interactions. Our results seem
to be the first results for general models that guarantee that {\em the}
generating model is reconstructed. Furthermore, we provide explicit $O(n^{d+2}
\epsilon^{-2}\delta^{-4} \log n)$ running time bound. In cases where the
measure on the graph has correlation decay, the running time is $O(n^2 \log n)$
for all fixed $d$. We also discuss the effect of observing noisy samples and
show that as long as the noise level is low, our algorithm is effective. On the
other hand, we construct an example where large noise implies
non-identifiability even for generic noise and interactions. Finally, we
briefly show that in some simple cases, models with hidden nodes can also be
recovered.

ferromagnetic fluctuations which possess a quantum critical character are
present above $T_{\rm Curie}$ and the occurrence of ferromagnetic transition at
2.5 K in our polycrystalline sample. The magnetic fluctuations in the normal
state show that UCoGe is an itinerant ferromagnet similar to ZrZn$_2$ and
YCo$_2$. The onset SC transition was identified at $T_S \sim 0.7$ K, below
which $1/T_1$ of 30 % of the volume fraction starts to decrease due to the
opening of the SC gap. This component of $1/T_1$, which follows a $T^3$
dependence in the temperature range of $0.3 - 0.1$ K, coexists with the
magnetic components of $1/T_1$ showing a $\sqrt{T}$ dependence below $T_S$.
  From the NQR measurements in the SC state, we suggest that the self-induced
vortex state is realized in UCoGe.

the transferred momentum, an incident photon polarization and an incident

polarization, and the peaks in the spectra correspond to the energies of the

RIXS spectra. These findings lead to further application for RIXS when

to the standard single power-law behaviour has recently been reported in the
literature. This component can be fit with different models; in particular the
addition of a spectral line provides the best representation.In this paper we
investigate the physical properties that the surrounding medium must have in
order to produce a spectral feature that can explain the detected emission. We
analyse and discuss how and if the detected spectral excess fits in different
theoretical models developed to explain the nature of line emission during the
afterglow phase of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). Trasmission and reflection models
have been considered. Given the high value (>>1) of the Thomson optical depth,
the emission is likely to arise in a reflection scenario. Within reflection
models, the external reflection geometry fails to predict the observed
luminosity. On the contrary, the detected feature can be explained in a funnel
scenario with typical opening angle theta of 5 degrees, Nickel mass of the
order of 0.1 M_o and T=10^6 K. For theta=20 degrees, assuming the reprocessing
material to be the SN shell, the detected emission implies a Nickel mass of 0.4
M_o at T=10^7 K and a metallicity 10 times the solar value. If the giant X-ray
flare that dominates the early XRT light curve is identified with the ionizing
source, the SN expansion began 3000 s before the GRB event.

system (Shin et al, Science, 306, 76 (2004)), in which an exotic toroidal
structure was observed upon confinement in alumina nanopores. Our computational
study shows that a zoo of exotic structures can be formed, although the
majority, including the catenoid, helix and double helix that were also found

general classification scheme and consider the role of kinetics and
elongational pressure on stability and formation pathway of both equilibrium
and metastable structures in detail. We find that helicity and three-fold
connections mediate structural transitions on a larger scale. Moreover, by
matching the remaining parameter in our mesoscopic method, the Flory-Huggins
parameter, to the experimental system, we obtain a structure that resembles the
experimental toroidal structure in great detail. Here, the most important
factor seems to be the roughness of the pore, i.e. small variations of the pore
radius on a scale that is larger than the characteristic size in the system.

Induced quantum wires guide the transfer of electrons along metal paths and
induced quantum dots store the electrons in specific locations of the

misaligned curves. Without adjustment, even an analysis as simple as estimation

involves equating ``landmarks'' such as peaks or troughs. The landmarks method
can work well but will fail if marker events can not be identified or are
missing from some curves. An alternative approach, the ``continuous monotone
registration'' method, works by transforming the curves so that they are as
close as possible to a target function. This method can also perform well but
is highly dependent on identifying an accurate target function. We develop an
alignment method based on equating the ``moments'' of a given set of curves.
These moments are intended to capture the locations of important features which
may represent local behavior, such as maximums and minimums, or more global
characteristics, such as the slope of the curve averaged over time. Our method
works by equating the moments of the curves while also shrinking toward a
common shape. This allows us to capture the advantages of both the landmark and
continuous monotone registration approaches. The method is illustrated on
several data sets and a simulation study is performed.

examined in terms of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) model as well as
the quantum well (QW) model. We have investigated the behavior of the exchange
coupling by artificially varying moments of Fe atoms in ferromagnetic layers.
For a small moment of Fe, the coupling shows bilinearity in the magnetic
moments, implying its RKKY character. However, at higher moments close to that
of bulk Fe, the saturation of long-period oscillations is in accordance with
the QW model. Quantum well dispersions around the Fermi level demonstrate that
the majority-spin bands contribute largely to the formation of quantum well
states, which we analyze quantitatively by making use of the phase accumulation
model. Our analysis indicates that the quantum well model gives a better

amenable to experiment by the advent of ultracold bosonic atoms in optical
lattices, a chain of two different bosonic constituents. Excitations in this
system are first considered within the framework of bosonization and Luttinger
liquid theory which are applicable if the Luttinger liquid parameters are
determined numerically. The occurrence of a bosonic counterpart of fermionic
spin-charge separation is signalled by a characteristic two-peak structure in
the spectral functions found by dynamical DMRG in good agreement with
analytical predictions. Experimentally, single-particle excitations as probed
by spectral functions are currently not accessible in cold atoms. We therefore
consider the modifications needed for current experiments, namely the
investigation of the real-time evolution of density perturbations instead of
single particle excitations, a slight inequivalence between the two
intraspecies interactions in actual experiments, and the presence of a
confining trap potential. Using time-dependent DMRG we show that only
quantitative modifications occur. With an eye to the simulation of strongly
correlated quantum systems far from equilibrium we detect a strong dependence
of the time-evolution of entanglement entropy on the initial perturbation,
signalling limitations to current reasonings on entanglement growth in
many-body systems.

observations at 3.6 cm and 7 mm towards the core of the L723 multipolar outflow
revealing a multiple system of four radio sources suspected to be YSOs in a
region of only ~4 arcsecs (1200 AU) in extent. The 3.6 cm observations show
that the previously detected source VLA 2 contains a close (separation ~0.29
arcsecs or ~90 AU) radio binary, with components (A and B) along a position
angle of ~150 degrees. The northern component (VLA 2A) of this binary system is
also detected in the 7 mm observations, with a positive spectral index between
3.6 cm and 7 mm. In addition, the source VLA 2A is associated with extended
emission along a position angle of ~115 degrees, that we interpret as
outflowing shock-ionized gas that is exciting a system of HH objects with the
same position angle. A third, weak 3.6 cm source, VLA 2C, that is detected also
at 7 mm, is located ~0.7 arcsecs northeast of VLA 2A, and is possibly
associated with the water maser emission in the region. The 7 mm observations
reveal the presence of an additional source, VLA 2D, located ~3.5 arcsecs
southeast of VLA 2A, and with a 1.35 mm counterpart. All these radio continuum
sources have a positive spectral index, compatible with them being YSOs. We
also propose that the high velocity CO emission observed in the region could be
the superposition of multiple outflows (at least three independent bipolar
outflows) excited by the YSOs located at the core, instead of the previous

independent Poisson distributions, while in practice the data may exhibit
overdispersion and spatial correlation. In this work, we examine the behavior
of the spatial scan statistic when overdispersion and spatial correlation are
present, and propose a modified spatial scan statistic to account for that.
Some theoretical results are provided to demonstrate that ignoring the
overdispersion and spatial correlation leads to an increased rate of false
positives, which is verified through a simulation study. Simulation studies
also show that our modified procedure can substantially reduce the rate of
false alarms. Two data examples involving brain cancer cases in New Mexico and

model the onset parameters of the sodium current in the Hodgkin Huxley equation

entangled. The underlying physics is general and can involve entanglement
between various degrees of freedom underlaying ion transition states or 'gating

different 'affinity' states of ions with atoms lining the sub-regions of the

potential pulses with the critical onset dynamics observed recently in

by gravitational instability. The process is hierarchical: smaller systems
collapse earlier, and later merge to form larger haloes. The galaxy clusters,
hosted by the largest dark matter haloes, are at the top of this hierarchy
representing the largest as well as the last structures formed in the universe,
while the smaller and first haloes are those Earth-sized dark subhaloes which
have been both predicted by theoretical considerations and found in numerical
simulations, though it does not exist any observational hints of their
existence. The probability that a halo of mass $m$ at redshift $z$ will be part
of a larger halo of mass $M$ at the present time can be described in the frame
of the extended Press & Schecter theory making use of the progenitor
(conditional) mass function. Using the progenitor mass function we calculate
analytically, at redshift zero, the distribution of subhaloes in mass,
formation epoch and rarity of the peak of the density field at the formation
epoch. That is done for a Milky Way-size system, assuming both a spherical and
an ellipsoidal collapse model. Our calculation assumes that small progenitors
do not lose mass due to dynamical processes after entering the parent halo, and
that they do not interact with other subhaloes. For a $\mathrm{\Lambda}$CDM
power spectrum we obtain a subhalo mass function $\mathrm{d}n/\mathrm{d}m$
proportional to $m^{- \alpha}$ with a model-independent $\alpha \sim 2$.
Assuming the dark matter is a weakly interacting massive particle, the inferred
distributions is used to test the feasibility of an indirect detection in the
$\gamma$-rays energy band of such a population of subhaloes with a GLAST-like
satellite.

dissection. Using an explicit representation of the Kerr angle in terms of real

a minimum in the Re $\sigma_{xx}$ spectra can give rise to a large Kerr

Car originates from at least 3 different point sources. The emission of Eta Car
itself can be isolated for the first time, and its spectrum unambiguously

burst, must be <100 Myr. If the stars in z~6 galaxies are remnants of the
star-formation that was responsible for ionizing the intergalactic medium,
reionization must have been a brief process that was completed at z<7. This
assumes the most current estimates of the clumping factor and escape fraction
and a Salpeter slope extending up to 200 M_{\sun} for the stellar initial mass
function (IMF; dN/dM \propto M^{\alpha}, \alpha=-2.3). Unless the ratio of the
clumping factor to escape fraction is less than 60, a Salpeter slope for the
stellar IMF and reionization redshift higher than 7 is ruled out. In order to
maintain an ionized intergalactic medium from redshift 9 onwards, the stellar
IMF must have a slope of \alpha=-1.65 even if stars as massive as ~200 M_{\sun}
are formed. Correspondingly, if the intergalactic medium was ionized from
redshift 11 onwards, the IMF must have \alpha~-1.5. The range of stellar mass
densities at z~6 straddled by IMFs which result in reionization at z>7 is
1.3+/-0.4\times10^{7} Msun/Mpc^3.

C18O and C17O are used to derive the column densities of gas towards the
sources and these are compared with those derived from submillimetre continuum
observations. The derived fractional abundance suggests that the CO species
show a range of degrees of depletion towards the objects. We then use the
radiative transfer code RATRAN to model a selection of the sources to confirm
that the spread of abundances is not a result of assumptions made when
calculating the column densities. We find a range of abundances of C17O that
cannot be accounted for by global variations in either the temperature or dust
properties and so must reflect source to source variations. The most likely
explanation is that different sources show different degrees of depletion of
the CO. Comparison of the C17O linewidths of our sources with those of CS
presented by other authors reveal a division of the sources into two groups.
Sources with a CS linewidth >3 km/s have low abundances of C17O while sources
with narrower CS lines have typically higher C17O abundances. We suggest that
this represents an evolutionary trend. Depletion towards these objects shows
that the gas remains cold and dense for long enough for the trace species to
deplete. The range of depletion measured suggests that these objects have
lifetimes of 2-4x10^5 years.
