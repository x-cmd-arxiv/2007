roots in cosmology--a notion that may turn out to be the most far reaching
aspect of MOND. Next I discuss the implications of MOND for the dark matter
(DM) doctrine: MOND's successes imply that baryons determine everything. For DM
this would mean that the puny tail of leftover baryons in galaxies wags the
hefty DM dog. This has to occur in many intricate ways, and despite the
haphazard construction history of galaxies--a very tall order. I then
concentrate on galaxy clusters in light of MOND, which still requires some yet
undetected cluster dark matter, presumably in some baryonic form (CBDM). This
CBDM might contribute to the heating of the x-ray emitting gas and thus
alleviate the cooling-flow puzzle. MOND, qua theory of dynamics, does not
directly enter the microphysics of the gas; however, it does force a new
outlook on the role of DM in shaping the cluster gasdynamics: MOND tells us
that the cluster DM is not cold dark matter, is not so abundant, and is not
expected in galaxies; it is thus not subject to constraints on baryonic DM in
galaxies. The mass in CBDM required in a whole cluster is, typically, similar
to that in hot gas, but is rather more centrally concentrated, totally
dominating the core. The CBDM contribution to the baryon budget in the universe
is thus small. Its properties, deduced for isolated clusters, are consistent
with the observations of the ``bullet cluster''. Its kinetic-energy reservoir
is much larger than that of the hot gas in the core, and would suffice to keep
the gas hot for many cooling times. Heating can be effected in various ways
depending on the exact nature of the CBDM, from very massive black holes to
cool, compact gas clouds.

  Wallace (eds.), Oxford, 2009. Revised version involves some clarification in
  the formulation and minor corrections",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We argue that the intractable part of the measurement problem -- the 'big'
measurement problem -- is a pseudo-problem that depends for its legitimacy on
the acceptance of two dogmas. The first dogma is John Bell's assertion that
measurement should never be introduced as a primitive process in a fundamental
mechanical theory like classical or quantum mechanics, but should always be
open to a complete analysis, in principle, of how the individual outcomes come
about dynamically. The second dogma is the view that the quantum state has an
ontological significance analogous to the significance of the classical state
as the 'truthmaker' for propositions about the occurrence and non-occurrence of
events, i.e., that the quantum state is a representation of physical reality.
We show how both dogmas can be rejected in a realist information-theoretic
interpretation of quantum mechanics as an alternative to the Everett
interpretation. The Everettian, too, regards the 'big' measurement problem as a
pseudo-problem, because the Everettian rejects the assumption that measurements
have definite outcomes, in the sense that one particular outcome, as opposed to
other possible outcomes, actually occurs in a quantum measurement process. By
contrast with the Everettians, we accept that measurements have definite
outcomes. By contrast with the Bohmians and the GRW 'collapse' theorists who
add structure to the theory and propose dynamical solutions to the 'big'
measurement problem, we take the problem to arise from the failure to see the
significance of Hilbert space as a new kinematic framework for the physics of
an indeterministic universe, in the sense that Hilbert space imposes kinematic
(i.e., pre-dynamic) objective probabilistic constraints on correlations between
events.

other clusters we have studied, the BSS distribution is found to be bimodal:
highly peaked in the cluster center, rapidly decreasing at intermediate radii,
and rising again at larger radii. In other clusters the sparsely populated
intermediate-radius region (or ``zone of avoidance'') corresponds well to that
part of the cluster where dynamical friction would have caused the more massive
BSS or their binary progenitors to settle to the cluster center. Instead, in
NGC 6388, BSS still populate a region that should have been cleaned out by
dynamical friction effects, thus suggesting that dynamical friction is somehow
less efficient than expected. As by-product of these observations, the peculiar
morphology of the horizontal branch (HB) is also confirmed. In particular,
within the (very extended) blue portion of the HB we are able to clearly
characterize three sub-populations: ordinary blue HB stars, extreme HB stars,

is indistinguishable from normal cluster stars.

also known as GSC 03727-01064. The orbital period of XO-3b is 3.1915426 +/-
0.00014 days. XO-3 lacks a trigonometric distance; we estimate its distance to
be 260 +/- 23 pc. The radius of XO-3 is 2.13 +/- 0.21 Rsun, its mass is 1.41
+/- 0.08 Msun, its vsini = 18.54 +/- 0.17 km/s, and its metallicity is [Fe/H] =
-0.177 +/- 0.027. This system is unusual for a number of reasons. XO-3b is one
of the most massive planets discovered around any star for which the orbital
period is less than 10 days. The mass is near the deuterium burning limit of 13
Mjup, which is a proposed boundary between planets and brown dwarfs. Although
Burrows et al. (2001) propose that formation in a disk or formation in the
interstellar medium in a manner similar to stars is a more logical way to
differentiate planets and brown dwarfs, our current observations are not
adequate to address this distinction. XO-3b is also unusual in that its
eccentricity is large given its relatively short orbital period. Both the
planetary radius and the inclination are functions of the spectroscopically
determined stellar radius. Analysis of the transit light curve of XO-3b
suggests that the spectroscopically derived parameters may be over estimated.
Though relatively noisy, the light curves favor a smaller radius in order to
better match the steepness of the ingress and egress. The light curve fits
imply a planetary radius of 1.25 +/- 0.15 Rjup, which would correspond to a
mass of 12.03 +/- 0.46 Mjup.

including the voter model and the invasion process. These are both two-state
models in which in an update event an individual changes state to agree with a
neighbor. For the voter model, an individual ""imports"" its state from a
randomly-chosen neighbor. Here the average time T_N to reach consensus for a
network of N nodes with an uncorrelated degree distribution scales as N
mu_1^2/mu_2, where mu_k is the kth moment of the degree distribution. Quick
consensus thus arises on networks with broad degree distributions. We also
identify the conservation law that characterizes the route by which consensus
is reached. Parallel results are derived for the invasion process, in which the
state of an agent is ""exported"" to a random neighbor. We further generalize to
biased dynamics in which one state is favored. The probability for a single
fitter mutant located at a node of degree k to overspread the population--the
fixation probability--is proportional to k for the voter model and to 1/k for
the invasion process.

agents each receive partial information about a system in the form of data. In
addition, each agent agrees or is informed that there are certain global
constraints on the system that are always true. The agents are then asked to
make inferences about the entire system. The system becomes more complex as we
add agents and allow them to share information. This system can have a
geometrical form, such as a crystal structure. The shape may dictate how the
agents are able to share information, such as sharing with nearest neighbors.
This method can be used to model many systems where the agents or cells have
local or partial information but must adhere to some global rules. This could
also illustrate how the agents evolve and could illuminate emergent behavior of
the system.

accidental rather than being symmetry determined. The large spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) of osmium upsets the spin balance (no net spin moment without SOC): it
reduces the Os spin moment by 0.27 $\mu_B$ and induces an Os orbital moment of
0.17 $\mu_B$ in the opposite direction. The effects combine (with small oxygen
contributions) to give a net total moment of 0.54 $\mu_B$ per cell in \scoo,
reflecting a large impact of SOC in this compound. This value is in moderately
good agreement with the measured saturation moment of 0.75 $\mu_B$. The value
of the net moment on the Os ion obtained from neutron diffraction (0.73 $\mu_B$
at low temperature) differs from the calculated value (1.14 $\mu_B$). Rather
surprisingly, in isovalent Sr$_2$CrRuO$_6$ the smaller SOC-induced spin changes
and orbital moments (mostly on Ru) almost exactly cancel. This makes
Sr$_2$CrRuO$_6$ a ""half (semi)metallic antiferromagnet"" (practically vanishing

small-band-overlap semimetal. Fixed spin moment (FSM) calculations are

(CDM) models, and central velocity dispersions that still yield an accurate
representation of the bound mass and observed central M/L~40 of Carina, despite
inflation of the velocity dispersion outside the dSph core by unbound debris.
Our survey of parameter space also allows us to address a number of commonly
held misperceptions of tidal disruption and its observable effects on dSph
structure and dynamics. The simulations suggest that even modest tidal
disruption can have a profound effect on the observed dynamics of dSph stars at
large radii. Satellites that are well-described by tidally disrupting MFL
models could still be fully compatible with L-CDM if for example they represent
a later stage in the evolution of luminous subhalos.

Gaussian profiles to the RXTE/ASM and SWIFT/BAT light curves. The time
corresponding to the maximum value of the profiles is treated as the arrival
time of Type I outburst. We used differential magnitudes in the time-series
analysis of the optical light curve. MIDAS and its suitable packages were used
to reduce and analyze the spectra. Prior to the Type II outburst, orbital
phases of Type I outbursts were delayed for 6 days after the periastron
passage, which is consistent with findings of Wilson et al., (2002, 2005).
After the giant Type II outburst, the phase of Type I outbursts underwent a
sudden shift of 13 days after the periastron passage. The amplitudes of Type I
outbursts were increased between MJD 52500 and 53500. These amplitudes then
decreased for 10 orbital cycles until the Type II outburst was triggered. If
the change of outburst amplitudes correlated with the mass accretion, then
during the decrease of these amplitudes mass should be deposited in a disk
around neutron star temporarily. The release of this stored mass may ignite the
Type II outburst. We report that the optical light curve became fainter by 0.4
mag during the decrease of amplitude of the Type I outbursts. The observed
H$\alpha$ profiles and their equivalent widths during the decay and after the
giant outburst are consistent with previous observations of the system.

With further departure from half-filling the peak transforms to a ridge around
the $\Gamma$ point. In the considered range $0\leq|1-\bar{n}|\alt 0.2$ of the

the absence of the long-range charge ordering. However, for $|1-\bar{n}|\approx

normal conditions and in the presence of different pathologies like
atherosclerosis, loss of blood, anatomical abnormalities, pathological changing
in chemical transformations and others is significant issue for many
physiologists. In this connection should be pointed out that global processes
are of special interest as they include feedbacks and interdependences among
different regions of the organism. Thus the main goal of this work is to
develop the model allowing to describe effectively blood flow in the whole
organism. As we interested in global processes the models of the four vascular
trees (arterial and venous parts of systemic and pulmonary circulation) must be
closed with heart and peripheral circulation models. As one of the model
applications the processes of the blood loss is considered in the end of the

study the fundamental local dynamics of accretion discs. This approach has
proved to be very useful because it allows high resolution and long term

disc.
  Localised disc studies have largely focused on examining the rate of enhanced
transport of angular momentum, essentially a sum of the Reynolds and Maxwell
stresses. The dominant radial-azimuthal component of this stress tensor is, in
the classic Shakura-Sunayaev model, expressed as a constant alpha times the
pressure. Previous studies have estimated alpha based on a modest number of
orbital times. Here we use much longer baselines, and perform a cumulative
average for alpha. Great care must be exercised when trying to extract
numerical alpha values from simulations: dissipation scales, computational box
aspect ratio, and even numerical algorithms all affect the result. This study
suggests that estimating alpha becomes more, not less, difficult as
computational power increases.

construct the equation of state of neutron stars with the condensate, where the

first order. We calculate the coefficient of bulk viscosity due to the
non-leptonic weak interaction n --> p + K^-. The influence of antikaon bulk
viscosity on the gravitational radiation reaction driven instability in the
r-modes is investigated. We compare our results with the previously studied
non-leptonic weak interaction $n + p --> p + \Lambda$ involving hyperons on the
damping of the r-mode oscillations.
  We find that the bulk viscosity coefficient due to the non-leptonic weak
process involving the condensate is suppressed by several orders of magnitude
in comparison with the non-superfluid hyperon bulk viscosity coefficient.
Consequently, the antikaon bulk viscosity may not be able to damp the r-mode
instability, while hyperon bulk viscosity can effectively suppress r-mode
oscillations at low temperatures. Hence neutron stars containing $K^-$
condensate in their core could be possible sources of gravitational waves.

the sense that cross-sections of null infinity specified by that gauge are
anisotropic and in fact non-compact. For this reason, that gauge is difficult
to use for explicit computations of the Bondi energy in general, asymptotically

whether apparent difference between the expressions of higher dimensional Bondi

qualitatively different nature of higher dimensional gravity from 4-dimensional

one of more natural gauge conditions that admit a global specification of
background structure with compact, spherical cross-sections of null infinity.
Accordingly, we modify the previous definition of higher dimensional news

derive, for vacuum solutions, the expression for the Bondi energy-momentum in

integer lattice Z^d: internal DLA, in which particles perform random walks
until reaching an unoccupied site; the rotor-router model, in which particles
perform deterministic analogues of random walks; and the divisible sandpile, in
which each site distributes its excess mass equally among its neighbors. As the
lattice spacing tends to zero, all three models are found to have the same
scaling limit, which we describe as the solution to a certain PDE free boundary
problem in R^d. In particular, internal DLA has a deterministic scaling limit.
We find that the scaling limits are quadrature domains, which have arisen
independently in many fields such as potential theory and fluid dynamics. Our
results apply both to the case of multiple point sources and to the
Diaconis-Fulton smash sum of domains. In the special case when all particles
start at a single site, we show that the scaling limit is a Euclidean ball in
R^d, and give quantitative bounds on the rate of convergence to a ball. We also
improve on the previously best known bounds of Le Borgne and Rossin in Z^2 and
Fey and Redig in higher dimensions for the shape of the classical abelian
sandpile model. Lastly, we study the sandpile group of a regular tree whose
leaves are collapsed to a single sink vertex, and determine the decomposition
of the full sandpile group as a product of cyclic groups. For the regular
ternary tree of height n, for example, the sandpile group is isomorphic to
(Z_3)^{2^{n-3}} x (Z_7)^{2^{n-4}} x ... x Z_{2^{n-1}-1} x Z_{2^n-1}. We use

compare our distance with the well-known Kullback-Leibler divergence and with
the proper distance defined using the Fisher matrix as a metric on the
parameter space. We consider using our notion of distance in several problems
in gravitational wave data analysis: to place templates in the parameter space
in searches for gravitational-wave signals, to assess quality of search
templates, and to study the signal resolution.

  theory",,,,"physics.soc-ph",,"  In Hopfield neural networks with up to 10^8 nodes we store two patterns
through Hebb couplings. Then we start with a third random pattern which is
supposed to evolve into one of the two stored patterns, simulating the
cognitive process of associative memory leading to one of two possible
opinions. With probability p each neuron independently, instead of following
the Hopfield rule, takes over the corresponding value of another network, thus
simulating how different people can convince each other. A consensus is
achieved for high p.

  Springer, 2006",,,"math-ph math.MP",,"  We study the motion of electrons in a periodic background potential (usually
resulting from a crystalline solid). For small velocities one would use either
the non-magnetic or the magnetic Bloch hamiltonian, while in the relativistic
regime one would use the Dirac equation with a periodic potential. The
dynamics, with the background potential included, is perturbed either through
slowly varying external electromagnetic potentials or through a slow
deformation of the crystal. In either case we discuss how the Hilbert space of
states decouples into almost invariant subspaces and explain the effective
dynamics within such a subspace.

AdS/CFT. The method we introduce is based on the matrix model maps (MMP) which
were previously successfully employed at the linearized level. The strategy is
to start with the map for 1/2 BPS configurations which is exactly known (to all
orders) in the hamiltonian framework. We then use the extension of the matrix
model map with the corresponding Ward identities to completely specify the
interaction. A central point in this construction is the non-vanishing of
off-shell interactions (even for highest-weight states).
