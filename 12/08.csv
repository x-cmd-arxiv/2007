generators we define a partial order--called the {\sf $\omega$-sorting
order}--on the set of group elements $W_\omega\subseteq W$ that occur as
subwords of $\omega$. We show that the $\omega$-sorting order is a
supersolvable join-distributive lattice and that it is strictly between the
weak and Bruhat orders on the group. Moreover, the $\omega$-sorting order is a
""maximal lattice"" in the sense that the addition of any collection of Bruhat
covers results in a nonlattice. Along the way we define a class of structures
called {\sf supersolvable antimatroids} and we show that these are equivalent
to the class of supersolvable join-distributive lattices.

evolution of the Universe, it is timely to review the status of Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and to confront its predictions, along with the
constraints which emerge from them, with those derived from independent
observations of the Universe at much later epochs in its evolution. Following
an overview of the key physics controlling element synthesis in the early
Universe, the predictions of BBN in the standard models of cosmology and
particle physics are presented, along with those from some non-standard models.
The observational data used to infer the primordial abundances are described,
with an emphasis on the distinction between precision and accuracy. The
observationally inferred relic abundances are compared with the predicted
abundances, testing the internal consistency of BBN and enabling a comparison
of the BBN-inferred constraints with those derived from the Cosmic Background
Radiation and Large Scale Structure data. Emerging from these comparisons is
confirmation of a successful standard model along with constraints on (or hints
of) physics beyond the standard models of particle physics and of cosmology.

challenges posed by searches for prompt EM counterparts and propose novel
observational strategies to address them. In particular, we discuss the size
and shape evolution of the LISA localization error ellipses on the sky, and
quantify the requirements for dedicated EM surveys of the area prior to
coalescence. A triggered EM counterpart search campaign will require monitoring
a several-square degree area. It could aim for variability at the 24-27 mag
level in optical bands, for example, which corresponds to 1-10% of the
Eddington luminosity of the prime LISA sources of 10^6-10^7 Msun BHs at z=1-2,

with the quasi-periodic gravitational waveform over 10-1000 cycles may aid the
detection. Alternatively, EM searches can detect a transient signal
accompanying the coalescence. We highlight the measurement of differences in
the arrival times of photons and gravitons from the same cosmological source as
a valuable independent test of the massive character of gravity, and of
possible violations of Lorentz invariance in the gravity sector.

have been inflated by a previous cycle of nuclear activity . If the bubble is
filled with a light, relativistic fluid we calculate that in expanding, it has
done more than sufficient work to counteract the energy lost from the
intra-group medium via radiative cooling; the bubble can provide this energy as
it expands and rises. Using upper limits on the flux density of the plasma
filling the bubble at 330 MHz and 1.4 GHz, we derive constraints on its
electron energy distribution and magnetic field strength. We show that the data
require the high-energy cut-off of the electron spectrum to be very low
compared to the cut-offs seen in more typical radio sources if the fluid
filling the bubble is a conventional relativistic plasma. This suggests that
the fluid filling the bubble may not have evolved by expansion or synchrotron
losses consistent with a dead radio source, leaving a puzzle as to what the
origin of the bubble may be.

relays, all operating in the same frequency band in the presence of block
fading, are analyzed. This setup has attracted significant attention and
several relaying protocols have been reported in the literature. However, most
of the proposed solutions require either centrally coordinated scheduling or
detailed channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter side. Here, an
opportunistic relaying scheme is proposed, which alleviates these limitations.
The scheme entails a two-hop communication protocol, in which sources
communicate with destinations only through half-duplex relays. The key idea is
to schedule at each hop only a subset of nodes that can benefit from
\emph{multiuser diversity}. To select the source and destination nodes for each
hop, it requires only CSI at receivers (relays for the first hop, and
destination nodes for the second hop) and an integer-value CSI feedback to the
transmitters. For the case when $n$ is large and $m$ is fixed, it is shown that
the proposed scheme achieves a system throughput of $m/2$ bits/s/Hz. In
contrast, the information-theoretic upper bound of $(m/2)\log \log n$ bits/s/Hz
is achievable only with more demanding CSI assumptions and cooperation between
the relays. Furthermore, it is shown that, under the condition that the product
of block duration and system bandwidth scales faster than $\log n$, the
achievable throughput of the proposed scheme scales as $\Theta ({\log n})$.
Notably, this is proven to be the optimal throughput scaling even if
centralized scheduling is allowed, thus proving the optimality of the proposed
scheme in the scaling law sense.

CZT detectors grown by the company Orbotech and read out with 8x8 pixels. In
this contribution, we describe the optimization of the photolithographic

  October 2007",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The recent implementation of the high-speed burst mode at the ISAAC
instrument on UT1, and its propagation to other ESO instruments, has opened the
door to observational capabilities which hold the potential for a wealth of
novel results. In the ELT era, when the accent will likely be on lengthy
programs aimed at the best sensitivity and angular resolution, the VLT
telescopes could continue to play a significant and largely unique role by
performing routinely observations of transient events at high temporal
resolution. In our contribution, we provide details on two such kinds of
observations, namely lunar occultations of stars and of asteroids. For the
first ones, we report on two passages of the Moon in regions with high stellar
density as the Galactic Center. The VLT-UT1 telescope was used for the first
time to record successfully 53 and 71 occultations on March 22 and August 6,
2006, with an angular resolution of 0.5-1 milliarcsecond and $K\sim12.5$
limiting magnitude. We note that the angular resolution is superior to that
achieved at present by Adaptive Optics on any telescope, and also superior to
that foreseen for the ELT at the same wavelength. LO are also very efficient in
terms of telescope time. We present some of the results, including the
discovery of close binaries, and the detection and study of compact
circumstellar components of cool giants, AGB stars and embedded IR sources.

particulate matter can be interpreted in terms of the topological properties of
space-time. The theory is developed in terms of vector and matrix equations of
exterior differential systems, which are not constrained by tensor
diffeomorphic equivalences. The first postulate defines the field properties (a
vector space continuum) of the Cosmological Vacuum in terms of matrices of
basis functions that map exact differentials into neighborhoods of exterior
differential 1-forms (potentials). The second postulate requires that the field
equations must satisfy the First Law of Thermodynamics dynamically created in
terms of the Lie differential with respect to a process direction field acting
on the exterior differential forms that encode the thermodynamic system. The
vector space of infinitesimals need not be global and its compliment is used to
define particle properties as topological defects embedded in the field vector
space. The potentials, as exterior differential 1-forms, are not (necessarily)
uniquely integrable: the fibers can be twisted, leading to possible Chiral
matrix arrays of certain 3-forms defined as Topological Torsion and Topological
Spin. A significant result demonstrates how the coefficients of Affine Torsion
are related to the concept of Field excitations (mass and charge); another
demonstrates how thermodynamic evolution can describe the emergence of
topological defects in the physical vacuum.

evidence originating from different sources. Depending on the situation to be
modelled, different belief fusion methods can be applied. Cumulative and
averaging belief fusion is defined for fusing opinions in subjective logic, and
for fusing belief functions in general. The principle of fission is the
opposite of fusion, namely to eliminate the contribution of a specific belief
from an already fused belief, with the purpose of deriving the remaining
belief. This paper describes fission of cumulative belief as well as fission of
averaging belief in subjective logic. These operators can for example be
applied to belief revision in Bayesian belief networks, where the belief

quantum number is taken large, the curvature, field strengths, inverse volume,

Sitter Hubble scale can be tuned parametrically smaller than the scales of the
moduli, KK, and winding mode masses. A subtle point in the construction is that
although the curvature remains consistently weak, the circle fibers of the
nilmanifolds become very small in this limit (though this is avoided in
illustrative solutions at modest values of the parameters). In the simplest
version of the construction, the heaviest moduli masses are parametrically of
the same order as the lightest KK and winding masses. However, we provide a
method for separating these marginally overlapping scales, and more generally
the underlying supersymmetry of the model protects against large corrections to

was observed by INTEGRAL on May 15, 2006 during the real-time routine
monitoring of IBIS/ISGRI images performed at the INTEGRAL Science Data Centre.
The flare, detected during a single one-hour long pointing, peaked at 250 mCrab
in the 20-40 keV energy range.
  Aims : Multi-wavelength observations, combining high-energy and optical data,
were used to unveil the nature of IGR J08408-4503.
  Methods : A search in all INTEGRAL public data for other bursts from IGR
J08408-4503 was performed, and the detailed analysis of another major flare is
presented. The results of two Swift Target of Opportunity observations are also
described. Finally, a study of the likely optical counterpart, HD 74194, is
provided.
  Results : IGR J08408-4503 is very likely a supergiant fast X-ray transient
(SFXT) system. The system parameters indicate that the X-ray flares are
probably related to the accretion of wind clumps on a compact object orbiting
about 1E13 cm from the supergiant HD 74194. The clump mass loss rate is of the
order of 1E-6 solar mass/yr.
  Conclusions : Hard X-ray flares from SFXTs allow to probe the stellar winds
of massive stars, and could possibly be associated with wind perturbations due
to line-driven instabilities.

have an AGN which accounts for more than 10% of the infrared luminosity,

are generally in good agreement other measurements based in the mid-infrared
line ratios measured by Spitzer IRS, but lower than those derived from PAH
equivalent widths or the mid-infrared spectral slope. Our models determine the
mass of dense molecular gas via the extinction required to reproduce the SED.
Assuming that this mass is that traced by HCN, we reproduce the observed linear
relation between HCN and infrared luminosities found by Gao & Solomon. We also
find that the star formation efficiency, defined as the current star formation
rate per unit of dense molecular gas mass, is enhanced in the ULIRGs phase. If
the evolution of ULIRGs includes a phase in which an AGN contributes an
important fraction to the infrared luminosity, this phase should last an order
of magnitude less time than the starburst phase. Because the mass of dense
molecular gas which we derive is consistent with observations of the HCN
molecule,it should be possible to estimate the mass of dense, star-forming
molecular gas in such objects when molecular line data are not available.

simplified treatment of the effects of 22Ne sedimentation, this is done
self-consistently for the first time, using an up-to-date stellar evolutionary
code in which the diffusion equation is coupled with the full set of equations
of stellar evolution. Due the large neutron excess of 22Ne, this isotope
rapidly sediments in the interior of the white dwarf. Although we explore a
wide range of parameters, we find that using the most reasonable assumptions
concerning the diffusion coefficient and the physical state of the white dwarf
interior the delay introduced by the ensuing chemical differentation is minor
for a typical 0.6 Msun white dwarf. For more massive white dwarfs, say M_Wd
about 1.0 Msun, the delay turns out to be considerably larger. These results
are in qualitatively good accord with those obtained in previous studies, but
we find that the magnitude of the delay introduced by 22Ne sedimentation was
underestimated by a factor of about 2. We also perform a preliminary study of
the impact of 22Ne sedimentation on the white dwarf luminosity function.
Finally, we hypothesize as well on the possibility of detecting the
sedimentation of 22Ne using pulsating white dwarfs in the appropriate effective

of thousands of voxels during hundreds of sequential time points. One approach
towards illuminating the connection between fMRI and cognitive function is
through decoding; how do the time series of voxel activities combine to provide
information about internal and external experience? Here we seek models of fMRI
decoding which are balanced between the simplicity of their interpretation and
the effectiveness of their prediction. We use signals from a subject immersed
in virtual reality to compare global and local methods of prediction applying
both linear and nonlinear techniques of dimensionality reduction. We find that
the prediction of complex stimuli is remarkably low-dimensional, saturating
with less than 100 features. In particular, we build effective models based on
the decorrelated components of cognitive activity in the classically-defined
Brodmann areas. For some of the stimuli, the top predictive areas were
surprisingly transparent, including Wernicke's area for verbal instructions,
visual cortex for facial and body features, and visual-temporal regions for
velocity. Direct sensory experience resulted in the most robust predictions,
with the highest correlation ($c \sim 0.8$) between the predicted and
experienced time series of verbal instructions. Techniques based on non-linear
dimensionality reduction (Laplacian eigenmaps) performed similarly. The
interpretability and relative simplicity of our approach provides a conceptual

medium in the central parts of an elliptical host. In the framework of the
proposed model, we follow the evolution of ultrarelativistic electrons injected
from a terminal hotspot of a jet to expanding lobes, taking into account their
adiabatic energy losses as well as radiative cooling. This allows us to discuss
the broad-band lobe emission of young radio sources. In particular, we argue
that the observed spectral turnover in the radio synchrotron spectra of these
objects cannot originate from the synchrotron self-absorption process but is
most likely due to free-free absorption effects connected with neutral clouds
of interstellar medium engulfed by the expanding lobes and photoionized by
active centers. We also find a relatively strong and complex high-energy
emission component produced by inverse-Compton up-scattering of various
surrounding photon fields by the lobes' electrons. We argue that such high
energy radiation is strong enough to account for several observed properties of
GHz-peaked-spectrum (GPS) radio galaxies at UV and X-ray frequencies. In
addition, this emission is expected to extend up to GeV (or possibly even TeV)
photon energies and can thus be probed by several modern gamma-ray instruments.
In particular, we suggest that GPS radio galaxies should constitute a
relatively numerous class of extragalactic sources detected by GLAST.

standard candle data (ESSENCE+SNLS+HST from Davis et. al.). We find that, even
though both classes of data are consistent with LCDM at the 2\sigma level,
there is a systematic difference between the two classes of data. In
particular, we find that for practically all values of the parameters
(\Omega_0m,\Omega_b) in the 2\sigma range of the the 3-year WMAP data (WMAP3)
best fit, LCDM is significantly more consistent with the SnIa data than with
the CMB+BAO data. For example for (\Omega_0m,\Omega_b)=(0.24,0.042)
corresponding to the best fit values of WMAP3, the dark energy equation of
state parametrization w(z)=w_0 + w_1 (z/(1+z)) best fit is at a 0.5\sigma
distance from LCDM (w_0=-1,w_1=0) using the SnIa data and 1.7\sigma away from
LCDM using the CMB+BAO data. There is a similar trend in the earlier data (SNLS
vs CMB+BAO at z=0.35). This trend is such that the standard ruler CMB+BAO data
show a mild preference for crossing of the phantom divide line w=-1, while the
recent SnIa data favor LCDM. Despite of this mild difference in trends, we find
no statistically significant evidence for violation of the cosmic distance
duality relation \eta \equiv d_L(z)/(d_A(z) (1+z)^2)=1. For example, using a
prior of \Omega_0m=0.24, we find \eta=0.95 \pm 0.025 in the redshift range

an initial ~0.1-1 s spike of hard radiation followed, after a ~3-10 s lull in
emission, by a softer period of extended emission lasting ~10-100 s. In a few
well-studied cases, these ``short GRBs with extended emission'' show no
evidence for a bright associated supernova (SN). We propose that these events
are produced by the formation and early evolution of a highly magnetized,
rapidly rotating neutron star (a ``proto-magnetar'') which is formed from the
accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf (WD), the merger and collapse
of a WD-WD binary, or, perhaps, the merger of a double neutron star binary. The
initial emission spike is powered by accretion onto the proto-magnetar from a
small disk that is formed during the AIC or merger event. The extended emission
is produced by a relativistic wind that extracts the rotational energy of the
proto-magnetar on a timescale ~10-100 s. The ~3-10 s delay between the prompt
and extended emission is the time required for the newly-formed proto-magnetar
to cool sufficiently that the neutrino-heated wind from its surface becomes
ultra-relativistic. Because a proto-magnetar ejects little or no Ni56 (< 1e-3
M_sun), these events should not produce a bright SN-like transient. We model
the extended emission from GRB060614 using spin-down calculations of a cooling
proto-magnetar, finding reasonable agreement with observations for a magnetar
with an initial rotation period of ~1 ms and a surface dipole field of ~3e15 G.
If GRBs are indeed produced by AIC or WD-WD mergers, they should occur within a
mixture of both early and late-type galaxies and should not produce strong
gravitational wave emission. An additional consequence of our model is the
existence of X-ray flashes unaccompanied by a bright SN.

immune to action by a specific interaction, such as the well-known dark state
in a three-state lambda system. We here show that in a three-state loop
linkage, a Hilbert-space Householder reflection breaks the loop and presents
the linkage as a single chain. With certain conditions on the interaction
parameters, this chain can break into a simple two-state system and an
additional spectator state. Alternatively, a two-photon resonance condition in
this Householder-basis chain can be enforced, which heralds the existence of
another spectator state. These spectator states generalize the usual dark state
to include contributions from all three bare basis states and disclose hidden
population trapping effects, and hence hidden constants of motion. Insofar as a
spectator state simplifies the overall dynamics, its existence facilitates the
derivation of analytic solutions and the design of recipes for quantum state
engineering in the loop system. Moreover, it is shown that a suitable sequence
of Householder transformations can cast an arbitrary N-dimensional hermitian
Hamiltonian into a tridiagonal form. The implication is that a general N-state
system, with arbitrary linkage patterns where each state connects to any other
state, can be reduced to an equivalent chainwise-connected system, with
nearest-neighbor interactions only, with ensuing possibilities for discovering
hidden multidimensional spectator states and constants of motion.

proposed recently by the authors in \cite{Feng2}. In this approach, the second
order fully nonlinear Monge-Amp\`ere equation is approximated by the fourth
order quasilinear equation $-\epsilon\Delta^2 u^\epsilon + \det{D^2u^\epsilon}
=f$. It was proved in \cite{Feng1} that the solution $u^\epsilon$ converges to
the unique convex viscosity solution $u^0$ of the Dirichlet problem for the
Monge-Amp\`ere equation. This result then opens a door for constructing
convergent finite element methods for the fully nonlinear second order
equations, a task which has been impracticable before. The goal of this paper
is threefold. First, we develop a family of Hermann-Miyoshi type mixed finite
element methods for approximating the solution $u^\epsilon$ of the regularized
fourth order problem, which computes simultaneously $u^\vepsi$ and the moment
tensor $\sigma^\vepsi:=D^2u^\epsilon$. Second, we derive error estimates, which
track explicitly the dependence of the error constants on the parameter
$\vepsi$, for the errors $u^\epsilon-u^\epsilon_h$ and
$\sigma^\vepsi-\sigma_h^\vepsi$. Finally, we present a detailed numerical study
on the rates of convergence in terms of powers of $\vepsi$ for the error
$u^0-u_h^\vepsi$ and $\sigma^\vepsi-\sigma_h^\vepsi$, and numerically examine
what is the ""best"" mesh size $h$ in relation to $\vepsi$ in order to achieve
these rates.

  Theory"", ASP Conference Series, ed: H. Beuther et al",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The history of star formation in the strong gravitational potential of the
Galactic center has been of much interest, recently. We propose that the
sub-parsec-scale disk of massive stars orbiting the massive black hole at the
Galactic center can be interpreted in terms of partial accretion of extended
Galactic center clouds, such as the 50 \kms molecular cloud, as these clouds
envelop Sgr A* on their passage through the inner Galactic center. The loss of
angular momentum of the captured cloud material by self-interaction subsequent
to gravitationally focusing by Sgr A* naturally creates a compact gaseous disk
of material close to Sgr A* in which star formation takes place. On a larger
scale the formation of massive clusters such as the Arches and Quintuplet
clusters or on-going massive star formation such as Sgr B2 could also be
triggered by cloud-cloud collisions due to gravitational focusing in the deep
potential of the central bulge.
  Unlike the violent and high-pressure environment of clustered star formation
triggered by cloud-cloud collision, there are also isolated pockets of star
formation and quiescent dense clouds. These sites suggest an inefficient, slow
mode of star formation. We propose enhanced cosmic rays in the nuclear disk may
be responsible for inhibiting the process of star formation in this region. In
particular, we argue that the enhanced ionization rate due to the impact of
cosmic-ray particles is responsible for lowering the efficiency of on-going
star formation in the nuclear disk of our Galaxy. The higher ionization
fraction and higher thermal energy due to the impact of these electrons may
also reduce MHD wave damping which contributes to the persistence of the high
velocity dispersion of the molecular gas in the nuclear disk.

approach reveals a triangular structure in the quasi-energy band. Our analysis
of the corresponding Floquet states shows that this triangle signals the onset
of a localization phenomenon, which can be regarded as a generalization of the
well-known phenomenon called coherent destruction of tunneling. With the second
quantized model, we find also a triangular structure in the quantum

Monte-Carlo (QMC) analysis. However when the residual thermal excitation of the
strongly confined degree of freedom is taken into account, an excellent
agreement is reached between the MF and the QMC approaches. For the interaction
strength corresponding to the experiment, we predict a strong correction to the
critical atom number with respect to the ideal gas theory (factor $\sim 2$). A
quantitative agreement between theory and experiment is reached concerning the
critical atom number if the predicted density profiles are used for temperature
calibration.

In previous reports the appearance of magnetic moments was explained in a 2-D

  We study three high luminosity episodes, two of them at the system apoastron,
three brightening with lower intensity, two at the periastron, and one extended
period of intermediate luminosity spanning one orbital cycle. We perform timing
analysis to determine the pulse period and pulse profiles at different energy
ranges. We also analyze the broad band phase average spectrum of different
luminosity states and perform phase resolved spectroscopy for the first flare.
  From the timing analysis, we find a pulse period of ~297 s around MJD 53000
with a significant scatter around the mean value. From the spectral analysis we
find that the source emission can be described by an absorbed bremsstrahlung
model in which the electron temperature varies between ~25 and ~37 keV, without
any correlation to luminosity, and the intrinsic absorbing column is constantly
of the order of 10^23 cm^-2. Phase resolved spectral analysis evidences a
different temperature of the plasma in the ascending and descending edges of
the pulse during the first flare. This justifies the pulse maximum shift by
~0.4 phase units between 20 and 100 keV observed in the pulse profiles.
  The comparison with the previous period measurements reveals that the source
is currently spinning-down, in contrast to the long term secular trend observed
so far indicating that at least a temporary accretion disk is formed. The study
of the spectral property variations with respect to time and spin phase
suggests the presence of two emitting components at different temperatures
whose relative intensity varies with time.

of the metallic phase in metal-ammonia solutions (MAS). This behavior is mainly
controlled by the degenerate electron gas, which remains stable down to 5 MPM
due to high solvent polarizability and strong dielectric screening of solvated
ions. Comparing the behavior of the metallic state with those of localized
solvated electrons, we have estimated the miscibility gap $\Delta n$ for
various alkali metals and found $\Delta n$(Na)$> \Delta n($K$)$. It is rather
narrow in Rb-NH$_3$ and does not occur in Cs-NH$_3$ solutions, which is in full
agreement with the experiments. The case of Li is discussed separately. The
difference calculated in the excess free energies of the metallic and
nonmetallic phases is in the order of $k_BT$, yielding a thermally fluctuating
mixed state at intermediate metal concentrations. It results in a continuous
metal-nonmetal (MNM) transition above the consolute point $T_c$ and a phase
separation below $T_c$. We propose a criterion for the MNM transition which may
be attributed to the line of the maximum of compressibility above $T_c$. This
line crosses the spinodal one at the critical temperature. Finally, we assert
that a new electronic phase similar to microemulsion should also arise between
the spinodal and the binodal lines.

numerically for both non-trapping (NTIP) and trapping (TIP) invasion
percolation processes. Two different anisotropy quantifiers, the anisotropy
parameter and the asphericity are used for probing the degree of anisotropy of
clusters. We observe that in spite of the difference in scaling properties of
NTIP and TIP, there is no difference in the values of anisotropy quantifiers of
these processes. Furthermore, we find that in completely random media, the
invasion percolation clusters are on average slightly less isotropic than
standard percolation clusters. Introducing isotropic long-range correlations
into the media reduces the isotropy of the invasion percolation clusters. The
effect is more pronounced for the case of persisting long-range correlations.
The implication of boundary conditions on the shape of clusters is another
subject of interest. Compared to the case of free boundary conditions, IP
clusters of conventional rectangular geometry turn out to be more isotropic.
Moreover, we see that in conventional rectangular geometry the NTIP clusters
are more isotropic than TIP clusters.
