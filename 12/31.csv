bits such that each k of them are independent. In this paper we consider k-wise
independent distributions with identical marginals, each bit has probability p
to be 1. We address the following question: how high can the probability that
all the bits are 1 be, for such a distribution? For a wide range of the
parameters n,k and p we find an explicit lower bound for this probability which
matches an upper bound given by Benjamini et al., up to multiplicative factors
of lower order. The question we investigate can be seen as a relaxation of a
major open problem in error-correcting codes theory, namely, how large can a
linear error correcting code with given parameters be?
  The question is a type of discrete moment problem, and our approach is based
on showing that bounds obtained from the theory of the classical moment problem
provide good approximations for it. The main tool we use is a bound controlling
the change in the expectation of a polynomial after small perturbation of its
zeros.

star formation and the redder colours are a result of older RSF episodes, with
no measurable evidence of negative feedback from the AGN on the star formation

remarkably small dispersion around a spectral index of 0.62. This is also the
region where bright X-ray emission is detected. Further from the nucleus, the
spectral index flattens slightly to 0.50 - 0.55 and X-ray emission, although
still detectable, is fainter relative to the radio. The brightest X-ray
emission from the jets is therefore not associated with the flattest radio
spectra, but rather with some particle-acceleration process whose
characteristic energy index is 2.24. The change in spectral index occurs
roughly where our relativistic jet models require rapid deceleration.

locally transitive SL(2)-action on a normal affine three-dimensional variety X
is uniquely determined by a pair (p/q, r), where 0<p/q<=1 is an uncancelled
fraction and r is a positive integer. Here r is the order of the stabilizer of
a generic point. In this paper we show that the variety X is toric, i.e. admits
a locally transitive action of an algebraic torus, if and only if r is
divisible by q-p. To do this we prove the following necessary and sufficient
condition for an affine G/H-embedding to be toric. Suppose X is a normal affine
variety, G is a simply connected semisimple algebraic group acting regularly on
X, H is a closed subgroup of G such that the character group $\mathfrak{X}(H)$
is finite and G/H -> X is a dense open equivariant embedding. Then X is toric
if and only if there exist a quasitorus T and a $(G\times T)$-module V such
that $X\stackrel{G}{\cong} V//T$. The key role in the proof plays D. Cox's
construction.

perhaps beyond - 70 um imply dust temperatures T_dust <45-85 K for debris in
equilibrium with the stellar radiation field. We infer bulk properties such as
characteristic temperature, location, fractional luminosity, and mass of the
dust from fitted single temperature blackbody models. For >1/3 of the debris
sources we find that multiple temperature components are suggested, implying a
spatial distribution of dust extending over many tens of AU. Because the disks
are dominated by collisional processes, the parent body (planetesimal) belts
may be extended as well. Preliminary assessment of the statistics of cold
debris around sun-like stars shows that ~10% of FEPS targets with masses
between 0.6 and 1.8 Msun and ages between 30 Myr and 3 Gyr exhibit 70 um
emission in excess of the expected photospheric flux density. We find that
fractional excess amplitudes appear higher for younger stars and that there may
be a trend in 70 um excess frequency with stellar mass.

metallicity is detected in two of these systems, with [Zn/H]=-0.05\pm0.12 and
[Zn/H]>+0.86. The latter system is however a weak system with N(H I)<18.8, and
therefore may need significant ionisation corrections to the abundances. Fe II
lines were detected in all systems, with an average Fe abundance of
<[Fe/H]>=-0.68, higher than typical Fe abundances for DLA systems at these
redshifts. This high mean [Fe/H] could be due to less depletion of Fe onto dust
grains, or to higher abundances in these systems. We also discuss the relative
abundances in these absorbers. The systems with high metallicity show high
ratios of [Mn/Fe] and [Zn/Fe], as seen previously in another sub-DLA. These
higher values of [Mn/Fe] could be a result of heavy depletion of Fe onto

system of nodes and springs and as a product of one-dimensional continua
(represented by graphs), and the grammars describe how these continua transform
during the process of optimal complex construction. The simplest case of a
topological grammar (``add a node'', ``bisect an edge'') is equivalent to the
construction of ``principal trees'', an object useful in many practical
applications. We demonstrate how it can be applied to the analysis of bacterial

radiation of the (3+1)-dimensional charged rotating black strings and their
higher dimensional extensions in anti-de Sitter spacetimes, whose horizons are
not spherical but can be toroidal, cylindrical or planar, according to their
global identifications. It should be emphasized that our analysis presented
here is very general in the sense that the determinant of the reduced
(1+1)-dimensional effective metric from these black strings need not be equal
to one $(\sqrt{-g} \neq 1)$. Our results indicate that the gauge and energy
momentum fluxes needed to cancel the (1+1)-dimensional covariant gauge and
gravitational anomalies are compatible with the Hawking fluxes. Besides,
thermodynamics of these black strings are studied in the case of a variable
cosmological constant.

under a wide high pressure range. The ice X phase (up to 380GPa), the
theoretical proposed higher pressure phase ice XV (300GPa), as well as the
ambient pressure low-temperature phase ice XI are involved. Our results show
that the dispersion relations of optical properties of ice under high pressure
are quite different from those under ambient pressure. Under higher pressure,
there is whole tendency of blue shift in all optical properties of ice, and the
energy region for optical response become broader, such as the absorption band
and reflection band. In addition to the augmented absorption edge, all
absorption peaks are found to be rising, and the reflection peaks are also
enhanced a bit; hence the transmissivity of ice is inferred to be dropping. The
photoconductivity is enhanced, and we explain this behavior from the increase
of earner density. The static optical properties are found to be pressure
independent, and principally due to the network topology of hydrogen bonding.

its spin dynamics and magnetic state at low temperatures. Although there exists
only one crystallographic site for Ga in NiGa$_2$S$_4$, we found two distinct
Ga signals by NMR and NQR. The origin of the two Ga signals is not fully
understood, but possibly due to stacking faults along the c axis which induce
additional broad Ga NMR and NQR signals with different local symmetries. We
found the novel spin freezing occurring at $T_{\rm f}$, at which the specific
heat shows a maximum, from a clear divergent behavior of the nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_{1}$ and nuclear spin-spin relaxation rate
$1/T_{2}$ measured by Ga-NQR as well as the muon spin relaxation rate
$\lambda$. The main sharp NQR peaks exhibit a stronger tendency of divergence,
compared with the weak broader spectral peaks, indicating that the spin
freezing is intrinsic in NiGa$_2$S$_4$. The behavior of these relaxation rates
strongly suggests that the Ni spin fluctuations slow down towards $T_{\rm f}$,
and the temperature range of the divergence is anomalously wider than that in a
conventional magnetic ordering. A broad structureless spectrum and
multi-component $T_1$ were observed below 2 K, indicating that a static
magnetic state with incommensurate magnetic correlations or inhomogeneously
distributed moments is realized at low temperatures. However, the wide
temperature region between 2 K and $T_{\rm f}$, where the NQR signal was not
observed, suggests that the Ni spins do not freeze immediately below $T_{\rm
f}$, but keep fluctuating down to 2 K with the MHz frequency range.

  Conf. Ser., eds. J. G. Funes and E. M. Corsini",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The extreme outer Galaxy (EOG) has a very different environment from that in
the solar neighborhood, with low metallicity (less than -0.5 dex), much lower
gas density, and small or no perturbation from spiral arms. The EOG is an
excellent laboratory for the study of the star formation processes that
happened during the formation period of the Galaxy. In particular, the study of
the EOG may shed light on the origin and role of the thick disk, whose
metallicity range matches well with that of the EOG. We show an example of a
molecular cloud in the EOG (Digel's Cloud 2), which is located at R_g ~ 20 kpc
beyond the Outer arm. Based on our NIR and 12CO data as well as HI, radio
continuum, and IRAS data in the archives, we examined the detailed star
formation processes in this unique environment, especially the supernova
triggered star formation, which should have been the major star formation mode
during the halo and thick disk formation.

degenerate scenario, taking account of the metallicity dependences of the white
dwarf (WD) wind and the mass-stripping effect on the binary companion star. Our
model naturally predicts that the SN Ia lifetime distribution spans a range of
0.1-20 Gyr with the double peaks at ~0.1 and 1 Gyr. While the present SN Ia
rate in elliptical galaxies can be reproduced with the old population of the
red-giants+WD systems, the large SN Ia rate in radio galaxies could be
explained with the young population of the main-sequence+WD systems. Because of
the metallicity effect, i.e., because of the lack of winds from WDs in the
binary systems, the SN Ia rate in the systems with [Fe/H]<-1, e.g., high-z
spiral galaxies, is supposed to be very small. Our SN Ia model can give better
reproduction of the [(alpha, Mn, Zn)/Fe]-[Fe/H] relations in the solar
neighborhood than other models such as the double-degenerate scenario. The
metallicity effect is more strongly required in the presence of the young
population of SNe Ia. We also succeed in reproducing the galactic supernova
rates with their dependence on the morphological type of galaxies, and the
cosmic SN Ia rate history with a peak at z~1. At z>1, the predicted SN Ia rate
decreases toward higher redshifts and SNe Ia will be observed only in the
systems that have evolved with a short timescale of chemical enrichment. This
suggests that the evolution effect in the supernova cosmology can be small.

manifold. We introduce an energy functional over the cone, and use its critical
points to single out the strongly extremal Reeb vectors fields. Should one such
vector field be a member of the extremal set, the scalar curvature of a Sasaki
extremal metric representing it would have the smallest $L^2$-norm among all
Sasakian metrics of fixed volume that can represent vector fields in the cone.
We use links of isolated hypersurface singularities to produce examples of
manifolds of Sasaki type, many of these in dimension five, whose Sasaki cone
coincides with the extremal set, and examples where the extremal set is empty.
We end up by proving that a conjecture of Orlik concerning the torsion of the
homology groups of these links holds in the five dimensional case.

within a nonlinear chiral Lagrangian framework is briefly presented. Two scalar
meson nonets are introduced to explore the mass spectrum and decay properties
of the $I$=1/2 and $I$=1 scalar states. For the $I$=0 states, in addition to
these two nonets a scalar glueball component is also taken into account, and
together with the constraints from the $I$=1/2 and $I$=1 sectors, their mass
spectrum is studied. The fact that an ideally mixed $q {\bar q}$ scalar nonet
has a mass ordering which is opposite to that of an ideally mixed four-quark
scalar nonet is exploited to gain some insight into the quark substructure of
the $I$=1/2, $I$=1 and $I$=0 states below and above 1 GeV. Consequently,
numerical estimates of various components of these states (two quark and four
quark components of $I$=1/2 and $I$=1 states, and two quark, four quark and
glue component of $I$=0 states) are determined.

range, including the ice X phase (55-380GPa), the previous theoretically
proposed higher-pressure phase ice XIIIM (Refs. 1-2) (380GPa), ice XV (a new
structure we derived from ice XIIIM) (300-380GPa), as well as the ambient
pressure low-temperature phase ice XI. Different from many other materials, the
band gap of ice X is found to be increasing linearly with pressure from 55GPa
up to 290GPa, the electronic density of states (DOS) shows that the valence
bands have a tendency of red shift (move to lower energies) referring to the
Fermi energy while the conduction bands have a blue shift (move to higher
energies). This behavior is interpreted as the high pressure induced change of
s-p charge transfers between hydrogen and oxygen. It is found that ice X exists
in the pressure range from 75GPa to about 290GPa. Beyond 300GPa, a new
hydrogen-bonding structure with 50% hydrogen atoms in symmetric positions in
O-H-O bonds and the other half being asymmetric, ice XV, is identified. The
physical mechanism for this broken symmetry in hydrogen bonding is revealed.
