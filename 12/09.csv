interpret the complex dependence of resistance on temperature, magnetic field,

negative magnetoresistance results from the orbital weak localization effect.
The resistance maximum and the associated negative magnetoresistance near the
Curie temperature are assigned to the destructive influence of preformed

disorder-modified carrier-carrier interactions. These interactions account also
for the low-temperature increase of resistance. Furthermore, the sensitivity of

catalogue, it was proposed to overscale distances in such an ''artificial'' way
that the concentration of galaxies was varying as with increase of the distance
a power-behaved function with the same exponent beta as for the full
homogeneous catalogue. Various parameters of clustering were taking into
account: alpha (0.01, 0.1, 1%) as the part of galaxies, which have the relative
volume of a Voronoi's cell smaller than the critical one for the random
distribution; beta = 0, which fits to the random galaxy distribution; beta =
0.7, which is close to the pancake galaxy distribution. It is revealed that
Voronoi's tessellation method depends weakly on beta-parameter, and the number
of galaxies in rich structures is growing rather than in poor ones with
increase of alpha-parameter. The comparison of the groups derived with the
groups obtained by Karachentsev's dynamical method shows that the number of
groups, which coincides by all the components, is 22%. As a whole, the
dynamical method is more preferred for identifying sparsely populated galaxy

the rescaled eigenvalue ODE for the set of all shock waves, augmented with the

temperature regime T > 40 K where the broad maximum of ZFC curve (at T = Tmax)
is associated with the blocking of core particle moments, whereas the sharp
maximum (at T = TS) is related to the freezing of surface (shell) spins. The
unusual shape of M (H) loop at T = 1.5 K, temperature dependent feature of
coercive field and remanent magnetization give a strong support of surface spin
freezing that are occurring at lower temperature regime (T < 40 K) in this LCMO
nanoparticles. Additionally, waiting time (tw) dependence of ZFC relaxation
measurements at T = 50 K show weak dependence of relaxation rate [S(t)] on tw
and dM/dln(t) following a logarithmic variation on time. Both of these features
strongly support the high temperature regime to be associated with the blocking
of core moments. At T = 20 K, ZFC relaxation measurements indicates the
existence of two different types of relaxation processes in the sample with
S(t) attaining a maximum at the elapsed time very close to the wait time tw =
1000 sec, which is an unequivocal sign of glassy behavior. This age-dependent

X-ray source that is astrometrically coincident with a faint 8.5-GHz source.
The latter has a diameter less than 0.3 arcsec (26 pc for NGC 4621, 17 pc for

structure of the neutral curve becomes very irregular and possibly fractal,
while individual trajectories within the unstable region become highly complex
and possibly chaotic, as the atmosphere-ocean coupling $\kappa$ increases. In
the unstable regime, spontaneous transitions occur in the mean ``temperature''
({\it i.e.}, thermocline depth), period, and extreme annual values, for purely
periodic, seasonal forcing. The model reproduces the Devil's bleachers
characterizing other ENSO models, such as nonlinear, coupled systems of partial
differential equations; some of the features of this behavior have been
documented in general circulation models, as well as in observations. We
expect, therefore, similar behavior in much more detailed and realistic models,
where it is harder to describe its causes as completely.

  Stellar Mass Tully-Fisher Relation","12 pages, MNRAS, submitted",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Recent observations of distant disk galaxies show that there is little to no
evolution in the relation between maximum rotation speed and stellar mass at z
< 1.2. There is however a significant scatter between these two quantities
whose origin is uncertain. We show in this paper that this scatter is at least
partially the result of galaxy merging, revealing that disk galaxy growth at z
< 1 is fundamentally hierarchical. We carry this out by calculating CAS
(concentration, asymmetry, clumpiness) structural parameters using archival
Hubble Space Telescope imaging of 91 high-redshift disk galaxies at 0.4 < z <
1.0 with robustly measured stellar masses and rotational maximum velocities
taken from Conselice et al. (2005). We separate our sample into two redshift
bins divided at z = 0.7, and investigate deviations from the stellar-mass
Tully-Fisher relation in both the M_* and V_max directions, and how these
correlate with structural asymmetries. We find a significant (> 3 sigma)
correlation between the residuals from the stellar-mass Tully-Fisher relation
in both the M_* and V_max directions, and high asymmetries. This result holds
after we remove contributions from star formation and edge-on galaxies which
can produce higher asymmetries unrelated to merging. While there are a few
cases in which our disk galaxies have very large asymmetries, and are
potentially involved in major mergers, in general these asymmetries are smaller
than the major merger limit. It is therefore likely that these galaxies are
forming hierarchically through minor galaxy mergers, which is also suggested by
the constant slope and zero point of the stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation
during the same epoch.

what they called ""Reality Criterion"" imply that quantum mechanics cannot be
complete. That is, there must exist some elements of reality that are not
described by quantum mechanics. There must be, they concluded, a more complete
description of physical reality behind quantum mechanics. There must be a
state, a hidden variable, characterizing the state of affairs in the world in
more details than the quantum mechanical state, something that also reflects
the missing elements of reality.
  Under some further but quite plausible assumptions, this conclusion implies
that in some spin-correlation experiments the measured quantum mechanical
probabilities should satisfy particular inequalities (Bell-type inequalities).
The paradox consists in the fact that quantum probabilities do not satisfy
these inequalities. And this paradoxical fact has been confirmed by several
laboratory experiments in the last three decades. The problem is still open and
hotly debated among both physicists and philosophers. It has motivated a wide
range of research from the most fundamental quantum mechanical experiments

spectrum of DG Tau itself. We combine our new ACIS-S data with a data set
previously obtained. The data are superimposed to obtain flux and hardness
images. Separate X-ray spectra are extracted for DG Tau and areas outside its
point spread function. We detect a prominent X-ray jet at a position angle of
PA ~225 deg (tentatively suggested by Guedel et al. 2005), coincident with the
optical jet axis. We also identify a counter jet at PA = 45 deg. The X-ray jets
are detected out to a distance of ~5"" from the star, their sources being
extended at the ACIS-S resolution. The jet spectra are soft, with a best-fit
electron temperature of 3.4 MK. We find evidence for excess absorption of the
counter jet. The spectrum of the DG Tau point source shows two components with
largely different temperatures and absorption column densities. The similar
temperatures and small absorbing gas columns of the jet sources and the soft
component of the ""stellar"" source suggest that these sources are related,
produced either by shocks or by magnetic heating in the jets. Cooling estimates
suggest that the pressure in the hot gas contributes to jet expansion. The hard
""stellar"" component, on the other hand, is associated with a stellar corona or
magnetosphere. The excessive photoelectric absorption of this component
suggests the presence of dust-depleted accretion streams above coronal magnetic

initially stay away from the hard edge at $x = 0$, but at a certain critical

modulation in the average spectra for the 6 different nights we analysed.

range are generated within supersymmetric gauge extensions of the Standard
Model with a generalized supersymmetry breaking sector. If the usual
superpotential Yukawa couplings are forbidden by the additional gauge symmetry
(such as a U(1)'), effective Dirac mass terms involving the ""wrong Higgs"" field
can arise either at tree level due to hard supersymmetry breaking fermion
Yukawa couplings, or at one-loop due to nonanalytic or ""nonholomorphic"" soft
supersymmetry breaking trilinear scalar couplings. As both of these operators
are naturally suppressed in generic models of supersymmetry breaking, the
resulting neutrino masses are naturally in the sub-eV range. The neutrino
magnetic and electric dipole moments resulting from the radiative mechanism
also vanish at one-loop order.

conditions give a system of stochastic PDEs for the evolution of the implied

fixing a strike $K$ and varying $T$. In order to give conditions to prove an
existence-and-uniqueness result for the solution of the system it is here
expressed in terms of the square root of the forward implied volatility and
rewritten in an Hilbert space setting. The existence and the uniqueness for the

surface-emitting semiconductor lasers that use surface plasmons to provide
optical mode confinement in cavities which have dimensions in the 100-300 nm
range. The proposed laser cavities are in many ways nanoscale optical versions
of micropatch antennas that are commonly used at microwave/RF frequencies.
Surface plasmons are not only used for mode confinement but also for output
beam shaping to realize single-lobe far-field radiation patterns with narrow
beam waists from subwavelength size cavities. We identify the cavity modes with
the largest quality factors and modal gain, and show that in the near-IR
wavelength range (1.0-1.6 microns) cavity losses (including surface plasmon
losses) can be compensated by the strong mode confinement in the gain region
provided by the surface plasmons themselves and the required material threshold
gain values can be smaller than 700 1/cm.
