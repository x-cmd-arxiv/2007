contains a noisy background component due to non-specific binding. This paper
presents a physical model for background estimation in Affymetrix Genechips. It
combines two different approaches. The first is based on the sequence
composition, specifically its sequence dependent hybridization affinity. The
second is based on the strong correlation of intensities from locations which
are the physical neighbors of a specific spot on the chip. Both effects are
incorporated in a background functional which contains 24 free parameters,
fixed by minimization on a training data set. In all data analyzed the sequence
specific parameters, obtained by minimization, are found to strongly correlate
with empirically determined stacking free energies for RNA/DNA hybridization in
solution. Moreover, there is an overall agreement with experimental background
data and we show that the physics-based model proposed in this paper performs
on average better than purely statistical approaches for background
calculations. The model thus provides an interesting alternative method for
background subtraction schemes in Affymetrix Genechips.

suffers from several fine-tuning problems, e.g. the mu-problem and the problem
of proton decay through higher dimension operators. Both of these problems can
be avoided by replacing R-parity with a non-anomalous U(1)' gauge symmetry
which is broken at the TeV scale. The new gauge symmetry does not necessarily
forbid all renormalizable R-parity violating interactions among the MSSM
fields, and may allow for either lepton number or baryon number violation at
the renormalizable level. However, the proton decay problem resurfaces with the
introduction of new TeV-scale exotic fields which are required for gauge
anomaly cancellations. In this paper we investigate the issue of proton
stability in the presence of TeV-scale exotics. We show that there are large
classes of models in which TeV exotics do not destabilize the proton. We
classify the viable models according to the residual discrete symmetries after
U(1)' and electroweak symmetry breaking. In some of our examples the residual
U(1)' discrete gauge symmetry within the MSSM sector alone ensures that the
proton is absolutely stable, for any exotic representations. In other cases the
proton can be sufficiently long-lived, depending on the U(1)' and hypercharge
discrete charge assignments for the exotic fields. Our analysis outlines a
general scheme for ensuring proton stability in the presence of light exotics
with baryon and lepton number violating interactions.

GUT-scale parameters need not be finely tuned in order to predict the correct
value of the Z boson mass at low scales is the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model (NMSSM). However, in order that fine tuning be absent, the
lightest CP-even Higgs boson h should have mass ~100 GeV and SM couplings to
gauge bosons and fermions. The only way that this can be consistent with LEP
limits is if h decays primarily via h->aa->4 tau or 4j but not 4b, where a is
the lighter of the two pseudo-scalar Higgses that are present in the NMSSM.
Interestingly, m_a < 2 m_b is natural in the NMSSM with m_a > 2 m_tau somewhat
preferred. Thus, h -> 4 tau becomes a key mode of interest. Meanwhile, all
other Higgs bosons of the NMSSM are typically quite heavy. Detection of any of
the NMSSM Higgs bosons at the LHC in this preferred scenario will be very
challenging using conventional channels. In this paper, we demonstrate that the
h -> aa -> 4 tau decay chain should be visible if the Higgs is produced in the
process pp -> p+h+p with the final state protons being measured using suitably
installed forward detectors. Moreover, we show that the mass of both the h and

from this sector are related to five master graphs which ought to be calculable
by the method of partial integration. The remaining supergraph is argued to be
vanishing or finite; a numerical treatment should be possible. The number of
numerator terms remains small even if a further four-loop sector is included.
There is no need for infrared rearrangements.

among the possible models for their origin. Therefore an unbiased and
exhaustive investigation in this direction is crucial.
  Methods. With this goal in mind in this paper we revise the occurrence of
radio halos in the redshift range 0-0.4, combining the low redshift (z<0.2)
statistical study of XBACs clusters with the NVSS (by Giovannini et al. 1999)
with our recent results from the radio follow up of REFLEX and eBCS clusters,
the GMRT radio halo survey, at higher redshift (0.2<z<0.4).
  Results. We find a significant statistical evidence (at 3.7 sigma) of an
increase of the fraction of clusters with Radio Halos with the X-ray luminosity
(mass) of the parent clusters and show that this increase is in line with
statistical calculations based on the re-acceleration scenario. We argue that a
fundamental expectation of this scenario is that the probability to have radio
halos emitting at hundred MHz is larger than that at GHz frequencies and thus
that future radio interferometers operating at low frequencies, such as LOFAR
and LWA, should detect a larger number of radio halos with respect to that
caught by present GHz observations. We also show that the expected increase of
the fraction of clusters with radio halos with the cluster mass as measured
with future LOFAR and LWA surveys should be less strong than that in present
surveys.

evolution of the wavelet formalism developed by Antoine & Vandergheynst (1999)
and Wiaux et al. (2005). The translations of the wavelets at any point on the
sphere and their proper rotations are still defined through the continuous
three-dimensional rotations. The dilations of the wavelets are directly defined
in harmonic space through a new kernel dilation, which is a modification of an
existing harmonic dilation. A family of factorized steerable functions with
compact harmonic support which are suitable for this kernel dilation is firstly
identified. A scale discretized wavelet formalism is then derived, relying on
this dilation. The discrete nature of the analysis scales allows the exact
reconstruction of band-limited signals. A corresponding exact multi-resolution
algorithm is finally described and an implementation is tested. The formalism
is of interest notably for the denoising or the deconvolution of signals on the
sphere with a sparse expansion in wavelets. In astrophysics, it finds a
particular application for the identification of localized directional features
in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, such as the imprint of
topological defects, in particular cosmic strings, and for their reconstruction
after separation from the other signal components.

spacetimes with compactified extra dimensions. We refer to these regulators as
the ``extended hard cutoff'' (EHC) and ``extended dimensional regularization''
(EDR). Although based on traditional four-dimensional regulators, the key new
feature of these higher-dimensional regulators is that they are specifically
designed to handle mixed spacetimes in which some dimensions are infinitely
large and others are compactified. Moreover, unlike most other regulators which
have been used in the extra-dimension literature, these regulators are designed
to respect the original higher-dimensional Lorentz and gauge symmetries that
exist prior to compactification, and not merely the four-dimensional symmetries
which remain afterward. This distinction is particularly relevant for
calculations of the physics of the excited Kaluza-Klein modes themselves, and
not merely their radiative effects on zero modes. By respecting the full
higher-dimensional symmetries, our regulators avoid the introduction of
spurious terms which would not have been easy to disentangle from the physical
effects of compactification. As part of our work, we also derive a number of
ancillary results. For example, we demonstrate that in a gauge-invariant
theory, analogues of the Ward-Takahashi identity hold not only for the usual
zero-mode (four-dimensional) photons, but for all excited Kaluza-Klein photons
as well.

  Journal","Astrophys.J. 676:335,2008","10.1086/528924",,"astro-ph",,"  We present an analysis of a pair of Suzaku spectra of the soft X-ray
background (SXRB), obtained from pointings on and off a nearby shadowing
filament in the southern Galactic hemisphere. Because of the different Galactic
column densities in the two pointing directions, the observed emission from the
Galactic halo has a different shape in the two spectra. We make use of this
difference when modeling the spectra to separate the absorbed halo emission
from the unabsorbed foreground emission from the Local Bubble (LB). The
temperatures and emission measures we obtain are significantly different from
those determined from an earlier analysis of XMM-Newton spectra from the same
pointing directions. We attribute this difference to the presence of previously
unrecognized solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) contamination in the XMM-Newton
spectra, possibly due to a localized enhancement in the solar wind moving
across the line of sight. Contemporaneous solar wind data from ACE show nothing
unusual during the course of the XMM-Newton observations. Our results therefore
suggest that simply examining contemporaneous solar wind data might be
inadequate for determining if a spectrum of the SXRB is contaminated by SWCX
emission. If our Suzaku spectra are not badly contaminated by SWCX emission,
our best-fitting LB model gives a temperature of log T = 5.98 +0.03/-0.04 and a
pressure of p/k = 13,100-16,100 cm^-3 K. These values are lower than those
obtained from other recent observations of the LB, suggesting the LB may not be
isothermal and may not be in pressure equilibrium. Our halo modeling,
meanwhile, suggests that neon may be enhanced relative to oxygen and iron,
possibly because oxygen and iron are partly in dust.

follow the propagation of an I-front into a uniform IGM, and compute its
thickness for a range of possible quasar spectra and ages. We also explore the
effects of uniform and non-uniform ionizing backgrounds. We find that even for
hard spectra, the fronts are initially thin, with a thickness much smaller than
the mean free path of ionizing photons, but the thickness increases as the
front approaches equilibrium in 10^8 - 10^9 years, and can eventually
significantly exceed simple estimates based on the mean free path. With a high
intrinsic hydrogen column density obscuring the source (log(N_H/cm^-2) >~ 19.2)

dlog(F_\nu)/dlog(\nu) >~ -1.2 at log(N_H/cm^-2) >~ 18.0), the thickness of the

most of their ionizing photons up to ~40 eV. For obscured sources with

non-equilibrium, coherent oscillations of the order parameter. The integrable
and non-linear nature of the equations of motions makes this operating regime
particularly rich in potential applications, such as quantum modulation and

two. From a mathematical point of view, such systems can be described using the

particularly useful, since it allows a direct application of the known

constraints with data from galaxy redshift surveys. We investigate such an

statistics using a semi-analytic model derived from the Millennium Simulation.
We compare clustering statistics from original SAM galaxy samples and shuffled
ones with environmental influence on galaxy properties eliminated. Among the
luminosity-threshold samples examined, the one with the lowest threshold
luminosity (~0.2L_*) is affected by environmental effects the most, which has a
~10% decrease in the real-space two-point correlation function (2PCF) after
shuffling. By decomposing the 2PCF into five different components based on the
source of pairs, we show that the change in the 2PCF can be explained by the
age and richness dependence of halo clustering. The 2PCFs in redshift space are
found to change in a similar manner after shuffling. If the environmental
effects are neglected, halo occupation distribution modeling of the real-space
and redshift-space clustering may have a less than 6.5% systematic uncertainty
in constraining beta from the most affected SAM sample and have substantially
smaller uncertainties from the other, more luminous samples. We argue that the
effect could be even smaller in reality. In the Appendix, we present a method
to decompose the 2PCF, which can be applied to measure the two-point
auto-correlation functions of galaxy sub-samples in a volume-limited galaxy

of ~1000 galaxies with ultraviolet (UV) through infrared (IR) photometry from
GALEX, SDSS, and Spitzer and optical spectroscopy from SDSS. The ratio of IR to
UV emission (IRX) is used to constrain the dust attenuation in galaxies. We use
the 4000A break as a robust and useful, although coarse, indicator of star
formation history (SFH). We examine the relationship between IRX and the UV
spectral slope (a common attenuation indicator at high-redshift) and find
little dependence of the scatter on 4000A break strength. We construct average
UV through far-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for different ranges of
IRX, 4000A break strength, and stellar mass (M_*) to show the variation of the
entire SED with these parameters. When binned simultaneously by IRX, 4000A
break strength, and M_* these SEDs allow us to determine a low resolution
average attenuation curve for different ranges of M_*. The attenuation curves
thus derived are consistent with a lambda^{-0.7} attenuation law, and we find
no significant variations with M_*. Finally, we show the relationship between
IRX and the global stellar mass surface density and gas-phase-metallicity.
Among star forming galaxies we find a strong correlation between IRX and
stellar mass surface density, even at constant metallicity, a result that is
closely linked to the well-known correlation between IRX and star-formation
rate.

inhomogeneity in addition to the strong vertical stratification associated with
the near-surface layers. Keeping in mind that the aim of this effort is to
understand and characterize linear MHD interactions, we discuss a means of
computing statically consistent background states. Power maps computed from
simulations of waves interacting with thick flux tubes of peak photospheric
field strengths 600 G and 3000 G are presented. Strong modal power reduction in
the `umbral' regions of the flux tube enveloped by a halo of increased wave
power are seen in the simulations with the thick flux tubes. These enhancements
are also seen in Doppler velocity power maps of active regions observed in the
Sun, leading us to propose that the halo has MHD underpinnings.

semilocal Abelian Higgs model with a global $\mathbf{SU}(2)$ invariance. This
model can be viewed as the Weinberg-Salam theory in the limit where the
non-Abelian gauge field decouples, or as a two component Ginzburg-Landau
theory. The twisted vortices are characterized by a constant global current
${\cal I}$, and for ${\cal I}\to 0$ they reduce to the semilocal strings, that
is to the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices embedded into the semilocal model.
Solutions with ${\cal I}\neq 0$ are more complex and, in particular, they are
{\it less energetic} than the semilocal strings, which makes one hope that they
could have better stability properties. We consider the generic field
fluctuations around the twisted vortex within the linear perturbation theory
and apply the Jacobi criterion to test the existence of the negative modes in
the spectrum of the fluctuation operator. We find that twisted vortices do not
have the homogeneous instability known for the semilocal strings, neither do
they have inhomogeneous instabilities whose wavelength is less than a certain
critical value. This implies that short enough vortex pieces are perturbatively
stable and suggests that small vortex loops could perhaps be stable as well.
For longer wavelength perturbations there is exactly one negative mode in the
spectrum whose growth entails a segmentation of the uniform vortex into a
non-uniform, `sausage like' structure. This instability is qualitatively
similar to the hydrodynamical Plateau-Rayleigh instability of a water jet or to
the Gregory-Laflamme instability of black strings in the theory of gravity in
higher dimensions.

theoretically by analyzing exactly solvable discrete-state ``burnt-bridge''
models. Molecular motors are viewed as diffusing particles that can
asymmetrically break or rebuild periodically distributed weak links when
passing over them. Our explicit calculations of dynamic properties show that
coupling the transport of the unbiased molecular motor with the bridge-burning
mechanism leads to a directed motion that lowers fluctuations and produces a
dynamic transition in the limit of low concentration of weak links. Interaction
between the backward biased molecular motor and the bridge-burning mechanism
yields a complex dynamic behavior. For the reversible dissociation the backward
motion of the molecular motor is slowed down. There is a change in the
direction of the molecular motor's motion for some range of parameters. The
molecular motor also experiences non-monotonic fluctuations due to the action
of two opposing mechanisms: the reduced activity after the burned sites and
locking of large fluctuations. Large spatial fluctuations are observed when two
mechanisms are comparable. The properties of the molecular motor are different
for the irreversible burning of bridges where the velocity and fluctuations are
suppressed for some concentration range, and the dynamic transition is also
observed. Dynamics of the system is discussed in terms of the effective driving

compact drop stabilized primarily by rotation, and the other to an elongated
drop stabilized primarily by capillary forces. Here we explore consequences of
the drop bistability for the dynamics of highly viscous drops. Using both
boundary-integral simulations and small-deformation theory we show that a
quasi-static change of the flow vorticity gives rise to a hysteretic response
of the drop shape, with rapid changes between the compact and elongated
solutions at critical values of the vorticity. In flows with sinusoidal
temporal variation of the vorticity we find chaotic drop dynamics in response
to the periodic forcing. A cascade of period-doubling bifurcations is found to
be directly responsible for the transition to chaos. In random flows we obtain
a bimodal drop-length distribution. Some analogies with the dynamics of
macromolecules and vesicles are pointed out.

the phenomenon of consciousness is considered. A mathematical model is proposed
for the principal feature of consciousness assumed in EEC, namely its ability
(in the state of sleep, trance or meditation, when the explicit consciousness
is disabled) to obtain information from all alternative classical realities
(Everett's worlds) and select the favorable realities. To represent this
ability, a mathematical operation called postcorrection is introduced, which
corrects the present state to guarantee certain characteristics of the future
state. Evolution of living matter is thus determined by goals (first of all by
the goal of survival) as well as by causes. The resulting theory, in a way
symmetrical in time direction, follows from a sort of antropic principle.
Possible criteria for postcorrection and corresponding phenomena in the sphere
of life are classified. Both individual and collective criteria of survival are
considered as well as the criteria providing certain quality of life and those
which are irrelevant to the life quality. The phenomena of free will and direct
sighting of truth (e.g. scientific insight) are explained in these terms. The
problem of artificial intellect and the role of brain look differently in the
framework of this theory. Automats may perform intellectual operations, but not
postcorrection, therefore artificial intellect but not an artificial life can
be created. The brain serves as an interface between the body and
consciousness, but the most profound level of consciousness is not a function
of brain.

Spitzer photometric redshifts, we show that at least a third of the

the high-redshift reversal of the local star formation - galaxy density
relation. We derive the dust-shrouded cosmic star formation history of galaxies

Msun, this peaks at lower redshifts than the ostensible z~2.2 maximum for submm

formation. Our surveys are also consistent with ``downsizing'' in mass
assembly. Both the mean star formation rates <dM/dt> and specific star

difference is the existence of a nontrivial dilaton configuration in the D3-D7

spheres as an expansion parameter. The exact single particle $t$-operator for
partially absorbing boundary condition is used to obtain a closed form

$D(t)=5 a^2/(12 f D_{0} t) +O((D_0t/a^2)^{-2})$, to the first order of

observational data in the mass-luminosity plane or the

developed, with which each data point can have its own due contribution.
Previous studies have shown that there exists a plateau feature in the

observational luminosity function, we find by fitting the observational data
using our weight assigning scheme that the plateau spans from 0.28 to 0.50

calculations well account for the experimental data for the neutron number
dependence of binding energy, two neutrons separation energy, and odd-even mass
staggering of these isotopes. This result suggests that by introducing the
isovector term in the pairing interaction, one can construct a global effective
pairing interaction which is applicable to nuclei in a wide range of the
nuclear chart. It is also shown with the local density approximation (LDA) that
the pairing field deduced from the pairing gaps in infinite matter reproduces
qualitatively well the pairing field for finite nuclei obtained with the HFB
method.

using field-theoretic and replica methods. Charge disorder is assumed to be
confined to macroion surfaces surrounded by a cloud of mobile neutralizing
counterions in an aqueous solvent. A general formalism is developed by assuming
that the disorder is partially annealed (with purely annealed and purely
quenched disorder included as special cases), i.e., we assume in general that
the disorder undergoes a slow dynamics relative to fast-relaxing counterions
making it possible thus to study the stationary-state properties of the system
using methods similar to those available in equilibrium statistical mechanics.
By focusing on the specific case of two planar surfaces of equal mean surface
charge and disorder variance, it is shown that partial annealing of the
quenched disorder leads to renormalization of the mean surface charge density
and thus a reduction of the inter-plate repulsion on the mean-field or
weak-coupling level. In the strong-coupling limit, charge disorder induces a
long-range attraction resulting in a continuous disorder-driven collapse
transition for the two surfaces as the disorder variance exceeds a threshold
value. Disorder annealing further enhances the attraction and, in the limit of
low screening, leads to a global attractive instability in the system.

the Sun, stars and compact stars are compressed and extremely subsonic. Such
low Mach number flows are usually encountered when studying for example dynamo
action in stars, planets, the hydro-thermodynamics of X-ray bursts on neutron
stars and dwarf novae. Treating such flows is numerically complicated and
challenging task. We aim to present a robust numerical tool that enables
modeling the time-evolution or quasi-stationary of stratified low Mach number
flows under astrophysical conditions. It is argued that astrophysical low Mach
number flows cannot be considered as an asymptotic limit of incompressible
flows, but rather as highly compressed flows with extremely stiff pressure
terms. Unlike the pseudo-pressure in incompressible fluids, a Possion-like
treatment for the pressure would smooth unnecessarily the physically induced
acoustic perturbations, thereby violating the conservation character of the
compressible equations. Moreover, classical dimensional splitting techniques,
such as ADI or Line-Gauss-Seidel methods are found to be unsuited for modeling
compressible flows with low Mach numbers. In this paper we present a nonlinear

hierarchy has been extended by the introduction of one or more singularities in
the metric. We restricted ourselves to a real massless scalar field supposed to
propagate in a five dimensional bulk with the extradimension being compactified
on a strip or on a circle. With the same emphasis on the hermiticity and
commutativity properties of the Kakuza Klein operators, we have established all
the allowed boundary conditions to be imposed on the fields. From them, for
given positions of the singularities, one can deduce either mass eigenvalues
building up a Kaluza Klein tower, or a tachyon, or a zero mass state. Assuming
the Planck mass to be the high mass scale and by a choice, unique for all
boundary conditions, of the major warp parameters, the low lying mass
eigenvalues are of the order of the TeV, in this way explaining the mass scale
hierarchy. In our model, the physical masses are related to the Kaluza Klein
eigenvalues, depending on the location of the physical brane which is an
arbitrary parameter of the model. Illustrative numerical calculations are given
to visualize the structure of Kaluza Klein mass eigenvalue towers. Observation
at high energy colliders like LHC of a mass tower with its characteristic
structure would be the fingerprint of the model.

in the extended envelopes of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars
and incorporated the radioactive nucleus 26Al as a trace element. The aim of
this paper is to analyse in detail the effect of nuclear uncertainties, in
particular the large uncertainties of up to four orders of magnitude related to
the 26Al_g+(p,gamma)27Si reaction rate, on the production of 26Al in AGB stars
and compare model predictions to data obtained from laboratory analysis of SiC
stardust grains. Stellar uncertainties are also briefly discussed. We use a
detailed nucleosynthesis postprocessing code to calculate the 26Al/27Al ratios
at the surface of AGB stars of different masses (M = 1.75, 3, and 5 M_sun) and
metallicities (Z = 0.02, 0.012, and 0.008). For the lower limit and recommended
value of the 26Al_g(p,gamma)27Si reaction rate, the predicted 26Al/27Al ratios
replicate the upper values of the range of the 26Al/27Al ratios measured in SiC
grains. For the upper limit of the 26Al_g(p,gamma)27Si reaction rate, instead,
the predicted 26Al/27Al ratios are approximately 100 times lower and lie below
the range observed in SiC grains. When considering models of different masses
and metallicities, the spread of more than an order of magnitude in the
26Al/27Al ratios measured in stellar SiC grains is not reproduced. We propose
two scenarios to explain the spread of the 26Al/27Al ratios observed in
mainstream SiC, depending on the choice of the 26Al_g+p reaction rate. One
involves different times of stardust formation, the other involves extra-mixing
processes. Stronger conclusions will be possible after more information is
available from future nuclear experiments on the 26Al_g+p reaction.

suggest that, except if the films are very thin, the twin boundaries consist of
superimposed rows of weak links with mean height,ds, whose mean length along
the TBs is an universal function of T/Tc, the reduced temperature. This
conclusion yields a general expression for the critical surface current density
of the films as a function of T/Tc and of the number of superimposed weak links
rows, while the critical current density depends on ds. A comparison of the
measurements reported by various authors shows that the nature of the substrate

energies, using the newly developed (2+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic code

transverse evolution of longitudinally boost-invariant systems without
azimuthal symmetry around the beam direction. Shear viscosity is shown to
decelerate the longitudinal and accelerate the transverse hydrodynamic
expansion. For fixed initial conditions, this leads to a longer quark-gluon
plasma (QGP) lifetime, larger radial flow in the final state, and flatter
transverse momentum spectra for the emitted hadrons compared to ideal fluid
dynamic simulations. We find that the elliptic flow coefficient v_2 is
particularly sensitive to shear viscosity: even the lowest value allowed by the
AdS/CFT conjecture, eta/s=1/4pi, suppresses v_2 enough to have significant
consequences for the phenomenology of heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider. A comparison between our numerical results and earlier
analytic estimates of viscous effects within a blast-wave model parametrization
of the expanding fireball at freeze-out reveals that the full dynamical theory
leads to much tighter constraints for the specific shear viscosity eta/s,
thereby supporting the notion that the quark-gluon plasma created at RHIC

Moscow, Atomizdat, 1975, p.181-190 (in Russian). This paper elaborates further
the idea (formulated in 1971 by Braginsky and Mensky) of detecting
high-frequency gravitational waves by observing resonance action of a
gravitational wave on the electromagnetic wave in a closed resonator
(waveguide). The phenomenon underlying such a detector was called
gravitational-electromagnetic resonance (GER). In the present paper both closed
(for example circular) resonator or waveguide and long (for example in the
shape of a spiral) waveguide are considered as possible gravitational-wave
detectors. High-frequency gravitational-wave detectors are now again actual
(see A.M.Cruise and R.M.J.Ingley, Class. Quant. Grav. 22, S479, 2005), but the
current literature on this topic does not cover all the issues discussed in the
present paper.

means, left- and right-handed molecules can be distinguished purely

striking changes with respect to Landau Fermi liquid theory. In contrast with
normal metals, where the electronic specific heat is linear at low temperature
(with a T^3 term as a leading correction), a dynamical mean-field study of the
correlated Hubbard model reveals a clear kink in the temperature dependence,
marking a rapid change from a low-temperature linear behavior and a second
linear regime with a reduced slope. Experiments on LiV2O4 support our findings,
implying that correlated materials are more resistive to cooling at low T than
expected from the intermediate temperature behavior.

the mode of a high-finesse optical cavity allows for the generation of
temporally separated, entangled light pulses. Entanglement between the
photon-number fluctuations of the pulses is created and mediated via the atomic
center-of-mass motion, which is interfaced with light through the mechanical
effect of atom-photon interaction. By means of a quantum noise analysis we
determine the correlation matrix which characterizes the entanglement, as a
function of the system parameters. The scheme is feasible in experimentally
accessible parameter regimes. It may be easily extended to the generation of
entangled pulses at different frequencies, even at vastly different
wavelengths.
