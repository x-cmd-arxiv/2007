  Special Ap.J.Suppl., December, 2007 (29 papers)",,"10.1086/524659",,"astro-ph",,"  We use the UV-optical color magnitude diagram in combination with
spectroscopic and photometric measurements derived from the SDSS spectroscopic
sample to measure the distribution of galaxies in the local universe (z<0.25)
and their physical properties as a function of specific star formation rate
(SSFR) and stellar mass. Throughout this study our emphasis is on the
properties of galaxies on and off of a local ""star-forming sequence."" We
discuss how the physical characteristics of galaxies along this sequence are
related to scaling relations typically derived for galaxies of different
morphological types. We find, among other trends that our measure of the star
formation rate surface density is nearly constant along this sequence. We
discuss this result and implications for galaxies at higher redshift. For the
first time, we report on measurements of the local UV luminosity function
versus galaxy structural parameters as well as inclination. We also split our
sample into disk-dominated and bulge-dominated subsamples using the i-band
Sersic index and find that disk-dominated galaxies occupy a very tight locus in
SSFR vs. stellar mass space while bulge-dominated galaxies display a much
larger spread of SSFR at fixed stellar mass. A significant fraction of galaxies
with SSFR and SF surface density above those on the ""star-forming sequence"" are
bulge-dominated. We can use our derived distribution functions to ask whether a
significant fraction of these galaxies may be experiencing a final episode of
star formation (possibly induced by a merger or other burst), soon to be
quenched, by determining whether this population can explain the growth rate of
the non-star-forming galaxies on the ""red sequence."" (Abridged)

truncation along the line of sight: hard truncation and conventional (no

the thin lens approximation alone is less than 0.3% in the singular isothermal
sphere model, and less than 2% in the model of Navarro et al. (1997). The
removal of hard truncation introduces an additional error of the same order of
magnitude in the best case, and up to an order of magnitude larger in the worst
case studied. Our results ensure that the future generation of precision

  Manchester, UK (minor changes are added in the replaced version)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The future new-generation radio telescope SKA (Square Kilometre Array) and
its precursors will provide a rapidly growing number of polarized radio
sources. Hundred and thousands polarized background sources can be measured
towards nearby galaxies thus allowing their detailed magnetic field mapping by
means of Faraday rotation measures (RM). We aim to estimate the required
density of the background polarized sources detected with the SKA for reliable
recognition and reconstruction of the magnetic field structure in nearby spiral
galaxies. We construct a galaxy model which includes the ionized gas and
magnetic field patterns of different azimuthal symmetry (axisymmetric (ASS),
bisymmetric (BSS) and quadrisymmetric spiral (QSS), and superpositions) plus a
halo magnetic field. RM fluctuations with a Kolmogorov spectrum due to
turbulent fields and/or fluctuations in ionized gas density are superimposed.
Recognition of magnetic structures is possible from RM towards background
sources behind galaxies or a continuous RM map obtained from the diffuse
polarized emission from the galaxy itself. Under favourite conditions, about a
few dozens of polarized sources are sufficient for a reliable recognition.
Reconstruction of the field structure without precognition becomes possible for
a large number of background sources. A reliable reconstruction of the field
structure needs at least 20 RM values on a cut along the projected minor axis
which translates to approximately 1200 sources towards the galaxy. Radio
telescopes operating at low frequencies (LOFAR, ASKAP and the low-frequency SKA
array) may also be useful instruments for field recognition or reconstruction
with the help of RM, if background sources are still significantly polarized at
low frequencies (abriged).

largely infeasible because Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) would need to be
applied with a great many parameters, whose number increases rapidly with the
order. In this paper we show how to make it feasible by effectively reducing
the number of parameters, exploiting the fact that many interactions have the
same values for all training cases. Our method uses a single ``compressed''
parameter to represent the sum of all parameters associated with a set of
patterns that have the same value for all training cases. Using symmetric
stable distributions as the priors of the original parameters, we can easily
find the priors of these compressed parameters. We therefore need to deal only
with a much smaller number of compressed parameters when training the model
with MCMC. The number of compressed parameters may have converged before
considering the highest possible order. After training the model, we can split
these compressed parameters into the original ones as needed to make
predictions for test cases. We show in detail how to compress parameters for
logistic sequence prediction models. Experiments on both simulated and real
data demonstrate that a huge number of parameters can indeed be reduced by our
compression method.

less than 2.0 km/sec, while five show significant rotation, over 3 km/sec. The

However, the most luminous stars, with M(V) <= -1.5, do show net rotation, with
mean values of 2 to 4 km/sec, depending on the algorithm employed, and these

more about the function with the power series $\sum x^{t_n}$ where $t_n$ is the

every positive integer is the sum of three triangular numbers. This doesn't end
of being fruitful for Euler, but in fact later Jacobi proves a lot of results

N-band, VLTI/MIDIobservations). The emission from MWC 147 is clearly resolved
and has a characteristic physical size of approx. 1.3 AU and 9 AU at 2.2 micron
and 11 micron respectively (Gaussian diameter). The spectrally dispersed AMBER
and MIDI interferograms both show a strong increase in the characteristic size
towards longer wavelengths, much steeper than predicted by analytic disk models
assuming power-law radial temperature distributions. We model the
interferometric data and the spectral energy distribution of MWC 147 with 2-D,
frequency-dependent radiation transfer simulations. This analysis shows that
models of spherical envelopes or passive irradiated Keplerian disks (with
vertical or curved puffed-up inner rim) can easily fit the SED, but predict
much lower visibilities than observed; the angular size predicted by such
models is 2 to 4 times larger than the size derived from the interferometric
data, so these models can clearly be ruled out. Models of a Keplerian disk with
optically thick gas emission from an active gaseous disk (inside the dust
sublimation zone), however, yield a good fit of the SED and simultaneously
reproduce the absolute level and the spectral dependence of the NIR and MIR
visibilities. We conclude that the NIR continuum emission from MWC 147 is
dominated by accretion luminosity emerging from an optically thick inner
gaseous disk, while the MIR emission also contains contributions from the
outer, irradiated dust disk.

L_FIR~10^{12}L_sun, these disk-like galaxies are borderline ULIRGs but with
star formation efficiency similar to that of local spirals, and an order of

revealed a correlation between the luminosity of the central object and the
position of the disk inner rim. This correlation breaks down for the cooler T
Tauri stars, a fact often interpreted in terms of disks with larger inner
radii. In most cases, the conversion between the observed interferometric
visibility and the calculated disk inner radius was done with a crude disk
emission model. Here, we examine how the use of models that neglect scattered
light can lead to an overestimation of the disk sizes. To do so, synthetic disk
images (and visibilities) are calculated with a full treatment of the radiative
transfer. The relative contributions of thermal emission and scattered light
are compared. We find that the latter can not be neglected for cool stars. For
further comparison, the model visibilities are also converted into inner disk
radii using the same simple disk models as found in the literature. We find
that reliable inner radii can only be estimated for Herbig Ae/Be stars with
these models. However, they lead to a systematic overestimation of the disk
size, by a factor of 2 to 3, for T Tauri stars. We suggest that including
scattered light in the models is a simple (and sufficient) explanation of the
current interferometric measurements of T Tauri stars.

seen to follow the pattern familiar from studies of test particles falling
towards a concentrated mass, the case of weak gravity is very different. The
velocity of the dust that is witnessed by external observers is derived for the
critically open case and is seen to differ markedly from the expectations based
upon Newtonian gravity theory. Viewed as an idealized model for a cluster of

with the solely baryonic measure of the mass, obviating the need to introduce
extraneous dark matter. Hitherto unexplained and subject-to-reinterpretation

and disk of M51 (NGC 5194) using the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on the Spitzer
Space Telescope. The six H_2 lines have markedly different emission
distributions. We obtained the H_2 temperature and surface density
distributions by assuming a two temperature model: a warm (T = 100 - 300 K)
phase traced by the low J (S(0) - S(2)) lines and a hot phase (T = 400 - 1000
K) traced by the high J (S(2) - S(5)) lines. The lowest molecular gas
temperatures are found within the spiral arms (T ~ 155 K), while the highest
temperatures are found in the inter-arm regions (T > 700 K). The warm gas
surface density reaches a maximum of 11 M_sun/pc^2 in the northwestern spiral
arm, whereas the hot gas surface density peaks at 0.24 M_sun/pc^2 at the
nucleus. The spatial offset between the peaks in the warm and hot phases and
the differences in the distributions of the H_2 line emission suggest that the
warm phase is mostly produced by UV photons in star forming regions while the
hot phase is mostly produced by shocks or X-rays associated with nuclear
activity. The warm H_2 is found in the dust lanes of M51, spatially offset from
the brightest HII regions. The warm H_2 is generally spatially coincident with
the cold molecular gas traced by CO (J = 1 - 0) emission, consistent with
excitation of the warm phase in dense photodissociation regions (PDRs). In
contrast, the hot H_2 is most prominent in the nuclear region. Here, over a 0.5
kpc radius around the nucleus of M51, the hot H_2 coincides with [O IV](25.89
micron) and X-ray emission indicating that shocks and/or X-rays are responsible
for exciting this phase.

  time of a major flare and coronal mass ejection",,,"10.1086/527413",,"astro-ph",,"  Solar flares and coronal mass ejections are associated with rapid changes in
field connectivity and powered by the partial dissipation of electrical
currents in the solar atmosphere. A critical unanswered question is whether the
currents involved are induced by the motion of pre-existing atmospheric
magnetic flux subject to surface plasma flows, or whether these currents are
associated with the emergence of flux from within the solar convective zone. We
address this problem by applying state-of-the-art nonlinear force-free field
(NLFFF) modeling to the highest resolution and quality vector-magnetographic
data observed by the recently launched Hinode satellite on NOAA Active Region
10930 around the time of a powerful X3.4 flare. We compute 14 NLFFF models with
4 different codes and a variety of boundary conditions. We find that the model
fields differ markedly in geometry, energy content, and force-freeness. We
discuss the relative merits of these models in a general critique of present
abilities to model the coronal magnetic field based on surface vector field
measurements. For our application in particular, we find a fair agreement of
the best-fit model field with the observed coronal configuration, and argue (1)
that strong electrical currents emerge together with magnetic flux preceding
the flare, (2) that these currents are carried in an ensemble of thin strands,
(3) that the global pattern of these currents and of field lines are compatible
with a large-scale twisted flux rope topology, and (4) that the ~10^32 erg
change in energy associated with the coronal electrical currents suffices to
power the flare and its associated coronal mass ejection.

orbit (e = 0.14) has allowed a measurement of the rate of advance of
periastron: (0.0136 +/- 0.0007) degrees per year. It is very likely that the
periastron advance is due to the effects of general relativity; the total mass
of the binary system is (2.14 +/-0.16) solar masses. The small measured mass
function implies, in a statistical sense, that a very large fraction of this
total mass is contained in the pulsar: (1.94+0.17 -0.19) solar masses
(1-sigma); there is a 5% probability that the mass of this object is below 1.59
solar masses. With the possible exception of PSR J1748-2021B, this is the
largest neutron star mass measured to date. When combined with similar
measurements made previously for Terzan 5 I and J, we can exclude, in a
statistical sense, the ``soft'' equations of state for dense neutron matter,
implying that matter at the center of a neutron star is highly incompressible.
There is also some evidence for a bimodal distribution of MSP masses, the
reasons for that are not clear.

IRAS 23033+5951. Our observations reveal two massive molecular cloud cores,
designated IRAS 23033+5951-MMS1 and IRAS 23033+5951-MMS2. MMS1 has already
formed a massive protostar and MMS2 appears to be on the verge of doing so. The
latter core may be an example of a massive analogue to a ""Class 0"" star-forming
object. The more evolved core shows some evidence of N2H+ destruction near the
protostar, consistent with similar findings in low-mass star-forming objects.
In addition to the already-known prominent HCO+ outflow, our SiO 2--1, and
CH3OH 2--1 maps show evidence for two more candidate outflows, both presumably
less powerful than the main one. Both cores are embedded in an elongated
feature whose major axis is oriented almost exactly perpendicular to the axis
of the most prominent outflow in the region. Although it has many of the
characteristics of a disk, the 87,000 AU (0.42 pc) diameter of this structure
suggests that it is more likely to be the flattened, rotating remnant of the
natal molecular cloud fragment from which the star-forming cores condensed. We
conclude that IRAS 23033+5951 is an excellent example of massive star formation
proceeding in relative isolation, perhaps by the method of monolithic collapse
and disk accretion.

frequency-dependent response functions, there are generally three independent
functions. For stochastic dynamics we show that there are only two independent
response functions; for this case it is shown how analytic continuation may be
utilized to express the third response functions in terms of two others.
Operational criteria are presented for the linear thermoviscoelasticity being
described by a single ""order"" parameter, in which case there is just one
independent thermoviscoelastic response function. It is shown that a single
""order"" parameter description applies to a good approximation whenever thermal
equilibrium fluctuations of fundamental variables like energy and pressure are
strongly correlated. Results from computer simulations showing that this is the
case for a number of simple glass-forming liquids, as well as a few exceptions,

expression for the relaxation time, $\tau=F(\rho^x/T)$ ($\rho$ and $T$ are

infrared galaxies in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS). We use a local density

catalog, both of which make use of the DEEP2 spectroscopic redshift catalog, to
quantify the environment of these galaxies.
  We find that the local environment of LIRGs and ULIRGs is intermediate

environments and inhabit local environments that are more dense on average than
those of other DEEP2 galaxies at similar redshifts. However, when the

compare three velocity statistics (the distribution of radial velocities, the
mean pairwise streaming velocity, and the velocity correlation function) and
analyze the relative merits of these statistics in constraining dark energy
parameters. Of the three statistics, mean pairwise streaming velocity provides
constraints that are least sensitive to velocity errors: the constraints on
parameters degrades only by a factor of two when the random error is increased
from 100 to 500 km/s. We also compare cluster velocities with other dark energy
probes proposed in the Dark Energy Task Force report. For cluster velocity
measurements with realistic priors, the eventual constraints on the dark energy
density, the dark energy equation of state and its evolution are comparable to
constraints from supernovae measurements, and better than cluster counts and
baryon acoustic oscillations; adding velocity to other dark energy probes
improves constraints on the figure of merit by more than a factor of two. For
upcoming Sunyaev-Zeldovich galaxy cluster surveys, even velocity measurements
with errors as large as 1000 km/s will substantially improve the cosmological
constraints compared to using the cluster number density alone.

Markov chains (the Gilbert-Elliot channel model). A user chooses one channel to
sense and access in each slot and collects a reward determined by the state of
the chosen channel. The problem is to design a sensing policy for channel
selection to maximize the average reward, which can be formulated as a
multi-arm restless bandit process. In this paper, we study the structure,
optimality, and performance of the myopic sensing policy. We show that the
myopic sensing policy has a simple robust structure that reduces channel
selection to a round-robin procedure and obviates the need for knowing the
channel transition probabilities. The optimality of this simple policy is
established for the two-channel case and conjectured for the general case based
on numerical results. The performance of the myopic sensing policy is analyzed,
which, based on the optimality of myopic sensing, characterizes the maximum
throughput of a multi-channel opportunistic communication system and its
scaling behavior with respect to the number of channels. These results apply to
cognitive radio networks, opportunistic transmission in fading environments,

distributions of Jupiter Trojans, with particular attention to asteroid
families. We use a sample of data from the Moving Object Catalogue of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, together with spectra obtained from several surveys. A
first sample of 349 observations, corresponding to 250 Trojan asteroids, were
extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and we also extracted from the
literature a second sample of 91 spectra, corresponding to 71 Trojans. The
spectral slopes were computed by means of a least-squares fit to a straight
line of the fluxes obtained from the Sloan observations in the first sample,
and of the rebinned spectra in the second sample. In both cases the reflectance
fluxes/spectra were renormalized to 1 at 6230 $\textrm{\AA}$. We found that the
distribution of spectral slopes among Trojan asteroids shows a bimodality.
About 2/3 of the objects have reddish slopes compatible with D-type asteroids,
while the remaining bodies show less reddish colors compatible with the P-type
and C-type classifications. The members of asteroid families also show a
bimodal distribution with a very slight predominance of D-type asteroids, but
the background is clearly dominated by the D-types. The L4 and L5 swarms show
different distributions of spectral slopes, and bimodality is only observed in
L4. These differences can be attributed to the asteroid families since the
backgraound asteroids show the same slope distribtuions in both swarms. The
analysis of individual families indicates that the families in L5 are
taxonomically homogeneous, but in L4 they show a mixture of taxonomic types. We
discuss a few scenarios that might help to interpret these results.

from first principles, it is proposed to generalize the effective potential
approach for composite operators to non-zero temperatures. It is essentially
non-perturbative by construction, since it assumes the summation of an infinite
number of the corresponding contributions. There is no dependence on the
coupling constant, only a dependence on the mass gap, which is responsible for
the large-scale structure of the QCD ground state. The equation of state
generalizes the Bag constant at non-zero temperatures, while its nontrivial
Yang-Mills part has been approximated by the generalization of the free gluon
propagator to non-zero temperatures, as a first necessary step. Even in this
case we were able to show explicitly that the pressure may almost continuously
change its regime at $T^* = 266.5 MeV$.All the other thermodynamical quantities

non-zero minimal volume in (3+1) dimensions. Given this, one can easily guess
that one will have a non-zero minimal 9-volume in (9+1) dimensions. Therefore,
in this paper, we argue that not only D9-brane but also Dp-brane for p less
than 9 has a 9-volume. This idea is new, as the present view states that such a
Dp-brane has p-volume but no 9 volume. To demonstrate this, first, we equate
D8-brane action with D9-brane action and show that 9th direction which is
perpendicular to D8-brane has non-zero width. We repeat this step for different
ps; we equate Dp-brane action with Dp-1 brane action. By this iteration and
induction we conclude that Dp-brane has non-zero widths for each of (9-p)
directions perpendicular to the Dp-brane, and therefore, non-zero volume. When
antisymmetric tensor and field strength are zero, this width is calculated to
be 2 pi sqrt(alpha') for all (9-p) directions. For non-vanishing antisymmetric
tensor and field strength, the width receives small corrections. In this paper,
we only calculate up to the first order correction.

Palatini formalisms in theories whose Lagrangian density is a general function,
f(R), of the Ricci scalar. We derive these equations in a number of gauges. We
show that for viable models that satisfy cosmological and local gravity
constraints (LGC), matter perturbation equations derived under a sub-horizon
approximation are valid even for super-Hubble scales provided the oscillating
mode (scalaron) does not dominate over the matter-induced mode. Such
approximate equations are especially reliable in the Palatini formalism because
of the absence of scalarons.
  Using these equations we make a comparative study of the behaviour of density
perturbations as well as gravitational potentials for a number of classes of
theories. In the metric formalism the parameter m=Rf_{,RR}/f_{,R}
characterising the deviation from the Lambda CDM model is constrained to be
very small during the matter era in order to ensure compatibility with LGC, but
the models in which m grows to the order of 10^{-1} around the present epoch
can be allowed. These models also suffer from an additional fine tuning due to
the presence of scalaron modes which are absent in the Palatini case.
  In Palatini formalism LGC and background cosmological constraints provide
only weak bounds on |m| by constraining it to be smaller than ~ 0.1. This is in
contrast to matter density perturbations which, on galactic scales, place far
more stringent constraints on the present deviation parameter m of the order of
|m| < 10^{-5} - 10^{-4}. This is due to the peculiar evolution of matter
perturbations in the Palatini case which exhibits a rapid growth or a damped
oscillation depending on the sign of m.

the evolution of a hypersurface moving in the direction of its mean curvature
vector. The flow stems from a geometrically natural action containing kinetic
and internal energy terms. As the mean curvature of the hypersurface is the
main driving factor, we refer to this model as the hyperbolic mean curvature
flow (HMCF). The case that the initial velocity field is normal to the
hypersurface is of particular interest: this property is preserved during the
evolution and gives rise to a comparatively simpler evolution equation. We also
consider the case where the manifold can be viewed as a graph over a fixed
manifold. Our main results are as follows. First, we derive several balance
laws satisfied by the hypersurface during the evolution. Second, we establish
that the initial-value problem is locally well-posed in Sobolev spaces; this is
achieved by exhibiting a convexity property satisfied by the energy density
which is naturally associated with the flow. Third, we provide some criteria
ensuring that the flow will blow-up in finite time. Fourth, in the case of
graphs, we introduce a concept of weak solutions suitably restricted by an
entropy inequality, and we prove that a classical solution is unique in the
larger class of entropy solutions. In the special case of one-dimensional
graphs, a global-in-time existence result is established.
