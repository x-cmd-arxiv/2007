reconstruct the hydrogen density field for the Lya forest lines observed in
high resolution QSO spectra. The method is based on the hypothesis that the Lya
lines arise in the low to intermediate density intergalactic gas and that the
Jeans length is the typical size of the Lya absorbers. The reliability of FLO
is tested against mock spectra obtained from cosmological simulations. The
recovering algorithm gives satisfactory results in the range from the mean
density to over-densities of ~30 and reproduces correctly the correlation
function of the density field and the 1D power spectrum on scales between ~20
and 60 comoving Mpc. A sample of Lya forests from 22 high resolution QSO
spectra is analysed, covering the redshift range 1.7<z<3.5. For each line of
sight, we fit Voigt profiles to the lines of the Lya forest, providing the
largest, homogeneous sample of fitted Lya lines ever studied. The line number
density evolution with redshift follows a power-law relation: dn/dz=(166 +/- 4)
[(1+z)/3.5]^{(2.8 +/- 0.2)} (1 sigma errors). The two-point correlation
function of lines shows a signal up to separations of ~2 comoving Mpc; weak
lines (log N(HI)<13.8) also show a significant clustering but on smaller scales
(r<1.5 comoving Mpc). We estimate with FLO the hydrogen density field toward
the 22 observed lines of sight. The redshift distribution of the average
densities computed for each QSO is consistent with the cosmic mean hydrogen
density in the analysed redshift range. The two-point correlation function and
the 1D power spectrum of the delta field are estimated. The correlation
function shows clustering signal up to ~4 comoving Mpc.

the degree of birefringence may be intrinsically small, its effects on a
gravitational wave will accumulate as the wave propagates. The proposed Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be sensitive enough to observe the
gravitational waves from sources at cosmological distances great enough that
interesting bounds on the Chern-Simons may be found. Here we evaluate the
effect of a Chern-Simons induced spacetime birefringence to the propagation of
gravitational waves from such systems. We find that gravitational waves from in

Chern-Simons gravity. This signature appears as a time-dependent change in the
apparent orientation of the binary's orbital angular momentum with respect to
the observer line-of-sight, with the change magnitude reflecting the integrated
history of the Chern-Simons coupling over the worldline of a radiation
wavefront. While spin-orbit coupling in the binary system will also lead to an
evolution of the system's orbital angular momentum, the time dependence and
other details of this \emph{real} effect are different than the \emph{apparent}

Measured mode profiles are in good agreement with finite element method

measurements are in excellent agreement with theory and demonstrate tuning of
the zero dispersion wavelength via the core diameter. Optimum design parameters
for absorption sensors are discussed using a general parameter diagram. From
our analysis, we estimate that a sensitivity increase of three orders of

nonlocal, even though there is good reason to believe that the continuum limit
is in the correct universality class. In order to understand scaling
violations, it is thus necessary to extend the construction of the Symanzik
effective theory to include rooted staggered fermions. We show how this can be
done, starting from a generalization of the renormalization-group approach to
rooted staggered fermions recently developed by one of us. We then explain how
the chiral effective theory follows from the Symanzik action, and show that it
leads to ""rooted"" staggered chiral perturbation theory as the correct chiral
theory for QCD with rooted staggered fermions. We thus establish a direct link
between the renormalization-group based arguments for the correctness of the
continuum limit and the success of rooted staggered chiral perturbation theory
in fitting numerical results obtained with the rooting trick. In order to
develop our argument, we need to assume the existence of a standard
partially-quenched chiral effective theory for any local partially-quenched
theory. Other technical, but standard, assumptions are also required.

considered. The visibility horizon, which characterizes the differences between
black holes and passing wormholes, is determined in an invariant way. It is
shown that the rotation of wormholes does not affect the amount of phantom
matter that surrounds them.

algorithms that do not rely on any concept of quantum theory but are
nevertheless capable of reproducing the averages computed from quantum theory
through an event-by-event simulation. The simulation approach is illustrated by
applications to single-photon Mach-Zehnder interferometer experiments and
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments with photons.

  Nuclear Science of Condensed Matter, Dubna, May 19-20, 2007",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The present paper presents a new general conception of interaction between
physical systems, differing significantly from that of both classical physics
and quantum physics as generally understood. We believe this conception could
provide the basis for a coherent understanding of several classes of natural
phenomena that until now have been studied only in a piece-meal fashion. These
include 1) the universal tendency for physical systems to associate together
into stable dynamic formations; 2) the seemingly unlimited capacity for
generation of physical objects in Nature, including the emergence of coherent,
quantized states in physical systems of the most varied nature; 3) the
existence of close couplings between processes whose characteristic
length-scales, frequency- and energy-ranges differ by many orders of magnitude.
The proposed conception first emerged in connection with experimental studies
of the nonlinear behavior of coupled electromagnetic oscillators, and the
discovery of two fundamental phenomena that had been overlooked in the
classical theory of oscillations. The essential features of these phenomena are
summarized in the first two sections of the paper, after which we indicate how
the underlying physical principles can be combined under a single notion of
interaction, providing a mechanism by which a practically unlimited wealth of
physical objects could be generated by the interaction of just a few. The final
section puts forward some preliminary ideas about the electromagneto-mechanical
dual nature of physical objects as oscillatory processes, suggesting a
universal scope for the proposed conceptions.

automata in the hyperbolic plane and we consider the global function defined on
all possible configurations. Is the injectivity of this function undecidable?
The problem was answered positively in the case of the Euclidean plane by
Jarkko Kari, in 1994. In the present paper, we give a partial answer: when the
configurations are restricted to a certain condition, the problem is
undecidable.

the exponential rate of decay of the relative entropy from equilibrium of
Markov processes in discrete settings. When this method applies the relative
entropy decays in a convex way. The method is shown to be rather powerful when
applied to a class of birth and death processes. We then consider other
examples, including inhomogeneous zero-range processes and Bernoulli-Laplace
models. For these two models, known results were limited to the homogeneous
case, and obtained via the martingale approach, whose applicability to
inhomogeneous models is still unclear.

  Mutually Unbiased Bases","20pages, no figures. The paper has been submitted to IEEE
  Transanction on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  The notation of mutually unbiased bases(MUB) was first introduced by Ivanovic
to reconstruct density matrixes\cite{Ivanovic}. The subject about how to use
MUB to analyze, process, and utilize the information of the second moments
between random variables is studied in this paper. In the first part, the
mathematical foundation will be built. It will be shown that the spectra of MUB
have complete information for the correlation matrixes of finite discrete
signals, and the nice properties of them. Roughly speaking, it will be shown
that each spectrum from MUB plays an equal role for finite discrete signals,
and the effect between any two spectra can be treated as a global constant
shift. These properties will be used to find some important and natural
characterizations of random vectors and random discrete operators/filters. For
a technical reason, it will be shown that any MUB spectra can be found as fast
as Fourier spectrum when the length of the signal is a prime number.
  In the second part, some applications will be presented. First of all, a
protocol about how to increase the number of users in a basic digital
communication model will be studied, which has bring some deep insights about
how to encode the information into the second moments between random variables.
Secondly, the application of signal analysis will be studied. It is suggested
that complete ""MUB"" spectra analysis works well in any case, and people can
just choose the spectra they are interested in to do analysis. For instance,
single Fourier spectra analysis can be also applied in nonstationary case.
Finally, the application of MUB in dimensionality reduction will be considered,
when the prior knowledge of the data isn't reliable.
