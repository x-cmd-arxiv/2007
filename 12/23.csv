chiralities does not lead to a full massless scalar field. Similarly, in three
dimensions the addition of two Maxwell-Chern-Simons fields of opposite
helicities $\pm 1$ will not produce a parity invariant Maxwell-Proca theory. An
interference term between the opposite chiralities (helicities) states is
required in order to obtain the expected result. The so called soldering
procedure provides the missing interference Lagrangian in both 2D and 3D cases.
In two dimensions such interference term allows to fuse two chiral fermionic
determinants into a nonchiral one. In a recent work we have generalized this
procedure by allowing the appearance of an extra parameter which takes two
possible values and leads to two different soldered Lagrangians. Here we apply
this generalized soldering in a bosonic theory which has appeared in a partial
bosonization of the 3D gauged Thirring with $N$ flavors. The multiplicity of
flavors allow new types of solderings and help us to understand the connection
between different perturbative approaches to bosonization in 3D. In particular,
we obtain an interference term which takes us from a multiflavor
Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory to a pair of self-dual and anti-self-dual theories
when we combine together both fermionic determinants of +1/2 and -1/2 helicity
fermions. An important role is played by a set of pure non-interacting
Chern-Simons fields which amount to a normalization factor in the fermionic
determinants and act like spectators in the original theory but play an active
role in the soldering procedure. Our results suggest that the generalized
soldering could be used to provide dual theories in both 2D and 3D cases.

pure vector and pure chiral respectively, such that the vector (or chiral)
Schwinger model should not lose its chirality structure due to the addition of
the quartic interaction term. Here we extend this analysis to a generalized

(nearly) limit-cycle bursts with recurrence times that decreased
proportionately as the persistent flux increased. Here we report additional
measurements of the burst recurrence time by RXTE, Chandra, and XMM-Newton, as
well as observations of optical bursts. On a few occasions we measured burst
recurrence times which deviated significantly from the earlier flux-recurrence
time relationship, and most of these bursts occurred earlier than would be
predicted based on the X-ray flux level. The epochs with early bursts were also
accompanied by unusual broadband timing signatures, with the entire power
spectrum shifting to higher frequencies. Concurrent XMM-Newton observations
during one of these occasions, in 2003 April, indicate that an additional soft
component may be present in the spectrum containing enough flux (30% of the
total) to account for the burst recurrence time discrepancy. A self-consistent
interpretation for the increase in soft flux and accompanying timing changes
during 2003 April is that accretion disk extends down to smaller radial
distances from the source than during the other observing epochs. The RXTE
observations since 2003 April show that the spectral and timing properties have
nearly returned to the previously established level.

$\PP^3$ then the variety of trisecants has dimension one, unless the curve is
planar and has degree at least 3, in which case the variety of trisecants has
dimension 2. In this paper, our purpose is first to present another derivation
of this result and then to introduce a generalization to non-equidimensional
varities. For the sake of clarity, we shall reformulate our first problem as
follows. Let $Z$ be an equidimensional variety (maybe singular and/or
reducible) of dimension $n$, other than a linear space, embedded into $\PP^r$,
$r \geq n+1$. The variety of trisecant lines of $Z$, say $V_{1,3}(Z)$, has
dimension strictly less than $2n$, unless $Z$ is included in a
$(n+1)-$dimensional linear space and has degree at least 3, in which case
$\dim(V_{1,3}(Z)) = 2n$. Then we inquire the more general case, where $Z$ is
not required to be equidimensional. In that case, let $Z$ be a possibly
singular variety of dimension $n$, that may be neither irreducible nor
equidimensional, embedded into $\PP^r$, where $r \geq n+1$, and $Y$ a proper
subvariety of dimension $k \geq 1$. Consider now $S$ being a component of
maximal dimension of the closure of $\{l \in \G(1,r) \vtl \exists p \in Y, q_1,
q_2 \in Z \backslash Y, q_1,q_2,p \in l\}$. We show that $S$ has dimension
strictly less than $n+k$, unless the union of lines in $S$ has dimension $n+1$,
in which case $dim(S) = n+k$. In the latter case, if the dimension of the space
is stricly greater then $n+1$, the union of lines in $S$ cannot cover the whole
space. This is the main result of our work. We also introduce some examples
showing than our bound is strict.

where electron-phonon coupling leads to non-analytic phonon dispersion at

bilayer graphene where the charge density is modulated by the electric field
effect. This anomaly, arising from charge-tunable modulations of particle-hole
pairs that are resonantly coupled to lattice vibrations, is predicted to
exhibit a logarithmic divergence in the long-wavelength optical-phonon energy.
In a non-uniform bilayer of graphene, the logarithmic divergence is abated by
charge density inhomogeneity leaving as a vestige an anomalous phonon
softening. The observed softening marks the first confirmation of the phonon
anomaly as a key signature of the resonant deformation-potential
electron-phonon coupling. The high sensitivity of the phonon softening to
charge density non-uniformity creates significant venues to explore the
interplay between fundamental interactions and disorder in the atomic layers.

anharmonic pinning potential $V_1(q_i) =|q_i|^{2k}/2k$ and harmonic coupling
potentials $V_2(q_i- q_{i-1}) = (q_i- q_{i-1})^2/2$ between itself and its
nearest neighbors. We consider the case $k > 1$ when the pinning potential is
stronger then the coupling potential. At high energy, when a large fraction of
the energy is located in the bulk of the chain, breathers appear and block the
transport of energy through the system, thus slowing its convergence to
equilibrium.
  In such a regime, we obtain equations for an effective dynamics by averaging
out the fast oscillation of the breather. Using this representation and related
ideas, we can prove a number of results. When the chain is of length three and
$k> 3/2$ we show that there exists a unique invariant measure. If $k > 2$ we
further show that the system does not relax exponentially fast to this

generator of the dynamics. When the chain has five or more oscillators and $k>
3/2$ we show that the generator again has zero in its essential spectrum.

decrease of the energy when it is concentrated in one of the oscillators

energy of the Z^+ to the width Gamma_1 of its constituent D_1 can be exploited
to predict properties of its line shapes. Its full width at half maximum in the
channel psi' pi^+ should be approximately sqrt{3} Gamma_1 = 35 MeV, which is
consistent with the measured width of the Z^+. The Z^+ should also decay into
D^* D-bar^* pi through decay of its constituent D_1. The peak in the line shape

pseudo-Euclidean (Lorentzian) geometry of space-time. However, as it is
explicitly stated in General Relativity, the geometry itself depends on
dynamics, specifically, on the energy-momentum tensor. We discuss a few
examples, which illustrate the dynamical aspect of the length-contraction
effect within the framework of Special Relativity. We show some pitfalls
associated with direct application of the length contraction formula in cases
when an extended object is accelerated. Our analysis reveals intimate
connections between length contraction and the dynamics of internal forces
within the accelerated system.
  The developed approach is used to analyze the correlation between two
congruent disks - one stationary and one rotating (the Ehrenfest paradox).
Specifically, we consider the transition of a disk from the state of rest to a
spinning state under the applied forces. It reveals the underlying physical
mechanism in the corresponding transition from Euclidean geometry of stationary
disk to Lobachevsky's (hyperbolic) geometry of the spinning disk in the process
of its rotational boost. A conclusion is made that the rest mass of a spinning
disk or ring of a fixed radius must contain an additional term representing the
potential energy of non-Euclidean circumferential deformation of its material.
Possible experimentally observable manifestations of Lobachevsky's geometry of
rotating systems are discussed.

several methods. It is shown that a mean field approach fails to gain the
correct phase diagram for the Ising type anisotropy. We then applied the spin
wave theory which is justified for the anisotropic case. We have derived the
phase diagram between the antiferromagnetic long range order and the Kondo
singlet phases. We have found that the exchange interaction (J) between the
itinerant spins and local ones enhances the quantum fluctuations around the
classical long range antiferromagnetic order and finally destroy the ordered
phase at the critical value, J_c. Moreover, our results show that the onset of
anisotropy in the XY term of the itinerant interactions develops the
antiferromagnetic order for J<J_c. This is in agreement with the qualitative
feature which we expect from the symmetry of the anisotropic XY interaction. We
have justified our results by the numerical Lanczos method where the structure
factor at the antiferromagnetic wave vector diverges as the size of system goes
to infinity.

that exhibit strong evidence for five orbiting planets. The four previously
reported planets are strongly confirmed here. A fifth planet is presented, with
an apparent orbital period of 260 days, placing it 0.78 AU from the star in the
large empty zone between two other planets. The velocity wobble amplitude of
4.9 \ms implies a minimum planet mass \msini = 45.7 \mearthe. The orbital
eccentricity is consistent with a circular orbit, but modest eccentricity
solutions give similar \chisq fits. All five planets reside in low eccentricity
orbits, four having eccentricities under 0.1. The outermost planet orbits 5.8
AU from the star and has a minimum mass, \msini = 3.8 \mjupe, making it more
massive than the inner four planets combined. Its orbital distance is the
largest for an exoplanet with a well defined orbit. The innermost planet has a
semi-major axis of only 0.038 AU and has a minimum mass, \msinie, of only 10.8
\mearthe, one of the lowest mass exoplanets known. The five known planets
within 6 AU define a {\em minimum mass protoplanetary nebula} to compare with
the classical minimum mass solar nebula. Numerical N-body simulations show this
system of five planets to be dynamically stable and show that the planets with
periods of 14.65 and 44.3 d are not in a mean-motion resonance. Millimagnitude
photometry during 11 years reveals no brightness variations at any of the
radial velocity periods, providing support for their interpretation as
planetary.

this situation is reduced to a system of evolution equations posed spatially on
$\R^d$, $d=1,2$, which involve two nonlocal operators. The different asymptotic
models are obtained by expanding the nonlocal operators with respect to

Split-Hopkinson Tension Bar at a strain-rate in the range of 150-600/s and in a

novel specimen design was utilized for the Hopkinson bar tests of this sheet
material. Digital image correlation was used together with high-speed
photography to study strain localisation in the tensile specimens at high rates
of strain. By using digital image correlation, it is possible to obtain
in-plane displacement and strain fields during non-uniform deformation of the
gauge section, and accordingly the strains associated with diffuse and
localised necking may be determined. The full-field measurements in high
strain-rate tests reveal that strain localisation started even before the
maximum load was attained in the specimen. An elasto-viscoplastic constitutive
model is used to predict the observed stress-strain behaviour and strain
localisation for the dual-phase steel. Numerical simulations of dynamic tensile
tests were performed using the non-linear explicit FE code LS-DYNA. Simulations
were done with shell (plane stress) and brick elements. Good correlation
between experiments and numerical predictions was achieved, in terms of
engineering stress-strain behaviour, deformed geometry and strain fields.
However, mesh density plays a role in the localisation of deformation in
numerical simulations, particularly for the shell element analysis.

the other hand a random phase based statistical model that uses averaging over

elementary notion of a node's descents in breadth-first-search (BFS or
shortest-path) trees, and study both the descent and nodal-load distributions
in the case of scale-free networks. Our treatment is both semi-analytical
(combining a generating-function formalism with simulation-derived BFS
branching probabilities) and computational for the descent distribution; it is
exclusively computational in the case of the load distribution. Our main result
is that the load distribution, even though it can be disguised as a power-law
through subtle (but inappropriate) binning of the raw data, is in fact a
succession of sharply delineated probability peaks, each of which can be
clearly interpreted as a function of the underlying BFS descents. This find is
in stark contrast with previously held belief, based on which a power law of
exponent -2.2 was conjectured to be valid regardless of the exponent of the
power-law distribution of node degrees.
