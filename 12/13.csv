  figures (some in color). Comments welcome",,"10.1086/527665",,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss the angular clustering of galaxy clusters at z > 1 selected within
50 sq. deg from the Spitzer Wide-Infrared Extragalactic survey. We employ a
simple color selection to identify high redshift galaxies with no dependence on
galaxy rest-frame optical color using Spitzer IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 micron
photometry. The majority (>90%) of galaxies with z > 1.3 are identified with
[3.6] - [4.5] > -0.1 AB mag. We identify candidate galaxy clusters at z > 1 by
selecting overdensities of >26-28 objects with [3.6] - [4.5] > -0.1 mag within
radii of 1.4 arcminutes, which corresponds to r < 0.5 Mpc/h at z=1.5. These
candidate galaxy clusters show strong angular clustering, with an angular
correlation function represented by w(theta) = (3.1 +/- 0.5) theta^(-1.1 +/-
0.1) with theta in units of arcminutes over scales of 2-100 arcminutes.
Assuming the redshift distribution of these galaxy clusters follows a fiducial
model, these galaxy clusters have a spatial-clustering scale length r_0 = 22.4
+/- 3.6 Mpc/h, and a comoving number density n = 1.2 +/- 0.1 x 10^-6
(Mpc/h)^-3. The correlation scale length and number density of these objects
are comparable to those of rich galaxy clusters at low redshift. The number
density of these high-redshift clusters correspond to dark-matter halos larger
than 3-5 x 10^13 h^-1 solar masses at z=1.5. Assuming the dark halos hosting
these high-redshift clusters grow following Lambda-CDM models, these clusters
will reside in halos larger than 1-2 x 10^14 h^-1 solar masses at z=0.2,
comparable to rich galaxy clusters.

the two ways. One is launched just after the core-bounce in a prompt way and
another is launched at $ \sim 100 $ ms after the stall of the prompt shock. We
find that the shock-revival occurs when the magnetic pressure becomes strong,
due to the field wrapping, enough to overwhelm the ram pressure of the
accreting matter. The critical toroidal magnetic fields for the magnetic
shock-revival are found to be universal of $\sim 10^{15}\mathrm{G}$ behind the
jets. We point out that the time difference before the shock-revival has a
strong correlation with the explosions energies. Our results suggest that the
magnetically dominated jets are accompanied by the formation of the magnetars.
Since the jets are mildly relativistic, we speculate that they might be the
origin of some observed X-ray flashes.

of magnetic reconnection in relativistic pair plasmas is demonstrated by
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. In the outflow regions, powerful
reconnection jet piles up the magnetic fields and then a tangential
discontinuity appears there. Further downstream, it is found that the
two-dimensional extension of the relativistic Weibel instability generates
electro-magnetic fields, which are comparable to the anti-parallel or piled-up
fields. In a microscopic viewpoint, the instability allows plasma's multiple
interactions with the discontinuity. In a macroscopic viewpoint, the

characterized the folding and the conformational diversity of alpha-synuclein
(aSyn), a natively unstructured protein involved in Parkinson disease, by
mechanically stretching single molecules of this protein and recording their
mechanical properties. These experiments permitted us to directly observe
directly and quantify three main classes of conformations that, under in vitro
physiological conditions, exist simultaneously in the aSyn sample, including
disordered and ""beta-like"" structures. We found that this class of ""beta-like""
structures is directly related to aSyn aggregation. In fact, their relative
abundance increases drastically in three different conditions known to promote
the formation of aSyn fibrils: the presence of Cu2+, the occurrence of the
pathogenic A30P mutation, and high ionic strength. We expect that a critical
concentration of aSyn with a ""beta-like"" structure must be reached to trigger
fibril formation. This critical concentration is therefore controlled by a
chemical equilibrium. Novel pharmacological strategies can now be tailored to
act upstream, before the aggregation process ensues, by targeting this
equilibrium. To this end, Single Molecule Force Spectroscopy can be an
effective tool to tailor and test new pharmacological agents.

translational-invariant critical spin chains is investigated. At criticality,
the accuracy with which they describe ground state properties of a system is
limited by the size $\chi$ of the matrices that form the approximation. This
limitation is quantified in terms of the scaling of the half-chain entanglement
entropy. In the case of the quantum Ising model, we find $S \sim {1/6}\log
\chi$ with high precision. This result can be understood as the emergence of an
effective finite correlation length $\xi_\chi$ ruling of all the scaling
properties in the system. We produce five extra pieces of evidence for this
finite-$\chi$ scaling, namely, the scaling of the correlation length, the
scaling of magnetization, the shift of the critical point, and the scaling of
the entanglement entropy for a finite block of spins. All our computations are
consistent with a scaling relation of the form $\xi_\chi\sim \chi^{\kappa}$,
with $\kappa=2$ for the Ising model. In the case of the Heisenberg model, we
find similar results with the value $\kappa\sim 1.37$. We also show how
finite-$\chi$ scaling allow to extract critical exponents. These results are
obtained using the infinite time evolved block decimation algorithm which works
in the thermodynamical limit and are verified to agree with density matrix
renormalization group results.

density decreases monotonically possesses an upper bound on its mass-to-radius
ratio, $2M/R\leq 8/9$. However, field configurations typically will not be
compact. Here we investigate non-compact static configurations whose matter
fields have a slow global spatial decay, bounded by a power law behavior. These
matter distributions have no sharp boundaries. We derive an upper bound on the
fundamental ratio max_r{2m(r)/r} which is valid throughout the bulk. In its
simplest form, the bound implies that in any region of spacetime in which the
radial pressure increases, or alternatively decreases not faster than some
power law $r^{-(c+4)}$, one has $2m(r)/r \leq (2+2c)/(3+2c)$. [For $c \leq 0$
the bound degenerates to $2m(r)/r \leq 2/3$.] In its general version, the bound
is expressed in terms of two physical parameters: the spatial decaying rate of
the matter fields, and the highest occurring ratio of the trace of the pressure
tensor to the local energy density.

by boolean combinations of polynomial equalities and inequalities over the real
numbers. The relational calculus augmented with polynomial constraints is the
standard first-order query language for constraint databases. Although the
expressive power of this query language has been studied extensively, the
difficulty of the efficient evaluation of queries, usually involving some form
of quantifier elimination, has received considerably less attention. The
inefficiency of existing quantifier-elimination software and the intrinsic
difficulty of quantifier elimination have proven to be a bottle-neck for for
real-world implementations of constraint database systems. In this paper, we
focus on a particular query, called the \emph{alibi query}, that asks whether
two moving objects whose positions are known at certain moments in time, could
have possibly met, given certain speed constraints. This query can be seen as a
constraint database query and its evaluation relies on the elimination of a
block of three existential quantifiers. Implementations of general purpose
elimination algorithms are in the specific case, for practical purposes, too
slow in answering the alibi query and fail completely in the parametric case.
The main contribution of this paper is an analytical solution to the parametric
alibi query, which can be used to answer this query in the specific case in
constant time. We also give an analytic solution to the alibi query at a fixed
moment in time. The solutions we propose are based on geometric argumentation
and they illustrate the fact that some practical problems require creative
solutions, where at least in theory, existing systems could provide a solution.

dimensions with a negative cosmological constant $-\Lambda\equiv -l^{-2}<0$. In
this paper we address the quantization of the Banados--Teitelboim--Zanelli
(BTZ) black hole. We show that the mass function describing the black hole is
made of two pieces, a constant non-vanishing boundary contribution and a
discrete spectrum of the form $\mu_n = \frac{\hbar}{l}(n+ \frac 12)$. The
discrete spectrum is obtained by applying the Wheeler--DeWitt equation with a
particular choice of factor ordering and interpreted as giving the energy
levels of the collapsed matter shells that form the black hole. Treating a
black hole microstate as a particular distribution of shells among the levels,
we determine the canonical entropy of the BTZ black hole. Comparison with the
Bekenstein--Hawking entropy shows that the boundary energy is related to the
central charge of the Virasoro algebra that generates the asymptotic symmetry
group of the three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space AdS$_3$. This gives a
connection between the Wheeler--DeWitt approach and the conformal field theory
approach.

components occurring simultaneously in the two jets roughly every 35 days. When
corrected for projection effects and Doppler boosting, the intensities of the
two jets are intrinsically very similar. Fractional linear polarization up to
20% is present along the ridge-lines, while the core is essentially
unpolarized. The rotation measures are consistent with a foreground screen with
RM ~ +110 radians per meter squared, plus a larger, asymmetrical contribution
close to the core. The apparent magnetic fields in the jets are roughly aligned
with the ridge-lines in most but not all of each jet. The jet is more highly
polarized between the components than in the components themselves, suggesting
that the mechanism that creates them compresses a tangled part of the magnetic
field into a partially-ordered transverse layer. The off-jet emission is
remarkably highly polarized, with m ~ 50% in places, suggesting large-scale
order of the magnetic field surrounding the jets. This polarized signal may

reexamined in the light of the decoupling theorem. The Ward identities
satisfied by these couplings are derived by adopting a $SU_L(2)\times

discussed. Previous results on $\tilde{\kappa}_\gamma$, whose bound is updated
to $|\tilde{\kappa}_\gamma| <5.2\times 10^{-5}$, are reproduced, but
disagreement with those existing for $\tilde{\lambda}_\gamma$ is found. In
particular, the upper bound $|\tilde{\lambda}_\gamma|<1.9\times10^{-2}$ is
found from the limit on the neutron EDM, which is more than 2 orders of
magnitude less stringent than that of previous results. It is argued that this
difference between the $\tilde{\kappa}_\gamma$ and $\tilde{\lambda}_\gamma$

theorem. This argument is reinforced by analyzing careful the low--energy

strongly depends on the small-body size distribution of each system. Based on
an analysis of the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) data we
infer that the diffuse emission from the MBAs, Trojans, and KBOs has an
integrated flux of less than ~6x10^{-6} cm^{-2} s^{-1} (100-500 MeV), which
corresponds to ~12 times the Lunar albedo, and may be detectable by the
forthcoming Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST). If detected by GLAST,
it can provide unique direct information about the number of small bodies in
each system that is difficult to assess by any other method. Additionally, the
KBO albedo flux can be used to probe the spectrum of CR nuclei at
close-to-interstellar conditions. The orbits of MBAs, Trojans, and KBOs are
distributed near the ecliptic, which passes through the Galactic center and
high Galactic latitudes. Therefore, the asteroid gamma-ray albedo has to be
taken into account when analyzing weak gamma-ray sources close to the ecliptic,
especially near the Galactic center and for signals at high Galactic latitudes,
such as the extragalactic gamma-ray emission. The asteroid albedo spectrum also
exhibits a 511 keV line due to secondary positrons annihilating in the rock.

particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. Two-dimensional PIC simulations exhibit the
guide field dependence to the linear instabilities; the tearing or reconnection
modes are relatively insensitive, while the relativistic drift-kink instability
(RDKI), the fastest mode in a relativistic current sheet, is stabilized by the
guide field. Particle acceleration in the nonlinear stage is also investigated.
A three-dimensional PIC simulation demonstrates that the current sheet is
unstable to the RDKI, although small reconnection occurs in the deformed
current sheet. Another three-dimensional PIC simulation with a guide field
demonstrates a completely different scenario. Secondary magnetic reconnection
is triggered by nonlinear coupling of oblique instabilities, which we call the
relativistic drift-sausage tearing instability. Therefore, particle
acceleration by relativistic guide field reconnection occurs in
three-dimensional configuration. Based on the plasma theories, we discuss an
important role of the guide field: to enable non-thermal particle acceleration

study galaxy formation and evolution in detail in the nearby Universe. Although
they seem to be simple systems at first view, they remain poorly understood. In
an attempt to alleviate this situation, the MAGPOP EU Research and Training
Network embarked on a study of dwarf galaxies named MAGPOP-ITP (Peletier et
al., 2007). In this paper, we present the analysis of a sample of 24 dwarf
elliptical galaxies (dEs) in the Virgo Cluster and in the field, using optical
long-slit spectroscopy. We examine their stellar populations in combination
with their light distribution and environment. We confirm and strengthen
previous results that dEs are, on average, younger and more metal-poor than
normal elliptical galaxies, and that their [alpha/Fe] abundance ratios scatter
around solar. This is in accordance with the downsizing picture of galaxy
formation where mass is the main driver for the star formation history. We also
find new correlations between the luminosity-weighted mean age, the large-scale
asymmetry, and the projected Virgocentric distance. We find that environment
plays an important role in the termination of the star formation activity by
ram pressure stripping of the gas in short timescales, and in the
transformation of disky dwarfs to more spheroidal objects by harassment over

  instability","18 pages, 3 pages. accepted by Nature Physics",,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  The finger-like branching pattern that occurs when a less viscous fluid
displaces a more viscous one confined between two parallel plates has been
widely studied as a classical example of a mathematically-tractable
hydrodynamic instability since the time of Saffman and Taylor. Fingering in
such Hele-Shaw geometries have been generated not only with Newtonian fluids
but also with various non-Newtonian fluids including fine granular material
displaced by gas, liquid, or large grains. Here we study a granular Hele-Shaw
system to explore whether the absence of cohesive forces in dry granular
material can produce an ideal venue for studying the hitherto-unrealizable
singular hydrodynamics predicted in the zero-surface-tension limit. We
demonstrate that the grain-gas interface does indeed exhibit fractal structure
and sharp cusps associated with finite-time singularities. Above the yield
stress, the scaling for the finger width is distinct from that for ordinary
fluids, reflecting unique granular properties such as friction-induced
dissipation as opposed to viscous damping. Despite such differences, the
dimension of the global fractal structure and the shape of the singular cusps
on the interface agree with the theories based on simple Laplacian growth of
conventional fluid fingering in the zero-surface-tension limit. Our study
provides new insights not only on the dynamics of two-phase dense granular
flows and granular pattern formation, but also on the fluid dynamics in the
zero-surface-tension limit.

Furthermore, we find that when the coating layer of the concentrator is
realized with left-handed materials, energy will circulate between the coating
and the core, and the energy transmits through the core of the concentrator can
be much bigger than that transmits through the concentrator. Therefore, such
concentrator is also a power flux amplifier. Finally, we propose a spherical
field rotator, which functions as not only a wave vector rotator, but also a
polarization rotator, depending on the orientations of the spherical rotator
with respect to the incident wave direction. The functionality of these novel

originally developed by Heyvaert & Priest (1992), in which we include the
dynamical effect of the background magnetic field along a coronal structure by
using exact results from wave MHD turbulence (Galtier et al. 2000). Aims : We
evaluate the heating rate and the microturbulent velocity for comparison with
observations in the quiet corona, active regions and also coronal holes.
Methods :The coronal structures are assumed to be in a turbulent state
maintained by the slow erratic motions of the magnetic footpoints. A
description for the large-scale and the unresolved small-scale dynamics are
given separately. From the latter, we compute exactly (or numerically for
coronal holes) turbulent viscosites that are finally used in the former to
close self-consistently the system and derive the heating flux expression.
Results : We show that the heating rate and the turbulent velocity compare
favorably with coronal observations. Conclusions : Although the Alfven wave
turbulence regime is strongly anisotropic, and could reduce a priori the
heating efficiency, it provides an unexpected satisfactory model of coronal
heating for both magnetic loops and open magnetic field lines.

replacing the MSSM with an R-symmetric supersymmetric model allows order one
flavor-violating soft masses, even for squarks of order a few hundred GeV. The
minimal R-symmetric supersymmetric model contains Dirac gaugino masses and
R-symmetric Higgsino masses with no left-right mixing in the squark or slepton

most flavor problems, while the R-symmetric Higgs sector becomes important at
large tan(beta). epsilon_K can be accommodated if CP is preserved in the SUSY
breaking sector, or if there is a moderate flavor degeneracy, which can arise
naturally. epsilon'/epsilon, as well as neutron and electron EDMs are easily
within experimental bounds. The most striking phenomenological distinction of

Pb+Pb as well as p+p collisions at bombarding energies from 10 to 160 AGeV are
studied within the HSD and UrQMD microscopic transport approaches. Our
investigation is directly related to the future experimental program of the
NA61 Collaboration at the SPS for a search of the QCD critical point. The
dependence on energy and atomic mass number of the scaled variances for
negative, positive, and all charged hadrons is presented and compared to the
results of the model of independent sources. Furthermore, the nucleus-nucleus
results from the transport calculations are compared to inelastic proton-proton
collisions for reference. We find a dominant role of the participant number
fluctuations in nucleus-nucleus reactions at finite impact parameter $b$. In
order to reduce the influence of the participant numbers fluctuations on the
charged particle multiplicity fluctuations only the most central events have to
be selected. Accordingly, the samples of the 1% most central nucleus-nucleus
collisions with the largest numbers of the projectile participants are studied.
The results are compared with those for collisions at zero impact parameter. A
strong influence of the centrality selection criteria on the multiplicity
fluctuations is pointed out. Our findings are essential for an optimal choice
of colliding nuclei and bombarding energies for the experimental search of the
QCD critical point.

include the use of variable transmission lengths based on distributed

opportunistic scheduling to achieve high throughput in time-varying wireless

brightness states is explained in terms of the response of a viscous disk to
changes of 20-50 per cent in the mass transfer rate from the donor star. Low-
and high-frequency flickering maps are dominated by emission from two
asymmetric arcs reminiscent of those seen in the outbursting dwarf nova IP Peg,
and are similarly interpreted as manifestation of a tidally-induced spiral
shock wave in the outer regions of a large accretion disk. The asymmetric arcs
are also seen in the map of the steady-light aside of the broad brightness
distribution of a roughly steady-state disk. The arcs account for 25 per cent
of the steady-light flux and are a long-lasting feature in the accretion disk
of UU Aqr. We infer an opening angle of 10+/-3 degrees for the spiral arcs. The
results suggest that the flickering in UU Aqr is caused by turbulence generated

inverse squared zero-temperature magnetic penetration depth (\lambda_0^{-2}) on

\lambda_0^{-2} was found to obey the power law dependence \lambda_0^{-2}\propto
T_c^{3.1(1)} which appears to be common for some families of BCS

III seems to have taken place during two distinct epochs: there is the 8-15 Myr
epoch that had previously been recognized, but we also see strong evidence for
a separate ""burst"" of star formation 25-30 Myr ago. The ""super-supernova"" or
GRB blast wave model for the formation of Constellation III is difficult to
reconcile with such an extended, two-epoch star formation history, because the
shock wave should have induced star formation throughout the structure
simultaneously, and any unconsumed gas would quickly be dissipated, leaving
nothing from which to form a subsequent burst of activity. We propose a ""truly
stochastic"" self-propagating star formation model, distinct from the canonical
model in which star formation proceeds in a radially-directed wave from the
center of Constellation III to its perimeter. As others have noted, and we now
confirm, the bulk age gradients demanded by such a model are simply not present
in Constellation III. In our scenario, the prestellar gas is somehow pushed
into these large-scale arc structures, without simultaneously triggering
immediate and violent star formation throughout the structure. Rather, star
formation proceeds in the arc according to the local physical conditions of the
gas. Self-propagating star formation is certainly possible, but in a truly
stochastic manner, without a directed, large scale pattern.

strength predicted by realistic microscopic $\alpha$-cluster models of the

When there are multiple WLANs in the vicinity of each other, the already-low

a complete understanding of its capacity is very important for the practical
implementation of optimal fault-tolerant architectures. It is known that
stabilizer codes support a natural set of gates that can be more easily
implemented by teleportation than any other gates. These gates belong to the so
called $\mathcal{C}_k$ hierarchy introduced by Gottesman and Chuang (Nature
\textbf{402}, 390). Moreover, a subset of $\mathcal{C}_k$ gates, called
semi-Clifford operations, can be implemented by an even simpler architecture
than the traditional teleportation setup (Phys. Rev. \textbf{A62}, 052316).
However, the precise set of gates in $\mathcal{C}_k$ remains unknown, even for
a fixed number of qubits $n$, which prevents us from knowing exactly what
teleportation is capable of. In this paper we study the structure of
$\mathcal{C}_k$ in terms of semi-Clifford operations, which send by conjugation
at least one maximal abelian subgroup of the $n$-qubit Pauli group into another
one. We show that for $n=1,2$, all the $\mathcal{C}_k$ gates are semi-Clifford,
which is also true for $\{n=3,k=3\}$. However, this is no longer true for
$\{n>2,k>3\}$. To measure the capability of this teleportation primitive, we
introduce a quantity called `teleportation depth', which characterizes how many
teleportation steps are necessary, on average, to implement a given gate. We
calculate upper bounds for teleportation depth by decomposing gates into both
semi-Clifford $\mathcal{C}_k$ gates and those $\mathcal{C}_k$ gates beyond
semi-Clifford operations, and compare their efficiency.

$d$, this mimics the measure on Euclidean $d$-dimensional space, and in this
case our setup is equivalent to looking at the Laplacian acting on radial
functions on Euclidean space or variations of Euclidean space such as the
exterior of a sphere (with either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions), or
the connected sum of two copies of $\R^d$. In this way we illuminate some
recent results on the Riesz transform on asymptotically Euclidean manifolds.
  We are however interested in all real values of $d > 1$, and another goal of
our analysis is to study the range of boundedness as a function of $d$; it is
particularly interesting to see the behaviour as $d$ crosses 2. For example, in
one of our cases which models radial functions on the connected sum of two
copies of $\R^d$, the upper threshold for $L^p$ boundedness is $p=d$ for $d \ge

actually bounded on $L^p$ when $p$ is equal to the upper threshold.

lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias and
eventually better algorithms for the prediction and prevention of such dreadful

shorter pacing period. Existing experimental and theoretical studies adopt the
assumption that alternans in homogeneous cardiac tissue is exclusively
determined by the pacing period. In contrast, we find that, when calcium-driven
alternans develops in cardiac fibers, it may take different spatiotemporal
patterns depending on the pacing history. Because there coexist multiple
alternans solutions for a given pacing period, the alternans pattern on a fiber

show that the coexistence of multiple alternans patterns is induced by the
interaction between electrotonic coupling and an instability in calcium

This result settles the open problem about the existence of hinged dissections
between pairs of polygons that goes back implicitly to 1864 and has been
studied extensively in the past ten years. Our result generalizes and indeed
builds upon the result from 1814 that polygons have common dissections (without
hinges). We also extend our common dissection result to edge-hinged dissections
of solid 3D polyhedra that have a common (unhinged) dissection, as determined
by Dehn's 1900 solution to Hilbert's Third Problem. Our proofs are
constructive, giving explicit algorithms in all cases. For a constant number of

unhinged dissections. Hinged dissections have possible applications to

accuracy of this approach has already been evaluated. METHODS: We present work
in progress concerning the evaluation of the approach from the dosimetry
viewpoint. The objective is to determine what impact this system may have on
the treatment of the patient. Dose planning is performed from initial TRUS
prostate contours and evaluated on contours modified by data fusion. RESULTS:
For the eight patients included, we demonstrate that TRUS prostate volume is
most often underestimated and that dose is overestimated in a correlated way.
However, dose constraints are still verified for those eight patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This confirms our initial hypothesis.

in various heavy-fermion metals, apparently inconsistent with the standard

Kondo effect at the critical point. Here we investigate, within one specific
scenario, the fate of such a zero-temperature transition upon coupling of the
electronic to lattice degrees of freedom. We study a Kondo-Heisenberg model
with volume-dependent Kondo coupling -- this model displays both Kondo volume
collapse and Kondo-breakdown transitions, as well as Lifshitz transitions
associated with a change of the Fermi-surface topology. Within a large-N
treatment, we find that the Lifshitz transition tends to merge with the Kondo
volume collapse and hence becomes first order, whereas the Kondo breakdown
transition remains of second order except for very soft lattices. Interesting
physics emerges at the zero-temperature endpoint of the Kondo volume collapse:
For electrons in two space dimensions, this endpoint is located at the Lifshitz
line for a large range of parameters, thus two continuous quantum phase
transitions coincide without fine tuning. We analyze the effective Landau
theory for such a situation and discuss critical exponents. Finally, we relate
our findings to current heavy-fermion experiments.

epochs in three near-infrared filter bandpasses, a homogeneous imaging data set
spanning more than 6 years (or 10 orbits) is presented. Data were obtained from
the highly successful Keck Aperture Masking Experiment, which can recover high
fidelity images at extremely high angular resolutions, revealing the geometry
of the plume with unprecedented precision. Inferred properties for the
(unresolved) underlying binary and wind system are orbital period 241.5 +/- 0.5
days and angular outflow velocity of 0.28 +/- 0.02 mas/day. An optically thin
cavity of angular size 13.3 +/- 1.4 mas was found to lie between the central
binary and the onset of the spiral dust plume. Rotational motion of the wind
system induced by the binary orbit is found to have important ramifications:
entanglement of the winds results in strong shock activity far downstream from
the nose of the bowshock. The far greater fraction of the winds participating
in the collision may play a key role in gas compression and the nucleation of
dust at large radii from the central binary and shock stagnation point.
Investigation of the effects of radiative braking pointed towards significant
modifications of the simple hydrostatic colliding wind geometry, extending the
relevance of this phenomena to wider binary systems than previously considered.
Limits placed on the maximum allowed orbital eccentricity of e < 0.06 argue
strongly for a prehistory of tidal circularization in this system. Finally we

This has prevented many researchers from carefully considering their choice of

appear to be generally curved into a log-parabolic shape. In a previous
investigation of Mrk 421, two correlations were found between the spectral
parameters. One involves the height $S_p$ increasing with the position $E_p$ of
the first peak; this was interpreted as a signature of synchrotron emission
from relativistic electrons. The other involves the curvature parameter $b$
decreasing as $E_p$ increases; this points toward statistical/stochastic

relative U- and B- flux contribution by the earlier-type component of the

Psc, UX Ari, RS CVn, SZ Psc and AR Lac the existence of hot photospheric
faculae must be necessarily invoked. We also found that in single-lined and
double-lined binary stars in which the fainter component is inactive or much
less active the V magnitude is correlated to B-V and U-B color variations in
more than 60% of observation seasons. The correlation is found in less than 40%

star Z Andromedae, covering 112--yr of mostly visual observations. Two strictly
periodic and one quasi-periodic cycles can be identified in this LC. A P1=7550
d quasi periodicity characterizes the repetition time of the outburst episodes
of this symbiotic star. Six such events have been recorded so far. During
quiescence states of the system, i.e. in time intervals between outbursts, the
LC is clearly modulated by a stable coherent period of P2=759.1 d. This is the
well known orbital period of the Z And binary system that have been measured
also spectroscopically. A third coherent period of P3=658.4 d is modulating the
intense fluctuations in the optical brightness of the system during outbursts.
We attribute the trigger of the outbursts phenomenon and the clock that drives
it, to a solar type magnetic dynamo cycle that operates in the convection and
the outer layers of the giant star of the system. We suggest that the intense
surface activity of the giant star during maximum phases of its magnetic cycle
is especially enhanced in one or two antipode regions, fixed in the atmosphere
of the star and rotating with it. Such spots could be active regions around the
North and the South poles of a general magnetic dipole field of the star. The
P3 periodicity is half the beat of the binary orbital period of the system and
the spin period of the giant. The latter is then either 482 or 1790 d. If only
one pole is active on the surface of the giant, P3 is the beat period itself,
and the spin period is 352 d. It could also be 5000 d if the giant is rotating
in retrograde direction. We briefly compare these findings in the LC of Z And
to similar modulations that were identified in the LC of two other prototype
symbiotics, BF Cyg and YY Her.

ordering of genes. These substructures include stochastic proportionality of
expression signals in a large percentage of all gene pairs, negative
correlations hidden in ordered gene triples, and a long sequence of weakly
dependent random variables associated with ordered pairs of genes. The reported
striking regularities are of general biological interest and they also have
far-reaching implications for theory and practice of statistical methods of

testing differential expression of nonoverlapping gene pairs. While designed
for testing a different null hypothesis, this method provides an order of
magnitude more accurate control of type 1 error rate compared to conventional

area 50 x 70 $\mu$ $m^{2}$ at various temperatures. In order to analyze such

modified with the inclusion of a broadening parameter due to finite life time
effects of quasi particles. An additional voltage drop due to local electric
fields at the rough interface has been included in terms of an extra energy
shift which may be related to the asymmetry of normalized resistance data. Spin
polarization has been introduced for the ferromagnet. The presented model
explains the multi-peak nature and asymmetry of Andreev reflection data

interprets the experimentally observed anomalous enhancement of resistance
peaks in the sub-gap region which may result from crossing the critical current

J16493-4348 is not associated with PSR J1649-4349. Combining the INTEGRAL
observations with Swift/XRT data and information gathered by RXTE and Chandra
we suggest that IGR J16493-4348 is an X-ray binary; and that the source
characteristics favour a high mass X-ray binary although an LMXB nature cannot
be ruled out.

results show that a mutual interaction takes place between the two species in
the solid, which alters the band positions and band strengths. It is found that
the band strengths of the H2O bulk stretch, bending and libration vibrational
bands decrease linearly by a factor of up to 2 when the CO concentration is
increased from 0 to 80%. By contrast, the band strength of the free OH stretch
increases linearly. The results are compared to a recently performed
quantitative study on H2O:CO2 ice mixtures. It is shown that for mixing ratios
of 1:0.5 H2O:X and higher, the H2O bending mode offers a good tracer to
distinguish between CO2 or CO in H2O ice. Additionally, it is found that the
band strength of the CO fundamental remains constant when the water
concentration is increased in the ice. The integrated absorbance of the 2152
cm-1 CO feature, with respect to the total integrated CO absorption feature, is
found to be a good indicator of the degree of mixing of CO in the H2O:CO
laboratory ice system. From the change in the H2O absorption band strength in
laboratory ices upon mixing we conclude that astronomical water ice column
densities on various lines of sight can be underestimated by up to 25% if
significant amounts of CO and CO2 are mixed in.

mathematical model describing the morphological evolution of the powder in the

the kiln was modelled, including the exchanges between a dense phase (powder
bed) and an airborne phase (particles showering down). An original feature of
this model is to consider the effect of lifters for calculating the dynamic
variables. Secondly, the phenomena responsible for the changes in morphology

agglomerates was considered, whose number and size change due to Brownian and
sedimentation agglomeration, sintering, breaking up, and chemical reactions.
The model is based on population balances and the particle size distribution is
divided into sections. Results of both dynamic and morphological calculations

bullets reportedly to have been derived from the same batch as those used in
the assassination. The new analyses show that the bullet fragments involved in
the assassination are not nearly as rare as previously reported. In particular,
the new test results are compared to key bullet composition testimony presented
before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). Matches of bullets
within the same box of bullets are shown to be much more likely than indicated
in the House Select Committee on Assassinations' testimony. Additionally, we
show that one of the ten test bullets is considered a match to one or more
assassination fragments. This finding means that the bullet fragments from the
assassination that match could have come from three or more separate bullets.
Finally, this paper presents a case for reanalyzing the assassination bullet
fragments and conducting the necessary supporting scientific studies. These
analyses will shed light on whether the five bullet fragments constitute three
or more separate bullets. If the assassination fragments are derived from three
or more separate bullets, then a second assassin is likely, as the additional
bullet would not easily be attributable to the main suspect, Mr. Oswald, under
widely accepted shooting scenarios [see Posner (1993), Case Closed, Bantam, New

region ($r \le 6^\prime$) the slope of the mass function (MF), $\Gamma$, in the
mass range $\sim 1.0 \le M/M_\odot < 13.4$ can be represented by a power law
having a slope of $-1.38\pm0.12$, which agrees well with Salpeter value
(-1.35). In the mass range $0.3 \le M/M_\odot < 1.0$, the MF is also found to
follow a power law with a shallower slope of $\Gamma = -0.58\pm 0.23$
indicating a break in the slope of the IMF at $\sim 1 M_\odot$. The slope of
the $K$-band luminosity function for the cluster ($r \le 6^\prime$) is found to
be $0.31\pm0.02$, which is smaller than the average value ($\sim$ 0.4) obtained
for embedded star clusters. A significant number of YSOs are distributed along
a Nebulous Stream towards the east side of the cluster. A small cluster is
embedded in the Nebulous Stream. The YSOs lying in the Nebulous Stream and in
the embedded cluster are found to be younger than the stars in the cluster
Stock 8. It appears that star formation activity in the Nebulous Stream and
embedded cluster may be independent from that of Stock 8.

well-labeled tree bijection to the case of quadrangulations with a marked

enumeration. We obtain the generating functions for quadrangulations with a
marked geodesic of fixed length, as well as with a set of ""confluent

given points. In the limit of quadrangulations with a large area n, we find in
particular an average number 3*2^i of geodesics between two fixed points at
distance i>>1 from each other. We show that, for generic endpoints, two
confluent geodesics remain close to each other and have an extensive number of
contacts. This property fails for a few ""exceptional"" endpoints which can be
linked by truly distinct geodesics. Results are presented both in the case of
finite length i and in the scaling limit i ~ n^(1/4). In particular, we give
the scaling distribution of the exceptional points.

multipoles are also included. We evaluate the deformations induced by different
field configurations, paying special attention to those for which the star has
a prolate shape. We also explore the dependence of the stellar deformation on
the particular choice of the equation of state and on the mass of the star. Our
results show that, for neutron stars with mass M = 1.4 Msun and surface
magnetic fields of the order of 10^15 G, a quadrupole ellipticity of the order
of 10^(-6) - 10^(-5) should be expected. Low mass neutron stars are in
principle subject to larger deformations (quadrupole ellipticities up to
10^(-3) in the most extreme case). The effect of quadrupolar magnetic fields is
comparable to that of dipolar components. A magnetic field permeating the whole
star is normally needed to obtain negative quadrupole ellipticities, while
fields confined to the crust typically produce positive quadrupole
ellipticities.

  work by Sun, Yao and Preda is clarified",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A central question in quantum information theory and computational complexity
is how powerful nonlocal strategies are in cooperative games with imperfect
information, such as multi-prover interactive proof systems. This paper
develops a new method for proving limits of nonlocal strategies that make use
of prior entanglement among players (or, provers, in the terminology of
multi-prover interactive proofs). Instead of proving the limits for usual
isolated provers who initially share entanglement, this paper proves the limits
for ""commuting-operator provers"", who share private space, but can apply only
such operators that are commutative with any operator applied by other provers.
Commuting-operator provers are at least as powerful as usual isolated but
prior-entangled provers, and thus, limits for commuting-operator provers
immediately give limits for usual entangled provers. Using this method, we
obtain an n-party generalization of the Tsirelson bound for the Clauser-Horne-
Shimony-Holt inequality for every n. Our bounds are tight in the sense that, in
every n-party case, the equality is achievable by a usual nonlocal strategy
with prior entanglement. We also apply our method to a 3-prover 1-round binary
interactive proof for NEXP. Combined with the technique developed by Kempe,
Kobayashi, Matsumoto, Toner and Vidick to analyze the soundness of the proof
system, it is proved to be NP-hard to distinguish whether the entangled value
of a 3-prover 1-round binary-answer game is equal to 1 or at most 1-1/p(n) for
some polynomial p, where n is the number of questions. This is in contrast to
the 2-prover 1-round binary-answer case, where the corresponding problem is
efficiently decidable. Alternatively, NEXP has a 3-prover 1-round binary
interactive proof system with perfect completeness and soundness 1-2^{-poly}.

small differences between different trajectories. This nonlinear system
switches abruptly between ""self-maintained coherence"" and ""self-induced
