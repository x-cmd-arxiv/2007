Moreover, the degeneracy of the string state reproduces the parametric

it with the rotation of pure liquid crystal droplets. No enhancement was found,
confirming that photoinduced dye effects are only associated with an internal

periodic departures from a pure homeotropic texture. The texture modulation
acts as a grating for the incident light. The incident light is both directly

the capture range of common image similarity measures. We propose a fast and

1.5% of its main sequence life, and possibly still being on the pre-main

chemical abundances and no magnetic field.

disparity between the g-r color and the strength of the hydrogen Balmer lines
when the two observations are made at random phases. Comparison with a large
sample of known variables in the SDSS equatorial stripe (Stripe 82) shows that
the discovery efficiency for our technique is ~85%. Analysis of stars with
multiple spectroscopic observations suggests a similar efficiency throughout
the entire DR-6 sample. We also develop a technique to estimate the average g
apparent magnitude (over the pulsation cycle) for individual RR Lyrae stars,
using the <g-r> for the entire sample and measured colors for each star. The
resulting distances are found to have precisions of ~14%. Finally, we explore
the properties of our DR-6 sample of N = 1087 variables, and recover portions
of the Sagittarius Northern and Southern Stream. Analysis of the distance and
velocity for the Southern Stream are consistent with previously published data
for blue horizontal-branch stars. In a sample near the North Galactic Polar

contributes non-trivially to the gap equation of the ghost. The detailed study
of the corresponding vertex equation reveals that in the presence of a
dynamical infrared cutoff this form factor remains finite in the limit of
vanishing ghost momentum. This, in turn, allows the ghost self-energy to reach
a finite value in the infrared, without having to assume any additional

charged particle stopping power, in a weakly to moderately coupled plasma. This
method, called dimensional continuation, lies within the framework of
convergent kinetic equations, and it is powerful enough to allow for systematic
perturbative expansions in the plasma coupling constant. In particular, it
provides an exact evaluation of the stopping power to leading and
next-to-leading order in the plasma coupling, with the systematic error being
of cubic order. Consequently, the calculation is near-exact for a weakly
coupled plasma, and quite accurate for a moderately coupled plasma. The leading
order term in this expansion has been known since the classic work of Spitzer.
In contrast, the next-to-leading order term has been calculated only recently
by Brown, Preston, and Singleton (BPS), using the aforementioned method, to
account for all short- and long-distance physics accurate to second order in
the plasma coupling, including an exact treatment of the quantum-to-classical
scattering transition. Preliminary numerical studies suggest that the BPS
stopping power increases the ignition threshold, thereby having potential
adverse implications for upcoming high energy density facilities. Since the key
ideas behind the BPS calculation are possibly unfamiliar to plasma physicists,
and the implications might be important, I will use this opportunity to explain
the method in a pedagogical fashion.

introduced by Lichnerowicz and York, on a closed manifold. We establish
existence of non-CMC weak solutions using a combination of a priori estimates
for the individual Hamiltonian and momentum constraints, barrier constructions
for the Hamiltonian constraint, and topological fixed-point arguments. An
important new feature of these results is the absense of the near-CMC
assumption when the rescaled background metric is in the positive Yamabe class,
if the freely specifiable part of the data given by the matter fields (if
present) and the traceless-transverse part of the rescaled extrinsic curvature
are taken to be sufficiently small. In this case, the mean extrinsic curvature
can be taken to be an arbitrary smooth function without restrictions on the
size of its spatial derivatives, giving what are apparently the first non-CMC
existence results without the near-CMC assumption. Standard bootstrapping
arguments to increase the regularity of the conformal factor are blocked by the
use of a weak background metric. In the CMC case, we recover Maxwell's rough
solution results as a special case. Our results extend the 1996 non-CMC result
of Isenberg and Moncrief in three ways: (1) the near-CMC assumption is removed
in the case of the positive Yamabe class; (2) regularity is extended down to
the maximum allowed by the background metric and the matter; and (3) the result
holds for all three Yamabe classes. This last extension was also accomplished
recently by Allen, Clausen and Isenberg, although their result is restricted to
the near-CMC case and to smoother background metrics and data.

high energy scattering in Anti--de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. In particular, we
develop the eikonal approximation to high energy scattering in AdS and explore
its consequences for the dual Conformal Field Theory (CFT).
  Using position space Feynman rules, we rederive the eikonal approximation for
high energy scattering in flat space. Following this intuitive position space
perspective, we then generalize the eikonal approximation for high energy
scattering in AdS and other spacetimes. Remarkably, we are able to resum, in
terms of a generalized phase shift, ladder and cross ladder Witten diagrams
associated to the exchange of an AdS spin j field, to all orders in the
coupling constant.
  By the AdS/CFT correspondence, the eikonal amplitude in AdS is related to the
four point function of CFT primary operators in the regime of large 't Hooft
coupling, including all terms of the 1/N expansion. We then show that the
eikonal amplitude determines the behavior of the CFT four point function for
small values of the cross ratios in a Lorentzian regime and that this controls
its high spin and dimension conformal partial wave decomposition. These results
allow us to determine the anomalous dimension of high spin and dimension double
trace primary operators, by relating it to the AdS eikonal phase shift. Finally
we find that, at large energies and large impact parameters in AdS, the
gravitational interaction dominates all other interactions, as in flat space.
Therefore, the anomalous dimension of double trace operators, associated to
graviton exchange in AdS, yields a universal prediction for CFT's with AdS
gravitational duals.

dispersion of ~9 km/s, MOND is able to give a very good fit to the observed HI
flaring beyond a galactocentric distance of 17 kpc up to the last measured

about 40% more than what MOND predicts for the standard interpolating function

the non-thermal pressure support by cosmic rays and magnetic fields, MOND seems
to be a plausible alternative to dark matter in explaining the Milky Way
flaring. Studying the flaring of extended HI discs in external edge-on galaxies

to explore, via one dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, the expected thermal
properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the context of the cooling flow
problem. Energy injection from type Ia supernovae, thermal conduction, and
dynamical friction (DF) from orbiting satellite galaxies are considered. The
novel feature of this work is the exploration of a wide range of efficiencies
of each heating process. While the latter two can provide a substantial amount
of energy, neither mechanism operating alone can produce nor maintain an ICM in
thermal balance over cosmological timescales, in stark contrast with
observations. For simulated clusters with initially isothermal temperature
profiles, both mechanisms acting in combination result in long-term thermal
balance for a range of ICM temperatures and for central electron densities less
than n_e~0.02 cm^-3; at greater densities catastrophic cooling invariably
occurs. Furthermore, these heating mechanisms can neither produce nor maintain
clusters with a declining temperature profile in the central regions, implying
that the observed ""cooling-core'' clusters, which have such declining
temperature profiles, cannot be maintained with these mechanisms alone. Thus,
while there appears to be an abundant supply of energy capable of heating the
ICM in clusters, it is extremely difficult for the energy deposition to occur
in such a way that the ICM remains in thermal balance over cosmological
time-scales. These results strongly suggest that a more dynamic heating process
such as feedback from a central black hole is required to generate the
properties of observed intracluster media. (ABRIDGED)

change of h({\bf r}) is much larger than \lambda_{\text{\tiny F}}, the
electrons move along semiclassical trajectories. We demonstrate that a weak
field-induced curving of the trajectories affects the interaction-induced
electron lifetime in a singular fashion: it gives rise to the correction to the

the interval \omega \sim \omega_0= E_{\text{\tiny F}}{\cal N}_h^{2/3} much

  FORS1 at the ESO VLT/UT1 telescope in the B, R, and H_alpha bands. We also
used archival images of the same field obtained with the VLT in the B band and
with the Chandra/ACIS in X-rays.
  Results: In the B band we detected a faint (B=28.1+/-0.3) source that may be
the optical counterpart of PSR B1133+16, as it is positionally consistent with
the radio pulsar and with the X-ray counterpart candidate published earlier.
Its upper limit in the R band implies a color index B-R <0.5, which is
compatible with the index values for most pulsars identified in the optical
range. The derived optical luminosity and its ratio to the X-ray luminosity of
the candidate are consistent with expected values derived from a sample of
pulsars detected in both spectral domains. No Balmer bow shock was detected,
implying a low density of ambient matter around the pulsar. However, in the
X-ray and H_alpha images we found the signature of a trail extending ~4""-5""
behind the pulsar and coinciding with the direction of its proper motion. If
confirmed by deeper studies, this is the first time such a trail has been seen
in the optical and X-ray wavelengths.
  Conclusions: Further observations at later epochs are necessary to confirm
the identification of the pulsar by the candidate's proper motion measurements.

astrophysics. Understanding the formation of massive stars is essential because
they dominate the luminous, kinematic, and chemical output of stars.
Furthermore, their feedback is likely to play a dominant role in the evolution
of molecular clouds and any subsequent star formation therein. Although
significant progress has been made observationally and theoretically, we still
do not have a consensus as to how massive stars form. There are two contending
models to explain the formation of massive stars, Core Accretion and
Competitive Accretion. They differ primarily in how and when the mass that
ultimately makes up the massive star is gathered. In the core accretion model,
the mass is gathered in a prestellar stage due to the overlying pressure of a
stellar cluster or a massive pre-cluster cloud clump. In contrast, competitive
accretion envisions that the mass is gathered during the star formation process
itself, being funneled to the centre of a stellar cluster by the gravitational
potential of the stellar cluster. Although these differences may not appear
overly significant, they involve significant differences in terms of the
physical processes involved. Furthermore, the differences also have important
implications in terms of the evolutionary phases of massive star formation, and
ultimately that of stellar clusters and star formation on larger scales. Here
we review the dominant models, and discuss prospects for developing a better
understanding of massive star formation in the future.

noise for LISA, the future space-based gravitational wave observatory. Until
very recently, the Galactic population consisted of a relatively well studied
disk population, a somewhat studied smaller bulge population and a mostly
unknown, but potentially large halo population. It has been argued that the
halo population may produce a signal that is much stronger (factor of ~5 in
spectral amplitude) than the disk population. However, this surprising result
was not based on an actual calculation of a halo white dwarf population but was
derived on (i) the assumption that one can extrapolate the halo population
properties from those of the disk population and (ii) the postulated
(unrealistically) high number of white dwarfs in the halo. We perform the first
calculation of a halo white dwarf population using population synthesis models.
Our comparison with the signal arising from double white dwarfs in the Galactic
disk+bulge clearly shows that it is impossible for the double white dwarf halo
signal to exceed that of the rest of the Galaxy. Using microlensing results to
give an upper limit on the content of white dwarfs in the halo (~30 % baryonic
mass in white dwarfs), our predicted halo signal is a factor of 10 lower than
the disk+bulge signal. Even in the implausible case where all of the baryonic
halo mass is found in white dwarfs, the halo signal does not become comparable
to that of the disk+bulge, and thus would still have a negligible effect on the
detection of other LISA sources.

larger radii the kinematics undergo a gradual but major transition to random
motion with little rotation. This transition does not seem to reflect a change
in the viewing geometry or the presence of a distinct halo component, since the
number counts of PNe follow the same simple exponential decline as the stellar
continuum with the same projected disc ellipticity out to large radii. The
galaxy's small companion, NGC 1023A, does not seem to be large enough to have
caused the observed modification either. This combination of properties would
seem to indicate a complex evolutionary history in either the transition to
form an S0 or in the past life of the spiral galaxy from which the S0 formed.
More data sets of this type from both spirals and S0s are needed in order to
definitively determine the relationship between these types of system.

from excited states it is much more difficult to get a H neutral disk than
indicated by previous analytical calculations. Near the poles, the ionization
is high in all models, while helium recombined in the equatorial regions for
all but our lowest mass-loss rate. Although the model parameters were not

  with unreliable feedback","20 pages, 6 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information
  Theory, an earlier version was presented at ITA '07 in UCSD",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  The traditional information theoretic approach to studying feedback is to
consider ideal instantaneous high-rate feedback of the channel outputs to the
encoder. This was acceptable in classical work because the results were
negative: Shannon pointed out that even perfect feedback often does not improve
capacity and in the context of symmetric DMCs, Dobrushin showed that it does
not improve the fixed block-coding error exponents in the interesting high rate
regime. However, it has recently been shown that perfect feedback does allow
great improvements in the asymptotic tradeoff between end-to-end delay and
probability of error, even for symmetric channels at high rate. Since gains are
claimed with ideal instantaneous feedback, it is natural to wonder whether
these improvements remain if the feedback is unreliable or otherwise limited.
  Here, packet-erasure channels are considered on both the forward and feedback
links. First, the feedback channel is considered as a given and a strategy is
given to balance forward and feedback error correction in the suitable
information-theoretic limit of long end-to-end delays. At high enough rates,
perfect-feedback performance is asymptotically attainable despite having only
unreliable feedback! Second, the results are interpreted in the zero- sum case
of ""half-duplex"" nodes where the allocation of bandwidth or time to the
feedback channel comes at the direct expense of the forward channel. It turns
out that even here, feedback is worthwhile since dramatically lower asymptotic
delays are possible by appropriately balancing forward and feedback error
correction.
  The results easily generalize to channels with strictly positive
zero-undeclared-error capacities.

and gas profiles, we impose a uniform $10^{-9}$ G magnetic field and follow its
collapse, disk formation and evolution up to 1 Gyr. Comparing to a purely
hydrodynamic simulation with the same initial condition, we find that a
protogalactic field of this strength does not significantly influence the
global disk properties. At the same time, the initial magnetic fields are
quickly amplified by the differentially rotating turbulent disk. After the
initial rapid amplification lasting $\sim500$ Myr, subsequent field
amplification appears self-regulated. As a result, highly magnetized material
begin to form above and below the disk. Interestingly, the field strengths in
the self-regulated regime agrees well with the observed fields in the Milky Way
galaxy both in the warm and the cold HI phase and do not change appreciably
with time. Most of the cold phase shows a dispersion of order ten in the
magnetic field strength. The global azimuthal magnetic fields reverse at
different radii and the amplitude declines as a function of radius of the disk.
By comparing the estimated star formation rate (SFR) in hydrodynamic and MHD
simulations, we find that after the magnetic field strength saturates, magnetic
forces provide further support in the cold gas and lead to a decline of the
SFR.

  lossless source-coding","25 pages, 17 figures. Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on
  Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  Inspired by the context of compressing encrypted sources, this paper
considers the general tradeoff between rate, end-to-end delay, and probability
of error for lossless source coding with side-information. The notion of
end-to-end delay is made precise by considering a sequential setting in which
source symbols are revealed in real time and need to be reconstructed at the
decoder within a certain fixed latency requirement. Upper bounds are derived on
the reliability functions with delay when side-information is known only to the
decoder as well as when it is also known at the encoder.
  When the encoder is not ignorant of the side-information (including the
trivial case when there is no side-information), it is possible to have
substantially better tradeoffs between delay and probability of error at all
rates. This shows that there is a fundamental price of ignorance in terms of
end-to-end delay when the encoder is not aware of the side information. This
effect is not visible if only fixed-block-length codes are considered. In this
way, side-information in source-coding plays a role analogous to that of
feedback in channel coding.
  While the theorems in this paper are asymptotic in terms of long delays and
low probabilities of error, an example is used to show that the qualitative
effects described here are significant even at short and moderate delays.

Src A is an extended source located at the peak position of HESS J1614-518, and
therefore it is a plausible counterpart to HESS J1614-518. The X-ray flux in
the 2-10 keV band is 5e-13 erg/s/cm^2, which is an order of magnitude smaller
than the TeV flux. The photon index is 1.7, which is smaller than the canonical
value of synchrotron emissions from high-energy electrons found in some
supernova remnants. These findings present a challenge to models in which the
origin of the TeV emission is the inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic
microwave background by accelerated electrons that emit X-rays via synchrotron
emission. Src B is located at a relatively dim region in the TeV band image;
however, its hydrogen column density is the same as that of src A. Therefore,
src B may also be physically related to HESS J1614-518. Src C is a foreground

The work could be extended straightforwardly yet tediously to perform mirror
symmetry on a general intersecting brane configuration and to compute Yukawa

Consequently we can apply all existing dimension reduction methods to
measurement error regression problems. The equivalence holds exactly for
multivariate normal predictors, and approximately for arbitrary predictors. We
also characterize the rate of convergence for the surrogate dimension reduction
estimators. Finally, we apply several dimension reduction methods to real and

turbulent flow requires closures for the pressure Hessian and viscous Laplacian
of A. Based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian change of variables and the so-called
Recent Fluid Deformation closure, such models were proposed recently. The
resulting stochastic model was shown to reproduce many geometric and anomalous
scaling properties of turbulence. In this work, direct comparisons between
model predictions and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data are presented.
First, statistical properties of A are described using conditional averages of
strain skewness, enstrophy production, energy transfer and vorticity
alignments, conditioned upon invariants of A. These conditionally averaged
quantities are found to be described accurately by the stochastic model. More
detailed comparisons that focus directly on the terms being modeled in the
closures are also presented. Specifically, conditional statistics associated
with the pressure Hessian and the viscous Laplacian are measured from the model
and are compared with DNS. Good agreement is found in strain-dominated regions.
However, some features of the pressure Hessian linked to rotation dominated
regions are not reproduced accurately by the model. Geometric properties such
as vorticity alignment with respect to principal axes of the pressure Hessian
are mostly predicted well. In particular, the model predicts that an
eigenvector of the rate-of-strain will be also an eigenvector of the pressure
Hessian, in accord to basic properties of the Euler equations. The analysis
identifies under what conditions the Eulerian-Lagrangian change of variables
with the Recent Fluid Deformation closure works well, and in which flow regimes
it requires further improvements.

consistent and asymptotically efficient, as expected. The method applies to
semiparametric regression models with unspecified covariances among the
observations. In the special case of linear models, the procedure reduces to
iterative reweighted least squares. Finite sample performance of the procedure
is studied by simulations, and compared with other methods. A numerical example
from a medical study is considered to illustrate the application of the method.

optimality in a rather general setting under very mild conditions on the prior.

and planet formation. Many theoretical studies, focussing on different aspects
such as e.g. disk emissivity or ionization, have been conducted in the context
of the Standard Accretion Disk (SAD) model, where no jet is present. We wish to
calculate the structure of YSO accretion disks in an approach that takes into
account the presence of the protostellar jets. The radial structure of these
Jet Emitting Disks (JED) should then be compared to that of standard accretion
disks. The analytical treatment used in this work is very similar to that of
standard accretion disks but is using the parameter space of Magnetised
Accretion-Ejection Structures that include the jet torque on the underlying
disk. In this framework, the analytical expressions of key quantities, such as
mid-plane temperatures, surface densities or disk aspect ratio are derived. It
is found that JEDs present a structure very different from the SADs and that
can be observationally tested. The implications on planet formation in the
inner regions of accretion disks are briefly discussed. We also supply sets of
analytical formulae, valid in different opacity regimes, for the disk
quantities. These expressions can be readily used for any work where the disk
structure is needed as an input for the model.

Galaxies (BCGs) using a carefully selected sample of 85 BCGs from the C4
cluster catalogue with redshift less than 0.1. We perform accurate background
subtractions, and surface photometry for these BCGs to 25 $\magsec$ in the
Sloan $r$-band. By quantitatively analysing the gradient of the Petrosian
profiles of BCGs, we find that a large fraction of BCGs have extended stellar
envelopes in their outskirts; more luminous BCGs tend to have more extended
stellar halos that are likely connected with mergers. A comparison sample of
elliptical galaxies was chosen with similar apparent magnitude and redshift
ranges, for which the same photometric analysis procedure is applied. We find
that BCGs have steeper size-luminosity ($R \propto L^\alpha$) and Faber-Jackson
($L \propto \sigma^\beta$) relations than the bulk of early type galaxies.
Furthermore, the power-law indices ($\alpha$ and $\beta$) in these relations
increase as the isophotal limits become deeper. For isophotal limits from 22 to
25 $\magsec$, BCGs are usually larger than the bulk of early type galaxies, and
a large fraction ($\sim 49%$) of BCGs have disky isophotal shapes. The
differences in the scaling relations are consistent with a scenario where the
dynamical structure and formation route of BCGs may be different from the bulk
of early type galaxies, in particular dry (dissipationless) mergers may play a
more important role in their formation; we highlight several possible dry
merger candidates in our sample.

shot noise applicable in the whole range of relevant bias and gate voltages.
Suppression of the TMR due to inelastic cotunneling and super-Poissonian shot
noise have been found in some of the Coulomb blockade regions. Furthermore, in
the Coulomb blockade regime there is an additional contribution to the noise
due to bunching of cotunneling processes involving the spin-majority electrons.
On the other hand, in the sequential tunneling regime TMR oscillates with the
bias voltage, while the current noise is generally sub-Poissonian.

we calculate expected time lags for high-energy (100 TeV) neutrinos in

focus on five: $\Lambda$CDM, quintessence, quintessence with time varying
equation of state, brane-world and generalized Chaplygin gas model as

Mirroring Neural Network is a neural network that can be trained with

used for unsupervised pattern classification using Forgy's algorithm. By
adapting the non-linear activation function (modified sigmoidal function) and
initializing the weights and bias terms to small random values, mirroring of
the input pattern is initiated. In training, the weights and bias terms are
changed in such a way that the input presented is reproduced at the output by
back propagating the error. The mirroring neural network is capable of reducing
the input vector to a great degree (approximately 1/30th the original size) and
also able to reconstruct the input pattern at the output layer from this
reduced code units. The feature set (output of central hidden layer) extracted
from this network is fed to Forgy's algorithm, which classify input data
patterns into distinguishable classes. In the implementation of Forgy's
algorithm, initial seed points are selected in such a way that they are distant
enough to be perfectly grouped into different categories. Thus a new method of
unsupervised learning is formulated and demonstrated in this paper. This method
gave impressive results when applied to classification of different image

to describe the midrapidity hadron production in relativistic heavy-ion

Thermodynamic properties of the quark-gluon plasma are taken from lattice
simulations, at low temperatures the hadron-gas equation of state is used,
while in the cross-over region an interpolation between the two equations of
state is constructed. The initial condition for hydrodynamics is obtained from
a Glauber profile for the entropy, with the initial central temperature Ti. The
conditions obtained from the hydrodynamic expansion at the freeze-out
temperature Tf are used as input for the thermal event generator THERMINATOR.
Basic physical observables are obtained: the transverse-momentum spectra, the
elliptic flow coefficient v2, and the HBT radii. The femtoscopic observables
are evaluated with the help of the two-particle method which accounts for the
resonance decays and Coulomb final-state interactions. The problem of a
simultaneous description of all discussed observables is addressed, with the
conclusion that at the highest RHIC energies our approach gives a quite
satisfactory global description of soft hadronic observables. Some
discrepancies may be attributed to the absence of the final-state elastic
interactions among hadrons. Extrapolating Ti to higher values allows for global
predictions for soft hadronic physics at the LHC. We test Ti=400, 450, and 500
MeV, and observe the expected growth of particle multiplicities and the
increase of the flow, resulting in smaller slopes of the pT-spectra. The

different notions of program equivalence. This is due to the fact that
equivalence for substitution (known as strong equivalence) and ordinary
equivalence are different concepts. The former holds, given programs P and Q,
iff P can be faithfully replaced by Q within any context R, while the latter
holds iff P and Q provide the same output, that is, they have the same answer
sets. Notions in between strong and ordinary equivalence have been introduced
as theoretical tools to compare incomplete programs and are defined by either
restricting the syntactic structure of the considered context programs R or by
bounding the set A of atoms allowed to occur in R (relativized equivalence).For
the latter approach, different A yield properly different equivalence notions,
in general. For the former approach, however, it turned out that any
``reasonable'' syntactic restriction to R coincides with either ordinary,
strong, or uniform equivalence. In this paper, we propose a parameterization
for equivalence notions which takes care of both such kinds of restrictions
simultaneously by bounding, on the one hand, the atoms which are allowed to
occur in the rule heads of the context and, on the other hand, the atoms which
are allowed to occur in the rule bodies of the context. We introduce a general
semantical characterization which includes known ones as SE-models (for strong
equivalence) or UE-models (for uniform equivalence) as special cases.
Moreover,we provide complexity bounds for the problem in question and sketch a
possible implementation method.

molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. It is found that the thermal conductivity
of SiNWs can be reduced exponentially by isotopic defects at room temperature.
The thermal conductivity reaches the minimum, which is about 27% of that of
pure 28Si NW, when doped with fifty percent isotope atoms. The thermal
conductivity of isotopic-superlattice structured SiNWs depends clearly on the
period of superlattice. At a critical period of 1.09 nm, the thermal
conductivity is only 25% of the value of pure Si NW. An anomalous enhancement
of thermal conductivity is observed when the superlattice period is smaller
than this critical length. The ultra-low thermal conductivity of superlattice
structured SiNWs is explained with phonon spectrum theory.

operator for the su(2) sector of the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, are
considered in the anti-ferromagnetic regime. These equations are deformation of
those for the Heisenberg XXX magnet. It is proven that in the thermodynamic
limit roots of the deformed equations group into strings. It is proven that the
corresponding Yang's action is convex, which implies uniqueness of solution for
centers of the strings. The state formed of strings of length (2n+1) is
considered and the density of their distribution is found. It is shown that the
energy of such a state decreases as n grows. It is observed that
non-analyticity of the left hand side of the Bethe equations leads to an
additional contribution to the density and energy of strings of even length.
Whence it is concluded that the structure of the anti-ferromagnetic vacuum is
determined by the behaviour of exponential corrections to string solutions in
the thermodynamic limit and possibly involves strings of length 2.

and a circumbinary disc leads to the formation of a large inner cavity in the
disc. Subsequent formation and inward migration of a low mass planet causes it
to become trapped at the cavity edge, where it orbits until further mass growth
or disc dispersal. The question of how systems of multiple planets in
circumbinary discs evolve has not yet been addressed. Here, we present a suite
of simulations which study the evolution of pairs of planets migrating in the
disc. We also present the results of hydrodynamic simulations of five-planet
systems, and study their long term evolution after disc dispersal using a
N-body code. For the two-planet simulations we assume that the innermost planet
has migrated to the edge of the inner cavity and remains trapped there, and
study the subsequent evolution of the system as the outermost planet migrates
inward. We find that the outcomes largely depend on the mass ratio q=m_i/m_o,
where m_i (m_o) is the mass of the innermost (outermost) planet. For q<1,
planets usually undergo dynamical scattering or orbital exchange. For values of
q>1 the systems reach equilibrium configurations in which the planets are
locked into mean motion resonances, and remain trapped at the edge of the inner
cavity without further migration. Most simulations of five-planet systems we
performed resulted in collisions and scattering events, such that only a single
planet remained in orbit about the binary. In one case however, a multiplanet
resonant system was found to be dynamically stable over long time scales,
suggesting that such systems may be observed in planet searches focussed on
close binary systems.

valence band fully filled by electrons) supports a nonzero persistent current,
because each atomic orbital overlaps with its own tail when making one loop
around the ring. In the tight-binding limit only the neighboring orbitals
overlap. In that limit the persistent current at full filling becomes zero

with individual detections and flux measurements at 8, 24, 70 and 160 um. We
have spectroscopic redshifts for 93% of these sources, and accurate photometric
redshifts for the remainder. We also used a stacking analysis to measure the IR
fluxes of fainter sources at higher redshifts. We show that the monochromatic
mid and far-infrared luminosities are strongly correlated with the total
infrared luminosity and our stacking analysis confirms that these correlations
also hold at higher redshifts. We provide relations between monochromatic
luminosities and total infrared luminosities L_IR that should be reliable up to
z~2 (z~1.1) for ULIRGs (LIRGs). In particular, we can predict L_IR with
accuracies of 37% and 54% from the 8 and 24 um fluxes, while the best tracer is
the 70 um flux. Combining bands leads to slightly more accurate estimates. For
example, combining the 8 and 24 um luminosities predicts L_IR with an accuracy
of 34%. Our results are generally compatible with previous studies, and the
small changes are probably due to differences in the sample selection criteria.
We can rule out strong evolution in dust properties with redshift up to z~1.

chromatin has in recent years been identified as carrying an epigenetic code
regulating transcriptional activity. The detailed knowledge of this code
contrasts the ignorance of the fiber structure which it regulates, and none of
the suggested fiber models are capable of predicting the most basic quantities
of the fiber (diameter, nucleosome line density, etc.). We address this
three-decade-old problem by constructing a simple geometrical model based on
the nucleosome shape alone. Without fit parameters we predict the observed
properties of the condensed chromatin fiber (e.g. its 30 nm diameter), the
structure, and how the fiber changes with varying nucleosome repeat length. Our
approach further puts the plethora of previously suggested models within a
coherent framework, and opens the door to detailed studies of the interplay
between chromatin structure and function.

this growing controversy over forensic science has occurred precisely at the
time that DNA evidence has become the ``gold standard'' in the courts, leading
to the overturning of hundreds of convictions many of which were based on
clearly less credible forensic evidence, including eyewitness testimony [Berger

give a proof that the coherent information is an achievable rate for
entanglement transmission through a noisy quantum channel. The codes are random
subspaces selected according to the Haar measure, but distorted as a function
of the sender's input density operator. Using large deviations techniques, we
show that classical data transmitted in either of two Fourier-conjugate bases
for the coding subspace can be decoded with low probability of error. A
recently discovered information-uncertainty relation then implies that the
quantum mutual information for entanglement encoded into the subspace and
transmitted through the channel will be high. The monogamy of quantum
correlations finally implies that the environment of the channel cannot be
significantly coupled to the entanglement, and concluding, which ensures the
existence of a decoding by the receiver.

is subject to local constraints on its geometry. This framework is applied to
describe the patterns of a folded sheet of paper. The unstretchability of paper
implies a constraint on the surface metric; bending is penalized by an energy
quadratic in mean curvature. The local Lagrange multipliers enforcing the
constraint are identified with a conserved tangential stress that couples to
the extrinsic curvature of the sheet. The framework is illustrated by examining
the deformation of a flat sheet into a generalized cone.

as the Kauffman skein module is a deformation of a 2-move, i.e. a crossing
change). Our main tools are Jones and Kauffman polynomials and the fundamental
group of the 2-fold branch cover of S^3 along a link. We use also the fact that
a 5-move is a composition of two rational \pm (2,2)-moves (i.e. \pm 5/2-moves)
and rational moves can be analyzed using the group of Fox colorings and its
non-abelian version, the Burnside group of a link. One curious observation is
that links related by one (2,2)-move are not 5-move equivalent. In particular,
we partially classify (up to 5-moves)
  3-braids, pretzel and Montesinos links, and links up to 9 crossings.
