stable and can play the role of dark matter. We consider the possibilities of
gluing two identical slices of 5D AdS in either the UV (IR-UV-IR model) or the
IR region (UV-IR-UV model) and discuss the model-building issues as well as
phenomenological properties in both cases. In particular, we find that the
UV-IR-UV model is not gravitationally stable and that additional mechanisms
might be required in the IR-UV-IR model in order to address flavor issues.
Collider signals of the warped KK parity are different from either the
conventional warped extra dimension without KK parity, in which the new
particles are not necessarily pair-produced, or the KK parity in flat universal
extra dimensions, where each KK level is nearly degenerate in mass. Dark matter
and collider properties of a TeV mass KK Z gauge boson as the LKP are
discussed.

dominate Higgs boson final states, thereby evading the LEP constraints on
standard Higgs boson production. The light spin-zero state decays primarily via
a to bb and tau+tau-, so this signal channel retains features distinct from the
main backgrounds. Our study shows that at the Tevatron, there may be potential
to observe a few events in the bb tau+tau- or bbbb channels with relatively
small background, although this observation would be statistically limited. At
the LHC, the background problem is more severe, but with cross sections and
integrated luminosities orders of magnitude larger than at the Tevatron, the
observation of a Higgs boson in this decay mode would be possible. The channel
h to aa to bbbb would provide a large statistical significance, with a
signal-to-background ratio on the order of 1:2. In these searches, the main
challenge would be to retain the adequate tagging efficiency of b's and tau's

equilibrium inversions of the data to obtain the magnetic field, once including
the Ca spectra. We find that the emission in the Ca II H line core at locations
without detectable photospheric polarization signal is due to waves that
propagate from low forming continuum layers in the line wing up to the line
core. The phase differences of intensity oscillations at different wavelengths
indicate standing waves for v < 2 mHz and propagating waves for higher
frequencies. The waves steepen into shocks in the chromosphere. On average,
shocks are both preceded and followed by intensity reductions. In field-free
regions, the profiles show emission about half of the time. The correlation
between wavelengths and the decorrelation time is significantly higher in the
presence of magnetic fields than for field-free areas. The average Ca II H
profile in the presence of magnetic fields contains emission features symmetric
to the line core and an asymmetric contribution, where mainly the blue H2V
emission peak is increased. We find that acoustic waves steepening into shocks
are responsible for the emission in the Ca II H line core for locations without
photospheric magnetic fields. We suggest using wavelengths in the line wing of

estimates of Burgers-turbulence properties for specific types of white-in-time
forcing. Existing mathematical relations between Burgers turbulence and the
statistical mechanics of directed polymers, allowing use of the replica method,
are exploited to obtain systematic upper bounds on the Burgers energy density,
corresponding to the ground-state binding energy of the directed polymer and
the speedup of the Huygens front. The results are complementary to previous
studies of both Burgers turbulence and directed polymers, which have focused on
universal scaling properties instead of forcing-dependent parameters. The
upper-bound formula can be heuristically understood in terms of renormalization
of a different kind from that previously used in combustion models, and also
shows that the burning velocity of an idealized turbulent flame does not
diverge with increasing Reynolds number at fixed turbulence intensity, a
conclusion that applies even to strong turbulence. Numerical simulations of the
one-dimensional inviscid Burgers equation using a Lagrangian finite-element
method confirm that the theoretical upper bounds are sharp within about 15% for
various forcing spectra (corresponding to various two-dimensional random
media). These computations provide a new quantitative test of the replica

compact knot of radio emission adjacent (in projection) to a companion galaxy,
after which it dramatically flares and bends, extending out in a diffuse

situ high-energy particle acceleration, we argue that the jet-companion
interaction is not a steady-state situation. Instead, we suggest that the jet
has been disrupted on a timescale less than the light travel time to the end of
the lobe, $\sim 10^6$ years, and that the jet flow to this hotspot will only be
disrupted for as long as the jet-companion interaction takes place. The host
galaxy of 3C 321 and the companion galaxy are in the process of merging, and
each hosts a luminous AGN. As this is an unusual situation, we investigate the
hypothesis that the interacting jet has driven material on to the companion
galaxy, triggering its AGN. Finally, we present detailed radio and X-ray
observations of both hotspots, which show that there are multiple emission
sites, with spatial offsets between the radio and X-ray emission.

The observed infrared (IR) radiation arises from the interaction of dust grains
that formed in mass outflow with the soft X-ray emitting plasma component of
the shocked gas. Spitzer IRS spectra at 5 - 30 microns taken on day 6190 since
the explosion show that the emission arises from ~ 1.1E-6 Msun of silicate
grains radiating at a temperature of ~180+20-15 K. Subsequent observations on
day 7137 show that the IR flux had increased by a factor of 2 while maintaining
an almost identical spectral shape. The observed IR-to-X-ray flux ratio (IRX)
is consistent with that of a dusty plasma with standard Large Magellanic Cloud
dust abundances. IRX has decreased by a factor of ~ 2 between days 6190 and
7137, providing the first direct observation of the ongoing destruction of dust
in an expanding SN blast wave on dynamic time scales. Detailed models
consistent with the observed dust temperature, the ionization timescale of the

radiating silicate grains are immersed in a 3.5E6 K plasma with a density of
(0.3-1)E4 cm^{-3}, and have a size distribution that is confined to a narrow
range of radii between 0.023 and 0.22 microns. Smaller grains may have been

the systems lie well below with a large scatter. All this suggests a picture in
which DLAs undergo successive star-bursts. During such an episode, the [N/O]

time. The nodes in the network represent firms, whereas the directed links
represent unilateral interactions between the firms. Both nodes and links
evolve according to their own dynamics and on different time scales. The model
assumes that firms produce knowledge based on the knowledge exchange with other
firms, which involves both costs and benefits for the participating firms. In
order to increase their knowledge production, firms follow different strategies
to create and/or to delete links with other firms. Dependent on the information
firms take into account for their decision, we find the emergence of different
network structures. We analyze the conditions for the existence of these
structures within a mathematical approach and underpin our findings by
extensive computer simulations which show the evolution of the networks and
their equilibrium state. In the discussion of the results, particular attention
is given to the emergence of direct and indirect reciprocity in knowledge
exchange, which refers to the emergence of cycles in the network structure. In
order to motivate our modeling framework, in the first part of the chapter we
give a broad overview of existing literature from economics and physics. This
shows that our framework bridges and extends two different lines of research,
namely the study of equilibrium networks with simple topologies and the dynamic
approach of hypercycle models.

radiatively driven stellar winds, we examine here the additional dynamical
effects of stellar {\em rotation} in the (still) 2-D axisymmetric case of an
aligned dipole surface field. In addition to the magnetic confinement parameter
$\eta_{\ast}$ introduced in Paper I, we characterize the stellar rotation in
terms of a parameter $W \equiv V_{\rm{rot}}/V_{\rm{orb}}$ (the ratio of the
equatorial surface rotation speed to orbital speed), examining specifically
models with moderately strong rotation $W =$ 0.25 and 0.5, and comparing these
to analogous non-rotating cases. Defining the associated Alfv\'{e}n radius
$R_{\rm{A}} \approx \eta_{\ast}^{1/4} \Rstar$ and Kepler corotation radius
$R_{\rm{K}} \approx W^{-2/3} \Rstar$, we find rotation effects are weak for
models with $R_{\rm{A}} < R_{\rm{K}}$, but can be substantial and even dominant
for models with $R_{\rm{A}} \gtwig R_{\rm{K}}$. In particular, by extending our
simulations to magnetic confinement parameters (up to $\eta_{\ast} = 1000$)
that are well above those ($\eta_{\ast} = 10$) considered in Paper I, we are
able to study cases with $R_{\rm{A}} \gg R_{\rm{K}}$; we find that these do
indeed show clear formation of the {\em rigid-body} disk predicted in previous
analytic models, with however a rather complex, dynamic behavior characterized
by both episodes of downward infall and outward breakout that limit the buildup
of disk mass. Overall, the results provide an intriguing glimpse into the
complex interplay between rotation and magnetic confinement, and form the basis
for a full MHD description of the rigid-body disks expected in strongly
magnetic Bp stars like $\sigma$ Ori E.

lies at binding energy about 3.2Ep; the OC band maximum is at the photon energy
about 4.2Ep. The half-widths of the bands are mainly determined by Ep and
slightly depend on Frohlich electron-phonon coupling constant: for its value
6-8 the ARPES band half-width is 1.7-1.3Ep and the OC band half-width is
2.8-2.2Ep. Using these results one can predict approximate position of ARPES

nearby flaring M dwarf star. During a 61-ks ACIS-S exposure, a very large flare
occurred (the equivalent of a solar X3400 event, with L_X = 1.8x10^30 ergs/s)
in which the count rate increased by a factor of over 100. The early phase of
the flare shows evidence for the Neupert effect, followed by a further rise and
then a two-component exponential decay. A large flare was also observed at the
end of a later 48-ks HRC-I observation. Emission from the non-flaring phases of
both observations was analyzed for evidence of low level flaring. From these
temporal studies we find that microflaring probably accounts for most of the
`quiescent' emission, and that, unlike for the Sun and the handful of other
stars that have been studied, the distribution of flare intensities does not
appear to follow a power-law with a single index. Analysis of the ACIS spectra,
which was complicated by exclusion of the heavily piled-up source core,
suggests that the quiescent Ne/O abundance ratio is enhanced by a factor of
~2.5 compared to the commonly adopted solar abundance ratio, and that the Ne/O
ratio and overall coronal metallicity during the flare appear to be enhanced
relative to quiescent abundances. Based on the temperatures and emission
measures derived from the spectral fits, we estimate the length scales and
plasma densities in the flaring volume and also track the evolution of the
flare in color-intensity space. Lastly, we searched for a stellar-wind
charge-exchange X-ray halo around the star but without success; because of the
relationship between mass-loss rate and the halo surface brightness, not even
an upper limit on the stellar mass-loss rate can be determined.

Two periodic drives, shifted one from another, are applied at two locations of

Analytical expressions are obtained for the pumped charge, current noise, and
Fano factor in different regimes. This allows to explore pumping for the whole

charge quantization is close to the optimum value: a single electron charge is
transferred in one cycle. Interactions can improve the situation, the charge

the case of relatively high electron density, when the Fermi energy $E_{F}$

$V_{donors}$, the density spin polarization inside the wire is practically
negligible and the wire conductance is spin-degenerate. When the density is
decreased such that $E_{F}$ approaches $V_{donors}$, the electron density and
conductance quickly become spin polarized. With further decrease of the density
the electrons are trapped inside the lakes (droplets) formed by the impurity

turns out that near 10^6 Msol their properties change fundamentally: stellar
populations become complex, a galaxial mass--radius relation emerges and the
median two-body relaxation time becomes longer than a Hubble time.
Intriguingly, only systems with a two-body relaxation time longer than a Hubble

slowly evolving Si II 6355 line velocity (LVG). Since the two groups have
comparable luminosities, the temperature at the photosphere is higher in LVG
SNe. This explains the different overall spectral appearance of HVG and LVG
SNe. However, the variation of the Ca II and Si II absorptions at the highest
velocities (v >~ 20,000 km/s) suggests that additional factors, such as
asphericity or different abundances in the progenitor white dwarf, affect the
outermost layers. The C II 6578 line is marginally detected in 3 LVG SNe,
suggesting that LVG undergo less intense burning. The carbon mass fraction is
small, only less than 0.01 near the photosphere, so that he mass of unburned C

background light over cosmological distances via the process of
electron-positron pair production. Recent observations of cosmologically
distant gamma-ray emitters by ground based gamma-ray telescopes have, however,
revealed a surprising degree of transparency of the universe to very high
energy photons. One possible mechanism to explain this observation is the
oscillation between photons and axion-like-particles (ALPs). Here we explore
this possibility further, focusing on photon-ALP conversion in the magnetic
fields in and around gamma-ray sources and in the magnetic field of the Milky
Way, where some fraction of the ALP flux is converted back into photons. We
show that this mechanism can be efficient in allowed regions of the ALP
parameter space, as well as in typical configurations of the Galactic Magnetic
Field. As case examples, we consider the spectrum observed from two HESS
sources: 1ES1101-232 at redshift z=0.186 and H 2356-309 at z=0.165. We also
discuss features of this scenario which could be used to distinguish it from

significantly improve bounds on cosmological parameters compared to an analysis
which treats $Y_p$ as a free parameter, if the neutrino chemical potential is
taken to vanish. We demonstrate that fixing the Helium fraction to an arbitrary
value can seriously bias parameter estimates. Under the assumption of
degenerate BBN (i.e., letting the neutrino chemical potential $\xi$ vary), the
BBN prior's constraining power is somewhat weakened, but nevertheless allows us
to constrain $\xi$ with an accuracy that rivals bounds inferred from present

early-type galaxies whose HI properties are known from interferometric data.
Our aim is to understand whether stellar age and chemical composition depend on
the HI content of galaxies. As a by-product of our analysis, we also study
their ionised gas content and how it relates to the neutral hydrogen gas.
Stellar populations and ionised gas are studied from optical long-slit spectra.
We determine stellar age, metallicity and alpha-to-iron ratio by analysing a
set of Lick/IDS line-strength indices measured from the spectra after modelling
and subtracting the ionised-gas emission. We do not find any trend in the
stellar populations parameters with M(HI). However, we do find that, at stellar
velocity dispersion below 230 km/s, 2/3 of the galaxies with less than 100
million solar masses of HI are centrally rejuvenated, while none of the
HI-richer systems are. Furthermore, none of the more massive
(velocity-dispersion>230 km/s) objects are centrally rejuvenated independently
on their HI mass. Concerning the ionised gas, we detect emission in 60% of the
sample. This is generally extended and always carachterised by LINER-like
emission-line ratios at any radius. We find that a large HI mass is necessary
(but not sufficient) for a galaxy to host bright ionised-gas emission. A
plausible interpretation of our results is that gas-rich mergers play a
significant role in E/S0 formation, especially at lower mass. Within this
picture, HI-poor, centrally-rejuvenated objects could form in mergers where gas
angular-momentum removal (and therefore inflow) is efficient; HI-rich galaxies
with no significant age gradients (but possibly uniformly young) could be
formed in interactions characterised by high-angular momentum gas.

novel tertiary constraints which are also first class. Once the constraints and

We consider the case when the adversary has access to the subsource

rate-distortion function is determined to be the maximum of the IID
rate-distortion function over a set of source distributions attainable by the
adversary. We then extend the results to allow for partial or noisy
observations of subsource realizations. We further explore the model by
attempting to find the rate-distortion function when the adversary is actually
helpful.
  Finally, a bound is developed on the uniform continuity of the IID
rate-distortion function for finite-alphabet sources. The bound is used to give
a sufficient number of distributions that need to be sampled to compute the
rate-distortion function of an AVS to within a certain accuracy. The bound is

Sagittarius A* from radio to X-ray wavelengths. On a few occasions,
simultaneous flares have been detected in IR and X-ray observations, but clear
counterparts at longer wavelengths have not been seen. We present a flare
observed over several hours on 2006 July 17 with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory,
the Keck II telescope, the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, and the
Submillimeter Array. All telescopes observed strong flare events, but the
submillimeter peak is found to occur nearly 100 minutes after the X-ray peak.
Submillimeter polarization data show linear polarization in the excess flare
emission, increasing from 9% to 17% as the flare passes through its peak,
consistent with a transition from optically thick to thin synchrotron emission.
The temporal and spectral behavior of the flare require that the energetic
electrons responsible for the emission cool faster than expected from their
radiative output. This is consistent with adiabatic cooling in an expanding
emission region, with X-rays produced through self-Compton scattering, although
not consistent with the simplest model of such expansion. We also present a
submillimeter flare that followed a bright IR flare on 2005 July 31. Compared
to 2006, this event had a larger peak IR flux and similar submillimeter flux,
but it lacked measurable X-ray emission. It also showed a shorter delay between
the IR and submillimeter peaks. Based on these events we propose a synchrotron
and self-Compton model to relate the submillimeter lag and the variable
IR/X-ray luminosity ratio.

In this paper we initiate the study of the kinematic dynamo in a partially
ionized turbulent plasma. The Hall effect arises from the treatment of the
electrons and the ions as two separate fluids and the ambipolar diffusion due
to the inclusion of neutrals as the third fluid. It is shown that these
nonideal effects modify the so called $\alpha$ effect and the turbulent
diffusion coefficient $\beta$ in a rather substantial way. The Hall effect may
enhance or quench the dynamo action altogether. The ambipolar diffusion brings
in an $\alpha$ which depends on the mean magnetic field. The new correlations
embodying the coupling of the charged fluids and the neutral fluid appear in a
decisive manner. The turbulence is necessarily magnetohydrodynamic with new
spatial and time scales. The nature of the new correlations is demonstrated by
taking the Alfv\'enic turbulence as an example.

simultaneous light curves of Sgr A* in radio, sub-mm and X-rays that show a
possible time delay of 110$\pm17$ minutes between X-ray and 850 $\mu$m
suggesting that the sub-mm flare emission is optically thick. At radio
wavelengths, we detect time lags of of $20.4\pm6.8, 30\pm12$ and 20$\pm6$
minutes between the flare peaks observed at 13 and 7 mm (22 and 43 GHz) in

0.7$\pm0.1$% is detected at 7 and 13 mm, respectively, when averaged over the

between various wavelengths, the asymmetric shape of the light curves, and the
observed polarization of the flare emission at 43 and 22 GHz. The derived
physical quantities that characterize the emission give an expansion speed of
v$_{exp} \sim 0.003-0.1$c, magnetic field of B$\sim$10-70 Gauss and particle
spectral index p$\sim$1-2. These parameters suggest that the associated plasma

rates for this reaction produce negligible changes to the stellar yields,
whereas the upper limit of the rate affects the production of 19F and 21Ne. The
stellar yields increase by ~50% to up to a factor of 4.5 for 19F, and by
factors of ~2 to 9.6 for 21Ne. While the 18}F(a,p)21Ne reaction competes with
18O production, the extra protons released are captured by 18O to facilitate
the 18O(p,a)15N(a,g)19F chain. The higher abundances of 19F obtained using the
upper limit of the rate helps to match the [F/O] ratios observed in AGB stars,
but only for large C/O ratios. Extra-mixing processes are proposed to help to
solve this problem. Some evidence that the 18F(a,p)21Ne rate might be closer to
its upper limit is provided by the fact that the higher calculated 21Ne/22Ne
ratios in the He intershell provide an explanation for the Ne isotopic
composition of silicon-carbide grains from AGB stars. This needs to be
confirmed by future experiments of the 18F(a,p)21Ne reaction rate. The
availability of accurate fluorine yields from AGB stars will be fundamental for
interpreting observations of this element in carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars.

high momentum regime of QCD, is employed for the formulation of baryonic
transition amplitudes via quark loops. A new aspect of this study is the role
of a direct ($Y$-shaped, Mercedes-Benz type) $qqq$ force in generating the
$qqq$ wave function. The dynamics is that of a Salpeter-like equation (3D
support for the kernel) formulated covariantly on the light front, a la
Markov-Yukawa Transversality Principle (MYTP) which warrants a 2-way
interconnection between the 3D and 4D Bethe-Salpeter (BSE) forms for 2 as well
as 3 fermion quarks. The dynamics of this 3-body force shows up through a
characteristic singularity in the hypergeometric differential equation for the
3D wave function $\phi$, corresponding to a $negative$ eigenvalue of the spin
operator $i \sigma_1.\sigma_2\times \sigma_3$ which is an integral part of the
$qqq$ force. As a first application of this wave function to the problem of the
proton spin anomaly, the two-gluon contribution to the anomaly yields an
estimate of the right sign, although somewhat smaller in magnitude.

challenging for conventional theoretical acceleration and emission models. We
re-examine the centrifugal acceleration of particles by rotating jet
magnetospheres in the vicinity of accreting supermassive black hole systems and
analyze the energy constraints imposed for highly underluminous systems.
Applications are presented for conditions expected to be present in the radio
galaxy M87, assuming accretion onto the central black hole to occur in an
advection-dominated (ADAF) mode. We show that for a highly underluminous source
like M87, centrifugally accelerated electrons may reach Lorentz factors up to
$\gamma \sim (10^7-10^8)$, allowing inverse Compton (Thomson) upscattering of
sub-mm disk photons to the TeV regime. Upscattering of Comptonized disk photons
results in a flat TeV spectrum $L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{-\alpha_c}$ with spectral
index $\alpha_c \simeq 1.2$. The characteristic variability time scale is of
the order $r_{\rm L}/c$, which in the case of M87 corresponds to $\simeq 1.7$ d
for a typical light cylinder radius of $r_{\rm L} \simeq 5 r_{\rm s}$.
Centrifugal acceleration could thus provide a natural explanation for the
challenging VHE emission features in M87. Our results suggest that some
advection-dominated accreting (non-blazar) AGNs could well be observable VHE
emitting sources. (abridged)

fundamental premise on which modern cosmology is based. Fractal dimensions of
matter distribution is a parameter that can be used to test the hypothesis of
homogeneity. In this method, galaxies are used as tracers of the distribution
of matter and samples derived from various galaxy redshift surveys have been
used to determine the scale of homogeneity in the Universe. Ideally, for
homogeneity, the distribution should be a mono-fractal with the fractal
dimension equal to the ambient dimension. While this ideal definition is true
for infinitely large point sets, this may not be realised as in practice, we
have only a finite point set. The correct benchmark for realistic data sets is
a homogeneous distribution of a finite number of points and this should be used
in place of the mathematically defined fractal dimension for infinite number of
points (D) as a requirement for approach towards homogeneity. We derive the
expected fractal dimension for a homogeneous distribution of a finite number of
points. We show that for sufficiently large data sets the expected fractal
dimension approaches D in absence of clustering. It is also important to take
the weak, but non-zero amplitude of clustering at very large scales into
account. In this paper we also compute the expected fractal dimension for a
finite point set that is weakly clustered. Clustering introduces departures in
the Fractal dimensions from D and in most situations the departures are small
if the amplitude of clustering is small. Features in the two point correlation
function, like those introduced by Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) can lead
to non-trivial variations in the Fractal dimensions where the amplitude of
clustering and deviations from D are no longer related in a monotonic manner.

neglected. A state of the system is described by its one-body density matrix,
an infinite rank self-adjoint operator which is a compact perturbation of the
negative spectral projector of the free Dirac operator (the Dirac sea).
  We study the minimization of the reduced BDF energy under a charge
constraint. We prove the existence of minimizers for a large range of values of
the charge, and any positive value of the coupling constant $\alpha$. Our
result covers neutral and positively charged molecules, provided that the
positive charge is not large enough to create electron-positron pairs. We also
prove that the density of any minimizer is an $L^1$ function and compute the
effective charge of the system, recovering the usual renormalization of charge:
the physical coupling constant is related to $\alpha$ by the formula
$\alpha_{\rm phys}\simeq \alpha(1+2\alpha/(3\pi)\log\Lambda)^{-1}$, where
$\Lambda$ is the ultraviolet cut-off. We eventually prove an estimate on the
highest number of electrons which can be bound by a nucleus of charge $Z$. In

approximation, SBA). Using results from extreme value statistics the SBA allows
to study ensembles with fixed defect density which gives accurate results, e.g.
for the expectation value of the current. Corrections to SBA come from
effective interactions of bottlenecks close to the longest one. Defects close
to the boundaries can be described by effective boundary rates and lead to
shifts of the phase transitions. Finally it is shown that the SBA also works
for more complex models. As an example we discuss a model with internal states
that has been proposed to describe transport of the kinesin KIF1A.

flow from a circumstellar disc into a magnetospheric funnel flow onto a slow
rotating young forming star. Methods : New analytical constraints on the
formation of accretion funnels flows due to the presence of a dipolar stellar
magnetic field disrupting the disc are derived. The Versatile Advection Code is
used to confirm these constraints numerically. Axisymmetric MHD simulations are
performed, where a stellar dipole field enters the resistive accretion disc,
whose structure is self-consistently computed. Results : The analytical
criterion derived allows to predict a priori the position of the truncation
radius from a non perturbative accretion disc model. Accretion funnels are
found to be robust features which occur below the co-rotation radius, where the
stellar poloidal magnetic pressure becomes both at equipartition with the disc
thermal pressure and is comparable to the disc poloidal ram pressure. We
confirm the results of Romanova et al. 2002 and find accretion funnels for
stellar dipole fields as low as 140 G in the low accretion rate limit of
$10^{-9} M_\odot.yr^{-1}$. With our present numerical setup with no disc
magnetic field, we found no evidence of winds, neither disc driven nor X-winds,
and the star is only spun up by its interaction with the disc. Conclusions :
Weak dipole fields, similar in magnitude to those observed, lead to the
development of accretion funnel flows in weakly accreting T Tauri stars.
However, the higher accretion observed for most T Tauri stars (${\dot M} \sim
10^{-8} M_\odot.yr^{-1}$) requires either larger stellar field strength and/or
different magnetic topologies to allow for magnetospheric accretion.

more, of the cycle period. We present analytical descriptions of the expected

introduced. Our main finding is that for the Sun-like frequency shifts the
distortion of the asymmetrical Lorentzian-like profiles is very small, but also
just detectible. Our analysis indicates that by fitting modes to the usual
Lorentzian-like models -- which do not allow for the distortion -- rather than
new models we derive, there is a bias in the mode height and linewidth
parameters that is comparable in size to the observational uncertainties given
by multi-year datasets. Bias in the frequency parameter gives much less cause
for worry, being over an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding
frequency uncertainties. The distortion discussed in this paper may need to be
considered when multi-year Sun-like asteroseismic datasets are analyzed on

The observed weak linear dependence is not sufficient to produce any

SAW chains are mutually avoiding, whereas in the second model (CSAWs) chains
can cross each other. By applying an exact Renormalization Group (RG) method,
we establish the relevant phase diagrams for $b=2,3$ and $b=4$ members of the

sufficient to cause an increase of T_c, which is consistent with the present
experiments, but adverse to previous reports. For 5H and 6H the softening
provides the mechanism to understand the observed increase of T_c with

Spitzer IRAC. We select high probability candidate Class 0-I protostars,
distinguishing between those having a spectral energy distribution which rises
from K up to 8 microns (Class 0-Ia) from those where the SED rises from K up to
4.5 microns and decreasing afterwards (Class 0-Ib). We select a sample of bona

with normal photospheres. Our principal result is that Class 0-Ia objects are
significantly less luminous in X-rays, both in the total and hard bands, than
the more evolved Class II stars with mass larger than 0.5 Msun; these latter
show X-ray luminosities similar to those of Class 0-Ib stars. This result
supports the hypothesis that the onset of X-ray emission occurs at a very early
stage of star formation. Temporal variability and spectral properties of Class

detection of blueshifted absorption lines of highly ionized iron at energies
usually greater than ~7 keV. The lack of sensitivity of present day X-ray
observatories at these energies gives rise to bias against the detection of
more ``extreme'' outflows, with highest velocity and ionization, which would be
blueshifted at energies >10 keV. Thus, simulations with Simbol-X were carried
out to test its capability of detecting absorption lines/edges between 5-20
keV, in order to probe the dynamics (i.e. measurement of velocity variations)
of the absorbing gas, as well as the highest (up to relativistic speeds)

$\sim$1.3x10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$ of molecular gas, which has been proposed to be
captured from mergers with or ram-pressure stripping of gas-rich galaxies, or
accreted from a X-ray cooling flow. The molecular gas detected in our image has
a total mass of $\sim$4x10$^9$ M$_\odot$, and for the first time can be seen to
be concentrated in three radial filaments with lengths ranging from at least
1.1-2.4 kpc all lying in the east-west directions spanning the center of the
galaxy to radii of $\sim$8 kpc. The eastern and outer western filaments exhibit
larger blueshifted velocities with decreasing radii, whereas the inner western
filament spans the systemic velocity of the galaxy. The molecular gas shows no
signature of orbital motion, and is therefore unlikely to have been captured
from gas-rich galaxies. Instead, we are able to reproduce the observed
kinematics of the two outer filaments as free-fall in the gravitational
potential of Per A, as would be expected if they originate from a X-ray cooling
flow. Indeed, all three filaments lie between two prominent X-ray cavities
carved out by radio jets from Per A, and closely resembles the spatial
distribution of the coolest X-ray gas in the cluster core. The inferred
mass-deposition rate into the two outermost filaments alone is roughly 75
M$_odot$ yr$^{-1}$. This cooling flow can provide a nearly continuous supply of

  turbulence",,"Physics of Fluids 19 (2007) 025104","10.1063/1.2565563",,"physics.class-ph",,"  A model based on two-point closure theory of turbulence is proposed and
applied to study the Reynolds number dependency of the scalar flux spectra in
homogeneous shear flow with a cross-stream uniform scalar gradient. For the
cross-stream scalar flux, in the inertial range the spectral behavior agrees
with classical predictions and measurements. The streamwise scalar flux is
found to be in good agreement with the results of atmospheric measurements.
However, both the model results and the atmospheric measurements disagree with
classical predictions. A detailed analysis of the different terms in the
evolution equation for the streamwise scalar flux spectrum shows that nonlinear
contributions are governing the inertial subrange of this spectrum and that
these contributions are relatively more important than for the cross-stream
flux. A new expression for the scalar flux spectra is proposed. It allows us to
unify the description of the components in one single expression, leading to a
classical K^-7/3 inertial range for the cross-stream component and to a new
K^-23/9 scaling for the streamwise component that agrees better with
atmospheric measurements than the K^-3 prediction of J. C. Wyngaard and O. R.

young stars. In this review, I present the latest results obtained on the
rotational properties of low mass and very low mass pre-main sequence stars. I
discuss the evidence for extremely efficient angular momentum removal over the
first few Myr of pre-main sequence evolution and describe recent results that
support an accretion-driven braking mechanism. Angular momentum evolution
models are presented and their implication for accretion disk lifetimes
discussed.
