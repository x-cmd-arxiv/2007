illuminate the relationship between satellites and dark matter subhalos and aid
in developing and testing galaxy formation models. Previous efforts to
constrain the distribution attempted to eliminate interlopers from the measured
projected number density of satellites and found that the distribution is
generally consistent with the expected dark matter halo profile of the parent
hosts, with a best-fit power-law slope of ~ -1.7 between projected separations
of ~30 kpc/h and 0.5 Mpc/h. Here, I use the projected cross-correlation of
bright and faint galaxies to analyze contributions from satellites and
interlopers together, using a halo occupation distribution (HOD) analytic model
for galaxy clustering. This approach is tested on mock catalogs constructed
from simulations. I find that analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data
gives results generally consistent with interloper subtraction methods between
the projected separations of 10 kpc/h and 6.3 Mpc/h, although the errors on the
parameters that constrain the radial profile are large, and larger samples of
data are required.

matter, haloes and galaxies. This is done within the context of the halo model
of structure formation, as this allows for the self-consistent inclusion of
linear and non-linear redshift space distortions and also for the non-linearity
of the halo bias. The model is applicable over a wide range of scales: on the
largest scales the predictions reduce to those of the standard perturbation
theory (PT); on smaller scales they are determined primarily by the nonlinear
virial velocities of galaxies within haloes, and this gives rise to the
U-shaped anisotropy in the reduced bispectrum -- a finger print of the
Finger-Of-God distortions. We then confront the predictions with bispectrum
measurements from an ensemble of numerical simulations. On very large scales,
k=0.05 h/Mpc, we find reasonably good agreement between our Halo Model, PT and
the data, to within the errors. On smaller scales, k=0.1 h/Mpc, the measured
bispectra differ from the PT at the level of 10-20%, especially for colinear
triangle configurations. The Halo Model predictions improve over PT, but are
accurate to no better than 10%. On smaller scales k=0.5-1.0 h/Mpc, our model
provides a significant improvement over PT, which breaks down. This implies
that studies which use the lowest order PT to extract galaxy bias information
are not robust on scales k>0.1 h/Mpc. The analytic and simulation results also
indicate that there is no observable scale for which the configuration
dependence of the reduced bispectrum is constant--hierarchical models for the
higher order correlation functions in redshift space are unlikely to be useful.
It is hoped that our model will facilitate extraction of information from
large-scale structure surveys of the Universe.

together with prior mathematical analysis concerning the influence of a delay
distribution on system dynamics raises the question whether a broad delay
distribution can impact the dynamics of neural feedback loops. For a system of
reciprocally connected model neurons, we found that distributed delays enhance
system stability in the following sense. With increased distribution of delays,
the system converges faster to a fixed point and converges slower toward a
limit cycle. Further, the introduction of distributed delays leads to an
increased range of the average delay value for which the system's equilibrium
point is stable. The enhancement of stability with increasing delay
distribution is caused by the introduction of smaller delays rather than the

physics under extreme conditions. During the recent years, our knowledge of the
most violent phenomena in the Universe has impressively progressed thanks to
the advent of new detectors for high-energy gamma-rays. Observation of
gamma-rays gives an exciting view of the high-energy universe thanks to
satellite-based telescopes (AGILE, GLAST) and to ground-based detectors like
the Cherenkov telescopes (H.E.S.S. and MAGIC in particular), which recently
discovered more than 60 new very-high-energy sources. The progress achieved
with the last generation of Cherenkov telescopes is comparable to the one drawn
by EGRET with respect to the previous gamma-ray satellite detectors. This
article reviews the present status of high-energy gamma astrophysics, with
emphasis on the recent results and on the experimental developments.

Si nanospheres in glass, we develop an anisotropic bond model (ABM) that
expresses SHG in terms of physically meaningful parameters and provides a
detailed understanding of the basic physics of SHG on the atomic scale.
Nonlinear-optical (NLO) responses are calculated classically via the four
fundamental steps of optics: evaluate the local field at a given bond site,
solve the force equation for the acceleration of the charge, calculate the
resulting radiation, then superpose the radiation from all charges. The ABM
goes beyond previous bond models by including the complete set of underlying
contributions: retardation (RD), spatial-dispersion (SD), and magnetic (MG)
effects, in addition to the anharmonic restoring force acting on the bond
charge. We apply the ABM to obtain analytic expressions for SHG from amorphous
materials under Gaussian-beam excitation. These materials represent an
interesting test case not only because they are ubiquitous but also because the
anharmonic-force contribution that dominates the SHG response of crystalline
materials and ordered interfaces vanishes by symmetry. Using the paraxial-ray
approximation, we reduce the results to the isotropic case in two limits, that
where the linear restoring force dominates (glasses), and that where it is
absent (metals). Both forward- and backscattering geometries are discussed.
Estimated signal strengths and conversion efficiencies for fused silica appear
to be in general agreement with data, where available. Predictions are made
that allow additional critical tests of these results.

an efficient phase. Specifically, we calculate the dependence of the critical

and RX J1308.6+2127/RBS 1223) either lack an optical counterpart or have one
too faint to be used for astrometric purposes. We obtained ACIS observations 3
to 5 years apart to constrain or measure the displacement of the sources on the
X-ray sky using as reference the background of extragalactic or remote galactic
X-ray sources. Upper limits of 138 mas/yr and 76 mas/yr on the proper motion of
RX J0420.0-5022 and RX J0806.4-4123, respectively, have already been presented
in Motch et al. (2007). Here we report the very significant measurement (~ 10
sigma) of the proper motion of the third INS of our program, RX
J1308.6+2127/RBS1223. Comparing observations obtained in 2002 and 2007 reveals
a displacement of 1.1 arcsec implying a yearly proper motion of 223 mas, the
second fastest measured for the ROSAT discovered INSs. The source is rapidly
moving away from the galactic plane at a speed which precludes any significant
accretion of matter from the interstellar medium. Its transverse velocity of ~
740 (d/700pc) km/s might be the largest of the ""Magnificent Seven"" and among
the fastest recorded for neutron stars. RX J1308.6+2127/RBS1223 is thus a young
high velocity cooling neutron star. The source may have its origin in the
closest part of the Scutum OB2 association about 0.8 Myr ago, an age consistent
with that expected from cooling curves, but significantly younger than inferred
from pulse timing measurements (1.5 Myr).

single template family. `Complete' binary black-hole waveforms can now be
produced by matching post-Newtonian waveforms with those computed by numerical

templates. The `complete' waveforms can also be used to estimate the efficiency
of different search methods aiming to detect signals from black-hole
coalescences. This paper summarises some recent efforts in this direction.

find that the hypotheses that LSB galaxies have stellar populations dominated
by low-mass stars, i.e., very bottom-heavy IMFs (see Lee et al. 2004), can be
ruled out. Such models predict much too high N/O-ratios and generally too low
O/H-ratios. We also conclude that LSB galaxies probably have the same ages as
their high surface brightness counterparts, although the global rate of star
formation must be considerably lower in these galaxies.

more obscured than those with PBLs. Adding the measured obscuration indicators

specific perturbations in parameters that have significant effects on the
behavior of a given biosystem, at the scale investigated. In this work, using a
two-dimensional, multiscale non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) model, we
examine the effects of perturbations in system parameters which span both
molecular and cellular levels, i.e. across scales of interest. This is achieved
by first linking molecular and cellular activities and then assessing the
influence of parameters at the molecular level on the tumor's spatio-temporal
expansion rate, which serves as the output behavior at the cellular level.
Overall, the algorithm operated reliably over relatively large variations of
most parameters, hence confirming the robustness of the model. However, three
pathway components (proteins PKC, MEK, and ERK) and eleven reaction steps were
determined to be of critical importance by employing a sensitivity coefficient
as an evaluation index. Each of these sensitive parameters exhibited a similar
changing pattern in that a relatively larger increase or decrease in its value
resulted in a lesser influence on the system's cellular performance. This study
provides a novel cross-scaled approach to analyzing sensitivities of
computational model parameters and proposes its application to
interdisciplinary biomarker studies.

"0712.0375","Matvei Libine","Matvei Libine","Hyperbolic Cauchy Integral Formula for the Split Complex Numbers",,,,,"math-ph math.MP",,"  In our joint papers [FL1-FL2] we revive quaternionic analysis and show deep
relations between quaternionic analysis, representation theory and
four-dimensional physics. As a guiding principle we use representation theory
of various real forms of the conformal group. We demonstrate that the
requirement of unitarity of representations naturally leads us to the
extensions of the Cauchy-Fueter and Poisson formulas to the Minkowski space,
which can be viewed as another real form of quaternions. However, the Minkowski
space formulation also brings some technical difficulties related to the fact
that the singularities of the kernels in these integral formulas are now
concentrated on the light cone instead of just a single point in the initial
quaternionic picture. But the same phenomenon occurs when one passes from the
complex numbers to the split complex numbers (or hyperbolic algebra). So, as a
warm-up example we proved an analogue of the Cauchy integral formula for the
split complex numbers. On the other hand, there seems to be sufficient interest
in such formula among physicists. For example, see [KS] and the references
therein.

star formation. In a companion paper, we explored this connection by applying a
variety of statistics to SDSS data. In particular, we showed that specific star
formation rates of galaxies are higher if they have close neighbours. Here we
apply exactly the same techniques to AGN in the survey, showing that close
neighbours are not associated with any similar enhancement of nuclear activity.
Star formation is enhanced in AGN with close neighbours in exactly the same way
as in inactive galaxies, but the accretion rate onto the black hole, as
estimated from the extinction-corrected [O III] luminosity, is not influenced
by the presence or absence of companions. Previous work has shown that galaxies
with more strongly accreting black holes contain more young stars in their
inner regions. This leads us to conclude that star formation induced by a close
companion and star formation associated with black hole accretion are distinct
events. These events may be part of the same physical process, for example a
merger, provided they are separated in time. In this case, accretion onto the
black hole and its associated star formation would occur only after the two
interacting galaxies have merged. The major caveat in this work is our
assumption that the extinction-corrected [O III] luminosity is a robust
indicator of the bolometric luminosity of the central black hole. It is thus
important to check our results using indicators of AGN activity at other
wavelengths.

for the branes and the intersection are found. We find new self-accelerating
solutions. In a 6d spacetime, the solutions realize the see-saw modification of
gravity where the UV scale of the modification to 4d gravity is determined by
6d Planck scale given by $M_6 \sim 10^{-3}$eV and the IR scale of the
modification is determined by $M_6^2/M_4 \sim H_0 \sim 10^{-42}$ GeV where
$H_0$ is present-day Hubble scale. We find that it is increasingly difficult to
construct phenomenologically viable models in higher-dimensional spacetime due
to the necessity to have the lower value for the fundamental Planck scale to
realize the late time acceleration. It is found that the system also admits
self-tuning solutions where the tension at the intersection does not change the
geometry of the intersection. The induced gravity terms can avoid the necessity
to compactify the extra dimensions. Finally, we discuss the possibility to have
ordinary matter at the intersection, without introducing any regularisation,
using the induced gravity terms.

a combinatorial simplicial complex based on proximity of neighbors that serves

  We demonstrate that this projection map is 1-connected for the planar case

connectivity and fundamental group data. This implies that the fundamental
group of a Rips complex for a planar point set is a free group. We show that,
in contrast, introducing even a small amount of uncertainty in proximity
detection leads to `quasi'-Rips complexes with nearly arbitrary fundamental
groups. This topological noise can be mitigated by examining a pair of
quasi-Rips complexes and using ideas from persistent topology. Finally, we show
that the projection map does not preserve higher-order topological data for
planar sets, nor does it preserve fundamental group data for point sets in

by introducing a double bracket dissipation in kinetic equations using an

equations generalize the Debye-Hueckel equations for attracting round
particles, and Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations for spin waves in magnetized

extend our theory to the dissipative motion of self-interacting curves.

  evaporation","27 pages, 5 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.79.024015",,"hep-th gr-qc",,"  We aim to quantify the distribution of information in the Hawking radiation
and inside the black hole in the semiclassical evaporation process. The
structure quantum field theory forces to consider a shared information between
two different regions of space-time. Using this tool, we show that the entropy
of a thermal gas at the Unruh temperature underestimates the actual amount of
(shared) information present in a region of the Rindler space. Then, we analyze
the mutual information between the black hole and the late time radiation
region. We show that in the semiclassical picture it is not possible to recover
the eventual purity of the initial state in the final Hawking radiation through
correlations established during the whole evaporation period, no matter the
interactions present in the theory. We find extensivity of the entropy as a
consequence of a reduction to a two dimensional conformal problem in a simple
approximation. However, this seems not to be guaranteed in a full four
dimensional calculation. We also find that a large amount of information is
contained in a small approximately flat region of space-time near the point
where the horizon begins. This gives place to large violations of the entropy
bounds. This problem is not eased by backscattering effects and we argue that a
breaking of conformal invariance is necessary to delocalize the entropy.
Finally, we indicate that the mutual information could lead to a way to
understand the Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy which does not require a
reduction in degrees of freedom in order to regulate the entanglement entropy.
On the contrary a large number of field degrees of freedom at high energies
giving place to a Hagedorn transition implements a distance cutoff in the
mutual information, which may in consequence turn out to be bounded.

found that for the majority of sources, the ratio of these fluxes is smaller

redshift during the radius expansion episodes (for a 2M_sun neutron star). The
only sources for which this ratio is larger than 1.6 are high inclination
sources that include dippers and Cyg X-2. We discuss two possible geometric
interpretations of this effect and show that the inferred masses and radii of

uncertainties as large as ~50% may be introduced to the distance determination.

several random paths are obtained and the longest taken). The convergence to
the longest path and its properties ire characterized with respect to several

the lowering of electron kinetic energy through maximization of the overlap of
neighboring molecular orbitals over the entire doping range x = 3 to 5. In the
insulating and metallic phases this gives rise to orbital versions of the
superexchange and double-exchange interactions respectively.

variety of behavior, including superconductivity and magnetism in bulk

stems from the existence of many competing interactions, such as
electron-electron correlations, electron-vibration coupling, and intermolecular

difficulty of experimentally isolating the effects of a single interaction in
the intricate fulleride materials. Here we report a unique level of control of
the material properties of KxC60 ultra-thin films through well-controlled
atomic layer indexing and accurate doping concentrations. Using STM techniques,
we observe a series of electronic and structural phase transitions as the
fullerides evolve from two-dimensional monolayers to quasi-threedimensional
multilayers in the early stages of layer-by-layer growth. These results
demonstrate the systematic evolution of fulleride electronic structure and
molecular ordering with variable KxC60 film layer index, and shed new light on
creating novel molecular structures and devices.

  comments, main conclusions unchanged, accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1086/589820",,"astro-ph",,"  (Abridged) We here study the structure of a hyperaccretion disk around a
neutron star. We consider a steady-state hyperaccretion disk around a neutron
star, and as a reasonable approximation, divide the disk into two regions,
which are called inner and outer disks. The outer disk is similar to that of a
black hole and the inner disk has a self-similar structure. In order to study
physical properties of the entire disk clearly, we first adopt a simple model,
in which some microphysical processes in the disk are simplified, following
Popham et al. and Narayan et al. Based on these simplifications, we
analytically and numerically investigate the size of the inner disk, the
efficiency of neutrino cooling, and the radial distributions of the disk
density, temperature and pressure. We see that, compared with the black-hole
disk, the neutron star disk can cool more efficiently and produce a much higher
neutrino luminosity. Finally, we consider an elaborate model with more physical
considerations about the thermodynamics and microphysics in the neutron star
disk (as recently developed in studying the neutrino-cooled disk of a black
hole), and compare this elaborate model with our simple model. We find that
most of the results from these two models are basically consistent with each
other.

""analogue spacetimes'' provide one with concrete models of ""emergence''

high-energy microphysics). They also provide many concrete and controlled
models of ""Lorentz symmetry breaking'', and extensions of the usual notions of
pseudo-Riemannian geometry such as ""rainbow spacetimes'', and pseudo-Finsler
geometries, and more. I will provide an overview of the key items of ""unusual
physics'' that arise in analogue spacetimes, and argue that they provide us
with hints of what we should be looking for in any putative theory of ""quantum

known emergent/analogue spacetimes typically violate analogue Lorentz
invariance at high energy, but do not do so in completely arbitrary manner.
This suggests that a search for arbitrary violations of Lorentz invariance is
possibly overkill: There are a number of natural and physically well-motivated
restrictions one can put on emergent/ analogue dispersion relations,
considerably reducing the plausible parameter space.

irregulars, without bulges, while many low redshift SN Ic hosts are spirals

stem from very massive stars, then it seems plausible that the conditions
necessary for forming SN Ic are also required for LGRB. Additional factors,

magnetic field strengths that were at least as strong within a few Gyr of the
Big Bang as at the current epoch. We separately investigate a simple unevolving
toy model in which the RM is produced by MgII absorber systems, and find that
it can approximately reproduce the observed trend with redshift. An additional
possibility is that the intrinsic RM associated with the radio sources was much
higher in the past, and we show that this is not a trivial consequence of the

collection of smaller elements separated by voids. We propose a model for the
structure of a self-gravitating rubble pile. Static friction prevents its
elements from sliding relative to each other. Stresses are concentrated around
points of contact between individual elements. The effective dimensionless
rigidity, $\tilde\mu_{rubble}$, is related to that of a monolithic body of
similar composition and size, $\tilde\mu$ by $\tilde \mu_{rubble} \sim \tilde
\mu^{1/2} \epsilon_Y^{-1/2}$, where $\epsilon_Y \sim 10^{-2}$ is the yield
strain. This represents a reduction in effective rigidity below the maximum
radius, $R_{max}\sim [\mu\epsilon_Y/(G\rho^2)]^{1/2}\sim 10^3\km$, at which a
rubble pile can exist. Densities derived for binary near-Earth asteroids imply
that they are rubble piles. As a consequence, their tidal evolution proceeds
$10^3$ to $10^4$ times faster than it would if they were monoliths. This
accounts for both the sizes of their semimajor axes and their small orbital
eccentricities. We show that our model for the rigidity of rubble piles is
compatible with laboratory experiment in sand.

edge-on stellar disks, but the relation of truncations in face-on to those in
edge-on galaxies needs further clarification. The origin of truncations is most
likely related to a maximum in the specific angular momentum in the material
that formed the stellar disks, but this model does probably require some
redistribution of angular momentum. HI-warps start just beyond the truncation
radius and disks and warps appear distinct components. This suggests that inner
disks form initially and settle as rigid, very flat structures, while HI-warps
result from later infall of gas with a different orientation of the angular

deforming the terms in a given f(R) gravity-matter action S, and prior to
extremizing it, is promoted with the aim of reducing S via an algebraic mixing
between few selected gravity and matter terms without invoking new fields. The
result of this is a number of constraint equations among the fields and often
eccentric looking field equations derived from the reduced action. Section 4
has a similar upshot as section 3 but the difference is the action term mixing
is carried out only after extremizing S and prior to any integration by part.
Section 5 pertains to G(x) ontology where various personal views on G(x)
gravity are expressed in the context of the Standard Model fermions (SMF). The
prospect of mitigating gravity field effects for the SMF is investigated at the
end via the variable speed of light (VSL) and new global Lorentz
transformations fusing two upper speeds: the light speed c and a proper maximal
speed given in the text assigned to all point mass mo and involving the Planck
mass. The new LT in combination with VSL also houses a family of special
noninertial frames in linear motions. The (spin sensitive) spacetime and
momentum dependent VSL is modeled via the Hamiltonian formalism with the aim of
canceling the effect of Newtonian gravity felt by a SMF test particle. I also
model variable G for yielding finite gravity at all distances, including zero.
Excising gravity from the SMF rank (via VSL plus G(x), or by gauging to zero
the SMF gravitational masses) has epic brunt on quantum gravity, local SUSY,
superstring models, leptoquarks (if any) and cosmology.

showed strong radio to X-ray correlations. During one observation GRS 1915+105
was in a steady state, while during the three others it showed cycles of X-ray
dips and spikes (followed by radio flares). We present the time-resolved
spectroscopy of these cyclesand show that in all cases the hard X-ray component
(the Comptonized emission from a coronal medium) is suppressed in coincidence
with a soft X-ray spike that ends the cycle. We interpret these results as
evidence that the soft X-ray spike is the trigger of the ejection, and that the
ejected medium is the coronal material. In the steady state observation, the
X-ray spectrum is indicative of the hard-intermediate state, with the presence
of a relatively strong emission at 15 GHz. The X-ray spectra are the sum of a
Comptonized component and an extra power law extending to energies >200 keV
without any evidence for a cut-off. We observe a possible correlation of the
radio flux with that of the power law component, which may indicate that we see
direct emission from the jet at hard X-ray energies. We study the energy
dependence of a ~4 Hz QPO during the hard-intermediate state observation. The
QPO-``spectrum'' is well modeled by a power law with a cut-off at an energy
about 11 keV that clearly differs from the relative contribution of the
Comptonized component to the overall flux. This may rule out models of global
oscillations of the Compton corona.

color color diagrams. During a period of steady ``hard'' X-ray state (the
so-called class chi) we observe a steady radio flux. We then turn to 3
particular observations during which we observe several types of soft X-ray
dips and spikes cycles, followed by radio flares. During these observations GRS
1915+105 is in the so-called nu, lambda, and beta classes of variability. The
observation of ejections during class lambda are the first ever reported. We
generalize the fact that a (non-major) discrete ejection always occurs, in GRS
1915+105, as a response to an X-ray sequence composed of a spectrally hard
X-ray dip terminated by an X-ray spike marking the disappearance of the hard
X-ray emission above 18 keV. We also identify the trigger of the ejection as
this X-ray spike. A possible correlation between the amplitude of the radio
flare and the duration of the X-ray dip is found in our data. In this case the
X-ray dips prior to ejections could be seen as the time during which the source
accumulates energy and material that is ejected later.

the quantum model of the homogeneous, isotropic and closed universe filled with
a uniform scalar field and a perfect fluid which defines a reference frame. The

between them and the equations of the Einsteinian classical theory of gravity.
It is shown that quantized scalar field has a form of a condensate which
behaves as an antigravitating medium. The theory predicts an accelerating
expansion of the universe even if the vacuum energy density vanishes. An
antigravitating effect of a condensate has a purely quantum nature. It is shown
that the universe with the parameters close to the Planck ones can go through
the period of exponential expansion. The conditions under which in
semi-classical approximation the universe looks effectively like spatially flat
with negative deceleration parameter are determined. The reduction to the
standard model of classical cosmology is discussed.

  Journal",,"10.1088/0004-6256/135/3/957",,"astro-ph",,"  RV UMa is one of the RRab stars showing regular large amplitude light curve
modulation. Extended photoelectric observations of RV UMa obtained at the

was published by Kovacs (1995). After detecting an error in the reduction
procedure of the published Konkoly data, corrected photometric data are
presented with additional, previously unpublished measurements.
  The reanalysis of the combination of the corrected Konkoly data supplemented
with Preston & Spinrad's (1967) observations has led to the discovery that the
adequate mathematical model of the light curve is, in fact, a quintuplet,
instead of a triplet frequency solution. This finding has crucial importance in
the interpretation of the Blazhko phenomenon, as triplet (doublet) is the
preferred structure in the resonance models, quintuplet in the magnetic models.
  Period changes of both the pulsation and the modulation light variations of
RV UMa have been detected based on its century long photometric observations.
An overall anticorrelation between the pulsation and the modulation period
changes can be defined with dP_{Bl} / dP_0 = -8.6 pm 10^4 gradient, i.e., the
modulation period is longer if the pulsation period is shorter. Between 1946
and 1975 the pulsation and modulation periods showed, however, parallel
changes, which points to that there is no strict relation between the changes
in the periods of the pulsation and the modulation.

enriched in the corona relative to the photosphere, while high-FIP abundances
remain unchanged, has been known for a long while. High resolution X-ray
spectroscopy has revealed that active stellar coronae show an opposite effect,
which was labeled the Inverse-FIP (IFIP) effect. The correlation found between
coronal activity and the FIP/IFIP bias suggested perhaps that flaring activity
is involved in switching from FIP to IFIP. This work aims at a more systematic
understanding of the FIP trends during stellar flares and complements an
earlier study based on Chandra alone. The eight brightest X-ray flares observed
with XMM-Newton are analyzed and compared with their respective quiescence
states. Together with six previous flares observed with Chandra, this
establishes the best currently available sample of flares. We look for
abundance variations during the flare and their correlation with FIP. For that
purpose, we define a new FIP bias measure. A trend is found where coronae that
are IFIP biased in quiescence, during flares show a FIP bias with respect to
their quiescence composition. This effect is reversed for coronae that are FIP
biased in quiescence. The observed trend is thus consistent with chromospheric
evaporation rather than with a FIP mechanism operating during flares. It also
suggests that the quiescent IFIP bias is real and that the large flares are not
the direct cause of the IFIP effect in stellar coronae.

modeling of the cosmological 21-cm signal and the contaminating radiation. The
signal is obtained using a high resolution N-body simulation where the gas is
assumed to trace the dark matter and is reionized by stellar radiation computed
from semi-analytic galaxy formation recipes. We model contaminations to the
cosmological signal from synchrotron and free-free galactic foregrounds and
extragalactic sources including active galactic nuclei, radio haloes and
relics, synchrotron and free-free emission from star forming galaxies, and
free-free emission from dark matter haloes and the intergalactic medium. We
provide tests of the reconstruction method for several rms values of
instrumental noise from $\sigma_{N}=1$ to 250 mK. For low instrumental noise,
the recovered signal, along individual lines-of-sight, fits the true
cosmological signal with a mean rms difference of $d_{rms}\approx 1.7\pm 0.6$

multidimensional simulations of SNIa predict a significant amount of, so far
unobserved, carbon and oxygen moving at low velocities. It has been proposed
that these drawbacks can be resolved if there is a sudden jump to a detonation
(delayed detonation), but this kind of models has been explored mainly in one
dimension. Here we present new three-dimensional delayed detonation models in
which the deflagraton-to-detonation transition (DDT) takes place in conditions
like those favored by one-dimensional models. We have used a SPH code adapted
to SNIa with algorithms devised to handle subsonic as well as supersonic
combustion fronts. The starting point was a C-O white dwarf of 1.38 solar
masses. When the average density on the flame surface reached 2-3x10^7 g/cm^3 a
detonation was launched. The detonation wave processed more than 0.3 solar
masses of carbon and oxygen, emptying the central regions of the ejecta of
unburned fuel and raising its kinetic energy close to the fiducial 10^51 ergs
expected from a healthy Type Ia supernova. The final amount of 56Ni synthesized
also was in the correct range. However, the mass of carbon and oxygen ejected
is still too high. The three-dimensional delayed detonation models explored
here show an improvement over pure deflagration models, but they still fail to
coincide with basic observational constraints. However, there are many aspects
of the model that are still poorly known (geometry of flame ignition, mechanism
of DDT, properties of detonation waves traversing a mixture of fuel and ashes).
Therefore, it will be worth pursuing its exploration to see if a good SNIa
model based on the three-dimensional delayed detonation scenario can be
obtained.

weighted mean distance of the velocity points from the tangent point measured

also plateaus at 1/9, 1/8 and 1/7 of MS were observed as function of applied
magnetic field B//c. From additional neutron scattering experiments on TmB4, we
suppose that those plateaus arise from a stripe structure which appears to be
coherent domain boundaries between AF ordered blocks of 7 or 9 lattice
constants. The received results suggest that the frustration among the Tm3+
magnetic ions, which maps to a geometrically frustrated Shastry-Sutherland
lattice lead to strong competition between AF and ferromagnetic (FM) order.
Thus, stripe structures in intermediate field appear to be the best way to
minimize the magnetostatic energy against other magnetic interactions between
the Tm ions combined with very strong Ising anisotropy.

several reconstructed orthogonal viewing planes in real time. Fourteen
operators performed biopsies first under 2-D then 4-D transurethral ultrasound
(TRUS) guidance (336 biopsies). The biopsy path was modelled using segmentation
in a 3-D ultrasonographic volume. Special software was used to visualise the
biopsy paths in a reference prostate and assess the sampled area. A comparative
study was performed to examine the accuracy of the entry points and target of
the needle. Distribution was assessed by measuring the volume sampled and a
redundancy ratio of the sampled prostate. RESULTS: A significant increase in
accuracy in hitting the target zone was identified using 4-D ultrasonography as
compared to 2-D. There was no increase in the sampled volume or improvement in
the biopsy distribution with 4-D ultrasonography as compared to 2-D.
CONCLUSION: The 4-D TRUS guidance appears to show, on a synthetic model, an
improvement in location accuracy and in the ability to reproduce a protocol.
The biopsy distribution does not seem improved.

(model G00), allowing for a gradual reduction of the gas available for star
formation in low-mass galaxies. In model CF06 reionization starts at z ~ 15-20,
is 85% complete by z ~ 10; at the same z, the ionized fraction is 16% in model

existing data (evolution of Lyman-limit systems, cosmic star formation history,
high-z galaxy counts, IGM thermal history), which therefore cannot be used to
discriminate among different feedback models. Deviations among radiative
feedback prescriptions emerge when considering the expected HI 21 cm background

the CERN SPS. At the pi+ pi- threshold, the pi0 pi0 mass spectrum exhibits a
Wigner-cusp, from which the S-wave pi pi scattering lengths are extracted with
high precision. This measurement is complementary to the extraction of the
scattering lengths from K_e4 decays, which is also performed by the NA48/2
experiment.

cell type, cell-cell interactions are often essential, in addition to
intracellular gene expression dynamics. Based on dynamical systems theory, we
propose a mechanism for cell differentiation with regulation of populations of
each cell type by taking simple cell models with gene expression dynamics. By
incorporating several interaction kinetics, we found that the cell models with
a single intracellular positive-feedback loop exhibit a cell fate switching,
with a change in the total number of cells. The number of a given cell type or
the population ratio of each cell type is preserved against the change in the
total number of cells, depending on the form of cell-cell interaction. The
differentiation is a result of bifurcation of cell states via the intercellular
interactions, while the population regulation is explained by self-consistent
determination of the bifurcation parameter through cell-cell interactions. The
relevance of this mechanism to development and differentiation in several
multicellular systems is discussed.

Higgs doublet and an electroweak Higgs triplet. We construct the low-energy
effective theory for the light Higgs-doublet in the limit of small (but
nonzero) deviations in the rho parameter from one, a limit in which the triplet
states become heavy. For small deviations in the rho parameter from one,
perturbative unitarity of WW scattering breaks down at a scale inversely
proportional to the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the triplet field
(or, equivalently, inversely proportional to the square-root of the deviation
of the rho parameter from one). This result imposes an upper limit on the
mass-scale of the heavy triplet bosons in a perturbative theory; we show that
this upper bound is consistent with dimensional analysis in the low-energy
effective theory. Recent articles have shown that the triplet bosons do not
decouple, in the sense that deviations in the rho parameter from one do not
necessarily vanish at one-loop in the limit of large triplet mass. We clarify
that, despite the non-decoupling behavior of the Higgs-triplet, this model does
not violate the decoupling theorem since it incorporates a large dimensionful
coupling. Nonetheless, we show that if the triplet-Higgs boson masses are of
order the GUT scale, perturbative consistency of the theory requires the
(properly renormalized) Higgs-triplet vacuum expectation value to be so small
as to be irrelevant for electroweak phenomenology.

framework of a recent model of the dynamical evolution of the giant planets,
sometimes known as the Nice model. This model is characterized by a short, but
violent, instability phase, during which the planets were on large eccentricity
orbits. One characteristic of this model is that the proto-planetary disk must
have been truncated at roughly 30 to 35 AU so that Neptune would stop migrating
at its currently observed location. As a result, the Kuiper belt would have
initially been empty. In this paper we present a new dynamical mechanism which
can deliver objects from the region interior to ~35 AU to the Kuiper belt
without excessive inclination excitation. Assuming that the last encounter with
Uranus delivered Neptune onto a low-inclination orbit with a semi-major axis of
~27 AU and an eccentricity of ~0.3, and that subsequently Neptune's
eccentricity damped in ~1 My, our simulations reproduce the main observed
properties of the Kuiper belt at an unprecedented level.

close to the transition point, and identify the regimes where quantum
