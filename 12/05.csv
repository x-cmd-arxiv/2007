be as low as few TeVs if the Universe contains large extra dimensions. We
propose a search for the effects of Regge excitations of fundamental strings at
LHC, in the process p p \to \gamma jet. The underlying parton process is
dominantly the single photon production in gluon fusion, g g \to \gamma g, with
open string states propagating in intermediate channels. If the photon mixes
with the gauge boson of the baryon number, which is a common feature of D-brane
quivers, the amplitude appears already at the string disk level. It is
completely determined by the mixing parameter -- and it is otherwise
model-(compactification-) independent. Even for relatively small mixing, 100
fb^{-1} of LHC data could probe deviations from standard model physics, at a
5\sigma significance, for M_s as large as 3.3 TeV.

to Veltman (Acta Phys. Polon. B 12, 437 (1981)). It requires that radiative
corrections to the electroweak mass scale would be reasonably small. The second
is the condition due to Barbieri and Giudice (Nucl. Phys. B 306, 63 (1988)),
which is more popular lately. It requires that physical mass scale would not be
oversensitive to the values of the input parameters. We show here that the
above two conditions behave differently if higher order corrections are taken
into account. Veltman's condition is robust (insensitive to higher order
corrections), while Barbieri-Giudice condition changes qualitatively. We
conclude that higher order perturbative corrections take care of the fine
tuning problem, and, in this respect, scalar field is a natural system. We
apply the Barbieri-Giudice condition with higher order corrections taken into
account to the Standard Model, and obtain new restrictions on the Higgs boson
mass.

particles in an infinite fluid, but channel walls in real systems further break
symmetry and lead to dielectrophoresis (DEP) in local field gradients. Zhao and
Bau (Langmuir, \textbf{23}, 2007, pp 4053) recently predicted that a metal
(ideally polarizable) cylinder is repelled from an insulating wall in a DC
field. We revisit this problem with an AC field and show that attraction to the
wall sets in at high frequency and leads to an equilibrium distance, where DEP
balances ICEP, although, in three dimensions, a metal sphere is repelled from
the wall at all frequencies. This conclusion, however, does not apply to
asymmetric particles. Consistent with the recent experiments of Gangwal et al.
(arXiv:0708.2417), we show that a metal/insulator Janus particle is always
attracted to the wall in an AC field. The Janus particle tends to move toward
its insulating end, perpendicular to the field, but ICEP torque rotates this
end toward the wall. Under some conditions, the theory predicts steady
translation along the wall with an equilibrium tilt angle, as seen in
experiments, although more detailed modeling of the contact region of
overlapping double layers is required.

conflict with the thermodynamic requirement that entropy vanish at low

ULIRGs). These observations have allowed us to derive an updated version of the
power law describing the correlation between the FIR luminosity (L_FIR) and the
HCN(1-0) luminosity (L'_HCN(1-0)) of local and high-redshift galaxies. We
present the first clear observational evidence that the star formation
efficiency of the dense gas (SFE_dense), measured as the L_FIR/L'_HCN(1-0)
ratio, is significantly higher in LIRGs and ULIRGs than in normal galaxies, a
result that has also been found recently in high-redshift galaxies. This may
imply a statistically significant turn upward in the Kennicutt-Schmidt law
derived for the dense gas at L_FIR >= 10^11 L_sun. We have used a one-phase
Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) radiative transfer code to fit the three
independent line ratios derived from our observations. The results of this
analysis indicate that the [HCN]/[HCO^+] abundance ratios could be up to one
order of magnitude higher than normal in a significant number of LIRGs and
ULIRGs of our sample. An overabundance of HCN at high L_FIR implies that the
reported trend in the L_FIR/L'_HCN ratio as a function of L_FIR would be
underestimating a potentially more dramatic change of the SFE_dense. Results
obtained with two-phase LVG models corroborate that the L'_HCN(1-0)-to-M_dense
conversion factor must be lowered at high L_FIR. We discuss the implications of
these findings for the use of HCN as a tracer of the dense molecular gas in
local and high-redshift luminous infrared galaxies.

become one of the most powerful tools to study and understand the Universe.
More precisely, measuring the CMB power spectrum leads to the estimation of
most cosmological parameters. Nevertheless, accessing such precious physical
information requires extracting several different astrophysical components from
the data. Recovering those astrophysical sources (CMB, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
clusters, galactic dust) thus amounts to a component separation problem which
has already led to an intense activity in the field of CMB studies. In this
paper, we introduce a new sparsity-based component separation method coined
Generalized Morphological Component Analysis (GMCA). The GMCA approach is
formulated in a Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework. Numerical

dynamics of glass-forming benzophenone. Our measurements cover a broad
frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 120 GHz and temperatures from far below the glass
temperature well up into the region of the small-viscosity liquid. With respect
to the alpha relaxation this material can be characterized as a typical
molecular glass former with rather high fragility. A good agreement of the
alpha relaxation behavior with the predictions of the mode coupling theory of
the glass transition is stated. In addition, at temperatures below and in the
vicinity of Tg we detect a well-pronounced beta relaxation of Johari-Goldstein
type, which with increasing temperature develops into an excess wing. We
compare our results to literature data from optical Kerr effect and depolarized
light scattering experiments, where an excess-wing like feature was observed in
the 1 - 100 GHz region. We address the question if the Cole-Cole peak, which
was invoked to describe the optical Kerr effect data within the framework of
the mode coupling theory, has any relation to the canonical beta relaxation
detected by dielectric spectroscopy.

depends only on the ratio of the temperature to the quark mass T/m_q. We
compute a and b in terms of the meson quantum numbers and T/m_q. The limiting
meson velocity v_0 becomes much smaller than the speed of light at temperatures
below but close to T_diss, the temperature above which no meson bound states at
rest in the plasma are found. From our result for v_0, we find that the
temperature above which no meson bound states with velocity v exist is
T_diss(v) \simeq (1-v^2)^(1/4) T_diss, up to few percent corrections.We thus
confirm by direct calculation of meson dispersion relations a result inferred
indirectly in previous work via analysis of the screening length between a
static quark and antiquark in a moving plasma. Although we do not do our
calculations in QCD, we argue that the qualitative features of the dispersion
relation we compute, including in particular the relation between dissociation
temperature and meson velocity, may apply to bottomonium and charmonium mesons
propagating in the strongly coupled plasma of QCD. We discuss how our results

(graphene) have stimulated intense experimental and theoretical activity. The
key feature of graphene is the massless Dirac type of low-energy electron
excitations. This gives rise to a number of unusual physical properties of this
system distinguishing it from conventional two-dimensional metals. One of the
most remarkable properties of graphene is the anomalous quantum Hall effect. It
is extremely sensitive to the structure of the system; in particular, it
clearly distinguishes single- and double-layer samples. In spite of the
impressive experimental progress, the theory of quantum Hall effect in graphene
has not been established. This theory is a subject of the present paper. We
demonstrate that the Landau level structure by itself is not sufficient to
determine the form of the quantum Hall effect. The Hall quantization is due to
Anderson localization which, in graphene, is very peculiar and depends strongly
on the character of disorder. It is only a special symmetry of disorder that
may give rise to anomalous quantum Hall effects in graphene. We analyze the
symmetries of disordered single- and double-layer graphene in magnetic field
and identify the conditions for anomalous Hall quantization.

from a canonical (Y=0.25) to a He-enhanced composition (Y=0.42). The presence
of some He-core WDs seems able to explain the observed star counts. The
fraction of He WDs required ranges from 10% to 80% depending on their mean mass
and it is at least five times larger than for field WDs. The comparison in the

against this phantom chain, mean-field picture. We analyze numerically and
theoretically the static correlation function of the Rouse modes. Our numerical
results are obtained from computer simulations of two coarse-grained polymer
models for which the strength of the monomer repulsion can be varied, from full
excluded volume (`hard monomers') to no excluded volume (`phantom chains'). For
nonvanishing excluded volume we find the simulated correlation function of the
Rouse modes to deviate markedly from the predictions of phantom chain models.
This demonstrates that there are nonnegligible correlations along the chains in
a melt. These correlations can be taken into account by perturbation theory.

observed with the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG). This
database, known as X-Atlas, is accessible through a web interface with
searching, data retrieval, and interactive plotting capabilities. For each
target, X-Atlas also features predictions of the low-resolution ACIS spectra
convolved from the HETG data for comparison with stellar sources in archival
ACIS images. Preliminary analyses of the hardness ratios, quantiles, and
spectral fits derived from the predicted ACIS spectra reveal systematic
differences between the high-mass and low-mass stars in the atlas and offer
evidence for at least two distinct classes of high-mass stars. A high degree of
X-ray variability is also seen in both high and low-mass stars, including
Capella, long thought to exhibit minimal variability. X-Atlas contains over 130
observations of approximately 25 high-mass stars and 40 low-mass stars and will
be updated as additional stellar HETG observations become public. The atlas has
recently expanded to non-stellar point sources, and Low Energy Transmission
Grating (LETG) observations are currently being added as well.

mixes to a (generally non-uniform) distribution pi(x) in time O(n) and the
stationary distribution is determined by the initial state of the walk. An

breaking links between connected sites in the hypercube is also considered. We
find that the probability distribution mixes to the uniform distribution as
expected. However, the mixing time has a minimum at a critical decoherence rate
$p \approx 0.1$. A similar effect was previously reported for the QW on the
N-cycle with decoherence from repeated measurements of position. A controlled

of fundamental atomic-scale forces acting between liquid molecules and the
solid surface. In this work, the validity is assessed of a simple equation,
which approximately relates the contact angle of a liquid on a surface to its
density, its surface tension, and the effective molecule-surface potential.
This equation is derived in the sharp-kink approximation, where the density
profile of the liquid is assumed to drop precipitously within one molecular
diameter of the substrate. It is found that this equation satisfactorily
reproduces the temperature-dependence of the contact angle for helium on alkali
metal surfaces. The equation also seems be applicable to liquids such as water
on solid surfaces such as gold and graphite, based on a comparison of predicted
and measured contact angles near room-temperature. Nevertheless, we conclude
that, to fully test the equation's applicability to fluids such as water, it
remains necessary to measure the contact angle's temperature-dependence. We
hypothesize that the effects of electrostatic forces can increase with
temperature, potentially driving the wetting temperature much higher and closer
to the critical point, or lower, closer to room temperature, than predicted
using current theories.

difficult to estimate using conventional approaches to causal inference that
define this effect by comparing the mortality risks corresponding to
hypothetical scenarios in which all subjects in the target population engage in
a given level of vigorous physical activity. A causal effect defined on the
basis of such a static treatment intervention can only be identified from
observed data if all subjects in the target population have a positive
probability of selecting each of the candidate treatment options, an assumption
that is highly unrealistic in this case since subjects with serious health
problems will not be able to engage in higher levels of vigorous physical
activity. This problem can be addressed by focusing instead on causal effects
that are defined on the basis of realistic individualized treatment rules and
intention-to-treat rules that explicitly take into account the set of treatment
options that are available to each subject. We present a data analysis to
illustrate that estimators of static causal effects in fact tend to
overestimate the beneficial impact of high levels of vigorous physical activity
while corresponding estimators based on realistic individualized treatment
rules and intention-to-treat rules can yield unbiased estimates. We emphasize
that the problems encountered in estimating static causal effects are not
restricted to the IPTW estimator, but are also observed with the
$G$-computation estimator, the DR-IPTW estimator, and the targeted MLE. Our
analyses based on realistic individualized treatment rules and
intention-to-treat rules suggest that high levels of vigorous physical activity
may confer reductions in mortality risk on the order of 15-30%, although in
most cases the evidence for such an effect does not quite reach the 0.05 level

as acts, other one is protein type which can act as actors. From act degree

in cytokine-protein network to regulate immune activity. Dyad act degree
distribution is another important property to generalized collaboration
network. Dyad is two proteins and they appear in one cytokine collaboration
relationship. The dyad act degree distribution can be well described by typical

galaxy orbiting in a galaxy cluster. In this paper, we focus on the properties
of the galaxies' tails of stripped gas. The galactic wakes show a flaring
width, where the flaring angle depends on the gas disc's cross-section with
respect to the galaxy's direction of motion. The velocity in the wakes shows a
significant turbulent component of a few 100 km/s. The stripped gas is
deposited in the cluster rather locally, i.e. within ~150 kpc from where it was
stripped. We demonstrate that the most important quantity governing the tail
density, length and gas mass distribution along the orbit is the galaxy's mass
loss per orbital length. This in turn depends on the ram pressure as well as
the galaxy's orbital velocity. For a sensitivity limit of ~10^19 cm^-2 in
projected gas density, we find typical tail lengths of 40 kpc. Such long tails
are seen even at large distances (0.5 to 1 Mpc) from the cluster centre. At
this sensitivity limit, the tails show little flaring, but a width similar to
the gas disc's size. Morphologically, we find good agreement with the HI tails
observed in the Virgo cluster by Chung et al. (2007). However, the observed
tails show a much smaller velocity width than predicted from the simulation.
The few known X-ray and H$\alpha$ tails are generally much narrower and much
straighter than the tails in our simulations. Thus, additional physics like a
viscous ICM, the influence of cooling and tidal effects may be needed to
explain the details of the observations. We discuss the hydrodynamical drag as
a heat source for the ICM but conclude that it is not likely to play an
important role, especially not in stopping cooling flows.

how the full Z_N center symmetry dynamically emerges in the orientifold

this enhancement is the existence of stable k-strings in the large-N limit of
the orientifold theories. These strings are identical to those of
supersymmetric Yang--Mills theories. We argue that critical temperatures (and
other features) of the confinement-deconfinement phase transition are the same

masses in early-type galaxies and we establish their level of reliability. In
particular, we consider the well-studied sample of 15 field elliptical galaxies
selected from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey (z = 0.06-0.33). We examine
here the correlation between the stellar mass values, enclosed inside the
Einstein radius of each lens, based on analyses of lensing and stellar dynamics
combined and based on multiwavelength photometry spectral template fitting. The
lensing+dynamics stellar mass is obtained from the published SLACS Survey
results, assuming a two-component density distribution model and a prior from
the fundamental plane on the mass-to-light ratio for the lens galaxies. The
photometric stellar mass is measured by fitting the observed spectral energy
distribution of the galaxies (from the SDSS multi-band photometry over 354-913
nm) with composite stellar population templates, under the assumption that
light traces stellar mass. The two methods are completely independent. They
rely on several different assumptions, and so, in principle, both can have
significant biases. Based on our sample of massive galaxies, we find
consistency between the lensing+dynamics and the photometric mass estimates. We
obtain a Pearson linear correlation coefficient of 0.94 and a median value of
the ratio between the former and the latter mass measurements of 1.1+/-0.1.
This suggests that both methods can separately yield reliable stellar masses of
early-type galaxies, and confirms that photometric mass estimates are accurate,
as long as optical/near-IR rest frame photometry is available.

Applying a weak perpendicular magnetic field changes this situation drastically
and introduces a large conductance. We identify the underlying mechanisms being
partially due to the specific shape of the oval that causes a systematic
decoupling of a substantial number of states from the leads. Importantly a
pairwise destructive interference of the transmitting states is encountered
thereby leading to the complete conductance suppression. Coupling properties
and interferences can be tuned via a weak magnetic field. These properties are

introduction to the discrete setting, we explain a mechanism of spontaneous
symmetry breaking which leads to the emergence of a discrete causal structure.
As methods to study the transition between discrete space-time and Minkowski
space, we describe a lattice model for a static and isotropic space-time,
outline the analysis of regularization tails of vacuum Dirac sea
configurations, and introduce a Lorentz invariant action for the masses of the
Dirac seas. We mention the method of the continuum limit, which allows to
analyze interacting systems. Open problems are discussed.

X-ray sources. These close binaries are thought to play an important role in
the stability of the clusters by liberating energy and delaying the inevitable
core collapse of globular clusters. The inventory of close binaries and their
identification is therefore essential. We present XMM-Newton observations of
two Galactic globular clusters: NGC 2808 and NGC 4372. We use X-ray spectral
and variability analysis combined with ultra-violet observations made with the
XMM-Newton optical monitor and published data from the Hubble Space Telescope
to identify sources associated with the clusters. We compare the results of our
observations with estimates from population synthesis models. Five sources out
of 96 are likely to be related to NGC 2808. Nine sources are found in the field
of view of NGC 4372, none being located inside its half-mass radius. We find
one quiescent neutron star low mass X-ray binary candidate in the core of NGC
2808, and propose that the majority of the central sources in NGC 2808 are
cataclysmic variables. An estimation leads to ~20+/-10 cataclysmic variables
with luminosity above 4.25 x 10^31 erg s^-1. Millisecond pulsars could also be
present in the core of NGC 2808, and some sources outside of the half-mass

theoretically. The calculations were performed applying both quantummechanical
and classical approaches. Treating the problem quantummechanically, the time
dependent Schr\""odinger equation (TDSE) of our system was first transformed
into a pseudo-momentum space and solved in this space iteratively. While
neglecting the Coulomb potential during the solution of the TDSE we got the
results in the Volkov approximation, in the first order solution we taken into
account the Coulomb potential as perturbation. The classical calculations were
performed within the framework of the classical trajectory Monte-Carlo (CTMC)

  The double differential ionization probabilities are calculated for different
laser pulses and a reasonable agreement was found between the theories. Major
differences can be observed in the angular distribution of electrons at low
electron energies between classical and the quantummechanical approaches. At
high electron energies the differences disappear, which indicates that the
generation of low energy electrons is of quantum type, and it is strongly
influenced by the Coulomb potential, while the production of high energy
electrons is of classical type and it is less influenced by the Coulomb
interaction. Our results are also compared with the Coulomb-Volkov (CV) model

including those of intermediate-mass stars. Our analysis is done within the
framework of a passive circumstellar disk, which is optionally supplemented by
the effects of accretion and an added envelope. To achieve a more consistent
and realistic model, we used our continuum transfer code MC3D. In addition, we
studied the shape of the 10um silicate emission feature in terms of the
underlying dust population, both for single-dish and for interferometric
measurements. We show that a modestly flaring disk model with accretion can
explain both the observed spectral energy distribution and the mid-infrared
visibilities obtained with the mid-infrared infrared instrument. We found an
interesting ambiguity: a circumstellar active disk model with an added
envelope, and a lower accretion rate than in the active disk model without
envelope, could represent the observations equally as well. This type of model
with the envelope should be considered a viable alternative in future models of
other TTauri stars. The approach of a disk with a puffed-up inner rim wall and
the influence of a stellar companion is also discussed. From the study of the
silicate emission feature we see evidence for dust evolution in a TTauri star,
with a decreasing fraction of small amorphous and an increasing fraction of
crystalline particles closer to the star.

induce a fluctuation term in the counting of energy levels. We next quantize
the xp Hamiltonian, adding an interaction term that depends on two wave
functions associated to the classical boundaries in phase space. The general
model is solved exactly, obtaining a continuum spectrum with discrete bound
states embbeded in it. We find the boundary wave functions, associated to the
Berry-Keating regularization, for which the average Riemann zeros become
resonances. A spectral realization of the Riemann zeros is achieved exploiting
the symmetry of the model under the exchange of position and momenta which is
related to the duality symmetry of the zeta function. The boundary wave

flaring activity that gradually increases from a level of a few mJy at
apoastron to more than 100 mJy at periastron. Interbinary collisions between
very large (> 15 R) magnetic structures anchored on the two rotating stars of
the system have been proposed to be the origin of these periodic radio flares.
Magnetic structures extended over tens of stellar radii, that can also account
for the observed fast decay of the radio flares, seem to correspond to the
typical solar semi-open quite extended magnetic configurations called helmet
streamers.} Aims {We aim to find direct observational evidence for the
postulated, solar-like, coronal topologies.} Methods {We performed
seven-consecutive-day VLBI observations at 8.4 GHz using an array consisting of
the VLBA and the 100-m Effelsberg telescope.} Results {Two distintive
structures appear in the radio images here presented. They happen to be
associated with the primary and secondary stars of the V773 Tau A system. In
one image (Fig.2-B) the two features are extended up to 18 R each and are
nearly parallel revealing the presence of two interacting helmet streamers. One
image (Fig.2-E) taken a few hours after a flare monitored by the 100-m
Effelsberg telescope shows one elongated fading structure substantially rotated
with respect to those seen in the B run. The same decay scenario is seen in
Fig.2-G for the helmet streamer associated with the other star.} Conclusions
{This is the very first direct evidence revealing that even if the flare origin
is magnetic reconnection due to interbinary collision, both stars independently
emit in the radio range with structures of their own. These structures are
helmet streamers, observed for the first time in stars other than the Sun.}

which is intrinsic to each SQUID due to the presence of the Josephson junction
(on-site nonlinearity), along with the weak coupling of each SQUID to its
nearest neighbors through magnetic forces, result in the appearance of discrete
breathers. We analyze several discrete breather excitations, both in one and

however, are counter-balanced by an external flux source leading to linearly
stable discrete breather structures up to relatively large coupling parameters.
We show that DDB excitations may locally alter the magnetic response of array

months in the quiet fast solar wind above the Sun's polar coronal holes in a
highly ordered magnetic field. We use statistical analysis methods such as the
generalized structure function (GSF) and extended self-similarity (ESS) to
quantify the scaling of the moments of the probability density function of
fluctuations in the magnetic field. The GSFs give power law scaling in the
``$f^{-1}$'' range of the form $<| y(t+\tau)-y(t)|^{m}>\sim\tau^{\zeta(m)}$,
but ESS is required to reveal scaling in the inertial range, which is of the

is independent of spacecraft position and
$g(\tau)\sim\tau^{-log_{10}(\tilde{\lambda}\tau)}$. The ``$f^{-1}$'' scaling
fluctuates with radial spacecraft position. This confirms that, whereas the
``$f^{-1}$'' fluctuations are directly influenced by the corona, the inertial
range fluctuations are consistent with locally evolving turbulence, but with an
``envelope'' $g(\tau)$, which captures the formation of the quiet fast solar

glucose) by swimming towards the highest concentration of food molecules, or to
flee from poisons. Based on self-organized computational approaches and similar
stigmergic concepts we derive a novel swarm intelligent algorithm. What strikes
from these observations is that both eusocial insects as ant colonies and
bacteria have similar natural mechanisms based on stigmergy in order to emerge
coherent and sophisticated patterns of global collective behaviour. Keeping in
mind the above characteristics we will present a simple model to tackle the
collective adaptation of a social swarm based on real ant colony behaviors (SSA
algorithm) for tracking extrema in dynamic environments and highly multimodal
complex functions described in the well-know De Jong test suite. Later, for the
purpose of comparison, a recent model of artificial bacterial foraging (BFOA
algorithm) based on similar stigmergic features is described and analyzed.
Final results indicate that the SSA collective intelligence is able to cope and
quickly adapt to unforeseen situations even when over the same cooperative
foraging period, the community is requested to deal with two different and
contradictory purposes, while outperforming BFOA in adaptive speed. Results
indicate that the present approach deals well in severe Dynamic Optimization
problems.

required heating rate scales as ${\bar{B}}^{0.29} L^{-0.95}$. Finally we
discuss the future potential of this type of modeling, such as the ability to
use density measurements to fully constrain filling factor, and its
shortcomings, such as the requirement to use potential field extrapolations to
approximate the coronal field.

  Magnetic Nanodots","30 pages, 7 figures","Phys. Rev. B 78, 014405 (2008) (6 pages)","10.1103/PhysRevB.78.014405",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.other",,"  We found, by micromagnetic numerical and analytical calculations, that the
clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) circular-rotational motions of a
magnetic vortex core in a soft magnetic circular nanodot are the elementary
eigenmodes existing in the gyrotropic motion with respect to the corresponding
CW and CCW circular-rotational-field eigenbasis. Any steady-state vortex
gyrotropic motions driven by a linearly polarized oscillating in-plane magnetic
field in the linear regime can be perfectly understood according to the
superposition of the two circular eigenmodes, which show asymmetric resonance
characteristics reflecting the vortex polarization. The relative magnitudes in
the amplitude and phase between the CCW and CW eigenmodes determine the
elongation and orientation of the orbital trajectories of the vortex core
motions, respectively, which trajectories vary with the polarization and
chirality of the given vortex as well as the field frequency across the
resonance frequency.

This master equation is solved by transforming it into a quasiprobability
distribution in phase space and the quasiclassical limit is investigated.
