involving violation of the null energy condition in a model which combines the
ekpyrotic/cyclic scenario with the ghost condensate theory and the curvaton
mechanism of production of adiabatic perturbations of metric. The Lagrangian of
this theory, as well as of the ghost condensate model, contains a term with
higher derivatives, which was added to the theory to stabilize its vacuum
state. We found that this term may affect the dynamics of the cosmological
evolution. Moreover, after a proper quantization, this term results in the
existence of a new ghost field with negative energy, which leads to a
catastrophic vacuum instability. We explain why one cannot treat this dangerous
term as a correction valid only at small energies and momenta below some UV
cut-off, and demonstrate the problems arising when one attempts to construct a
UV completion of this theory.

Valleys."" These models are characterized by low mass (well below a TeV) bound
states resulting from a confining gauge interaction in a hidden sector; the
states include a spin-one resonance that can decay to lepton pairs. Assuming
that the hidden sector communicates to the Standard Model (SM) through TeV
suppressed operators, taking into account the constraint from the $Z$ pole
physics at LEP, searches at Tevatron may be difficult in the particular class
of Hidden Valleys we consider, so that we concentrate on the searches at the
LHC. Hidden Valley events are characterized by high multiplicities of jets and
leptons in the final state. Depending on the scale of confinement in the hidden
sector, the events are typically more spherical, with lower thrust and higher
incidences of isolated leptons, than those from the SM background processes.
Most notably, high cluster invariant mass and very narrow, low mass resonances
in lepton pairs are the key observables to identify the signal. We use these
characteristics to develop a set of cuts to separate the Hidden Valley from SM,
and show that with these cuts LHC has a significant reach in the parameter
space. Our strategies are quite general and should apply well beyond the
particular class of models studied here.

can be satisfied. The standard assumption of flavor universality in the
supersymmetry breaking sector is not necessary. We study signatures of this
framework at the LHC. The mass splitting among different generations of squarks
and sleptons can be much larger than in conventional scenarios, and even the
mass ordering can be changed. We find that there is a plausible scenario in
which the NLSP is a long-lived right-handed selectron or smuon decaying into
the LSP gravitino. This leads to the spectacular signature of monochromatic

warped throat, including the brane-antibrane tachyon as the waterfall field. We
find that there is a period at the end of inflation during which the entropy
mode associated with the tachyon field increases exponentially. In turn, the
induced entropy seeds a contribution to the curvature fluctuation on
cosmological scales which grows rapidly and could exceed the primordial
curvature perturbation. We identify parameter values for which in the absence
of back-reaction the induced curvature fluctuations are larger than the
primordial adiabatic ones. In the specific model we study, however,
back-reaction limits the growth of the entropy fluctuations. We discuss
situations in which back-reaction effects are less constraining. The lesson of
our investigation is that the study of the development of entropy fluctuations
at the end of the period of inflation can lead to constraints on models of
brane inflation and suggests that the curvaton mechanism may contribute
significantly to the spectrum of cosmological perturbations.

transformed the afterglow light curves into an extinction-corrected z=1 system
and compared their luminosities with a sample of pre-Swift afterglows. The
results of a former study, which showed that GRB afterglows clustered and
exhibited a bimodal distribution in luminosity space, is weakened by the larger
sample. We found that the luminosity distribution of the two afterglow samples
(Swift-era and pre-Swift) are very similar, and that a subsample for which we
were not able to estimate the extinction, which is fainter than the main
sample, can be explained by assuming a moderate amount of line-of-sight host
extinction. We derived bolometric isotropic energies for all GRBs in our
sample, and found only a tentative correlation between the prompt energy
release and the optical afterglow luminosity at one day after the GRB in the
z=1 system. A comparative study of the optical luminosities of GRB afterglows

generalized formalism of the capillarity scaling theory for 28 two-state

This average value corresponds to packing of rigid objects.That is, on average
the folded core of the nucleus is found to be relatively diffuse. We also
studied the growth of the folding nucleus and interface along the folding route
in terms of the density or packing fraction. The evolution of the folded core
and interface regions can be classified into three patterns of growth depending
on how the growth of the folded core is balanced by changes in density of the

dynamically evolved planetesimal disk in the outer solar system. This complex
structure, known as the trans-Neptunian belt (or Edgeworth-Kuiper belt), can
reveal important clues about disk properties, planet formation, and other
evolutionary processes. In contrast to the predictions of accretion theory,
TNOs exhibit surprisingly large eccentricities, e, and inclinations, i, which
can be grouped into distinct dynamical classes. Several models have addressed
the origin and orbital evolution of TNOs, but none have reproduced detailed
observations, e.g., all dynamical classes and peculiar objects, or provided
insightful predictions. Based on extensive simulations of planetesimal disks
with the presence of the four giant planets and massive planetesimals, we
propose that the orbital history of an outer planet with tenths of Earth's mass
can explain the trans-Neptunian belt orbital structure. This massive body was
likely scattered by one of the giant planets, which then stirred the primordial
planetesimal disk to the levels observed at 40-50 AU and truncated it at about
48 AU before planet migration. The outer planet later acquired an inclined
stable orbit (>100 AU; 20-40 deg) because of a resonant interaction with
Neptune (an r:1 or r:2 resonance possibly coupled with the Kozai mechanism),
guaranteeing the stability of the trans-Neptunian belt. Our model consistently
reproduces the main features of each dynamical class with unprecedented detail;
it also satisfies other constraints such as the current small total mass of the
trans-Neptunian belt and Neptune's current orbit at 30.1 AU. We also provide
observationally testable predictions.

the method of images, we generalize a recently developed approach for compact
objects in unbounded space [1,2] to show that the Casimir interaction between
the objects and the mirror plane can be accurately obtained over a wide range
of separations in terms of charge and current fluctuations of the objects and
their images. Our general result for the interaction depends only on the
scattering matrices of the compact objects. It applies to scalar fields with
arbitrary boundary conditions and to the electromagnetic field coupled to
dielectric objects. For the experimentally important electromagnetic Casimir
interaction between a perfectly conducting sphere and a plane mirror we present
the first results that apply at all separations. We obtain both an asymptotic
large distance expansion and the two lowest order correction terms to the
proximity force approximation. The asymptotic Casimir-Polder potential for an
atom and a mirror is generalized to describe the interaction between a
dielectric sphere and a mirror, involving higher order multipole
polarizabilities that are important at sub-asymptotic distances.

that turns out to be a function of both the energy scale associated to the
higher-derivative term and the gauge coupling. The dependence of the fermion
mass on the gauge coupling is non-perturbative. Extensions to SU(N) gauge
theories and fermion-scalar interactions are also analyzed, as well as to
theories with massive gauge fields. A few implications of these results in the
framework of quark-mass generation are discussed.

Beckner in the gaussian case and provide, along the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck flow,
the exponential decay of some generalized entropies which interpolate between
the $L^2$ norm and the usual entropy. Our criterion improves on results which,
for instance, can be deduced from the Bakry-Emery criterion and Holley-Stroock
type perturbation results. In a second step, we apply the same strategy to
non-linear equations of porous media type. This provides new interpolation
inequalities and decay estimates for the solutions of the evolution problem.
The criterion is again a non-local condition based on the positivity of the
lowest eigenvalue of a Schr\""odinger operator. In both cases, we relate the
Fisher information with its time derivative. Since the resulting criterion is
non-local, it is better adapted to potentials with, for instance, a
non-quadratic growth at infinity, or to unbounded perturbations of the

create a new class of soft solids, called `bijels', by stabilizing and
arresting the bicontinuous interface in a binary liquid demixing via spinodal
decomposition using particles that are neutrally wetted by both liquids. The
interfacial layer of particles is expected to be semi-permeable, hence, if
realised, these new materials would have many potential applications, e.g. as
microreaction media. However, the creation of bijels in the laboratory faces
serious obstacles. In general, fast quench rates are necessary to bypass
nucleation, so that only samples with limited thickness can be produced, which
destroys the three-dimensionality of the putative bicontinuous network.
Moreover, even a small degree of unequal wettability of the particles by the
two liquids can lead to ill-characterised, `lumpy' interfacial layers and
therefore irreproducible material properties. Here we report a reproducible
protocol for creating three-dimensional samples of bijel in which the
interfaces are stabilized by essentially a single layer of particles. We
demonstrate how to tune the mean interfacial separation in these bijels, and
show that mechanically, they indeed behave as soft solids.

the extended nature of the source star, as well as the related sensitivity to
its limb darkening. We demonstrate that the sensitive region, usually
considered to be limited to a source-diameter-wide band along the caustic, is
strongly expanded near cusps, most prominently along their outer axis. In the
case of multi-component caustics, facing cusps may form a region with a
non-negligible extended-source effect spanning the gap between them. We
demonstrate that for smaller sources the size of the sensitive region extending
from a cusp measured in units of source radii increases, scaling as the inverse
cube root of the radius. We study the extent of different sensitivity contours
and show that for a microlensed Galactic bulge giant the probability of
encountering at least a 1% extended-source effect is higher than the
probability of caustic crossing by 40-60% when averaged over a typical range of
lens-component separations, with the actual value depending on the mass ratio
of the components. We derive analytical expressions for the extended-source
effect and chromaticity for a source positioned off the caustic. These formulae
are more generally applicable to any gravitational lens with a sufficiently
small source. Using exactly computed amplifications we test the often used
linear-fold caustic approximation and show that it may lead to errors on the
level of a few percent even in near-ideal caustic-crossing events. Finally, we
discuss several interesting cases of observed binary and planetary microlensing
events and point out the importance of our results for the measurement of
stellar limb darkening from microlensing light curves.

Contrary to what many authors have claimed, non-euclidean geometries do not
rule out Kant's thesis that space is a form of intuition given {\it a priori};
on the contrary, Euclidean geometry is the condition for the possibility of any
more general geometry. 2) The conception of space-time as a Riemannian manifold
is an extremely ingenious way to describe the gravitational field, but, as
shown by Utiyama in 1956, general relativity is actually the gauge theory
associated to the Lorentz group. Utiyama's approach does not rely on the
assumption that space-time is curved, though the equations of the gauge theory
are identical to those of general relativity. Thus, following Poincar\'e, it
can be claimed that it is only a matter of convention to describe the

specified physical variables, the correct solution of the dynamical laws
(boundary conditions), and the connection with observations or experience or
conscious perceptions (laws of psycho-physical parallelism). Principles are
proposed for Bayesian meta-theories. One framework that obeys these principles
is Sensible Quantum Mechanics (SQM), which is discussed. In principle, it
allows one to test between single-history and many-worlds theories, and to
discuss threats to certain theories from fake universes and Boltzmann brains.
The threat of fake universes may be dismissed if one doubts the
substrate-independence of consciousness, which seems very implausible in the
SQM framework. Boltzmann brains seem more problematic, though there are many
conceivable solutions. SQM also suggests the possibility that past steps along
our evolutionary ancestry may be so rare that they have occurred nowhere else

proximity-map algorithm is implemented via \emph{oblique thresholding}, which
is the main new tool introduced in this work. We provide convergence conditions
for the algorithm in order to compute minimizers of the target energy.
Analogous results are derived for a parallel variant of the algorithm.
Applications are presented in domain decomposition methods for singular
elliptic PDE's arising in total variation minimization and in accelerated
sparse recovery algorithms based on $\ell_1$-minimization. We include numerical
examples which show efficient solutions to classical problems in signal and
image processing.

symmetries, we now deal with the case where the symmetry action can also have a

convenient form of the field equations of a nonholonomic field theory.
Nonholonomic symmetries are then introduced as symmetry generators whose
virtual work is zero along the constraint submanifold, and we show that for
every such symmetry, there exists a so-called momentum equation, describing the
evolution of the associated component of the momentum map. Keeping up with the
underlying geometric philosophy, a small modification of the derivation of the
momentum lemma allows us to treat also generalized nonholonomic symmetries,
which are vector fields along a projection. Such symmetries arise for example
in practical examples of nonholonomic field theories such as the Cosserat rod,
for which we recover both energy conservation (a previously known result), as
well as a modified conservation law associated with spatial translations.

During the heat treatment liquid Mg infiltrated into B layer and reacted with B

higher than that of usual powder-in-tube(PIT) processed wires. The wires with

PHY-layer raw date rate of wireless networks. However, within the current IEEE
802.11 legacy, MAC-layer throughput is dominated by users with the lowest data
rates, resulting in underutilization of bandwidth. In this paper, we propose
and analyze a novel distributed MAC strategy, referred to as Rate-aware DCF
(R-DCF), to leverage the potential of rate adaptation in IEEE 802.11 WLANs. The
key feature of R-DCF is that by introducing different mini slots according to
the instantaneous channel conditions, only contending stations with the highest
data rate can access the channel. In this way, the R-DCF protocol not only
exploits multi-user diversity in a fully distributed manner but also reduces
the loss of throughput due to collisions. Through analysis, we develop an
analytical model to derive the throughput of R-DCF in general multi-rate WLANs.
Using the analytical model we investigate the performance of R-DCF protocol in
various network settings with different rate adaptation strategies and channel
variations. Based on the analysis, we further derive the maximal throughput
achievable by R-DCF. For practical implementation, an offline adaptive backoff
method is developed to achieve a close-to-optimal performance at low runtime
complexity. The superiority of R-DCF is proven via extensive analyses and
simulations.

in a recent study of $\pi N$ scattering, we show that the pion photoproduction
data up to the second resonance region can be described to a very large extent
by only adjusting the bare $\gamma N \to N^*$ helicity amplitudes, while the
non-resonant electromagnetic couplings are taken from previous works. It is
found that the coupled-channels effects can contribute about 10 - 20 % of the
production cross sections in the $\Delta$ (1232) resonance region, and can
drastically change the magnitude and shape of the cross sections in the second
resonance region. The importance of the off-shell effects in a dynamical
approach is also demonstrated. The meson cloud effects as well as the
coupled-channels contributions to the $\gamma N \to N^*$ form factors are found
to be mainly in the low $Q^2$ region. For the magnetic M1 $\gamma N \to \Delta$

decays are shown to be factorizable under the QCD factorization approach. The
factorizability of the twist-3 two parton corrections is constructed on the
following findings. Under the energetic meson limit, the pseudoscalar
distribution amplitude for a light pseudoscalar meson is allowed to be
non-constant by the equations of motion for the quark. The non-constant
pseudoscalar distribution amplitude is then used to regularize the end-point
divergences in the hard spectator corrections at twist-3 order. By retaining
the momentum fraction variable of the spectator quark of the $B$ meson in the
propagators, the end-point divergence in the weak annihilation corrections at
twist-3 order is resolved. The factorization of the $O(\alpha_s)$ corrections
under the two parton approximation is shown valid up-to $O(1/m_b)$ . The hard
scattering kernels of order $O(\alpha_s)$ and $O(\Lambda_{QCD}/m_b)$ are

coronal loops rooted on both stars inflate and approach each other, which is
driven by the differential stellar rotation. The magnetic reconnection is
modulated by fast-mode magnetoacoustic waves which are trapped between the
surfaces of the two stars, so that the reconnection rate presents a periodic
behaviour. With the typical parameters for the binary system, the observed
period can be reproduced. We also derive an empirical formula to relate the
period of the flaring rate to the coronal temperature and density, as well as

interferometric arrays often form a limitation to the image fidelity. We hope
to overcome these limitations by constructing a frequency-resolved,
full-polarization empirical model for the primary beam of the Westerbork
Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). Holographic observations, sampling angular
scales between about 5 arcmin and 11 degrees, were obtained of a bright compact
source (3C147). These permitted measurement of voltage response patterns for
seven of the fourteen telescopes in the array and allowed calculation of the
mean cross-correlated power beam. Good sampling of the main-lobe, near-in, and
far-side-lobes out to a radius of more than 5 degrees was obtained. A robust
empirical beam model was detemined in all polarization products and at
frequencies between 1322 and 1457 MHz with 1 MHz resolution. Substantial
departures from axi-symmetry are apparent in the main-lobe as well as
systematic differences between the polarization properties. Surprisingly, many
beam properties are modulated at the 5 to 10% level with changing frequency.
These include: (1) the main beam area, (2) the side-lobe to main-lobe power
ratio, and (3) the effective telescope aperture. These semi-sinusoidsal
modulations have a basic period of about 17 MHz, consistent with the natural
'standing wave' period of a 8.75 m focal distance. The deduced frequency
modulations of the beam pattern were verified in an independent long duration
observation using compact continuum sources at very large off-axis distances.
Application of our frequency-resolved beam model should enable higher dynamic
range and improved image fidelity for interferometric observations in complex
fields. (abridged)

electric current is called the (magnetic) self inductance. Can there be a dual
situation with a magnetic current flowing around a loop and producing an
electric field and hence an electric flux through the loop? Following the
classical electrodynamics laws an answer to this question should be negative.
Nevertheless special spectral properties of magnetic dipolar modes in a
quasi-2D ferrite disk show there are the double-valued-function loop magnetic
currents which may produce eigen electric fields and hence eigen electric
fluxes through the loop. In this case one can definitely introduce the notion
of the electric self inductance as the ratio of the electric flux to the
magnetic current. In this paper we show experimentally that in the
magnetic-dipolar-mode ferrite disks there exist eigen electric fluxes. These
fluxes are very sensitive to permittivity parameters of materials abutting to
the ferrite disk. Dielectric samples above a ferrite disk with a higher
permittivity than air confine the electric field closely outside the ferrite,
thereby changing the loop magnetic currents and thus transforming the

reported switches between 0 and $\pi$ in the phase of Aharonov-Bohm
oscillations of the two-terminal differential conductance through a two-dot
ring with increasing voltage bias. Using a simple model, where one of the dots
contains multiple interacting levels, these findings are explained as a result
of transport through the interferometer being dominated at different biases by
quantum dot levels of different ""parity"" (i.e. the sign of the overlap integral
between the dot state and the states in the leads). The redistribution of
electron population between different levels with bias leads to the fact that
the number of switching events is not necessarily equal to the number of dot
levels, in agreement with experiment. For the same reason switching does not
always imply that the parity of levels is strictly alternating. Lastly, it is
demonstrated that the correlation between the first switching of the phase and
the onset of the inelastic cotunneling, as well as the sharp (rather than
gradual) change of phase when switching occurs, give reason to think that the
present interpretation of the experiment is preferable to the one based on
electrostatic AB effect.

this algebra plays an important role in a holomorphic conformal field theory
with a non-negative integer graded conformal dimension, whose target space does
not necessarily have the vanishing first Chern class. This algebra has two

Malikov-Schechtman-Vaintrob in order to compute the obstruction classes of
gerbes of chiral differential operators.

hypotheses) of Witten's $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ heterotic strings and Nekrasov's
generalized complex geometry, after Hitchin and Gualtieri, are consistent in
the case of $\mathbb{CP}^2$, which has $3$ affine patches and is expected to
have the ""first Pontryagin anomaly"".

manifolds, or rather toric del Pezzo surfaces, obtained by blowing up the
non-colinear $1, 2, 3$ points of $\mathbb{CP}^2$. The obstruction classes of
gerbes of them coincide with the second Chern characters obtained by the
Riemann-Roch theorem and in particular vanishes for $1$ point blowup, which
means that one of the gravitational anomalies vanishes for a non-Calabi-Yau
manifold compactification.

  of the Pacific",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present the results of a detailed modeling aimed to reproduce the spectral
energy distribution (SED) of dust and molecular line emission of massive
protostars under the hypothesis that they form via an accretion process. We
model the emission originated in the infalling envelopes at scales smaller than
0.1 pc from the central protostar. To do that, we compared our model results
with observational data covering a wide range of wavelengths, paying special
attention to the high angular resolution mid-infrared data obtained with the
Gemini Observatory and the ammonia line emission observed with the VLA at
centimeter wavelengths. We have explored two kind of model envelopes. In the
first kind of models, spherical symmetry is assumed and the SED as well as the
ammonia emission of the infalling envelope are calculated. In this way, the
temperature, density, velocity, velocity dispersion, and ammonia abundance
variations along the core can be obtained. The second approach takes into
account deviations from the spherical symmetry, and parameters such as the
rotation, degree of elongation of the core, or inclination of the system can be
constrained through the SED fitting. Using these two approaches we have been
able to model the formation of massive stars with a degree of detail similar to
that reached for the low mass stars.

comparisons between the linear and nonlinear versions of the theory and direct
synthetic catalogs show that the nonlinear theory provides an excellent fit to
the synthetic catalogs, while there are significant biases resulting from the
use of the linear approximation. We then address the suggestions proposed by
some authors to use the empirical distribution of inter-event times to obtain a
better determination of the so-called clustering parameter. Our theory and
tests against synthetic and empirical catalogs find a rather dramatic lack of
power for the distribution of inter-event times to distinguish between quite
different sets of parameters, casting doubt on the usefulness of this
statistics for the specific purpose of identifying the clustering parameter.

established recently, up to a natural decomposition of the system, whenever the

general case where S_Q may be infinite. Using the past increments of the

the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities, which first appear in the study of spin glass
models. This provides strong evidence that the above conjecture also holds in

different evolutions, their inner structure has relatively little impact on the

connected to the threshold between partial and complete convection, because
dynamo mechanisms involving a layer of shear like the solar
$\alpha\Omega$-dynamo must cease. Hence a change in stellar activity can be
expected there. Observations of stellar activity do not confirm a rapid break

A_CP, and the supersymmetric contributions to the B^0_{s,d} - \bar B^0_{s,d}

perturbation turned on at time $ t_{\rm w} < t$ in a way mainly depending on
the number of intermittent energy fluctuations, so-called quakes, which fall
within the observation interval $(t_{\rm w},t]$ [Sibani et al. Phys. Rev. B,
74, 224407 and Eur. J. of Physics B, 58,483-491, 2007]. The temporal
distribution of the quakes implies a functional dependence of the average
response on the ratio $t/t_{\rm w}$. Further insight is obtained imposing small
temperature steps, so-called $T$-shifts. The average response as a function of
$t/t_{\rm w,eff}$, where $t_{\rm w,eff}$ is the effective age, is similar to
the response of a system aged isothermally at the final temperature. Using an
Ising model with plaquette interactions, the applicability of analytic formulae
for the average isothermal magnetization is confirmed. The $T$-shifted aging
behavior of the model is described using effective ages. Large positive shifts
nearly reset the effective age. Negative $T$-shifts offer a more detailed probe
of the dynamics. Assuming the marginal stability of the `current' attractor
against thermal noise fluctuations, the scaling form $t_{\rm w,eff} = t_{\rm
w}^x$, and the dependence of the exponent $x$ on the aging temperatures before
and after the shift are theoretically available. The predicted form of $x$ has
no adjustable parameters. Both the algebraic scaling of the effective age and
the form of the exponent agree with the data. The simulations thus confirm the
crucial r\^{o}le of marginal stability in glassy relaxation.

reproducing the dispersion and kurtosis of the projected velocity distribution

density profile, characterized by the virial mass and concentration, together
with the constant anisotropy of galaxy orbits. The use of velocity dispersion
alone does not allow to constrain all the three parameters from kinematic data
due to the mass-anisotropy degeneracy. The degeneracy is broken by introducing
the fourth velocity moment, the kurtosis. We tested the method based on fitting
both moments on mock data sets drawn from simulated dark matter haloes and
showed it to reproduce reliably the properties of the haloes. The method has
been applied to estimate the mass, concentration and anisotropy of more than 20
clusters which allowed us to confirm, for the first time using kinematic data,
the mass-concentration relation found in N-body simulations.

(ODs) are single-symbol decodable/symbol-by-symbol decodable (SSD) and are

SSD codes are obtainable from designs that are not orthogonal also. Recently,
two such classes of SSD codes have been studied: (i) Coordinate Interleaved
Orthogonal Designs (CIODs) and (ii) Minimum-Decoding-Complexity (MDC) STBCs
from Quasi-ODs (QODs). Codes from ODs, CIODs and MDC-QODs are mutually
non-intersecting classes of codes. The class of CIODs have {\it non-unitary
weight matrices} when written as a Linear Dispersion Code (LDC) proposed by
Hassibi and Hochwald, whereas several known SSD codes including CODs have {\it
unitary weight matrices}. In this paper, we obtain SSD codes with unitary
weight matrices (that are not CODs) called Clifford Unitary Weight SSDs
(CUW-SSDs) from matrix representations of Clifford algebras. A main result of
this paper is the derivation of an achievable upper bound on the rate of any
unitary weight SSD code as $\frac{a}{2^{a-1}}$ for $2^a$ antennas which is
larger than that of the CODs which is $\frac{a+1}{2^a}$. It is shown that
several known classes of SSD codes are CUW-SSD codes and CUW-SSD codes meet
this upper bound. Also, for the codes of this paper conditions on the signal
sets which ensure full-diversity and expressions for the coding gain are
presented. A large class of SSD codes with non-unitary weight matrices are
obtained which include CIODs as a proper subclass.
