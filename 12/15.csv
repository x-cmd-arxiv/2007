the cosmic string network. In the scaling regime, we find two different scales
corresponding to large (one order below horizon) and small (few orders below
horizon) loops. The very small (tiny) loops at the gravitational back reaction
scale are absent, and thus, our model has no ultra-violet divergences. We
calculate the spectrum of loops and derive analytical expressions for the
positions and magnitudes of the small and large scale peaks. The small loops
are produced by large bursts of similar loops moving with very high velocities
in the same direction. We describe the shape of large loops, which would
usually consist of few kinks and few cusps per oscillation cycle. We also argue
that the typical size of large loops is set by the correlation length, which
does not depend on the intercommutation probability p, while the interstring
distance scales as p^{1/3}.

clustering of haloes corresponding to rarer peaks than was possible in previous
studies; the rarest haloes for which we measure the variance are 100 times more
clustered than the dark matter. We are able to extract, for the first time,
halo bias parameters from linear up to fourth order. For all orders measured,
we find that the bias parameters are a strong function of mass for haloes more
massive than the characteristic mass $M_{*}$. Currently, no theoretical model
is able to reproduce this mass dependence closely. We find that the bias
parameters also depend on the internal structure of the halo up to fourth
order. For haloes more massive than $M_{*}$, we find that the more concentrated
haloes are more weakly clustered than the less concentrated ones. We see no
dependence of clustering on concentration for haloes with masses $M<M_{*}$;
this is contrary to the trend reported in the literature when segregating
haloes by their formation time. Our results are insensitive to whether haloes
are labelled by the total mass returned by the friends-of-friends group finder
or by the mass of the most massive substructure. This implies that our

important for applications in real physical or biological systems: (a) it is
strictly insensitive to mixtures of arbitrary independent sources, (b) it gives
meaningful results even if the phase spectrum is not linear, and (c) it
properly weights contributions from different frequencies. Simulations of a
class of coupled multivariate random data show that for truly unidirectional
information flow without additional noise contamination our measure detects the
correct direction as good as the standard Granger causality. For random
mixtures of independent sources Granger Causality erroneously yields highly
significant results whereas our measure correctly becomes non-significant. An
application of our novel method to EEG data (88 subjects in eyes-closed

  figures",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20078989",,"astro-ph",,"  The study of symbiotic stars is essential to understand important aspects of
stellar evolution in interacting binaries. Their observed population in the
Galaxy is however poorly known, and is one to three orders of magnitudes
smaller than the predicted population size. IPHAS, the INT Photometric Halpha
survey of the Northern Galactic plane, gives us the opportunity to make a
systematic, complete search for symbiotic stars in a magnitude-limited volume,
and discover a significant number of new systems.
  A method of selecting candidate symbiotic stars by combining IPHAS and
near-IR (2MASS) colours is presented. It allows us to distinguish symbiotic
binaries from normal stars and most of the other types of Halpha emission line
stars in the Galaxy. The only exception are T Tauri stars, which can however be
recognized because of their concentration in star forming regions. Using these
selection criteria, we discuss the classification of a list of 4338 IPHAS stars
with Halpha in emission. 1500 to 2000 of them are likely to be Be stars. Among
the remaining objects, 1183 fulfill our photometric constraints to be
considered candidate symbiotic stars. The spectroscopic confirmation of three
of these objects, which are the first new symbiotic stars discovered by IPHAS,
proves the potential of the survey and selection method.

masers toward the silicate carbon star EU And to probe the spatio-kinematic
distribution of oxygen-rich material. EU And was observed at three epochs
(maximum time interval of 14 months) with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA).
Our VLBA observations of the 22 GHz H2O masers have revealed that the maser
spots are distributed along a straight line across ~20 mas, with a slight hint
of an S-shaped structure. The observed spectra show three prominent velocity
components at V_LSR = -42, -38, and -34 km s^-1, with the masers in SW
redshifted and those in NE blueshifted. The maser spots located in the middle
of the overall distribution correspond to the component at V_LSR = -38 km s^-1,
which approximately coincides with the systemic velocity. These observations
can be interpreted as either an emerging helical jet or a disk viewed almost
edge-on (a circumbinary or circum-companion disk). However, the outward motion
measured in the VLBA images taken 14 months apart is much smaller than that
expected from the jet scenario. Furthermore, the mid-infrared spectrum obtained
with the Spitzer Space Telescope indicates that the 10 micron silicate emission
is optically thin and the silicate grains are of sub-micron size. This lends
support to the presence of a circum-companion disk, because an optically thin
circumbinary disk consisting of such small grains would be blown away by the
intense radiation pressure of the primary (carbon-rich) star. If we assume
Keplerian rotation for the circum-companion disk, the mass of the companion is
estimated to be 0.5--0.8 M_sun. We also identify CO2 emission features at
13--16 micron in the Spitzer spectrum of EU And--the first unambiguous

high $\beta$ waves across the $\beta \approx 1$ layer. The work here
contributes specifically to what happens when a low $\beta$ fast wave crosses
the $\beta \approx 1$ layer and transforms into high $\beta$ fast and slow
waves. The nature of fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves is investigated in a
finite $\beta$ plasma in the neighbourhood of a two-dimensional null point. The
linearised equations are solved in both polar and cartesian forms with a
two-step Lax-Wendroff numerical scheme. Analytical work (e.g. small $\beta$
expansion and WKB approximation) also complement the work. It is found that
when a finite gas pressure is included in magnetic equilibrium containing an
X-type null point, a fast wave is attracted towards the null by a refraction
effect and that a slow wave is generated as the wave crosses the $\beta \approx
1$ layer. Current accumulation occurs close to the null and along nearby
separatrices. The fast wave can now \emph{pass through the origin} due to the
non-zero sound speed, an effect not previously seen in related papers but clear
seen for larger values of $\beta$. Some of the energy can now leave the region
of the null point and there is again generation of a slow wave component (we
find that the fraction of the incident wave converted to a slow wave is
proportional to $\beta$). We conclude that there are two competing phenomena;
the refraction effect (due to the variable Alfv\'en speed) and the contribution
from the non-zero sound speed. These experiments illustrate the importance of
the magnetic topology and of the location of the $\beta \approx 1$ layer in the
system.

recognition can be derived, the ambiguous and complex nature of this mechanism
precludes a simple recognition code, therefore the prediction of DNA target
sequences is not straightforward. DNA-protein interactions can be studied using
computational methods which can complement the current experimental methods and
offer some advantages. In the present work we use physical effective potentials
to evaluate the DNA-protein binding affinities for the lambda repressor-DNA
complex for which structural and thermodynamic experimental data are available.
The effect of conformational sampling by Molecular Dynamics simulations on the
computed binding energy is assessed; results show that this effect is in
general negative and the reproducibility of the experimental values decreases
with the increase of simulation time considered. The free energy of binding for
non-specific complexes agrees with earlier theoretical suggestions. Moreover,
as a results of these analyses, we propose a protocol for the prediction of
DNA-binding target sequences. The possibility of searching regulatory elements
within the bacteriophage-lambda genome using this protocol is explored. Our
analysis shows good prediction capabilities, even in the absence of any
thermodynamic data and information on the naturally recognized sequence. This
study supports the conclusion that physics-based methods can offer a completely
complementary methodology to sequence-based methods for the identification of

transition to the nebular phase, there is no need to appeal to forbidden lines
at 3 weeks postmaximum, and at 3 months postmaximum the only clear
identification of a forbidden line is [Ca II] 7291, 7324. Recent studies of SN
Ia rates indicate that most of the SNe Ia that have ever occurred have been
""prompt"" SNe Ia, produced by young (100,000,000 yr) stellar populations, while
most of the SNe Ia that occur at low redshift today are ""tardy"", produced by an
older (several Gyrs) population. We suggest that the shallow silicon SNe Ia
tend to be the prompt ones.

interactions-in the simplest case, the Ising model-provide surprisingly
accurate descriptions of experiments on real biological networks ranging from
neurons to genes. Finding these models requires us to solve an inverse problem:
given experimentally measured expectation values, what are the parameters of
the underlying Hamiltonian? This problem sits at the intersection of
statistical physics and machine learning, and we suggest that more efficient
solutions are possible by merging ideas from the two fields. We use a
combination of recent coordinate descent algorithms with an adaptation of the
histogram Monte Carlo method, and implement these techniques to take advantage
of the sparseness found in data on real neurons. The resulting algorithm learns
the parameters of an Ising model describing a network of forty neurons within a
few minutes. This opens the possibility of analyzing much larger data sets now
emerging, and thus testing hypotheses about the collective behaviors of these
networks.

either supports vortices by itself, or when these vortices are accompanied by

three different techniques. A formula for the fractional charge is given as a
function of a parameter in the Dirac Hamiltonian that breaks the spectral

neutron star is irrotational and the black hole is nonspinning with a 3:1 mass
ratio, we investigate the inspiral, merger, and disk formation in the system.
We find that the vast majority of material is promptly accreted and no more

gravitationally bound disk. We find similar results for mass ratios of 2:1 and
1:1, even when we reduce the NS compaction in the 2:1 mass ratio case. These
ambient disks reach temperatures suitable for triggering SGRBs, but their
masses may be too small to produce the required total energy output. We measure
gravitational waveforms and compute the effective strain in frequency space,
finding measurable differences between our waveforms and those produced by
binary black hole mergers within the advanced LIGO band. These differences
appear at frequencies corresponding to the emission that occurs when the NS is

micron spectrum of WD0018-267 are consistent with a Teff = 5720K, pure hydrogen
white dwarf model atmosphere. On the other hand, LHS 1126 remains peculiar with
significant mid-IR flux deficits in all IRAC bands and a featureless spectrum
in the 5.2-7.5 micron range. Even though this deficit is attributed to
collision induced absorption (CIA) due to molecular hydrogen, the shape of the
deficit cannot be explained with current CIA opacity calculations. The infrared
portion of the LHS 1126 spectral energy distribution is best-fit with a power
law index of -1.99; identical to a Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. This argues that
the deficit may be due to an unrecognized grey-like opacity source in the
infrared.

particle (LSP), the SUSY breaking scale (i.e., the gravitino mass) could be
determined by measuring the lifetime of the next-to-lightest SUSY particle
(NLSP). However, for an ultralight gravitino of mass of O(1) eV, which is
favored cosmologically, the determination of the SUSY breaking scale, or the
gravitino mass, is difficult because the NLSP decay length is too short to be
measured directly. Recently we proposed a new determination of the gravitino
mass by measuring a branching fraction of two decay modes of sleptons. In this
paper, we investigate the prospects for determining the gravitino mass at LHC.
For demonstration we take some explicit gauge-mediation models and show that
the gravitino mass can be determined with an accuracy of a few 10% for an
integrated luminosity 10-100 fb^{-1}.

dispersion along the $a^\ast$-axis direction near the resonance, but they are
isotropic at lower energies. Since a fundamental change in the low-temperature

takes place at $y\sim0.5$ with a metal-to-insulator crossover (MIC), where the

general capacity theory for wireless networks, particularly a theory capable of
describing the fundamental performance limits of mobile ad hoc networks
(MANETs). A MANET is a peer-to-peer network with no pre-existing
infrastructure. MANETs are the most general wireless networks, with single-hop,
relay, interference, mesh, and star networks comprising special cases. The lack
of a MANET capacity theory has stunted the development and commercialization of
many types of wireless networks, including emergency, military, sensor, and
community mesh networks. Information theory, which has been vital for links and
centralized networks, has not been successfully applied to decentralized
wireless networks. Even if this was accomplished, for such a theory to truly
characterize the limits of deployed MANETs it must overcome three key
roadblocks. First, most current capacity results rely on the allowance of
unbounded delay and reliability. Second, spatial and timescale decompositions
have not yet been developed for optimally modeling the spatial and temporal
dynamics of wireless networks. Third, a useful network capacity theory must
integrate rather than ignore the important role of overhead messaging and
feedback. This paper describes some of the shifts in thinking that may be
needed to overcome these roadblocks and develop a more general theory that we
refer to as non-equilibrium information theory.

scintillation efficiency to two major mechanisms: 1) energy loss and 2)
scintillation quenching. The former is commonly described by Lindhard's theory
and the latter by Birk's saturation law. We propose to combine these two to
explain the observed reduction of scintillation yield for nuclear recoils in
noble liquids. Birk's constants $kB$ for argon, neon and xenon determined from
existing data are used to predict noble liquid scintillator's response to
low-energy nuclear recoils and low-energy electrons. We find that energy loss
due to nuclear stopping power that contributes little to ionization and
excitation is the dominant reduction mechanism in scintillation efficiency for
nuclear recoils, but that significant additional quenching results from the
nonlinear response of scintillation to the ionization density.

luminosity of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Recent simulations and observations
are converging on the view that the extreme luminosity of quasars is fueled in
major mergers of gas-rich galaxies. In such a picture, quasars are expected to
be located in regions with a higher density of galaxies on small scales where
mergers are more likely to take place. However, in this picture, the activity
observed in low-luminosity AGN is due to secular processes that are less
dependent on the local galaxy density. To test this hypothesis, we compare the
local photometric galaxy density on kiloparsec scales around spectroscopic Type
I and Type II quasars to the local density around lower luminosity
spectroscopic Type I and Type II AGN. To minimize projection effects and
evolution in the photometric galaxy sample we use to characterize AGN
environments, we place our random control sample at the same redshift as our
AGN and impose a narrow redshift window around both the AGN and control
targets. We find that higher luminosity AGN have more overdense environments
compared to lower luminosity AGN on all scales out to our $2\Mpchseventy$
limit. Additionally, in the range $0.3\leqslant z\leqslant 0.6$, Type II
quasars have similarly overdense environments to those of bright Type I quasars
on all scales out to our $2\Mpchseventy$ limit, while the environment of dimmer
Type I quasars appears to be less overdense than the environment of Type II
quasars. We see increased overdensity for Type II AGN compared to Type I AGN on
scales out to our limit of $2\Mpchseventy$ in overlapping redshift ranges. We
also detect marginal evidence for evolution in the number of galaxies within
$2\Mpchseventy$ of a quasar with redshift.

strongly affected by the dynamics of their giant planets and/or their stellar
companions. These objects have profound effects on the structure of the disk of
planetesimals and protoplanetary objects in which terrestrial-class planets are
formed. To what extent the current theories of planet formation can be applied
to such ""extreme"" planetary systems depends on the dynamical characteristics of
their planets and/or their binary stars. In this paper, I present the results
of a study of the possibility of the existence of Earth-like objects in systems
with multiple giant planets (namely Upsilon Andromedae, 47 UMa, GJ 876, and 55
Cnc) and discuss the dynamics of the newly discovered Neptune-size object in 55
Cnc system. I will also review habitable planet formation in binary systems and
present the results of a systematic search of the parameter-space for which
Earth-like objects can form and maintain long-term stable orbits in the
habitable zones of binary stars.

standard form of the fair sampling assumption is that the loss is independent
of the measurement settings, so the ensemble of detected systems provides a
fair statistical sample of the total ensemble. This is often assumed to be
needed to interpret Bell inequality experiments as ruling out hidden-variable
theories. Here we show that it is not necessary; the loss can depend on
measurement settings, provided the detection efficiency factorises as a
function of the measurement settings and any hidden variable. This condition
implies that Tsirelson's bound must be satisfied for entangled states. On the
other hand, we show that it is possible for Tsirelson's bound to be violated
while the CHSH-Bell inequality still holds for unentangled states, and present
an experimentally feasible example.

The missions employ deep-space laser ranging using drag-free spacecraft to map

field is determined by three factors: the dynamic distribution of matter in the
solar system; the dynamic distribution of matter outside the solar system
(galactic, cosmological, etc.) and gravitational waves propagating through the
solar system. Different relativistic theories of gravity make different
predictions of the solar-system gravitational field. Hence, precise
measurements of the solar-system gravitational field test all these. The tests
and observations include: (i) a precise determination of the relativistic
parameters beta and gamma with 3-5 orders of magnitude improvement over
previous measurements; (ii) a 1-2 order of magnitude improvement in the
measurement of G-dot; (iii) a precise determination of any anomalous, constant
acceleration Aa directed towards the Sun; (iv) a measurement of solar angular
momentum via the Lense-Thirring effect; (v) the detection of solar g-mode
oscillations via their changing gravity field, thus, providing a new eye to see
inside the Sun; (vi) precise determination of the planetary orbit elements and
masses; (viii) better determination of the orbits and masses of major
asteroids; (ix) detection and observation of gravitational waves from massive

improve the performance of network users operating in a time-varying,
error-prone wireless environment. However, these solutions often rely on ad-hoc
optimization approaches, which ignore the different environmental dynamics
experienced at various layers by a user and violate the layered network
architecture of the protocol stack by requiring layers to provide access to
their internal protocol parameters to other layers. This paper presents a new
theoretic foundation for cross-layer optimization, which allows each layer to
make autonomous decisions individually, while maximizing the utility of the
wireless user by optimally determining what information needs to be exchanged
among layers. Hence, this cross-layer framework does not change the current
layered architecture. Specifically, because the wireless user interacts with
the environment at various layers of the protocol stack, the cross-layer
optimization problem is formulated as a layered Markov decision process (MDP)
in which each layer adapts its own protocol parameters and exchanges
information (messages) with other layers in order to cooperatively maximize the
performance of the wireless user. The message exchange mechanism for
determining the optimal cross-layer transmission strategies has been designed
for both off-line optimization and on-line dynamic adaptation. We also show
that many existing cross-layer optimization algorithms can be formulated as
simplified, sub-optimal, versions of our layered MDP framework.

this generally prevent any firm conclusion when a planet is considered on an
individual basis. On the basis of a sample of 9 transiting planets known at the
time, Guillot et al. A&A 453, L21 (1996), concluded that all planets could be
explained with the same set of hypotheses, either by large but plausible
modifications of the equations of state, opacities, or by the addition of an
energy source, probably related to the dissipation of kinetic energy by tides.
On this basis, they concluded that the amount of heavy elements in close-in
giant planets is correlated with the metallicity of the parent star.
Furthermore they showed that planets around metal-rich stars can possess large
amounts of heavy elements, up to 100 Earth masses. These results are confirmed
by studying the present sample of 18 transiting planets with masses between
that of Saturn and twice the mass of Jupiter.

disorder. The distribution K(.) of the location of the first contact of the
(free) polymer with the defect line is assumed to be of the form
K(n)=n^{-\alpha-1}L(n), with L(.) slowly varying. The model undergoes a
(de)-localization phase transition: the free energy (per unit length) is zero
in the delocalized phase and positive in the localized phase. For \alpha<1/2 it
is known that disorder is irrelevant: quenched and annealed critical points
coincide for small disorder, as well as quenched and annealed critical
exponents. The same has been proven also for \alpha=1/2, but under the
assumption that L(.) diverges sufficiently fast at infinity, an hypothesis that
is not satisfied in the (1+1)-dimensional wetting model considered by Forgacs
et al. (1986) and Derrida et al. (1992), where L(.) is asymptotically constant.
Here we prove that, if 1/2<\alpha<1 or \alpha >1, then quenched and annealed
critical points differ whenever disorder is present, and we give the scaling
form of their difference for small disorder. In agreement with the so-called
Harris criterion, disorder is therefore relevant in this case. In the marginal
case \alpha=1/2, under the assumption that L(.) vanishes sufficiently fast at
infinity, we prove that the difference between quenched and annealed critical
points, which is known to be smaller than any power of the disorder strength,
is positive: disorder is marginally relevant. Again, the case considered by
Forgacs et al. (1986) and Derrida et al. (1992) is out of our analysis and
remains open.

experiments are aiming to test different scenarios for elementary particles
interactions from SUSY, Extra dimensions to others. In fact, SUSY was invented
to kill the conceptual problems existing in the conventional Standard model
\textit{i.e.} the Hierarchy problem. However, in recent years, certain theories
which was rejected in the past like the wrong sign $\phi^{4}$ theory is now
well known to be a truly physically acceptable theory. Here, we analyze the
renormalization group flow of the different parameters in the theory. We find
that, rather than the conventional $\phi^{4}$ theory and because the theory is
asymptotically free, it does not sufferer from the catastrophic blow up of the
mass parameter for UV scales. This feature greatly recommend that this theory
is a plausible candidate to play the role of the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ symmetry
breaking in the standard model. If this picture will agree with the
experimental results from LHC, then the Higgs particle was massless in the far
past. Moreover, the cosmological constant problem as a Hierarchy problem may be
solved too. However, when trying to calculate the metric operator, we expected
that the equivalent Hermitian theory may attain non-remormalizabe terms and
thus the theory is incalculable. In fact, we show that there exists a Hermitian
and renormalizable equivalent theory though of indefinite metric. We
reformulated the Klein-Gordon equation in such a way that the wrong sign in the
propagator attains a new physical meaning that the Higgs particle is made from
exotic matter.

on-chip microwave resonators are simultaneously coupled to one superconducting
qubit. Within this framework, we demonstrate that the qubit can function as a
quantum switch between the two resonators, which are assumed to be originally
independent. In this three-circuit network, the qubit mediates a geometric
second-order circuit interaction between the otherwise decoupled resonators. In
the dispersive regime, it also gives rise to a dynamic second-order
perturbative interaction. The geometric and dynamic coupling strengths can be
tuned to be equal, thus permitting to switch on and off the interaction between
the two resonators via a qubit population inversion or a shifting of the qubit
operation point. We also show that our quantum switch represents a flexible
architecture for the manipulation and generation of nonclassical microwave
field states as well as the creation of controlled multipartite entanglement in
circuit QED. In addition, we clarify the role played by the geometric
interaction, which constitutes a fundamental property characteristic of
superconducting quantum circuits without counterpart in quantum-optical
systems. We develop a detailed theory of the geometric second-order coupling by
means of circuit transformations for superconducting charge and flux qubits.
Furthermore, we show the robustness of the quantum switch operation with
respect to decoherence mechanisms. Finally, we propose a realistic design for a
two-resonator circuit QED setup based on a flux qubit and estimate all the
related parameters. In this manner, we show that this setup can be used to
implement a superconducting quantum switch with available technology.

inflation mechanism which occurred soon after the Big Bang, while along a
relatively small number of lower redshift light paths where lensing events are
observed, space is positively curved. How do we know that global geometry and
topology are robust rather than in a state of chaos? The phenomenon of cosmic
shear provides an effective way of mapping curvature fluctuations, because it
affects {\it any} light rays whether they intercept mass clumps or not. We
discuss a range of astrophysical applications of the principal manifestation of
shear - the distortion of images. It will be shown that the quickest way of
testing the existence of shear in the near Universe is to look at the shape of
Einstein rings. The fact that most of these rings are circular to a large
extent means, statistically speaking, shear occurs at a much lower level than
the expectation based upon our current understanding of the inhomogeneous
Universe. While inflation may account for the mean geometry, it offers no means
of stabilizing it against the fluctuations caused by non-linear matter clumping
at low redshift. Either this clumping is actually much less severe, or the
physical mechanism responsible for shaping the large scale curvature has been
active not only during the very early epochs, but also at all subsequent times.
Might it be the vital `interface' between expansion on Hubble distances and
gravity on cluster scales and beneath?
