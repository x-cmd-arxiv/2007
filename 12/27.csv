theory capable of simultaneously satisfying all relevant bounds from cosmology,
neutrino physics, and flavor violation. In addition, we also explore several
potential extensions of the model, such as the possibility of right-handed
sneutrino dark matter and the potential for relating the leptogenesis mechanism
to the origin of the mu-term. Theories with a heavy gravitino and gaugino
masses generated by anomaly mediation emerge as one natural context for Dirac
leptogenesis. In such models the lightest neutralino is often expected to be
predominately wino or Higgsino, and is a viable dark matter candidate. We
conclude with an examination of the prospects for detecting the effectively

protocols for reliable packet communication under a secrecy constraint. The
hybrid automatic retransmission request (HARQ) protocol is revisited for a
block-fading wire-tap channel, in which two legitimate users communicate over a
block-fading channel in the presence of a passive eavesdropper who intercepts
the transmissions through an independent block-fading channel. In this model,
the transmitter obtains a 1-bit ACK/NACK feedback from the legitimate receiver
via an error-free public channel. Both reliability and confidentiality of
secure HARQ protocols are studied by the joint consideration of channel coding,
secrecy coding, and retransmission protocols. In particular, the error and
secrecy performance of repetition time diversity (RTD) and incremental
redundancy (INR) protocols are investigated based on good Wyner code sequences,
which ensure that the confidential message is decoded successfully by the
legitimate receiver and is kept in total ignorance by the eavesdropper for a
given set of channel realizations. This paper first illustrates that there
exists a good rate-compatible Wyner code family which ensures a secure INR
protocol. Next, two types of outage probabilities, connection outage and
secrecy outage probabilities are defined in order to characterize the tradeoff
between the reliability of the legitimate communication link and the
confidentiality with respect to the eavesdropper's link. For a given
connection/secrecy outage probability pair, an achievable throughput of secure
HARQ protocols is derived for block-fading channels. Finally, both asymptotic
analysis and numerical computations demonstrate the benefits of HARQ protocols
to throughput and secrecy.

case of a semitransparent mirror initially at rest, then accelerating for some

by Walker, and Carlitz and Willey), and finally moving with constant velocity.
When the reflection and transmission coefficients are those in the model

and $s(w)=\w/(\w+i\alpha)$, with $\alpha\geq 0$], the Bogoliubov coefficients

that, when $\alpha$ is very large (case of an ideal, perfectly reflecting
mirror) a thermal emission of scalar massless particles obeying Bose-Einstein
statistics is radiated from the mirror (a black body radiation), in accordance
with results previously obtained in the literature. However, when $\alpha$ is
finite (semitransparent mirror, a physically realistic situation) the striking
result is obtained that the thermal emission of scalar massless particles obeys
Fermi-Dirac statistics. We also show here that the reverse change of statistics
takes place in a bidimensional fermionic model for massless particles, namely
that the Fermi-Dirac statistics for the completely reflecting situation will
turn into the Bose-Einstein statistics for a partially reflecting, physical

amplitude off Y=0 brane boundary and compare it with the scattering amplitude
between two magnon bound-states in the bulk. We find that analytic structure of
the two amplitudes are intimately related each other: the boundary reflection
amplitude is a square-root of the bulk scattering amplitude. Using such
relation as a guide and taking known results at weak and strong coupling limits
as inputs, we find the reflection amplitude of an elementary magnon off Z=0
giant graviton boundary. The reflection phase factor is shown to solve crossing
and unitarity relations. We then compute the reflection amplitude of magnon
bound-state off the Z=0 brane boundary and observe that its analytic structures
are again intimately related to the bulk scattering and the Y=0 boundary
reflection amplitudes. We also take dyonic giant magnon limit of these
reflection amplitudes and confirm that their phase-shifts agree completely with
string worldsheet computations based on complex sine-Gordon soliton scattering.

II radio galaxy associated with a luminous extended emission-line region
(EELR). Surface brightness modeling of an emission-line-free HST R-band image
reveals that the host galaxy is a massive elliptical with a compact companion
0.8"" away and 4 magnitudes fainter. The host galaxy spectrum is best described
by an intermediate-age (1.3 Gyr) stellar population (4% by mass), superimposed
on a 10 Gyr old population and a power law (\alpha_{\lambda} = -1.8); the
stellar populations are consistent with super-solar metallicities, with the
best fit given by the 2.5 Z_sun models. We derive a dynamical mass of 4E11
M_sun within the effective radius from the velocity dispersion. The EELR
spectra clearly indicate that the EELR is photoionized by the hidden central
engine. Photoionization modeling shows evidence that the gas metallicity in
both the EELR and the nuclear narrow-line region is mildly sub-solar (0.3 - 0.7
Z_sun) -- significantly lower than the super-solar metallicities deduced from
typical active galactic nuclei in the SDSS. The more luminous filaments in the
EELR exhibit a velocity field consistent with a common disk rotation. Fainter
clouds, however, show high approaching velocities that are uncoupled with this
apparent disk rotation. The striking similarities between this EELR and the
EELRs around steep-spectrum radio-loud quasars provide further evidence for the
orientation-dependent unification schemes. The metal-poor gas is almost
certainly not native to the massive host galaxy. We suggest that the close
companion galaxy could be the tidally stripped bulge of a late-type galaxy that
is merging with the host galaxy. The interstellar medium of such a galaxy is
probably the source for the low-metallicity gas in 3C79.

opposite-sign, same-flavor (OSSF) dileptons with an invariant-mass distribution
shifted away from the kinematic endpoint. In different parameter regions, the
charginos and neutralinos produced in cascades all decay dominantly to the
lighter sneutrinos, leading to a kinematic edge in the jet-lepton
invariant-mass distribution from the decay chain $\tilde{q} \to \chi^- q \to

using mass estimation methods to distinguish this mixed-sneutrino jet-lepton

temperature, the value of the Wilson-Maldacena loop wrapping the Euclidean time
circle (the Polyakov-Maldacena loop, or PML) is computed by the area of a
certain minimal surface in the dual supergravity background. This prescription
can be used to calculate the free energy as a function of the PML (averaged
over the spatial coordinates), by introducing into the bulk action a Lagrange
multiplier term that fixes the (average) area of the appropriate minimal
surface. This term, which can also be viewed as a chemical potential for the
PML, contributes to the bulk stress tensor like a string stretching from the
horizon to the boundary (smeared over the angular directions). We find the
corresponding ""hedgehog"" black hole solutions numerically, within an
SO(6)-preserving ansatz, and derive part of the free energy diagram for the
PML. As a warm-up problem, we also find exact solutions for hedgehog black
holes in pure gravity, and derive the free energy and phase diagrams for that

testing the relation between risk and return on the financial instruments. On
the basis of the Intertemporal CAPM model we built a general sampling model

assumptions is that the skewness of the conditional distribution of returns is
used as an alternative source of relation between risk and return. This general
specification relates to GARCH-In-Mean model. In order to make conditional
distribution of financial returns skewed we considered a constructive approach
based on the inverse probability integral transformation. In particular, we
apply the hidden truncation mechanism, two equivalent approaches of the inverse
scale factors, order statistics concept, Beta and Bernstein distribution
transformations, and also the constructive method. Based on the daily excess
returns on the Warsaw Stock Exchange Index we checked the empirical importance
of the conditional skewness assumption on the relation between risk and return

equipped with the most advanced IR detectors and in most of the cases with

accuracy required to pinpoint faint objects in crowded fields. <Results>. We

<Conclusions>. The IR variability of the AXP XTE J1810-197 does not follow the
same monotonic decrease of its post-outburst X-ray emission. Instead, the IR
variability appears more similar to the one observed in radio band, although
simultaneous IR and radio observations are crucial to draw any conclusion in

fields in the Virgo Cluster spiral NGC4254 are investigated with help of
""magnetic maps"" presenting distributions of different magnetic field components
over the entire galaxy, free of Faraday rotation and projection effects. We
show that the dramatic variation of orientation of magnetic field vectors (from
0deg to more than 40deg) throughout the galaxy cannot arise from the dynamo
process alone, but must be dominated by the effects like density waves and
local gas flows. We determine within the galaxy the relation between the
strength of total magnetic field and the local star-formation rate (SFR) as a
power-law with an index of +0.18+-0.01. We find the opposite sense of relation
of magnetic field regularity with SFR (-0.32+-0.03) and suggest that it results
from efficient production of random field with rising turbulence in the regions
with actively forming stars. The distribution of Faraday rotation measures in
NGC4254 indicates a perturbed axisymmetrical mean-field dynamo mode or a
mixture of axisymmetrical and bisymmetrical ones with regular field directed
outwards the disk, which is contrary to most observed galaxies. The magnetic
fields within two outer magnetic arms (shifted downstream of a density wave)
are strong, up to 13muG in the regular field and 20muG in the total field. Our
modeling of cluster influence on different magnetic field components indicates
that within the outer magnetic arms the dynamo-induced magnetic fields are
modified by stretching and shearing forces rather than by cluster ram pressure.
Those forces, which are likely triggered by the galaxy's gravitational
interaction, produce an anisotropic component of the regular field and enhance
the polarized emission.(abridged)

doing any assigned task for that particular group. We term this sort of DSN as

we propose a secure membership verification mechanism using one-way accumulator

of nodes in the same deployment group can verify each other-s legitimacy of

those of the other previously proposed PKC schemes for WSN. Our security
architecture comprises basically of two parts; a key handshaking scheme based
on simple linear operations and the derivation of decryption key by a receiver
node. Our architecture allows both base-station-to-node or node-to-base-station

quantum field theory living on the boundary of spacetime. Specifically, we
study a five-dimensional model cosmology in type IIB supergravity, where the
dual theory is an unstable deformation of $\N=4$ supersymmetric SU(N) gauge
theory on $\Rbar\times S^3$. A one-loop computation shows that the coupling
governing the instability is asymptotically free, so quantum corrections cannot
turn the potential around. The big crunch singularity in the bulk occurs when a
boundary scalar field runs to infinity, in finite time. Consistent quantum
evolution requires that we impose boundary conditions at infinite scalar field,
i.e. a self-adjoint extension of the system. We find that quantum spreading of
the homogeneous mode of the boundary scalar leads to a natural UV cutoff in
particle production as the wavefunction for the homogeneous mode bounces back
from infinity. However a perturbative calculation indicates that despite this,
the logarithmic running of the boundary coupling governing the instability
generally leads to significant particle production across the bounce. This
prevents the wave packet of the homogeneous boundary scalar to return close to
its initial form. Translating back to the bulk theory, we conclude that a
quantum transition from a big crunch to a big bang is an improbable outcome of
cosmological evolution in this class of five-dimensional models.

evolution of standard big bang cosmology. In this paper, we calculate the
spectrum of curvature perturbation generated during the emergence of island. We
find that generally the spectrum obtained is nearly scale invariant, which can
be well related to that of slow roll inflation by a simple duality. This in
some sense suggests a degeneracy between their scalar spectra. In addition, we
also simply estimate the non-Gaussianity of perturbation, which is naturally

phase, several bursts were detected, and many aspects of the X-ray emission
changed. We report on the discovery of six X-ray bursts, the first ever seen
from this AXP in ~10 years of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) monitoring.
All the bursts occurred in the interval between 2006 April 6 and 2007 February
7. The bursts had the canonical fast rise slow decay profiles characteristic of
SGR/AXP bursts. The burst durations ranged from 8-3x10^3 s as characterized by
T90,these are very long durations even when compared to the broad T90
distributions of other bursts from SGRs and AXPs. The first five burst spectra
are well modeled by simple blackbodies, with temperature kT ~2-6 keV. However,
the sixth burst had a complicated spectrum consisting of at least three
emission lines with possible additional emission and absorption lines. The most
significant feature was at ~14 keV. Similar 14-keV spectral features were seen
in bursts from AXPs 1E 1048.1-5937 and XTE J1810-197. If this feature is
interpreted as a proton cyclotron line, then it supports the existence of a
magnetar-strength field for these AXPs. Several of the bursts were accompanied
by a short-term pulsed flux enhancement. We discuss these events in the context
of the magnetar model.

PP decays. We consider a FSI approach with both short- and long-distance
contributions, where the former are from in-elastic channels and are contained
in factorization amplitudes, while the latter are from the residual
rescattering among PP states. Flavor SU(3) symmetry is used to constrain the
residual rescattering S-matrix. We fit to all available data on the CP-averaged
decay rates and CP asymmetries, and make predictions on unmeasured ones. Our
main results are as follows: (i) Results are in agreement with data in the
presence of FSI. (ii) For B decays, the pi^+pi^- and pi^0pi^0 rates are
suppressed and enhanced respectively by FSI. (iii) The FSI has a large impact
on direct CP asymmetries of many modes. (iv) The deviation (Delta A) between
A(B{bar}^0 to K^-pi^+) and A(B^-to K^-\pi^0) can be understood in the FSI
approach. (v) Sizable and complex color-suppressed tree amplitudes, which are
crucial for the large \pi^0\pi^0 rate and Delta A, are generated through
exchange rescattering. The correlation of the ratio B(pi^0pi^0)/B(pi^+pi^-) and
Delta A is studied. (vi) The B^- to pi^-pi^0 direct CP violation is very small
and is not affected by FSI. (vii) Several B_s decay rates are enhanced. In
particular, the eta'eta' branching ratio is enhanced to the level of
1.0X10^{-4}, which can be checked experimentally. (viii) Time-dependent CP
asymmetries S in B_{d,s} decays are studied. CP asymmetries in these modes will
be useful to test the SM.

over an extended period, 40P/Vaisala 1, 47P/Ashbrook-Jackson and P/2004 H2

periods of around 33 and 10 hours respectively, although in both cases these
are not unique solutions. 94P was observed to have a large range in magnitudes

SO(2N+2)/U(N+1) coset space. To our great surprise, the Killing potential is
equivalent with the generalized density matrix. Its diagonal-block matrix is
related to a reduced scalar potential with a Fayet-Ilipoulos term. The reduced
scalar potential is optimized in order to see the behaviour of the vacuum
expectation value of the sigma-model fields and a proper solution for one of
the SO(2N+1) group parameters is obtained. We give bosonization of the SO(2N+2)

also reduces the influence of systematic uncertainties, which can be important.

to an elementary model -- the classical infinite-server model $M/M/\infty$, but
models with finitely many servers and customer abandonment are also treated.
The Markovian stochastic process representing the number of customers in the
system is constructed in terms of rate-1 Poisson processes in two ways: (i)
through random time changes and (ii) through random thinnings. Associated
martingale representations are obtained for these constructions by applying,
respectively: (i) optional stopping theorems where the random time changes are
the stopping times and (ii) the integration theorem associated with random
thinning of a counting process. Convergence to the diffusion process limit for
the appropriate sequence of scaled queueing processes is obtained by applying
the continuous mapping theorem. A key FCLT and a key FWLLN in this framework
are established both with and without applying martingales.

in a wide range of disciplines, as chemical catalysis, biological evolution,
social and economic systems. The dynamics of those systems can be formulated
within the unifying framework of evolutionary game theory. However it is not a
priori clear which mathematical description is appropriate when populations are
not infinitely large. Whereas the replicator equation approach describes the
infinite population size limit by deterministic differential equations, in
finite populations the dynamics is inherently stochastic which can lead to new
effects. Recently, an explicit mean-field description in the form of a
Fokker-Planck equation was derived for frequency-dependent selection in finite
populations based on microscopic processes. In asymmetric conflicts between two
populations with a cyclic dominance, a finite-size dependent drift reversal was
demonstrated, depending on the underlying microscopic process of the
evolutionary update. Cyclic dynamics appears widely in biological coevolution,
be it within a homogeneous population, or be it between disjunct populations as
female and male. Here explicit analytic address is given and the average drift
is calculated for the frequency-dependent Moran process and for different
pairwise comparison processes. It is explicitely shown that the drift reversal
cannot occur if the process relies on payoff differences between pairs of
individuals. Further, also a linear comparison with the average payoff does not
lead to a drift towards the internal fixed point. Hence the nonlinear
comparison function of the frequency-dependent Moran process, together with its
usage of nonlocal information via the average payoff, is the essential part of
the mechanism.

age, intrinsic reddening, and mass via comparison of their colours with
STARBURST99 models. We have found two prominent epochs of cluster formation

and 6 Myr ago. The star clusters are characterised by an intrinsic reddening
E(B-V) < 0.4 mag and a mass lower than 2e+06 solar masses. Out of the 50 star
clusters, we have selected 31 located within the boundaries of the IUE large
slit that was employed to obtain the spectrum of NGC7673 between 1150 Ang. and
3350 Ang. For each cluster, we have built a synthetic spectrum corresponding to
the age, mass and intrinsic reddening derived from the cluster colours,
properly redshifted to NGC7673. The spectra have then been added together in a
final, clusters integrated spectrum. This and the IUE and FUSE spectra of
NGC7673 have allowed us to describe the star-formation history of the
unresolved stars in the field as either exponentially decaying or multi-burst.
In the first case, we have derived an e-folding time of 700 (900) Myr and an
initial star-formation rate of 16 (13) solar masses per year when the
Fitzpatrick's (Calzetti's) extinction law is used. In the case of a multi-burst

This solution is defined on a product manifold containing n Ricci-flat factor

positive definite we singled out a special solution governed by the function
cosh. It is shown that this special solution has Kasner-like asymptotics in the

transformation is a map of a ``shadow'' part of the Kasner sphere S^{N-2} (N =

Brassard in 1984, describes how two spatially separated parties can generate a
random bit string fully known only to them by transmission of single-qubit
quantum states. Any attempt to eavesdrop on the protocol introduces disturbance
which can be detected by the legitimate parties. In this Master's Thesis a
novel modification to the BB84 protocol is analyzed. Instead of sending single
particles one-by-one as in BB84, they are grouped and a non-local
transformation is applied to each group before transmission. Each particle is
sent to the intended receiver, always delaying the transmission until the
receiver has acknowledged the previous particle on an authenticated classical
channel, restricting eavesdropping to accessing the quantum transmission one
particle at a time. Hence, an eavesdropper cannot undo the non-local
transformation perfectly. Even if perfect cloning of quantum states was
possible the state of the group could not be cloned. We calculate the maximal
information on the established key provided by an intercept-resend attack and
the induced disturbance for different transformations. We observe that it is
possible to significantly reduce the eavesdropper's maximal information on the
key--to one eighth of that in BB84 for a fixed, reasonable amount of
disturbance. We also show that the individual access to the particles poses a
fundamental restriction to the eavesdropper, and discuss a novel attack type
against the proposed protocol.
