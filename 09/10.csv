130,000 groups and clusters of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
presented by Sheldon et al. 2007 (Paper I). We present non-parametric
inversions of the 2D shear profiles to the mean 3D cluster density and mass
profiles in bins of both optical richness and cluster i-band luminosity. We
correct the inferred 3D profiles for systematic effects, including non-linear
shear and the fact that cluster halos are not all precisely centered on their
brightest galaxies. We also model the measured cluster shear profile as a sum
of contributions from the brightest central galaxy, the cluster dark matter
halo, and neighboring halos. We infer the relations between mean cluster virial
mass and optical richness and luminosity over two orders of magnitude in
cluster mass; the virial mass at fixed richness or luminosity is determined
with a precision of 13% including both statistical and systematic errors. We
also constrain the halo concentration parameter and halo bias as a function of
cluster mass; both are in good agreement with predictions of LCDM models. The
methods employed here will be applicable to deeper, wide-area optical surveys
that aim to constrain the nature of the dark energy, such as the Dark Energy
Survey, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and space-based surveys.

The Moon, therefore, is not dragged down by its weight, because its natural
tendency is frustrated by its revolution. And, on the contrary, it would be
really amazing if it could remain at rest always at the same place, like the
Earth>>. While Posidonius (circa 135-51 BC) had written: <<Matter is endowed
with a cohesion that keeps it together and against which the surrounding vacuum
has no power. Indeed, the material world is supported by an immense force, and
alternately contracts and expands in the vacuum following its own physical
processes, now consumed by fire, now, instead, giving rise to a new creation of

to provide a powerful probe into high-energy emission mechanisms as well as the
distribution of magnetic fields, radiation fields and interstellar matter. At
present, only exploratory polarisation measurements have been carried out in
the soft gamma-ray band. Reduction of the large background produced by
cosmic-ray particles has been the biggest challenge. PoGOLite uses Compton
scattering and photo-absorption in an array of 217 well-type phoswich detector
cells made of plastic and BGO scintillators surrounded by a BGO anticoincidence
shield and a thick polyethylene neutron shield. The narrow FOV (1.25msr)
obtained with well-type phoswich detector technology and the use of thick
background shields enhance the detected S/N ratio. Event selections based on
recorded phototube waveforms and Compton kinematics reduce the background to
that expected for a 40-100mCrab source between 25 and 50keV. A 6 hour
observation on the Crab will differentiate between the Polar Cap/Slot Gap,
Outer Gap, and Caustic models with greater than 5 sigma; and also cleanly
identify the Compton reflection component in the Cygnus X-1 hard state. The
first flight is planned for 2010 and long-duration flights from Sweden to

dimensionality, $d$. The critical exponent $\nu$ controlling the divergence of
the localization length at the transition is found to be $\nu = {1 \over 2}+ {1
\over {d-2}}$. This result confirms that the upper critical dimension is
infinity. Level statistics are investigated in detail. We show that the two
level correlation function decays exponentially and the number variance is
linear with a slope which is an increasing function of the spatial
dimensionality.

a uniform prior in m_beta, we find that a null result yields an upper bound of
about 0.17 eV at 90% confidence in the Bayesian analysis, to be compared with
the frequentist KATRIN reference value of 0.20 eV. This is a significant
difference when judged relative to the systematic and statistical uncertainties
of the experiment. On the other hand, an input m_beta=0.35 eV, which is the
KATRIN 5sigma detection threshold, would be detected at virtually the same
level. Finally, we combine the simulated KATRIN results with cosmological data
in the form of present (post-WMAP) and future (simulated Planck) observations.
If an input of m_beta=0.2 eV is assumed in our simulations, KATRIN alone
excludes a zero neutrino mass at 2.2sigma. Adding Planck data increases the
probability of detection to a median 2.7sigma. The analysis highlights the
importance of combining cosmological and laboratory data on an equal footing.

nonequilibrium systems whose transients relax, producing a unique
nonequilibrium steady state. Although the necessary and sufficient conditions
for the production of a unique nonequilibrium steady state are unknown, if such
a steady state exists, the generation of the steady state fluctuation relation
from the transient relation is shown to be very general. It is essentially a
consequence of time reversibility and of a form of decay of correlations in the
dissipation, which is needed also for, e.g., the existence of transport
coefficients. Because of this generality the resulting steady state fluctuation
relation has the same degree of robustness as do equilibrium thermodynamic
equalities. The steady state fluctuation relation for the dissipation stands in
contrast with the one for the phase space compression factor, whose convergence
is problematic, for systems close to equilibrium. We examine some model

clusters is the so-called 'blue tilt': clusters of the blue sub-population
follow a trend of redder colour with increasing luminosity. In this paper we
evaluate to which extent field star capture over a Hubble time may explain the
'blue tilt'. We perform collisional N-body simulations to quantify the amount
of field star capture occuring over a Hubble time to star clusters with 10^3 to
10^6 stars. In the simulations we follow the orbits of field stars passing
through a star cluster and calculate the energy change that the field stars
experience due to gravitational interaction with cluster stars during one
passage through the cluster. The capture condition is that their total energy
after the passage is smaller than the gravitational potential at the cluster's
tidal radius. By folding this with the fly-by rates of field stars with an
assumed space density as in the solar neighbourhood and a range of velocity
dispersions, we derive estimates on the mass fraction of captured field stars
as a function of environment. We find that integrated over a Hubble time, the
ratio between captured field stars and total number of clusters stars is very
low (<~ 10^(-4)), even for the smallest considered field star velocity
dispersion sigma=15 km/s. This holds for star clusters in the mass range of
both open clusters and globular clusters. We furthermore show that tidal
friction has a negligible effect on the energy distribution of field stars
after interaction with the cluster. We conclude that field star capture is not
a probable mechanism for creating the colour-magnitude trend of metal-poor
globular clusters.

technique. We concentrate on the energy band around the iron K-line, where the
relativistic effects are most pronounced. Persistent flares lasting for a
significant fraction of the orbital time scale and short, transient flares are
considered. In our time-resolved analysis, the spectra recorded by a distant
observer depend on the position of the flare/spot with respect to the central
black hole. If the flare duration significantly exceeds the light travel time
across the spot, then the spot horizontal stratification is unimportant. On the
other hand, if the flare duration is comparable to the light travel time across
the spot radius, the lightcurves exhibit a typical asymmetry in their time
profiles. The sequence of dynamical spectra proceeds from more strongly to less
strongly ionized re-emission. At all locations within the spot the spectral
intensity increases towards edge-on emission angles, revealing the limb
brightening effect. Future X-ray observatories with significantly larger
effective collecting areas will enable to spectroscopically map out the
azimuthal irradiation structure of the accretion disk and to localize
persistent flares. If the hot spot is not located too close to the marginally
stable orbit of the black hole, it will be possible to probe the reflecting

flares will only be obtained from analyzing the observed lightcurves on the

the Li abundances in clusters of different age allows us to understand the

membership and Li abundance in a sample of candidate members of the open
cluster NGC 3960 (age ~1 Gyr), with the aim to fill the gap between 0.6 and 2
Gyr in the empirical description of the behavior of the average Li abundance as
a function of the stellar age. We use VLT/FLAMES Giraffe spectra to determine
the radial velocities and thus the membership of a sample of 113
photometrically selected candidate cluster members. From the analysis of the Li
line we derive Li abundances for both cluster members and non-members. 39 stars
have radial velocity consistent with membership, with an expected fraction of
contaminating field stars of about 20%. Li is detected in 29 of the RV members;
we consider these stars as cluster members, while we make the reasonable
assumption that the remaining 10 RV members without Li, are among the
contaminating stars. Li abundances of the stars hotter than about 6000 K are
similar to those of stars in the Hyades, while they are slightly smaller for
cooler stars. This confirms that NGC 3960 is older than the Hyades. The average
Li abundance of stars cooler than about 6000 K indicates that the Li Pop. I
plateau might start already at ~1 Gyr rather than 2 Gyr that is the upper limit
previously derived in the literature. We also find that the fraction of field
stars with high Li abundance (>1.5) is about one third of the whole sample,
which is in agreement with previous estimates. The fraction of contaminating
field stars is consistent with that previously derived by us from photometry.

2004), we consider the effect of type-I migration of protoplanetary embryos due
to their tidal interaction with their nascent disks. During the early embedded
phase of protostellar disks, although embryos rapidly emerge in regions
interior to the ice line, uninhibited type-I migration leads to their efficient
self-clearing. But, embryos continue to form from residual planetesimals at
increasingly large radii, repeatedly migrate inward, and provide a main channel
of heavy element accretion onto their host stars. During the advanced stages of
disk evolution (a few Myr), the gas surface density declines to values
comparable to or smaller than that of the minimum mass nebula model and type-I
migration is no longer an effective disruption mechanism for mars-mass embryos.
Over wide ranges of initial disk surface densities and type-I migration
efficiency, the surviving population of embryos interior to the ice line has a
total mass several times that of the Earth. With this reservoir, there is an
adequate inventory of residual embryos to subsequently assemble into rocky
planets similar to those around the Sun. But, the onset of efficient gas
accretion requires the emergence and retention of cores, more massive than a
few M_earth, prior to the severe depletion of the disk gas. The formation
probability of gas giant planets and hence the predicted mass and semimajor
axis distributions of extrasolar gas giants are sensitively determined by the
strength of type-I migration. We suggest that the observed fraction of
solar-type stars with gas giant planets can be reproduced only if the actual
type-I migration time scale is an order of magnitude longer than that deduced
from linear theories.

weak as 2x10^-6cm/s -- gyroscopically pumped by turbulent stresses in the
overlying convection zone and/or tachocline -- can hold the field in
advective-diffusive balance within a confinement layer of thickness scale ~
1.5Mm ~ 0.002 x (solar radius) while transmitting a retrograde torque to the
Ferraro-constrained interior. The confinement layer sits at the base of the
high-latitude tachocline, near the top of the radiative envelope and just above
the `tachopause' marking the top of the helium settling layer. A family of
exact, laminar, frictionless, axisymmetric confinement-layer solutions is
obtained for uniform downwelling in the limit of strong rotation and
stratification. A scale analysis shows that the flow is dynamically stable and
the assumption of laminar flow realistic. The solution remains valid for
downwelling values of the order of 10^-5cm/s but not much larger. This suggests
that the confinement layer may be unable to accept a much larger mass
throughput. Such a restriction would imply an upper limit on possible internal
field strengths, perhaps of the order of hundreds of gauss, and would have
implications also for ventilation and lithium burning.

observed in the Overhauser shift of the photoluminescence of the exciton and
exciton complexes from the same single quantum dot under an external magnetic
field of 5 T. However, the degree of circular polarization shows different
behaviors between a positively charged exciton and a neutral exciton or
biexciton; further, only positively charged exciton exhibits the precisely
synchronized change and hysteretic behavior. It is suggested that the electron
spin distribution is affected by the flip-flop of electron-nuclear spins.
Further, the hysteresis is observed as a function of the degree of circular
polarization of the excitation light and its dependence on the excitation power
is studied. The saturation of the Overhauser shift after the abrupt rise
indicates the almost complete cancellation of the external magnetic field by
the nuclear field created within the width that is decided by the correlation

the dynamical regime of the bath determines the efficiency of the decoherence
process. For perturbative regimes, the integrable limit provides stronger
decoherence, while in the strong coupling regime the chaotic limit becomes more
efficient. We also show that the decoherence time behaves in a similar way. On
the contrary, the rate of decay of magnitudes like linear entropy or fidelity
does not depend on the dynamical regime of the bath. We interpret the latter
results as due to a comparable complexity of the Hamiltonian for both the
integrable and the fully chaotic limits.

the result that torsional Alfv\'en waves are exact solutions of the non-linear

discuss the features of the generalized deSitter phase, predicted by the new

if the ratio between the vacuum-energy density and that associated with the
fundamental length of the theory acquires a tantalizing negative character.
This choice allows us to explain the present universe dark energy as a relic of
the vacuum-energy cancellation due to the cosmological constant intrinsically
contained in our scheme. The corresponding scalar-tensor description of the
model is addressed too, and the behavior of the scalar field is analyzed for
both negative and positive values of the cosmological term. In the first case,
the Friedmann equation is studied both in vacuum and in presence of external
matter, while, in the second case, the quantum regime is approached in the
framework of ''repulsive'' properties of the gravitational interaction, as
described in recent issues in Loop Quantum Cosmology. In particular, in the
vacuum case, we find a pure non-Einsteinian effect, according to which a
negative cosmological constant provides an accelerating deSitter dynamics, in
the region where the series expansion of the exponential term does not hold.

the $R_S$ so that the HBT time-related puzzle disappears throughout the

the Cherenkov light flashes are very short, a fast readout can minimize the
influence of the background from the light of the night sky. Also, the time

unwanted hadronic showers. An overview of the performance of the new system and
its impact on the sensitivity of the MAGIC instrument will be presented.

investigate this problem it is necessary to consider the finite open system
connected to heat baths. We describe two different procedures to couple the
system with the reservoirs: a model of stochastic heat baths and the quantum
trajectories solution of the quantum master equation. The stochastic heat bath
procedure operates on the pure wave function of the isolated system, so that it
is locally and periodically collapsed to a quantum state consistent with a
boundary nonequilibrium state. In contrast, the quantum trajectories procedure
evaluates ensemble averages in terms of the reduced density matrix operator of
the system. We apply these procedures to different models of quantum spin
chains and numerically show their applicability to study the heat flow.

  Oph","MNRAS, in press (18 pages, 17 figures)",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12194.x",,"astro-ph",,"  From observations collected with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter, we report
the discovery of magnetic fields at the surface of the mildly accreting
classical T Tauri star V2129 Oph. Zeeman signatures are detected, both in
photospheric lines and in the emission lines formed at the base of the
accretion funnels linking the disc to the protostar, and monitored over the
whole rotation cycle of V2129 Oph. We observe that rotational modulation
dominates the temporal variations of both unpolarized and circularly polarized
line profiles. We reconstruct the large-scale magnetic topology at the surface
of V2129 Oph from both sets of Zeeman signatures simultaneously. We find it to
be rather complex, with a dominant octupolar component and a weak dipole of
strengths 1.2 and 0.35 kG, respectively, both slightly tilted with respect to
the rotation axis. The large-scale field is anchored in a pair of 2-kG unipolar
radial field spots located at high latitudes and coinciding with cool dark
polar spots at photospheric level. This large-scale field geometry is unusually
complex compared to those of non-accreting cool active subgiants with moderate
rotation rates. As an illustration, we provide a first attempt at modelling the
magnetospheric topology and accretion funnels of V2129 Oph using field
extrapolation. We find that the magnetosphere of V2129 Oph must extend to about
7R* to ensure that the footpoints of accretion funnels coincide with the
high-latitude accretion spots on the stellar surface. It suggests that the
stellar magnetic field succeeds in coupling to the accretion disc as far out as
the corotation radius, and could possibly explain the slow rotation of V2129
Oph. The magnetospheric geometry we derive produces X-ray coronal fluxes
typical of those observed in cTTSs.

$\Delta$-chain with a ferromagnetic main chain is investigated. In addition to
the ferromagnetic phase, various nonmagnetic ground states are found. If the
ferromagnetic coupling between apical spins and the main chain is strong, this
model is approximated by a spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain and the spin
quadrupolar phase with spin-2 gapless excitation is realized in addition to the
Haldane and ferromagnetic phases. In the regime where the coupling between the
apical spins and the main chain is weak, the numerical results which suggest
the possibility of a series of phase transitions among different nonmagnetic
phases are obtained. Physical pictures of these phases are discussed based on
the numerical results.
