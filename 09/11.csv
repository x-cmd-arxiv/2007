  galaxies","14 pages, 12 figures, submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12742.x",,"astro-ph",,"  We use empirical techniques to interpret the near-infrared colours of a
sample of 5800 galaxies drawn from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main
spectroscopic sample with YJHK photometry from the UK Infrared Deep Sky Survey
(UKIDSS) data release one. We study correlations between near-IR colours
measured within SDSS fibre and physical parameters derived from the spectra.
These parameters include specific star formation rate, stellar age, metallicity
and dust attenuation. All correlations are analyzed for samples of galaxies
that are closely matched in redshift, in stellar mass and in concentration
index. Whereas more strongly star-forming galaxies have bluer optical colours,
the opposite is true at near-IR wavelengths -- galaxies with higher specific
star formation rate have redder near-IR colours. This result agrees
qualitatively with the predictions of models in which Thermally Pulsing
Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) stars dominate the H and K-band light of a
galaxy following a burst of star formation. We also find a surprisingly strong
correlation between the near-IR colours of star-forming galaxies and their dust
attenuation as measured from the Balmer decrement. Unlike optical colours,
however, near-IR colours exhibit very little dependence on galaxy inclination.
This suggests that the correlation of near-IR colours with dust attenuation
arises because TP-AGB stars are the main source of dust in the galaxy. Finally,
we compare the near-IR colours of the galaxies in our sample to the predictions
of three different stellar population models: the Bruzual & Charlot 2003 model,
a preliminary version of a new model under development by Charlot & Bruzual,
which includes a new prescription for AGB star evolution, and the Maraston 2005
model.

6950 A in the blue wing of the K doublet at 0.77 micron which resembles in
depth and shape the satellite absorption predicted by detailed collisional
broadening profiles. In our previous work, the predicted line satellite
position was however somewhat too blue compared to the observed feature. In
this paper we investigate whether new calculations of the energy surfaces of
the potentials in the K-H_2 system, including spin-orbit coupling, result in a
closer coincidence of the satellite with the observed position. We also
investigate the extent to which CaH absorption bands contribute to the feature.
We present model atmospheres and synthetic spectra, including gravitational
settling for an improved description of depth-dependent abundances of
refractory elements, and based on new K-H_2 line profiles using improved
interaction potentials. By comparison with a high signal-to-noise optical
spectrum of the T1 dwarf epsilon Indi Ba, we find that these new models do
reproduce the observed feature, while CaH does not contribute for the
atmospheric parameters considered. We also find that CaH is settled out so deep
into the atmosphere that even turbulent vertical mixing would appear
insufficient to bring significant amounts of CaH to the photosphere in dwarfs
later than ~L5. We conclude that previous identification of the feature at this
location in T and late L dwarf spectra with CaH was erroneous, as expected on
physical grounds: calcium condenses onto grains in early L dwarfs and thus
should have settled out of the photosphere in cooler brown dwarfs. This finding
revokes one observational verification for the cloud-clearing theory: a gradual
clearing of the cloud cover in early T dwarfs.

clusters in the Galaxy, but less than 2000 of them have been discovered,
measured, and cataloged. We plan to undertake data mining of multiwavelength

search automatically for star clusters in very large stellar catalogs, which is
based on convolution with density functions. We have applied this method to a
subset of the Two Micron All Sky Survey catalog toward the Galactic anticenter.
We also developed a method to verify whether detected stellar groups are real
star clusters, which tests whether the stars that form the spatial density peak
also fall onto a single isochrone in the color-magnitude diagram. By fitting an
isochrone to the data, we estimate at the same time the main physical
parameters of a cluster: age, distance, color excess. Results: For the present
paper, we carried out a detailed analysis of 88 overdensity peaks detected in a
field of $16\times16$ degrees near the Galactic anticenter. From this analysis,
15 overdensities were confirmed to be new open clusters and the physical and
structural parameters were determined for 12 of them; 10 of them were
previously suspected to be open clusters by Kronberger (2006) and Froebrich
(2007). The properties were also determined for 13 yet-unstudied known open
clusters, thus almost tripling the sample of open clusters with studied
parameters in the anticenter. The parameters determined with this method showed
a good agreement with published data for a set of well-known clusters.

current with a superluminally rotating distribution pattern and show that the
absolute value of this gradient increases as R^(7/2) with distance R within the
sharply focused subbeams constituting the overall radiation beam. This result
not only supports the earlier finding that the azimuthal and polar widths of
these subbeams narrow with distance (as R^(-3) and R^(-1), respectively), but
also implies that the boundary contribution to the solution of the wave
equation governing the radiation field does not always vanish in the limit
where the boundary tends to infinity. There is a fundamental difference between
the classical expressions for the retarded potential and field: while the
boundary contribution for the potential can always be made zero via a gauge
transformation preserving the Lorenz condition, that for the field may be
neglected only if it diminishes with distance faster than the contribution of
the source density in the far zone. In the case of a rotating superluminal
source, however, the boundary term in the retarded solution for the field is by
a factor of order R^(1/2) larger than the source term of this solution in the
limit, which explains why an argument based on the solution of the wave
equation governing the field that neglects the boundary term (such as that
presented by J. H. Hannay) misses the nonspherical decay of the field. Given
that the distribution of the radiation field of an accelerated superluminal
source in the far zone is not known a priori, the only way to calculate the
free-space radiation field of such sources is via the retarded solution for the
potential. Finally, we apply these findings to pulsar observational data: the
more distant a pulsar, the narrower and brighter its giant pulses should be.

quasi 1D systems, where the gap is originated by spontaneous lattice
distortions of the Incommensurate Charge Density Wave (ICDW) type. Results can
be adjusted also to quasi-1D superconductors. The instanton approach allows to
calculate the interchain tunneling current both in single electron (amplitude
solitons, i.e. spinons) and bi-electron (phase slips) channels. Transition
rates are governed by a dissipative dynamics originated by emission of gapless
phase excitations in the course of the instanton process. We find that the
single-electron tunneling is allowed below the nominal gap 2Delta_0 down to the
true pair-breaking threshold at 2W_as<2Delta, where W_as=2Delta/pi is the
amplitude soliton energy. Most importantly, the bi-electronic tunneling
stretches down to U=0 (in the 1D regime). In both cases, the threshold behavior
is given by power laws J (U-U_c)^beta, where the exponent beta v_F/u is large
as the ratio of the Fermi velocity v_F and the phase one u. In the 2D or 3D
ordered phases, at temperature T<T_c, the one-electron tunneling current does
not vanish at the threshold U_c anymore, but saturates above it at U-U_c

hadron-resonance gas model in the large volume limit. The role of quantum
statistics and resonance decay effects are discussed. The microscopic
correlator method is used to enforce conservation of three charges -- baryon
number, electric charge, and strangeness -- in the canonical ensemble. In
addition, in the micro-canonical ensemble energy conservation is included. An
analytical method is used to account for resonance decays. The multiplicity
distributions and the scaled variances for negatively and positively charged
hadrons are calculated for the sets of thermodynamical parameters along the
chemical freeze-out line of central Pb+Pb (Au+Au) collisions from SIS to LHC
energies. Predictions obtained within different statistical ensembles are
compared with the preliminary NA49 experimental results on central Pb+Pb
collisions in the SPS energy range. The measured fluctuations are significantly
narrower than the Poisson ones and clearly favor expectations for the
micro-canonical ensemble. Thus, this is a first observation of the recently
predicted suppression of the multiplicity fluctuations in relativistic gases in
the thermodynamical limit due to conservation laws.

to the vertex-minor relation. We discuss an extension of the notion of
rank-width to edge-colored graphs. A C-colored graph is a graph where the arcs
are colored with colors from the set C. There is not a natural notion of
rank-width for C-colored graphs. We define two notions of rank-width for them,
both based on a coding of C-colored graphs by edge-colored graphs where each
edge has exactly one color from a field F and named respectively F-rank-width
and F-bi-rank-width. The two notions are equivalent to clique-width. We then
present a notion of vertex-minor for F-colored graphs and prove that F-colored

graphs to exclude as vertex-minors. A cubic-time algorithm to decide whether a
F-colored graph has F-rank-width (resp. F-bi-rank-width) at most k, for fixed
k, is also given. Graph operations to check MSOL-definable properties on
F-colored graphs of bounded rank-width are presented. A specialisation of all

The mass functions in both galaxies agree with a simple, approximate model in
which the clusters form with a Schechter initial mass function and evolve
subsequently by stellar escape driven by internal two-body relaxation. These
findings therefore undermine recent claims that the present peak of the mass

(MIMO) radio channel measurement devices (sounders) is based on time-division
multiplexed switching (TDMS) of a single transmit/receive radio-frequency chain

cost-effective, such a solution can cause significant measurement errors due to
phase noise and frequency offset in the local oscillators. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the resulting errors and show that, in practice,
overestimation of channel capacity by several hundred percent can occur.
Overestimation is caused by phase noise (and to a lesser extent frequency
offset) leading to an increase of the MIMO channel rank. Our analysis
furthermore reveals that the impact of phase errors is, in general, most
pronounced if the physical channel has low rank (typical for line-of-sight or
poor scattering scenarios). The extreme case of a rank-1 physical channel is
analyzed in detail. Finally, we present measurement results obtained from a

In the context of the core instability model, we present calculations

differential equations of giant planet formation were numerically solved with
an adaptation of a Henyey-type code. The planetesimals accretion rate was
coupled in a self-consistent way to the envelope's evolution. Results. We
performed several simulations for the formation of a Jupiter-like object by
assuming various surface densities for the protoplanetary disc and two
different sizes for the accreted planetesimals. We find that the atmospheric
gas drag gives rise to a major enhancement on the effective capture radius of
the protoplanet, thus leading to an average timescale reduction of 30% -- 55%
and ultimately to an increase by a factor of 2 of the final mass of solids
accreted as compared to the situation in which drag effects are neglected. With
regard to the size of accreted planetesimals, we find that for a swarm of
planetesimals having a radius of 10 km, the formation time is a factor 2 to 3
shorter than that of planetesimals of 100 km, the factor depending on the
surface density of the nebula. Moreover, planetesimal size does not seem to
have a significant impact on the final mass of the core.

understanding the origin of QSO absorption-line systems. Our initial study
focuses specifically on MgII absorbers. We construct a model of the gaseous
content in which the absorption equivalent width W_r is determined by the the
amount of cold gas, in the form of discrete clouds, along a sightline through a
halo. The two quantities that we specify per halo in the model are (1) the mean
absorption strength per unit surface mass density A_W(M), and (2) the mean
covering factor kappa_g(M) of the gaseous clouds. These parameters determine
the conditional probability distribution of W_r as a function of halo mass,
P(W_r|M). Two empirical measurements are applied to constrain the model: (i)
the absorber frequency distribution function and (ii) the W_r-dependent
clustering amplitude. We find that the data demand a rapid transition in the
gas content of halos at ~10^11.5 Msol/h, below which halos contain
predominantly cold gas and beyond which gas becomes predominantly hot. In order
to reproduce the observed overall strong clustering of the absorbers and the
anti-correlation between W_r and halo mass M, roughly 5% of gas in halos up to
10^14 Msol/h is required to be cold. The gas covering factor is near unity over
a wide range of halo mass, supporting that Mg II systems probe an unbiased
sample of typical galaxies. We discuss the implications of our study in the
contexts of mass assembly of distant galaxies and the origin of QSO absorption
line systems.

contain stars falling back onto the Galaxy, contrary to the observations. The

longer-lived 3 Msun HVSs fill our survey volume; shorter-lived 4 Msun HVSs are
missing at faint magnitudes. We infer that there are 96 +- 10 HVSs of mass 3 -

vary down to the level of 18 mA (column density of 2 x 10^11 cm^-2). We limit
any circumstellar absorption lines to be weaker than ~10 mA (6 x 10^10 cm^-2).
For the case of material distributed in spherically symmetric shells of radius

function (IGIMF, the IMF for the whole galaxy) which is steeper in the high
mass regime than the constant canonical IMF, and is dependent on the SFR of the
galaxy. Consequently, the L_Halpha-SFR relation becomes non-linear and flattens
for low SFRs. Especially for dwarf galaxies the SFRs can be underestimated by
up to three orders of magnitude. We revise the existing linear L_Halpha-SFR
relations using our IGIMF notion. These are likely to lead to a revision of the
cosmological star formation histories. We also demonstrate that in the case of
the Sculptor dwarf irregular galaxies the IGIMF-formalism implies a linear
dependence of the total SFR on the total galaxy gas mass. A constant gas
depletion time scale of a few Gyrs results independently of the galaxy gas mass
with a reduced scatter compared to the conventional results. Our findings are
qualitatively independent of the explicit choice of the IGIMF details and
challenges current star formation theory in dwarf galaxies.

as in different parts of a single galaxy, scales nonlinearly with the surface
density of the total gas. This observationally established relation is known as
the Kennicutt-Schmidt star formation law. The slope of the star formation law
has been shown to change with the density of the gas against which the star
formation rate is plotted. This dependence implies a nonlinear scaling between
the dense gas and the total gas surface densities within galaxies. Here, we
explore a possible interpretation of this scaling as a property of the geometry
of the interstellar medium (ISM), and we find that it arises naturally if the
topology of the ISM is multifractal. Under the additional assumption that, at
very high densities, the star formation timescale is roughly constant, the star
formation law itself can also be recovered as a consequence of the multifractal
geometry of the ISM. The slope of the scaling depends on the width of the
global probability density function (PDF), and is between 1.5 and 1.6 for wide
PDFs relevant to high-mass systems, while it is higher for narrower PDFs
appropriate for lower-mass dwarf galaxies, in agreement with observations.

the mean ellipticity of distant galaxies. However, conversion between
ellipticity and shear assumes local linearity of the lensing potential (ie that
the spatial derivatives of the shear are small), and this condition is not
satisfied in some of the most interesting regions of the sky. We extend a
derivation of lensing equations to include higher order terms, and assess the
level of biases introduced by assuming that first-order weak lensing theory
holds in a relatively strong shear regime. We find that, even in a worst-case
scenario, a fully linear analysis is accurate to within 1% outside ~1.07 times
the Einstein radius of a lens, by deriving an analytic function that can be
used to estimate the applicability of any first-order analysis. The effect is
too small to explain the discrepancy between weak- and strong-lensing estimates
of the mass of the bullet cluster, and should not impact cluster surveys for
the forseeable future. In fact, it means that arclets can be used to measure
shears closer to a cluster core than has been generally appreciated. However,
at the level of accuracy demanded by future lensing surveys, this bias ought to
be considered in measurements of the inner slope of cluster mass distributions
and the small-scale end of the mass power spectrum. Both of these are central
in determining the relationship between baryonic and dark matter.

dimensions, we obtain explosions (although in one case weak) for two

explosion is initiated when the inner edge of the oxygen layer accretes through
the shock. Thus, the shock is not revived while in the iron core, as previously
discussed in the literature. The three-dimensional studies of the development
of the stationary accretion shock instability (SASI) demonstrate the

each of these stages, the observations show remarkably different polarization
properties as a function of wavelength. We show that the degree of interstellar
polarization is 0.17%. The low intrinsic polarization (~0.2%) at the first
epoch is consistent with an almost spherical (<10% deviation from spherical
symmetry) hydrogen dominated ejecta. Similar to SN 1987A and to Type IIP SNe, a
sharp increase in the degree of the polarization (~1%) is observed when the
outer hydrogen layer becomes optically thin by day 31; only at this epoch is
the polarization well described by a ``dominant axis.'' The polarization angle
of the data shows a rotation through ~40 degrees between the first and second
epochs, indicating that the asymmetries of the first epoch were not directly
coupled with those observed at the second epoch. For the most polarized lines,
we observe wavelength-dependent loop structures in addition to the dominant
axis on the Q-U plane. We show that the polarization properties of Type IIb SNe
are roughly similar to one another, but with significant differences arising
due to line blending effects especially with the high velocities observed for
SN 2001ig. This suggests that the geometry of SN 2001ig is related to SN 1993J

carried out between 2002 and 2004. De Marco et al. (2004) reported that 10 out
of 11 monitored stars exhibited strong RV variability, but periods were not
detected. Since other mechanisms, such as wind variability, can cause apparent
RV variations, we monitored 4 of the 10 RV-variable stars at echelle
resolutions to determine the origin of the variability. Although RV changes are
confirmed for all four stars, none of them can be ascribed to binarity at this
time. However, only for IC4593 is wind variability able to explain most (though
not all) spectral variability. For BD+332642, no wind and no pulsations appear
to be the origin of the RV changes. Finally, M1-77 and M2-54, both known to be
irregular photometric variables, exhibit dramatic RV and line shape variability
of the hydrogen and HeI absorption lines, as well as large RV variability of
weaker lines, which do not change in shape. There is no satisfactory
explanation of this variability, though a combination of wind variability and
pulsations is still the best guess at what makes these stars so variable. We
suggest that luminous central stars are ill suited to detect spectroscopic
binaries, because winds (and possibly pulsations) are pervasive and would mask
even strong periodicities. It it likely that a sample of intrinsically faint
central stars would more readily yield binary information.

effective mass of GSs is negative, the inter-species attraction may
\emph{split} the two-component soliton. Two critical values, $\kappa_{1} $ and
$\kappa_{2}$, of the OL strength ($\kappa $) are identified. Two-species GSs
with fully overlapping wave functions are stable in strong lattices ($\kappa
>\kappa_{1}$). In an intermediate region, $\kappa_{1}>\kappa >\kappa_{2}$, the
soliton splits into a double-humped state with separated components. Finally,
in weak lattices ($\kappa <\kappa_{2}$%), the splitting generates a pair of
freely moving single-species GSs. We present and explain the dependence of
$\kappa_{1}$ and $\kappa_{2}$ on thenumber of atoms (total norm), and on the
relative strength of the competing inter-species attraction and intra-species

to the energetics of inflation. However, numerous systematic effects arising

In particular, systematic effects due to the coupling of the underlying
temperature and polarization fields with elliptical or otherwise asymmetric
beams yield spurious systematic signals. This paper presents a non-perturbative
analytic calculation of some of these signals. We show that results previously
derived in real space can be generalized, formally, by including infinitely
many higher-order corrections to the leading order effects. These corrections
can be summed and represented as analytic functions when a fully Fourier-space
approach is adopted from the outset. The formalism and results presented in
this paper were created to determine the susceptibility of CMB polarization
probes of the primary gravitational wave signal but can be easily extended to
the analysis of gravitational lensing of the CMB.

are observed at optical/near-infrared wavelengths. There are three possible
origins of the color differences: intrinsic variabilities of quasars,
differential dust extinction, and quasar microlensing. We examine how these
three possible scenarios can reproduce the observed chromaticity. Methods:We
evaluate how much color difference between multiple images can be reproduced by
the above three possible scenarios with realistic models; (i) an empirical
relation for intrinsic variabilities of quasars, (ii) empirical relations for
dust extinction and theoretically predicted inhomogeneity in galaxies, or (iii)
a theoretical model for quasar accretion disks and magnification patterns in
the vicinity of caustics. Results:We find that intrinsic variabilities of
quasars cannot be a dominant source responsible for observed chromatic features
in multiple quasars. In contrast, either dust extinction or quasar microlensing
can nicely reproduce the observed color differences between multiple images in
most of the lensed quasars. Taking into account the time interval between
observations at different wavebands in our estimations, quasar microlensing is
a more realistic scenario to reproduce the observed color differences than dust
extinction. All the observed color differences presented in this paper can be
explained by a combination of these two effects, but monitoring observations at
multiple wavebands are necessary to disentangle these.

campaign included ground-based optical and radio data, and yielded a
quasi-simultaneous broad-band spectral energy distribution from 10^9 Hz to
10^{19} Hz. The Suzaku observation provided a high S/N X-ray spectrum, which is
well represented by an extremely hard power-law with photon index Gamma ~ 1.2,
augmented by a soft component apparent below 1 keV, which is well described by
a black-body model with temperature kT ~ 0.2 keV. Monitoring by Suzaku revealed
temporal variability which is different between the low and high energy bands,
again suggesting the presence of a second, variable component in addition to
the primary power-law emission.We model the broadband spectrum of PKS 1510-089
assuming that the high energy spectral component results from Comptonization of
infrared radiation produced by hot dust located in the surrounding molecular
torus. In the adopted internal shock scenario, the derived model parameters
imply that the power of the jet is dominated by protons but with a number of
electrons/positrons exceeding a number of protons by a factor ~10. We also find
that inhomogeneities responsible for the shock formation, prior to the
collision may produce bulk-Compton radiation which can explain the observed
soft X-ray excess and possible excess at ~18 keV. We note, however, that the
bulk-Compton interpretation is not unique, and the observed soft excess could
arise as well via some other processes discussed briefly in the text.

``branched'', ``disconnected'', ``bended'', ``curved'', ``heterogeneous'', or,
more general, ``complex''. In these cases, simple principal component analysis
(PCA) as a tool for dimension reduction can fail badly. Of the many alternative
approaches proposed so far, local approximations of PCA are among the most
promising. This paper will give a short review of localized versions of PCA,
focusing on local principal curves and local partitioning algorithms.
Furthermore we discuss projections other than the local principal components.
When performing local dimension reduction for regression or classification
problems it is important to focus not only on the manifold structure of the
covariates, but also on the response variable(s). Local principal components
only achieve the former, whereas localized regression approaches concentrate on
the latter. Local projection directions derived from the partial least squares
(PLS) algorithm offer an interesting trade-off between these two objectives. We
apply these methods to several real data sets. In particular, we consider
simulated astrophysical data from the future Galactic survey mission Gaia.

assumes an existing blind multi-coset sampling method. The sparse structure of
multi-band signals in the continuous frequency domain is used to replace the
continuous reconstruction with a single finite dimensional problem without the
need for discretization. The resulting problem can be formulated within the
framework of compressed sensing, and thus can be solved efficiently using known
tractable algorithms from this emerging area. We also develop a theoretical
lower bound on the average sampling rate required for blind signal
reconstruction, which is twice the minimal rate of known-spectrum recovery. Our
method ensures perfect reconstruction for a wide class of signals sampled at
the minimal rate. Numerical experiments are presented demonstrating blind
sampling and reconstruction with minimal sampling rate.

  Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20066707",,"astro-ph",,"  A substantial part of the dark matter of the Universe could be in the form of
compact objects (MACHOs), detectable through gravitational microlensing effects
as they pass through the line of sight to background light sources. So far,
most attempts to model the effects of high-redshift microlensing by a
cosmologically distributed population of MACHOs have assumed the compact
objects to be randomly and uniformly distributed along the line of sight. Here,
we present a more realistic model, in which the MACHOs are assumed to follow
the spatial clustering of cold dark matter. Because of sightline-to-sightline
variations in surface mass density, this scenario leads to substantial scatter
in MACHO optical depths, which we quantify as a function of source redshift. We
find that while optical depth estimates based on a uniform line-of-sight
distribution are reasonable for the highest-redshift light sources, such
estimates can be incorrect by a factor of ~2 for the nearby (z~0.25) Universe.
Hence, attempts to derive the cosmological density of MACHOs from microlensing
observations of only a few independent sightlines can be subject to substantial
uncertainties. We also apply this model to the prediction of
microlensing-induced variability in quasars not subject to macrolensing, and
demonstrate that relaxing the assumption of randomly and uniformly distributed
MACHOs only has a modest impact on the predicted light curve amplitudes. This
implies that the previously reported problems with microlensing as the dominant
mechanism for the observed long-term optical variability of quasars cannot be
solved by taking the large-scale clustering of dark matter into account.

that has defied explanation until now. At the same time, we try to reproduce
the colour distribution of M3 horizontal branch stars. We find that only a very
small dispersion in mass loss along the red giant branch reproduces with good
accuracy the observational data. The enhanced and variable helium content among
cluster stars is at the origin of the extension in colour of the horizontal
branch, while the sharply peaked mass loss is necessary to reproduce the
sharply peaked period distribution of RR Lyr variables. The dispersion in mass
loss has to be <~ 0.003 Msun, to be compared with the usually assumed values of
~0.02 Msun. This requirement represents a substantial change in the
interpretation of the physical mechanisms regulating the evolution of globular
cluster stars.

characterized by the values of the sound velocity at the local maximum (at T =

dependent sound velocity functions yield the entropy density, which is
consistent with the lattice QCD simulations at high temperature. Our

grown crop on augmentative biological control are analyzed. Partial harvesting
can remove a proportion of both pests and biological control agents, so its
influence on the control efficiency cannot be a priori neglected. An impulsive
model consisting of a general predator-prey model in ODE, augmented by a
discrete component to depict releases of biological control agents and the
periodic partial harvesting is used. The periods are taken as integer multiples
of each other. A stability condition for pest eradication is expressed as the
minimal value of the budget per unit time to spend on predators. We consider
the partial harvesting period to be fixed by both the plant's physiology and
market forces so that the only manipulated variable is the release period. It
is shown that varying the release period with respect to the harvest period
influences the minimal budget value when the former is carried out more often
than the latter and has no effect when releases take place as often as or less
frequently than the partial harvests.

the Evershed flow in sunspot penumbrae. Aims: We determine the physical
properties of ECs from high spatial and temporal resolution spectropolarimetric
measurements. Methods: The Stokes profiles of four visible and three infrared
spectral lines are subject to inversions based on simple one-component models
as well as more sophisticated realizations of penumbral flux tubes embedded in
a static ambient field (uncombed models). Results: According to the
one-component inversions, the EC phenomenon can be understood as a perturbation
of the magnetic and dynamic configuration of the penumbral filaments along
which these structures move. The uncombed inversions, on the other hand,
suggest that ECs are the result of enhancements in the visibility of penumbral
flux tubes. We conjecture that the enhancements are caused by a perturbation of
the thermodynamic properties of the tubes, rather than by changes in the vector
magnetic field. The feasibility of this mechanism is investigated performing
numerical experiments of thick penumbral tubes in mechanical equilibrium with a
background field. Conclusions: While the one-component inversions confirm many
of the properties indicated by a simple line parameter analysis (Paper I of
this series), we tend to give more credit to the results of the uncombed
inversions because they take into account, at least in an approximate manner,
the fine structure of the penumbra.

points, and a flow with surgery has to be considered. The authors attempt to
show that, comparing to Ricci flow, the hyperbolic geometric flow has the
following advantage: the surgery technique may be replaced by choosing suitable

higher order curvature terms. We show that when the strong coupling scale of
the theory is on the 10^{-3}-10^{-1}eV range, the model passes all experimental
bounds on the existence of fifth forces even if the field has a mass of the
order of the Hubble scale in vacuum and non-suppressed couplings to SM fields.
The reason is that the coupling to certain curvature invariant acts as an
effective mass that grows in regions of large curvature. This prevents the
field from rolling down its potential near sources and makes its effects on
fifth-force search experiments performed in the laboratory to be observable
only at the sub-mm scale. We obtain the static spherically symmetric solutions
of the theory and show that a long-range force appears but it is turned on only
below a fixed Newtonian acceleration scale of the order of the Hubble constant.
We comment on the possibility of using this feature of the model to alleviate
the CDM small scale crisis and on its possible relation to MOND.

The corresponding set of kinetic equations is derived and solved in linear
approximation on the defect concentration. Three types of strongly correlated
complex jumps are considered and their contribution to fluctuations is
analysed. These are jumps of excess particles, vacancies and flip-flop jumps.
The kinetic approach is more general than the one based on diffusion-like
equations used in our previous papers. Thus, it becomes possible to adequately
describe correlations of fluctuations at small times, where our previous theory
fails to give correct results. Our new analytical results for fluctuations of

fundamental form of a hypersurface in a Euclidean space involves the so-called
""mean curvature of the second fundamental form"". Several new characteristic
properties of (hyper)spheres, in which the mean curvature of the second
fundamental form occurs, are given. In particular, it is shown that the spheres
are the only ovaloids which are a critical point of the area functional of the
second fundamental form under various constraints.

from extended thermal MD simulation, we illustrate various mechanisms of H

point out that the squared electron-lattice coupling (and the thermally-induced
mean square variation in electron energy eigenvalues) is robustly proportional
to the localization of the conjugate state, if localization is measured with
inverse participation ratio. Finally we discuss the Staebler-Wronski effect
using these methods, and argue that a sophisticated local heating picture

ionization and heating pattern around the first miniquasars and Population III
stars. The code follows the evolution of the ionization of the species of
hydrogen and helium and the intergalactic medium temperature profiles as a
function of redshift. The radiative transfer calculations show that the
ionization signature of the first miniquasars and stars is very similar yet the
heating pattern around the two is very different. Furthermore, the first
massive miniquasars (~>10^5 M_{sun}) do produce large ionized bubbles around
them, which can potentially be imaged directly using future radio telescopes.
It is also shown that the ionized bubbles not only stay ionized for
considerable time after the switching off of the source, but continue to expand
for a short while due to secondary collisions prompted by the X-ray part of
their spectra. Varying spectral shapes also produced sizable variations in
ionized fraction and temperature profile. We also compare the radiative
transfer results with the analytical approximation usually adopted for heating
by miniquasars and find that, because of the inadequate treatment of the He
species, the analytical approach leads to an underestimation of the temperature
in the outer radii by a factor ~5. Population III stars - with masses in the
range of 10 - 1000 M_{sun} and modelled as blackbodies at a temperature of
50000 K - are found to be efficient in ionizing their surroundings.

a random copolymer in a random emulsion. The copolymer is a random
concatenation of monomers of two types, $A$ and $B$, each occurring with
density 1/2. The emulsion is a random mixture of liquids of two types, $A$ and
$B$, organised in large square blocks occurring with density $p$ and $1-p$,
respectively, where $p \in (0,1)$. The copolymer in the emulsion has an energy
that is minus $\alpha$ times the number of $AA$-matches minus $\beta$ times the
number of $BB$-matches, where without loss of generality the interaction
parameters can be taken from the cone $\{(\alpha,\beta)\in\R^2\colon \alpha\geq
|\beta|\}$. To make the model mathematically tractable, we assume that the
copolymer is directed and can only enter and exit a pair of neighbouring blocks
at diagonally opposite corners.
  In \cite{dHW06}, it was found that in the supercritical percolation regime $p
\geq p_c$, with $p_c$ the critical probability for directed bond percolation on
the square lattice, the free energy has a phase transition along a curve in the
cone that is independent of $p$. At this critical curve, there is a transition
from a phase where the copolymer is fully delocalized into the $A$-blocks to a
phase where it is partially localized near the $AB$-interface. In the present
paper we prove three theorems that complete the analysis of the phase diagram :
(1) the critical curve is strictly increasing; (2) the phase transition is
second order; (3) the free energy is infinitely differentiable throughout the
partially localized phase.

studies in very high energy collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
In particular, we focus on the possibility to measure in $pp$ collisions the
average charged multiplicity as a function of the effective energy with the
ALICE experiment, using its capability to measure the energy of the leading
baryons with the Zero Degree Calorimeters. Analyses of this kind have been done
at lower centre--of--mass energies and have shown that, once the appropriate
kinematic variables are chosen, particle production is characterized by
universal properties: no matter the nature of the interacting particles, the
final states have identical features. Assuming that this universality picture
can be extended to {\it ion--ion} collisions, as suggested by recent results
from RHIC experiments, a novel approach based on the scaling hypothesis for
limiting fragmentation has been used to derive the expected charged event
multiplicity in $AA$ interactions at LHC. This leads to scenarios where the
multiplicity is significantly lower compared to most of the predictions from
the models currently used to describe high energy $AA$ collisions. A mean
charged multiplicity of about 1000-2000 per rapidity unit (at $\eta \sim 0$) is
expected for the most central $Pb-Pb$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.5 TeV$.

"0709.1728","J. Harnad","J. Harnad","Trouble with Physics?","5 pages, book review","Mathematical Intelligencer 30 no. 3 (2008) 66-69",,,"physics.hist-ph hep-th physics.gen-ph physics.pop-ph",,"  This is a review of Lee Smolin's ""The Trouble with Physics"". The main gist of
the review is that the physics of the past three decades has been rich with new
discoveries in a large number of domains. The Standard Model, while providing a
successful framework for the electroweak and strong interactions still needs to
be developed further to fully account fot the mass of strong interaction data
collected over the decades. A multitude of new phenomena have been discovered
however, or predicted theoretically, in the physics of very low temperatures
(e.g. fractional Hall effect, Bose-Einstein condensation) and quantum
macroscopic effects (liquid crystals, high temperature superconductivity), some
of which remain to be fully explained. Therefore if there is any ""Trouble with
Physics"", as implied by the author of this book, it mainly concerns speculative
work on Superstring theory, which may or may not turn out to agree with the
results of observation. The subject as a whole does not appear to be in
trouble.
