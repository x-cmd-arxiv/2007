theory describing the fluctuations around a quasi de Sitter background, in the

going to unitary gauge. In this gauge, the most general theory is built with
the lowest dimension operators invariant under spatial diffeomorphisms, like
g^{00} and K_{mu nu}, the extrinsic curvature of constant time surfaces. This
approach allows us to characterize all the possible high energy corrections to
simple slow-roll inflation, whose sizes are constrained by experiments. Also,
it describes in a common language all single field models, including those with
a small speed of sound and Ghost Inflation, and it makes explicit the
implications of having a quasi de Sitter background. The non-linear realization
of time diffeomorphisms forces correlation among different observables, like a
reduced speed of sound and an enhanced level of non-Gaussianity.

a classical electrodynamics-like setting. A Rutherfordian atomic model is used
assuming a circular electron orbit, without the quantum principle as imposed
arbitrarily in the Bohr model, but with an ad hoc incorporation in the electron
of intrinsic spin and associated magnetic dipole moment. Analyzing the motions
of the electron spin and orbital angular momenta, it is found that in the
presence of Thomas precession, the total angular momentum averaged over the
orbit is not generally a constant of the motion. It is noted this differs from
the finding of Thomas in a similar assessment of 1927, and the reason for this
difference is provided. It is found that although the total orbit-averaged
angular momentum is not a constant of the motion, it precesses around a fixed
axis similarly to the precession of the total angular momentum vector seen in
spin-orbit coupling in quantum theory. The magnitude of the angular velocity of
the total orbit-averaged angular momentum is seen to vanish only when the spin
and orbital angular momenta are antiparallel and their mutual precession
frequencies equate. It is then found, there is a unique radius where the mutual
precession frequencies equate. Assuming the electron magnetic moment is the
Bohr magneton, and an electron g-factor of two, this radius corresponds to
where the orbital angular momentum is the reduced Planck's constant. The orbit
radius for stationary total angular momentum for the circular orbit model with
nonzero orbital angular momentum is thus the ground-state radius of the Bohr
model.

  1 point sources and near-IR reverberation","accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20077911",,"astro-ph",,"  Spatially resolving the innermost torus in AGN is one of the main goals of
its high-spatial-resolution studies. This could be done in the near-IR
observations of Type 1 AGNs where we see directly the hottest dust grains in
the torus. We discuss two critical issues in such studies. Firstly, we examine
the nuclear point sources in the HST/NICMOS images of nearby Type 1 AGNs, to
evaluate the possible contribution from the central putative accretion disk.
After a careful subtraction of host bulge flux, we show that near-IR colors of
the point sources appear quite interpretable simply as a composite of a
black-body-like spectrum and a relatively blue distinct component as expected
for a torus and an accretion disk, respectively. Our radiative transfer models
for clumpy tori also support this simple two-component interpretation. The
observed near-IR colors suggest a fractional accretion disk contribution of
~25% or less at 2.2 micron. Secondly, we show that the innermost torus radii as
indicated by the recent near-IR reverberation measurements are systematically
smaller by a factor of ~3 than the predicted dust sublimation radius with a
reasonable assumption for graphite grains of sublimation temperature 1500 K and
size 0.05 micron in radius. The discrepancy might indicate a much higher
sublimation temperature or a typical grain size being much larger in the
innermost tori, though the former case appears to be disfavored by the observed
colors of the HST point sources studied above. The near-IR interferometry with
a baseline of ~100 m should be able to provide the important, independent size
measurements, based on the low accretion disk contribution obtained above.

Recently, Mohanty et al. (2007) found that effective temperature estimates for
2M1207B (1600 +- 100 K) are grossly inconsistent with its lying on the same
isochrone as the primary, being a factor of ~10 underluminous at all bands
between I (0.8 um) and L' (3.6 um). Mohanty et al. explain this discrepency by
suggesting that 2M1207B is an 8 M_Jup object surrounded by an edge-on disk
comprised of large dust grains producing 2.5^m of achromatic extinction. We
offer an alternative explanation: the apparent flux reflects the actual source
luminosity. Given the temperature, we infer a small radius (~49,000 km), and
for a range of plausible densities, we estimate a mass < M_Jup. We suggest that
2M1207B is a hot protoplanet collision afterglow and show that the radiative
timescale for such an object is >~1% the age of the system. If our hypothesis
is correct, the surface gravity of 2M1207B should be an order of magnitude

medium-resolution spectroscopy and broad-band photometry of seven cataclysmic

accurate orbital periods, all which are measured for the first time. For SDSS
J013132.39+090122.2, which contains a non-radially pulsating white dwarf, we
find an orbital period of 81.54 +/- 0.13 min and a low radial velocity
variation amplitude indicative of an extreme mass ratio. For SDSS
J205914.87+061220.4, we find a period of 107.52 +/- 0.14 min. This object is a
dwarf nova and was fading from its first recorded outburst throughout our
observations. INT photometry of SDSS J155531.99-001055.0 shows that this system
undergoes total eclipses which are 1.5 mag deep and occur on a period of 113.54
+/- 0.03 min. A NOT light curve of SDSS J075443.01+500729.2 shows that this
system is also eclipsing, on a period of 205.965 +/- 0.014 min, but here the
eclipses are V-shaped and only 0.5 mag deep. Its low emission-line strengths,
orbital period and V-shaped eclipse unambiguously mark it as a novalike object.
WHT photometry of SDSS J005050.88+000912.6 and SDSS J210449.94+010545.8 yields
periods of 80.3 +/- 2.2 and 103.62 +/- 0.12 min, respectively. Photometry of
the seventh and final system, SDSS J165658.12+212139.3, shows only flickering.
Our results strengthen the conclusion that the faint magnitude limit of the
SDSS spectroscopic database implies that the sample of CVs contained in it has
quite different characteristics to previously studied samples of these objects.
Five of the six orbital periods measured here are shorter than the observed 2-3
hr CV period gap. Two systems have periods very close to the minimum orbital
period for hydrogen-rich CVs.

black hole of mass $M=10^{3}-10^{4}M_{\odot}$ and a white dwarf can be formed
in a globular cluster. We point out that a major fraction of white dwarfs
tidally captured by the black hole may be destroyed by tidal inflation during
ongoing circularisation, and the formation of tight binaries is inhibited.
However, some stars may survive being spun up to high rotation rates. Then the
energy loss through gravitational wave emission induced by tidally excited
pulsation modes and dissipation through non linear effects may compete with the
increase of pulsation energy due to dynamic tides. The semi-major axes of these
stars can be decreased below a 'critical' value where dynamic tides are not
effective because pulsation modes retain phase coherence between successive
pericentre passages. The rate of formation of such circularising stars is
estimated assuming that they can be modelled as $n=1.5$ polytropes and that
results of the tidal theory for slow rotators can be extrapolated to fast
rotators. We estimate the total capture rate as $\sim \dot N\sim 2.5\cdot
10^{-8}M_{4}^{1.3}r_{0.1}^{-2.1}yr^{-1}$, where $M_{4}=M/10^4M_{\odot}$ and
$r_{0.1}$ is the radius of influence of the black hole in units $0.1pc$. We
find that the formation rate of tight pairs is approximately 10 times smaller
than the total capture rate. It is used to estimate the probability of
detection of gravitational waves coming from such tight binaries by LISA. We
conclude that LISA may detect such binaries provided that the fraction of
globular clusters with black holes in the mass range of interest is substantial
and that the dispersion velocity of the cluster stars near the radius of
influence of the black hole exceeds $\sim 20km/s$.

theory of gravity and a resolution to the cosmological constant problem. It is
believed that a true quantum theory of gravity will lead to a solution to the
this problem. Finding a quantum theory of gravity has been a difficult issue
mainly because of the high energy scale required for testing quantum gravity
which is far the reach of current accelerators. Also general relativity does
not possess a natural time variable thus the nature of time is not clear in
quantum gravity, a problem called the time paradox. The two main approaches are
string theory and loop quantum gravity. String theory unifies all interaction
but provides a perturbative background dependent formulation which violates
general covariance. Loop quantum gravity provides a non-perturbative approach
but does not provide a unified theory of interactions, which most physicist
believe should be the case at Planck scale energies. It doesn't also seem to
connect with low energy phenomena.

a quantum gravity theory by merging inputs from the perturbative and the

computation. At the same time control of a system's quantum state during time
evolution is one of the actual problems. It is usually considered that to hold
well-known resonance condition in magnetic resonance is sufficient to control
spin system. But because of nonlinearity of the system, obstructions of control
of system's quantum state may emerge.
  In particular quantum dynamics of two 1/2 spin-qubit system in the optical
cavity is studied in this work. The problem under study is a generalization of
paradigmatic model for Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics of James-Cummings model
in case of interacting spins. In this work it is shown that dynamics is chaotic
when taking into account center-of-mass motion of the qubit and recoil effect.
And besides even in case of zero detuning chaotic dynamics emerges in the
system. It is also shown in this work that because of the chaotic dynamics the
system execute irreversible transition from pure quantum-mechanical state to
mixed one. Irreversibility in its turn is an obstacle for controlling state of
quantum-mechanical system.

$B\to\pi\pi$ at NLO i.e. at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$. This special part of the
amplitude, whose LO starts at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$, is defined in the
framework of QCD factorization. QCD factorization allows to separate the short-
and the long-distance physics in leading power in an expansion in $\lqcd/m_b$,
where the short-distance physics can be calculated in a perturbative expansion
in $\alpha_s$. Compared to other parts of the amplitude hard spectator
interactions are formally enhanced by the hard collinear scale $\sqrt{\lqcd
m_b}$, which occurs next to the $m_b$-scale and leads to an enhancement of
$\alpha_s$.
  From a technical point of view the main challenges of this calculation are
due to the fact that we have to deal with Feynman integrals that come with up
to five external legs and with three independent ratios of scales. These
Feynman integrals have to be expanded in powers of $\lqcd/m_b$. I will discuss
integration by parts identities to reduce the number of master integrals and
differential equations techniques to get their power expansions. A concrete
implementation of integration by parts identities in a computer algebra system
is given in the appendix.
  Finally I discuss numerical issues like scale dependence of the amplitudes
and branching ratios. It will turn out that the NLO contributions of the hard
spectator interactions are important but small enough for perturbation theory
to be valid

these gamma rays expected from a supernova with an 11 M_sun progenitor. The
flux from neutron capture on protons exponentially decays on a timescale of 564
s, which is determined by neutron decay and capture on protons and 3He nuclei.
The peak flux is 2.38x10^{-7}/cm^2/s for a supernova at a distance of 1 kpc. In
contrast, the gamma-ray flux from positron annihilation follows the time
evolution of the anti-nu_e luminosity and lasts for ~10 s. The peak flux in
this case is 6.8x10^{-5}/cm^2/s for a supernova at a distance of 1 kpc.
Detection of the above gamma-ray fluxes is beyond the capability of current
instruments, and perhaps even those planned for the near future. However, if
such fluxes can be detected, they not only constitute a new kind of signals

games. Each wireless device selects a power profile over the entire available
bandwidth to maximize its data rate. Such competitive models represent
situations in which several wireless devices share spectrum without any central
authority or coordinated protocol.
  In contrast to games where devices have complete information about their
opponents, we consider scenarios where the devices are unaware of the
interference they cause to other devices. Such games, which are modeled as
Bayesian games, can exhibit significantly different equilibria. We first
consider a simple scenario of simultaneous move games, where we show that the
unique Bayes-Nash equilibrium is where both devices spread their power equally
across the entire bandwidth. We then extend this model to a two-tiered spectrum
sharing case where users act sequentially. Here one of the devices, called the
primary user, is the owner of the spectrum and it selects its power profile
first. The second device (called the secondary user) then responds by choosing
a power profile to maximize its Shannon capacity. In such sequential move
games, we show that there exist equilibria in which the primary user obtains a
higher data rate by using only a part of the bandwidth.
  In a repeated Bayesian interference game, we show the existence of reputation
effects: an informed primary user can bluff to prevent spectrum usage by a
secondary user who suffers from lack of information about the channel gains.
The resulting equilibrium can be highly inefficient, suggesting that
competitive spectrum sharing is highly suboptimal.

QCD approach as advocated by Kopeliovich, Nemchik and Schmidt. In the second

significantly from the local universe to redshift z~6. We arrive at this

at z~5-6, doubling the redshift range for such observations. These galaxies are
spectroscopically confirmed in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) through the
GRism ACS program for Extragalactic Science (GRAPES) project. The starburst
intensity limit for galaxies at z~5-6 agree with those at z~3-4 and z~0 to
within a factor of a few, after correcting for cosmological surface brightness
dimming and for dust. The most natural interpretation of this constancy over
cosmic time is that the same physical mechanisms limit starburst intensity at
all redshifts up to z~6 (be they galactic winds, gravitational instability, or
something else). We do see two trends with redshift: First, the UV spectral
slope of galaxies at z~5-6 is bluer than that of z~3 galaxies, suggesting an
increase in dust content over time. Second, the galaxy sizes from z~3 to z~6
scale approximately as the Hubble parameter 1/H(z). Thus, galaxies at z~6 are
high redshift starbursts, much like their local analogs except for slightly
bluer colors, smaller physical sizes, and correspondingly lower overall
luminosities. If we now assume a constant maximum star formation intensity, the
differences in observed surface brightness between z~0 and z~6 are consistent
with standard expanding cosmology and strongly inconsistent with tired light

building reconfigurable spin-based logic circuits compatible with conventional
electron-based devices. A distinctive feature of the proposed NanoFabric is
that a bit of information is encoded into the phase of the spin wave signal. It
makes possible to transmit information without the use of electric current and
utilize wave interference for useful logic functionality. The basic elements
include voltage-to-spin wave and wave-to-voltage converters, spin waveguides, a
modulator, and a magnetoelectric cell. As an example of a magnetoelectric cell,
we consider a two-phase piezoelectric-piezomagnetic system, where the spin wave
signal modulation is due to the stress-induced anisotropy caused by the applied
electric field. The performance of the basic elements is illustrated by
experimental data and results of numerical modeling. The combination of the
basic elements let us construct magnetic circuits for NOT and Majority logic
gates. Logic gates AND, OR, NAND and NOR are shown to be constructed as the
combination of NOT and a reconfigurable Majority gates. The examples of
computational architectures such as Cellular Automata, Cellular Nonlinear
Network and Field Programmable Gate Array are described. The main advantage of
the proposed NanoFabric is in the ability to realize logic gates with less
number of devices than it required for CMOS-based circuits. Potentially, the
area of the elementary reconfigurable Majority gate can be scaled down to
0.1um2. The disadvantages and limitations of the proposed NanoFabric are
discussed.

existing upper limits on the abundance of PBHs with masses >0.1 Msun by several
orders of magnitude. Fitting WMAP3 data with cosmological models that do not
allow for non-standard recombination histories, as produced by PBHs or other
early energy sources, may lead to an underestimate of the best-fit values of
the amplitude of linear density fluctuations (sigma_8) and the scalar spectral
index (n_s). Cosmological parameter estimates are affected because models with
PBHs allow for larger values of the Thomson scattering optical depth, whose
correlation with other parameters may not be correctly taken into account when
PBHs are ignored. Values of tau_e=0.2, n_s=1 and sigma_8=0.9 are allowed at 95%
CF. This result that may relieve recent tension between WMAP3 data and clusters
data on the value of sigma_8. PBHs may increase the primordial molecular
hydrogen abundance by up to two orders of magnitude, this promoting cooling and
star formation. The suppression of galaxy formation due to X-ray heating is
negligible for models consistent with the CMB data. Thus, the formation rate of

times and their observational signatures. The massive black hole seeds studied
here form at extremely high redshifts from the direct collapse of pre-galactic
gas discs. Populating dark matter halos with seeds formed in this way, we
follow the mass assembly of these black holes to the present time using a
Monte-Carlo merger tree. Using this machinery we predict the black hole mass
function at high redshifts and at the present time; the integrated mass density
of black holes and the luminosity function of accreting black holes as a
function of redshift. These predictions are made for a set of three seed models
with varying black hole formation efficiency. Given the accuracy of current
observational constraints, all 3 models can be adequately fit. Discrimination
between the models appears predominantly at the low mass end of the present day
black hole mass function which is not observationally well constrained.
However, all our models predict that low surface brightness, bulgeless galaxies
with large discs are least likely to be sites for the formation of massive seed
black holes at high redshifts. The efficiency of seed formation at high
redshifts has a direct influence on the black hole occupation fraction in
galaxies at z=0. This effect is more pronounced for low mass galaxies. This is
the key discriminant between the models studied here and the Population III
remnant seed model. We find that there exists a population of low mass galaxies
that do not host nuclear black holes. Our prediction of the shape of the black
hole mass - velocity dispersion relation at the low mass end is in agreement
with the recent observational determination from the census of low mass

packing is equivalent to constructing a matrix that has certain structural and

the spectral condition, it is often possible to reach a matrix that satisfies
both. One may then extract a packing from this matrix.
  This approach is both powerful and versatile. In cases where experiments have
been performed, the alternating projection method yields packings that compete
with the best packings recorded. It also extends to problems that have not been
studied numerically. For example, it can be used to produce packings of

much shorter than inferred light-crossing times at the black hole horizon,
suggesting that the variability involves enhanced emission in a small region
within an outflowing jet. The enhancement could be triggered by dissipation in
part of the black hole's magnetosphere at the base of the outflow, or else by
instabilities in the jet itself. By considering the energetics of the observed

pairs, we deduce that the bulk Lorentz factors in the jets must be >50. The

Here, X-ray monitoring observations by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)/

Counter Array (PCA) over the past decade are analyzed. We analyze both the flux
and column density dependence on orbital phase. The wind and stream dynamics
are calculated for various system inclinations, companion rotation rates and
wind velocities, as well as parametrized by the stream width and density. These
calculations are used as inputs to determine both the expected accretion
luminosity and the column density along the line-of-sight to the neutron star.
The model luminosity and column density are compared to observed flux and
column density vs. orbital phase, to constrain the properties of the stellar
wind and the gas stream. We find that the change between bright and medium
intensity levels is primarily due to decreased mass loss in the stellar wind,
but the change between medium and dim intensity levels is primarily due to
decreased stream density. The mass-loss rate in the stream exceeds that in the
stellar wind by a factor of 2.5. The quality of the model fits is significantly
better for lower inclinations, favoring a mass for WRAY 977 of 53 to 62 Msun.

surfaces. Here a simple model for the contact of \emph{viscoelastic} rough
surfaces with significant levels of adhesion is presented. This approach is
derived from our previous model [E. Barthel and G. Haiat {\em Langmuir}, 18
9362 2002] for the adhesive contact of viscoelastic spheres. For simplicity a
simple loading/unloading history (infinitely fast loading and constant pull-out
velocity) is assumed. The model provides approximate analytical expressions for
the asperity response and exhibits the full viscoelastic adhesive contact
phenomenology such as stress relaxation inside the contact zone and creep at
the contact edges. Combining this model with a Greenwood-Williamson statistical
modeling of rough surfaces, we propose a quantitative assessment of the
adhesion to rough viscoelastic surfaces. We show that moderate viscoelasticity
efficiently restores adhesion on rough surfaces over a wide dynamic range.

to an orbital distribution that is tangentially biased. The best-fit orbital

source while it is less conspicuous at shorter wavelengths such as J and
optical. P.A. and size of this red color nebulosity in our H-K color image
agree with those of the previously detected polarization disk. These data
agreement indicate that this bright circumstellar nebulosity region which
follows the reddening law might be attributed to a disk-like structure. At J

more extended (2.""3 long) to the southwest. We interpret these structures as

spectro-polarimetric observations. The majority of these inversion codes are
based on the optimization of a complicated non-linear merit function. However,
no reliable and statistically well-defined confidence intervals can be obtained
for the parameters inferred from the inversions. A correct estimation of the
confidence intervals for all the parameters that describe the model is
mandatory. Additionally, it is fundamental to apply efficient techniques to
assess the ability of models to reproduce the observations and to what extent
the models have to be refined or can be simplified. Bayesian techniques are
applied to analyze the performance of the model to fit a given observed Stokes
vector. The posterior distribution, is efficiently sampled using a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo method. For simplicity, we focus on the Milne-Eddington approximate
solution of the radiative transfer equation and we only take into account the
generation of polarization through the Zeeman effect. However, the method is
extremely general and other more complex forward models can be applied. We
illustrate the ability of the method with the aid of academic and realistic
examples. We show that the information provided by the posterior distribution
turns out to be fundamental to understand and determine the amount of

capacity-approaching low-density parity-check (LDPC) code ensembles whose
transmission takes place over memoryless binary-input output-symmetric (MBIOS)
channels. Properties of the degree distributions, graphical complexity and the
number of fundamental cycles in the bipartite graphs are considered via the
derivation of information-theoretic bounds. These bounds are expressed in terms
of the target block/ bit error probability and the gap (in rate) to capacity.
Most of the bounds are general for any decoding algorithm, and some others are
proved under belief propagation (BP) decoding. Proving these bounds under a
certain decoding algorithm, validates them automatically also under any
sub-optimal decoding algorithm. A proper modification of these bounds makes
them universal for the set of all MBIOS channels which exhibit a given
capacity. Bounds on the degree distributions and graphical complexity apply to
finite-length LDPC codes and to the asymptotic case of an infinite block
length. The bounds are compared with capacity-approaching LDPC code ensembles
under BP decoding, and they are shown to be informative and are easy to
calculate. Finally, some interesting open problems are considered.

Many of them are predominantly devoid of active star formation and for now they
represent the earliest observed stages of massive star formation. Their Outer
Galaxy counterparts, if present, are not easily identified because of a low or
absent mid-IR background. We characterize the ambient conditions in the Outer
Galaxy IRDC candidate G111.80+0.58, a relatively quiescent molecular core
complex in the vicinity of NGC7538. We conduct molecular line observations on a
number of dense cores and analyze the data in terms of excitation temperature,
column and volume density, mass and stability. The temperatures (15-20K) are
higher than expected from only cosmic ray heating, but comparable to those
found in massive cores. Star forming activity could be present in some cores,
as indicated by the presence of warm gas and YSO candidates. The observed
super-thermal line-widths are typical for star forming regions. The velocity
dispersion is consistent with a turbulent energy cascade over the observed size
scales. We do not find a correlation between the gas temperature and the
line-width. The LTE masses we find are much larger than the thermal Jeans mass
and fragmentation is expected. In that case the observed lines represent the
combined emission of multiple unresolved components. We conclude that
G111.80+0.58 is a molecular core complex with bulk properties very similar to
IRDCs in an early, but not pristine, star forming state. The individual cores
are close to virial equilibrium and some contain sufficient material to form
massive stars and star clusters. The ambient conditions suggest that turbulence
is involved in supporting the cores against gravitational collapse.

by Cowie & McKee (1977). In order to test the validity of the analytical
results for more realistic IS conditions the full hydrodynamical equations must
be treated. Therefore, 2D numerical simulations of the evolution of IS clouds
%are performed with different internal density structures and surrounded by a
hot plasma reservoir. Self-gravity, interstellar heating and cooling effects
and heat conduction by electrons are added. Classical thermal conductivity of a
fully ionized hydrogen plasma and saturated heat flux are considered. Using
pure hydrodynamics and classical heat flux we can reproduce the analytical
results. Heat flux saturation reduces the evaporation rate by one order of
magnitude below the analytical value. The evolution changes totally for more
realistic conditions when interstellar heating and cooling effects stabilize
the self-gravity. Evaporation then turns into condensation, because the
additional energy by heat conduction can be transported away from the interface
and radiated off efficiently from the cloud's inner parts. I.e. that the
saturated heat flux consideration is inevitable for IS clouds embedded in hot
tenuous gas. Various consequences are discussed in the paper.

kernel-based regression (KBR) methods. These kernel methods were developed
during the last decade and are inspired by convex risk minimization in
infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. One leading example is support vector
regression. We first describe the relationship between the loss function $L$ of
the KBR method and the tail of the response variable. We then establish the
$L$-risk consistency for KBR which gives the mathematical justification for the
statement that these methods are able to ``learn''. Then we consider robustness
properties of such kernel methods. In particular, our results allow us to
choose the loss function and the kernel to obtain computationally tractable and
consistent KBR methods that have bounded influence functions. Furthermore,
bounds for the bias and for the sensitivity curve, which is a finite sample
version of the influence function, are developed, and the relationship between
KBR and classical $M$ estimators is discussed.

in the superconducting (Bogoliubov) quasiparticle. We argue that this quantity
can be measured locally by comparing the ratio of tunneling currents at
positive and negative biases. This Bogoliubov angle allows one to measure
directly the energy and position dependent particle-hole admixture and
therefore visualize robustness of superconducting state locally. It may also
allow one to measure the particle-hole admixture of excitations in normal state
above critical temperature and thus may be used to measure superconducting

differences between groups of stars, are in good agreement with broad-band and
Stroemgren photometry calibrated on the infrared-flux method. The spectroscopic
abundance analysis reveals, for the first time, systematic trends of iron
abundance with evolutionary stage. Iron is found to be 31% less abundant in the
turnoff-point stars than in the red giants. An abundance difference in lithium
is seen between the turnoff-point and warm subgiant stars. The impact of
potential systematic errors on these abundance trends (stellar parameters, the
hydrostatic and LTE approximations) is quantitatively evaluated and found not
to alter our conclusions significantly. Trends for various elements (Li, Mg,
Ca, Ti and Fe) are compared with stellar-structure models including the effects
of atomic diffusion and radiative acceleration. Such models are found to
describe the observed element-specific trends well, if extra (turbulent) mixing
just below the convection zone is introduced. It is concluded that atomic
diffusion and turbulent mixing are largely responsible for the sub-primordial
stellar lithium abundances of warm halo stars. Other consequences of atomic
diffusion in old metal-poor stars are also discussed.

BeppoSAX data on GRB970228 in the 40-700 keV and 2-26 keV energy bands within
the ""fireshell"" model. We find that GRB970228 is a ""canonical GRB"", like e.g.

(CBM) average density n_{cbm}~10^{-3} #/cm^3. We also simulate the light curve
corresponding to a rescaled CBM density profile with n_{cbm}=1 #/cm^3. From
such a comparison it follows that the total time-integrated luminosity is a
faithful indicator of the GRB nature, contrary to the peak luminosity which is
merely a function of the CBM density. We call attention on discriminating the
short GRBs between the ""genuine"" and the ""fake"" ones. The ""genuine"" ones are
intrinsically short, with baryon loading B \la 10^{-5}, as stated in our
original classification. The ""fake"" ones, characterized by an initial spikelike
emission followed by an extended emission lasting tenths of seconds, have a
baryon loading 10^{-4} \la B \leq 10^{-2}. They are observed as such only due
to an underdense CBM consistent with a galactic halo environment which deflates

Ly-alpha radiation produced by quasar ionization fronts (I-fronts) that expand
in the partially ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) before reionization is
complete. These Ly-alpha photons are mainly generated by collisional
excitations of hydrogen atoms in the boundary of the rapidly expanding HII
region. The observable signal is produced by the part of the I-front that lies
behind the QSO with respect to the observer. Combining two radiative transfer
models (one for the QSO ionizing radiation and one for the Ly-alpha photons),
we estimate the expected Ly-alpha spectral shape and surface brightness (SB)
for a large number of configurations where we varied both the properties of the
ionizing QSO and of the surrounding medium. We find that the expected signal is
observable as a single (broad) emission line with a characteristic width of
100-200 km/s. The expected SB produced at redshift z~6.5 within a fully neutral
region (at mean density) by a typical QSO I-front lies in the range
$10^{-21}-10^{-20}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ and decreases
proportionally to $(1+z)^2$ for a given QSO age. QSOs with harder spectra may
produce a significantly brighter emission at early phases. The signal may cover
up to a few hundred square arcmin on the sky and should be already detectable
with current facilities by means of moderate/high resolution spectroscopy. The
detection of this Ly-alpha emission can shed new light on the reionization
history, the age and the emission properties of the highest-redshift QSOs.

explain how the observed slopes, either positive or negative, in the radial

  15-29 June 2007",,"10.1017/S174392130701397X",,"astro-ph",,"  The presence of a diffuse stellar component in galaxy clusters has been
established by a number of observational works in recent years. In this
contribution I summarize our results (Zibetti et al. 2005) obtained by stacking
SDSS images of 683 clusters, selected with the maxBCG algorithm at 0.2< z <0.3.
Thanks to our large sample and the advantages of image stacking applied to SDSS
images, we are able to measure the systematic properties of the intracluster
light (ICL) with very high accuracy. We find that the average surface
brightness of the ICL ranges between 26 and 32 mag/arcsec^2, and constantly
declines from 70 kpc cluster-centric distance (i.e. distance from the BCG) to
700 kpc. The fraction of diffuse light over the total light (including
galaxies), monotonically declines from ~50 to <~5% over the same range of
distances, thus showing that the ICL is more easily produced close to the
bottom of a cluster's potential well. Clusters lacking a bright BCG hardly
build up a large amount of intracluster stellar component. The link between the
growth of the BCG and the ICL is also suggested by the strong degree of
alignment between these two components which is observed in clusters where the
BCG displays a significant elongation. With the additional fact that the colors
of the ICL are consistent with those of galaxies, all this appears to be
evidence for IC stars being stripped from galaxies that suffer very strong
tidal interactions in the center of clusters and eventually merge into the BCG.
Our measurements also show that IC stars are a minor component of a cluster's
baryonic budget, representing only ~10% of the total optical emission within
500 kpc. Finally, we discuss some open issues that emerge from a comparison of
the present results with other observations and recent theoretical modeling.

studies, and reproduces several qualitative aspects of scanning tunnelling
microscopy (STM) experiments as well. The primary structural modulation
affecting the CuO_2 plane is found to be a buckling wave of tilted CuO_5
half-octahedra, with maximum tilt angle near the phase of the supermodulation
where recent STM experiments have discovered an enhancement of the
superconducting gap. We argue that the tilting of the half-octahedra and

show a surprising connection between the $A_n$ and the primes 2, 5, 13, 37,
463. In the Appendix, we give a conditional proof of the conjecture, assuming a
second conjecture we make about the zeros of $A_n$ and $q_k$ modulo powers of
2. Tables supporting this Zeros Conjecture are presented and we discuss a

  Science (DS 2007), Sendai, Japan, 2007",,,,"cs.AI cs.GR",,"  I postulate that human or other intelligent agents function or should
function as follows. They store all sensory observations as they come - the
data is holy. At any time, given some agent's current coding capabilities, part
of the data is compressible by a short and hopefully fast program / description
/ explanation / world model. In the agent's subjective eyes, such data is more
regular and more ""beautiful"" than other data. It is well-known that knowledge
of regularity and repeatability may improve the agent's ability to plan actions
leading to external rewards. In absence of such rewards, however, known beauty
is boring. Then ""interestingness"" becomes the first derivative of subjective
beauty: as the learning agent improves its compression algorithm, formerly
apparently random data parts become subjectively more regular and beautiful.
Such progress in compressibility is measured and maximized by the curiosity
drive: create action sequences that extend the observation history and yield
previously unknown / unpredictable but quickly learnable algorithmic
regularity. We discuss how all of the above can be naturally implemented on
computers, through an extension of passive unsupervised learning to the case of
active data selection: we reward a general reinforcement learner (with access
to the adaptive compressor) for actions that improve the subjective
compressibility of the growing data. An unusually large breakthrough in
compressibility deserves the name ""discovery"". The ""creativity"" of artists,
dancers, musicians, pure mathematicians can be viewed as a by-product of this
principle. Several qualitative examples support this hypothesis.

direction of the lowest conductivity. The lowest free energy phase corresponds
to a singlet d-wave symmetry in low fields, but to a triplet symmetry in high
fields. A first order singlet-triplet phase transition is expected at moderate
applied fields of a few teslas. We propose to ascribe the recent critical field
and NMR experimental data, observed in superconducting (TMTSF)2ClO4 to such an
effect.

discs surrounding young brown dwarfs, thus implying that the first stages of
planet formation take place also in the sub-stellar regime. Here, we
investigate the potential for planet formation around brown dwarfs and very low
mass stars according to the sequential core accretion model of planet
formation. We find that, for a brown dwarfs of mass 0.05M_{\odot}, our models
predict a maximum planetary mass of ~5M_{\oplus}, orbiting with semi-major axis
~1AU. However, we note that the predictions for the mass - semi-major axis
distribution are strongly dependent upon the models chosen for the disc surface
density profiles and the assumed distribution of disc masses. In particular, if
brown dwarf disc masses are of the order of a few Jupiter masses, Earth-mass
planets might be relatively frequent, while if typical disc masses are only a
fraction of Jupiter mass, we predict that planet formation would be extremely
rare in the sub-stellar regime. As the observational constraints on disc
profiles, mass dependencies and their distributions are poor in the brown dwarf
regime, we advise caution in validating theoretical models only on stars
similar to the Sun and emphasise the need for observational data on planetary
systems around a wide range of stellar masses. We also find that, unlike the
situation around solar-like stars, Type-II migration is totally absent from the
planet formation process around brown dwarfs, suggesting that any future
observations of planets around brown dwarfs would provide a direct measure of
the role of other types of migration.

rickettsii move within a host cell by polymerizing a comet-tail of actin fibers
that ultimately pushes the cell forward. This dense network of cross-linked
actin polymers typically exhibits a striking curvature that causes bacteria to
move in gently looping paths. Theoretically, tail curvature has been linked to
details of motility by considering force and torque balances from a finite
number of polymerizing filaments. Here we track beads coated with a prokaryotic
activator of actin polymerization in three dimensions to directly quantify the
curvature and torsion of bead motility paths. We find that bead paths are more
likely to have low rather than high curvature at any given time. Furthermore,
path curvature changes very slowly in time, with an autocorrelation decay time
of 200 seconds. Paths with a small radius of curvature, therefore, remain so
for an extended period resulting in loops when confined to two dimensions. When
allowed to explore a 3D space, path loops are less evident. Finally, we
quantify the torsion in the bead paths and show that beads do not exhibit a
significant left- or right-handed bias to their motion in 3D. These results
suggest that paths of actin-propelled objects may be attributed to slow changes
in curvature rather than a fixed torque.
