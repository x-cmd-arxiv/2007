polynomials for the classical Lie groups K = O(N), SO(N), and USp(N). To that
end, we start from the Clifford-Weyl algebera in its canonical realization on
the complex of holomorphic differential forms for a C-vector space V. From it
we construct the Fock representation of an orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra osp
associated to V. Particular attention is paid to defining Howe's oscillator
semigroup and the representation that partially exponentiates the Lie algebra
representation of sp in osp. In the process, by pushing the semigroup
representation to its boundary and arguing by continuity, we provide a
construction of the Shale-Weil-Segal representation of the metaplectic group.
  To deal with a product of n ratios of characteristic polynomials, we let V =
C^n \otimes C^N where C^N is equipped with its standard K-representation, and
focus on the subspace of K-equivariant forms. By Howe duality, this is a
highest-weight irreducible representation of the centralizer g of Lie(K) in
osp. We identify the K-Haar expectation of n ratios with the character of this
g-representation, which we show to be uniquely determined by analyticity, Weyl
group invariance, certain weight constraints and a system of differential
equations coming from the Laplace-Casimir invariants of g. We find an explicit
solution to the problem posed by all these conditions. In this way we prove
that the said Haar expectations are expressed by a Weyl-type character formula
for all integers N \ge 1. This completes earlier work by Conrey, Farmer, and

thus represents one preferred method for the inclusion of magnetic fields in
simulations. We show that constrained transport can be implemented with
volume-centered fields and hyperresistivity on a high-order finite difference
stencil. Additionally, the finite-difference coefficients can be tuned to
enhance high-wavenumber resolution. Similar techniques can be used for the
interpolations required for dealiasing corrections at high wavenumber.
Together, these measures yield an algorithm with a wavenumber resolution that
approaches the theoretical maximum achieved by spectral algorithms. Because
this algorithm uses finite differences instead of fast Fourier transforms, it
runs faster and isn't restricted to periodic boundary conditions. Also, since
the finite differences are spatially local, this algorithm is easily scalable
to thousands of processors. We demonstrate that, for low-Mach-number

motivated by understanding observed magnetization relaxation as a function of
temperature in diverse magnetic systems such as arrays of magnetic
nanoparticles and magnetic molecules. We assume that the magnetization of the
spin system relaxes through consecutive emission or absorption of a single
phonon. From a weak, linear spin-phonon coupling Hamiltonian, we derive
transition rates that would be used to examine dynamic properties of the system
in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Although the derived phonon-assisted
transition rates satisfy detailed balance, in the case of two and three
dimensional phonon baths, transitions between degenerate states are not
allowed. Thus, if there are no alternative paths along which the spin system
can relax, the relaxation time diverges. Otherwise, the system finds other
paths, which leads to an increase in the relaxation time and energy barrier.
However, when higher-order phonon processes are included in the transition
rates, it is found that the system can reach the states which were inaccessible
due to the forbidden transitions. As a result, the system recovers some of the
dynamic properties obtained using the Glauber transition rate.

combination with thermophoresis can efficiently erode a dust bed in a
low-pressure gaseous environment. The surface of an illuminated, light
absorbing dusty body is cooler than the dust below the surface (solidstate
greenhouse effect). This temperature gradient leads to a directed momentum
transfer between gas and dust particles and the dust particles are subject to a
force towards the surface(thermophoresis). If the thermophoretic force is
stronger than gravity and cohesion, dust particles are ejected. Applied to
protoplanetary discs, dusty bodies smaller than several kilometres in size
which are closer to a star than about 0.4 au are subject to a rapid and
complete disassembly to submillimetre size dust aggregates by this process.
While an inward-drifting dusty body is destroyed, the generated dust is not
lost for the disc by sublimation or subsequent accretion on to the star but can
be reprocessed by photophoresis or radiation pressure. Planetesimals cannot
originate through aggregation of dust inside the erosion zone. If objects
larger than several kilometres already exist, they prevail and further grow by
collecting dust from disassembled smaller bodies. The pile-up of solids in a
confined inner region of the disc, in general, boosts the formation of planets.
Erosion is possible in even strongly gas-depleted inner regions as observed for
TW Hya. Reprocessing of dust through light-induced erosion offers one possible
explanation for growth of large cores of gas-poor giant planets in a
gas-starved region as recently found around HD 149026b.

which may require centuries to manifest itself if LBVs go through long

detected a wealth of stars whose spectra are similar to the known LBVs. We

new LBV candidates. We demonstrate spectacular spectral variability for several
of the new LBV candidates, such as AM2, previously classified as a Wolf-Rayet
star, which now shows FeI, FeII and Balmer emission lines but neither the NIII
4634,42 nor HeII 4686 emission that it did in 1982. Profound spectral changes
are also noted for other suspected and known LBVs. Several of the LBV

  TeV band","Accepted for publication in A&A letters, 4 pages, 5 figures",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20078290",,"astro-ph",,"  Context: The redshift of PG 1553+11, a bright BL Lac object (V~14), is still
unknown. It has been recently observed in the TeV band, a fact that offers an
upper limit for the redshift z<0.4. Aims: We intend to provide a lower limit
for the distance of the object. Methods: We used a chi^2 procedure to constrain
the apparent magnitude of the host galaxy in archived HST images. Supposing
that the host galaxy is typical of BL Lac objects (M_{R} -22.8), a lower limit
to the distance can be obtained from the limit on the apparent magnitude of the
host galaxy. Results: Using the 3 sigma limit on the host galaxy magnitude, the
redshift is found to be greater or equal to 0.25. Conlusions: The redshift of
PG 1553+11 is probably in the range z=0.3-0.4, making this object the most
distant extragalactic source so far detected in the TeV energies. We suggest
that other bright BL Lac objects of unknown redshift and similar spectroscopic
characteristics may be interesting targets for TeV observations.

concerning the birth of mesons, the author describes recent developments in the
spectroscopy of pion-nucleus bound states via ""pion-transfer"" reactions. The
role of pions as Nambu-Goldstone bosons in nuclear media is emphasized by
recently obtained experimental evidence for the partial restoration of chiral
symmetry breaking. New light is shed on Kbar mesons, which play a unique role
in forming dense nuclear systems. The basic unit, K- pp, is predicted to
possess a molecular structure with quasi-Lambda(1405) as an ""atomic
constituent"". We find here ""super strong nuclear force"" produced by a migrating
real Kbar meson in the Heitler-London-Heisenberg scheme in place of the normal
nuclear force mediated by Yukawa's virtual mesons.
