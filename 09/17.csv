depth, tau_eff, over the redshift range 2<z<4.2 from a sample of 86
high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise quasar spectra obtained with the ESI and
HIRES spectrographs on Keck, and with the MIKE spectrograph on Magellan. This
represents an improvement over previous analyses of the Lya forest from
high-resolution spectra in this redshift interval of a factor of two in the
size of the data set alone. We pay particular attention to robust error
estimation and extensively test for systematic effects. We find that our
estimates of the quasar continuum levels in the Lya forest obtained by spline
fitting are systematically biased low, with the magnitude of the bias
increasing with redshift, but that this bias can be accounted for using mock
spectra. The mean fractional error is <1% at z=2, 4% at z=3, and 12% at z=4.
Previous measurements of tau_eff at z>~3 based on directly fitting the quasar
continua in the Lya forest, which have generally neglected this effect, are
therefore likely biased low. We provide estimates of the level of absorption
arising from metals in the Lya forest based on both direct and statistical
metal removal results in the literature, finding that this contribution is
~6-9% at z=3 and decreases monotonically with redshift. The high precision of
our measurement, attaining 3% in redshift bins of width Delta z=0.2 around z=3,
indicates significant departures from the best-fit power-law redshift evolution
(tau_eff=0.0018(1+z)^3.92, when metals are left in), particularly near z=3.2.
The observed downward departure is statistically consistent with a similar
feature detected in a precision statistical measurement using Sloan Digital Sky
Survey spectra by Bernardi and coworkers using an independent approach.

properties at the site of the X3.4 class flare, using a time series of vector

December 13 at the apparent collision site between the large, opposite polarity
umbrae. Elongated magnetic structures with alternatingly positive and negative
polarities resulting from flux emergence appeared one day before the flare in
the collision site penumbra. Subsequently, the polarity inversion line at the
collision site became very complicated. The number of bright loops in Ca II H
increased during the formation of these elongated magnetic structures. The
flare ribbons and bright loops evolved along the polarity inversion line and
one footpoint of the bright loop was located in a region having a large
departure of field azimuth angle with respect to its surroundings. The SOT
observations with high spatial resolution and high polarization precision
reveal temporal change in fine structure of magnetic fields at the flare site:
some parts of the complicated polarity inversion line then disappeared, and in
those regions the azimuth angle of photospheric magnetic field changed by about
90 degrees, becoming more spatially uniform within the collision site.

treatment is based on an invariant-embedding equation for the evolution of the

disordered conductor, where decoherence is introduced at par with the disorder
through an outcoupling, or stochastic absorption, of the wave amplitude into
side (transverse) channels, and its subsequent incoherent re-injection into the
conductor. This is essentially in the spirit of B{\""u}ttiker's
reservoir-induced decoherence. The resulting evolution equation for the
probability density of the 4-probe resistance in the presence of decoherence is
then generalised from the 1-dimensional to the d-dimensional case following an
anisotropic Migdal-Kadanoff-type procedure and analysed. The anisotropy, namely
that the disorder evolves in one arbitrarily chosen direction only, is the main
approximation here that makes the analytical treatment possible. A
qualitatively new result is that arbitrarily small decoherence reduces the
localisation-delocalisation transition to a crossover making resistance moments

because of cancellation in circular polarization. However, the Hanle effect
diagnostics, accessible through the second solar spectrum, provides us with a
very sensitive tool for studying the distribution of weak magnetic fields on
the Sun. Molecular lines are very strong and even dominate in some regions of
the second solar spectrum. The CN $B {}^{2} \Sigma - X {}^{2} \Sigma$ system is
one of the richest and most promising systems for molecular diagnostics and
well suited for the application of the differential Hanle effect method. The
aim is to interpret observations of the CN $B {}^{2} \Sigma - X {}^{2} \Sigma$
system using the Hanle effect and to obtain an estimation of the magnetic field
strength. We assume that the CN molecular layer is situated above the region
where the continuum radiation is formed and employ the single-scattering

model that can diagnose turbulent magnetic fields. We have succeeded in fitting
modeled CN lines in several regions of the second solar spectrum to
observations and obtained a magnetic field strength in the range from 10--30 G
in the upper solar photosphere depending on the considered lines.

eigenvectors of Floquet operators that describe unit time evolutions of
periodically driven systems, e.g., kicked rotors, are studied. First, an
example of the anholonomies induced by a periodically pulsed rank-1
perturbation is given. As a function of the strength of the perturbation, the
perturbed Floquet operator of the quantum map and its spectrum are shown to
have a period. However, we show examples where each eigenvalue does not obey
the periodicity of the perturbed Floquet operator and exhibits an anholonomy.
Furthermore, this induces another anholonomy in the eigenspaces, i.e., the
directions of the eigenvectors, of the Floquet operator. These two anholonomies
are previously observed in a family of Hamiltonians [T. Cheon, Phys. Lett. A
248, 285 (1998)] and are different from the phase anholonomy known as geometric
phases. Second, the stability of Cheon's anholonomies in periodically driven
systems is established by a geometrical analysis of the family of Floquet
operators. Accordingly, Cheon's anholonomies are expected to be abundant in
systems whose time evolutions are described by Floquet operators. As an
application, a design principle for quantum state manipulations along adiabatic
passages is explained.

formation, many umbral dots were observed emerging from the leading edges of
penumbral filaments, and intruding into the umbra rapidly. The precursor of the
light bridge formation was also identified as the relatively slow inward motion
of the umbral dots which emerged not near the penumbra, but inside the umbra.
The spectro-polarimeter on SOT provided physical conditions in the photosphere
around the umbral dots and the light bridges. We found the light bridges and
the umbral dots had significantly weaker magnetic fields associated with
upflows relative to the core of the umbra, which implies that there was hot gas
with weak field strength penetrating from subphotosphere to near the visible
surface inside those structures. There needs to be a mechanism to drive the
inward motion of the hot gas along the light bridges. We suggest that the
emergence and the inward motion are triggered by a buoyant penumbral flux tube
as well as the subphotospheric flow crossing the sunspot.

collision energies can be extracted from their wave function at zero energy. An
asymptotic expansion of this wave function at large interparticle distances is
derived, from which is defined a quantity $D$ named three-body scattering
hypervolume, which is an analog of the two-body scattering length. Given any
finite-range interaction potentials, one can thus predict the effective
three-body force from a numerical solution of the Schr\""{o}dinger equation. In
this way the constant $D$ for hard-sphere bosons is computed, leading to the
complete result for the ground state energy per particle of a dilute

is the number density. Effects of $D$ are also demonstrated in the three-body
energy in a finite box of size $L$, which is expanded to the order $L^{-7}$,

that there is a violation of the effective field theory (EFT) in the condensate

naturally in the phase space of arbitrary histories, with dynamics playing the

all fields in Taylor series around the observer's trajectory, and truncating at
some fixed order. This regularized but manifestly general-covariant theory is
quantized in the history phase space, and dynamics is imposed afterwards, in

are 1e2...1e6 times larger than expected for standard pulsar spin-down law.
Moreover, the second derivatives as well as braking indices are even negative
for about half the pulsars. We explain these paradoxical results on the basis
of the statistical analysis of the rotational parameters f0, f1 and f2 of the
subset of 295 pulsars taken mostly from the ATNF database. We have found a
strong correlation between f2 and f1 for both f2 > 0 (correlation coefficient r
~ 0.9) and f2 < 0 (r ~ 0.85), as well as between f0 and f1 (r ~ 0.6...0.7). We
interpret these dependencies as evolutionary ones due to f1 being nearly
proportional to the pulsars' age.
  The derived statistical relations as well as ""anomalous"" values of f2 are
well described by assuming the existence of long-time variations of the
spin-down rate. The pulsar frequency evolution, therefore, consists of secular
change of f0_{ev}(t), f1_{ev}(t) and f2_{ev}(t) according to the power law with
n ~ 5, the irregularities, observed within the timespan as timing noise, and
the non-monotonous variations on the timescale of several tens of years, which
is larger than that of the timespan. It is possible that the nature of
long-term variations is similar to that of short-term ones. The idea of
non-constant secular pulsars' braking index n is also analysed.

recent finding of such a ring in the galaxy cluster Cl 0024+17 by Jee et al. We
find that the parameters of the observed ring can be naturally explained in
this way; this feature may therefore turn out to be a direct evidence for MOND.
We study this phenomenon in simple, axisymmetric configurations aligned with
the line of sight: spherical masses, a dumbbell of spherical masses, and an
elongated, thin structure. The properties of the apparent ring: its radius,
surface density, and contrast, depend on the form of the MOND interpolating
function and on the exact three dimensional distribution of the sources (the
thin-lens approximation is quite invalid in MOND). We also comment on the
possible appearance of orphan features, marking the Newtonian-to-MOND
transition, in high surface brightness galaxies. In particular, we find that
previously unexplained structure in the rotation curves of some galaxies may be
evidence for such features.

sequence stars is an important pre-requisite for the design of future
life-finding space missions such as ESA's Darwin or NASA's Terrestrial Planet

perform such a survey from the ground. We investigate the performance of a
nulling interferometer optimised for the detection of exozodiacal discs at Dome
C, on the high Antarctic plateau, and compare it to the expected performance of
similar instruments at temperate sites. Based on the currently available
measurements of the turbulence characteristics at Dome C, we adapt the GENIEsim
software (Absil et al. 2006, A&A 448) to simulate the performance of a nulling
interferometer on the high Antarctic plateau. To feed a realistic instrumental
configuration into the simulator, we propose a conceptual design for ALADDIN,
the Antarctic L-band Astrophysics Discovery Demonstrator for Interferometric
Nulling. We assume that this instrument can be placed above the 30-m high
boundary layer, where most of the atmospheric turbulence originates. We show
that an optimised nulling interferometer operating on a pair of 1-m class
telescopes located 30 m above the ground could achieve a better sensitivity
than a similar instrument working with two 8-m class telescopes at a temperate
site such as Cerro Paranal. The detection of circumstellar discs about 20 times
as dense as our local zodiacal cloud seems within reach for typical Darwin/TPF
targets in a integration time of a few hours. Moreover, the exceptional
turbulence conditions significantly relax the requirements on real-time control
loops, which has favourable consequences on the feasibility of the nulling
instrument.

non-detection of some additional QSOs. The detected host galaxies are extremely
luminous with M_V ~ -25. Their rest-frame B-V colours, however, are close to
zero in the Vega system, indicating substantial contributions from young stars
and a stellar mass-to-light ratio below 1 (in solar units). Tentatively

of M_star in the range of several 10^11 M_sun, placing them within the

`curved' harmonic oscillators simultaneously on any such configuration space,
using a Cayley-Klein (CK) type approach, with two free parameters $\ki, \kii$
which altogether correspond to the possible values for curvature and signature
type: the generic Riemannian and Lorentzian spaces of constant curvature

obtain explicit expressions for the orbits by using three different methods:
first by direct integration, second by obtaining the general CK version of the
Binet's equation and third, as a consequence of its superintegrable character.
The orbits are conics with centre at the potential origin in any CK space,
thereby extending this well known Euclidean property to any constant curvature
configuration space. The final part of the article, that has a more geometric

the band gap upon the Si concentration. The same substitution for the

surface reactions on interstellar ices. However, solid state astrochemical
laboratory data on reactions of H-atoms with common interstellar ice
constituents are largely lacking. Aims: The goal of our laboratory work is to
determine whether and how carbon dioxide (CO2), formic acid (HCOOH) and
acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) react with H-atoms in the solid state at low temperatures
and to derive reaction rates and production yields. Methods: Pure CO2, HCOOH
and CH3CHO interstellar ice analogues are bombarded by H-atoms in an ultra-high
vacuum experiment. The ices are monitored by reflection absorption infrared
spectroscopy and the reaction products are detected in the gas phase through
temperature programmed desorption to determine the destruction and formation
yields as well as the corresponding reaction rates. Results: Within the
sensitivity of our set-up we conclude that H-atom bombardment of pure CO2 and
HCOOH ice does not result in detectable reaction products. The upper limits on
the reaction rates are less or equal to 7e(-17) cm^2/s which make it unlikely
that these species play a major role in the formation of more complex organics
in interstellar ices due to reactions with H-atoms. In contrast, CH3CHO does
react with H-atoms. At most 20% is hydrogenated to ethanol (C2H5OH) and a
second reaction route leads to the break-up of the C-C bond to form solid state
CH4 (~20%) as well as H2CO and CH3OH (15-50%). The methane production yield is
expected to be equal to the summed yield of H2CO and CH3OH and therefore CH4
most likely evaporates partly after formation due to the high exothermicity of
the reaction. The reaction rates for CH3CHO destruction depend on ice
temperature and not on ice thickness.

we obtain the {\em Kraftsum} of a code, if we divide for every length the
number of codewords of this length in the code by the total number of all
possible words of this length and then take summation over all codeword lengths
which appears in the code. The same way the Kraftsum of a lengths sequence
$(l_1,..., l_n) $ is given by $\sum_{i=1}^n q^{-l_i} $, where $q$ is the
numbers of letters in the alphabet. Kraft and McMillan have shown in
\cite{kraft} (1956), that there exists a prefix-free code with codeword lengths
of a certain lengths sequence, if the Kraftsum of the lengths sequence is
smaller than or equal to one. Furthermore they have shown, that the converse
also holds for all (uniquely decipherable) codes.\footnote{In this survey a
code means a set of words, such that any message which is encoded with these
words can be uniquely decoded. Therefore we omit in future the ""uniquely
decipherable"" and write only ""code"".} The question rises, if Kraft's and
McMillan's result can be generalized to other types of codes? Throughout, we
try to give an answer on this question for the class of fix-free codes. Since
any code has Kraftsum smaller than or equal to one, this answers the question
for the second implication of Kraft-McMillan's theorem. Therefore we pay
attention mainly to the first implication.

Under suitable mixing conditions for the fibre transformation, we show that the
properties ergodicity, weakly mixing, and strongly mixing are passed on from
the base transformation to the skew product (with respect to the product

with respect to the base variable for the series of ergodic averages of a

such a skew product. Assuming a certain growth condition for the coupling
function, a strong mixing condition on the fibre transformation, and continuity

L^p(P)-convergence in the fibre. Under an equicontinuity assumption on F we

planetary nebulae) with theoretical diagnostic diagrams, and derived the
spectral energy distribution (from 3.6 to 24 micron) of each type of object.
Moreover, we generated a catalogue of 24 micron sources and inferred their
nature from the observed and theoretical colours of the known type sources. We
estimated the star formation rate in M33 both globally and locally, from the IR
emission and from the Halpha emission line. The colours of the typical IR
emissions of HII regions, supernovae remnants and planetary nebulae are
continuous among the different samples, with overlapping regions in the
diagnostic diagrams. The comparison between the model results and the colours
of HII regions indicates a dusty envelope at relatively high temperatures ~600
K, and moderate extinction Av < 10. The 24 micron sources IR colours follow the
regions observationally defined by the three classes of known objects but the
majority of them represent HII regions. The derived total IR luminosity
function is in fact very similar to the HII luminosity function observed in the
Milky Way and in other late type spirals. Even though our completeness limit is
5x10^37 ergs s-1, in low density regions we are able to detect sources five
times fainter than this, corresponding to the faintest possible HII region.

studied numerically using a spectral method. The shape of the capsule and the
hydrodynamic flow field are expanded into smooth basis functions. Analytic
expressions for the derivative of the basis functions permit the evaluation of
elastic and hydrodynamic stresses and bending forces at specified grid points
in the membrane. Compared to methods employing a triangulation scheme, this
method has the advantage that the resulting capsule shapes are automatically
smooth, and few modes are needed to describe the deformation accurately.
Computations are performed for capsules both with spherical and ellipsoidal
unstressed reference shape. Results for small deformations of initially
spherical capsules coincide with analytic predictions. For initially
ellipsoidal capsules, recent approximative theories predict stable oscillations
of the tank-treading inclination angle, and a transition to tumbling at low
shear rate. Both phenomena have also been observed experimentally. Using our
numerical approach we could reproduce both the oscillations and the transition
to tumbling. The full phase diagram for varying shear rate and viscosity ratio
is explored. While the numerically obtained phase diagram qualitatively agrees
with the theory, intermittent behaviour could not be observed within our

back to the origin after L steps (L an even integer). In the 'pinning model'
each path \eta has a weight \lambda^{N(\eta)}, where \lambda>0 and N(\eta) is
the number of zeros in \eta. When the paths are constrained to be non-negative,
the polymer is said to satisfy a hard-wall constraint. Such models are well
known to undergo a localization/delocalization transition as the pinning
strength \lambda is varied. In this paper we study a natural 'spin flip'
dynamics for these models and derive several estimates on its spectral gap and
mixing time. In particular, for the system with the wall we prove that
relaxation to equilibrium is always at least as fast as in the free case
(\lambda=1, no wall), where the gap and the mixing time are known to scale as
L^{-2} and L^2\log L, respectively. This improves considerably over previously
known results. For the system without the wall we show that the equilibrium
phase transition has a clear dynamical manifestation: for \lambda \geq 1 the
relaxation is again at least as fast as the diffusive free case, but in the
strictly delocalized phase (\lambda < 1) the gap is shown to be O(L^{-5/2}), up
to logarithmic corrections. As an application of our bounds, we prove stretched
exponential relaxation of local functions in the localized regime.

of measurement, its completeness claims, the ambiguity of its notion of
correspondence, its confused notion of complementarity. It is demonstrated how
confusions and paradoxes stemming from the negative features of the Copenhagen
interpretation can be dealt with in an amended interpretation, to be referred
to as `neo-Copenhagen interpretation', in which the role of the measuring
instrument is taken seriously by recognizing the quantum mechanical character
of its interaction with the microscopic object. The ensuing necessity of
extending the notion of a quantum mechanical observable from the Hermitian
operator of the standard formalism to the positive operator-valued measure of a
generalized formalism is demonstrated to yield a sound mathematical basis for a
transition from the Copenhagen contextualistic-realist interpretation to the
neo-Copenhagen empiricist one. Applications to the uncertainty relations and to

dependence on the vortensity gradient in the limit of a cold disk. Although
this expression requires the solution of the hydrodynamic equations, it
provides some insight into the dynamics of the corotation region. In the
general case, we find an additional dependence on the entropy gradient at
corotation. This dependence is associated to the advection of entropy
perturbations. These are not associated to pressure perturbations. They remain
confined to the corotation region, where they yield a singular contribution to
the corotation torque. In a second part, we check our torque expression by
means of customized two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. In a third

to be adiabatic. We find an excess of corotation torque that scales with the
entropy gradient, and we check that the contribution of the entropy
perturbation to the torque is in agreement with the expression obtained from
the linear analysis. We finally discuss some implications of the corotation

of the soft X-ray background (extragalactic discrete sources dominated by AGNs,
galactic plasma, and the Warm/Hot Intergalactic Medium), investigating the
angular structure of the background. Fluctuations of the background are
measured using the auto-correlation function of the XRB determined in 5 energy
bands between 0.3 and 4.5 keV. The investigation is based on the extensive
observational data set selected from the XMM-Newton archives. Amplitudes of the
auto-correlation functions calculated in three energy bands above ~1 keV are
consistent with the conjecture that the background fluctuations result solely
from clustering of sources which produce the background. At energies below 1
keV the relative fluctuation amplitude decreases indicating that a fraction of
the soft XRB is associated with a smooth plasma emission in the Galaxy. It is
shown, however, that the mean spectrum of extragalactic discrete sources
steepens in the soft X-rays and is not well represented by a single power law
in the energy range 0.3-4.5 keV. The WHIM contribution to the total background
fluctuations is small and consistent with the WHIM properties derived from the
cross-correlation of the XRB with galaxies.

independent of the strength of the coupling with the environment. It is shown
that although such regime does exist, as previously established by Cucchietti

signature of a quantum phase transition in the environment. In fact, this kind
of universality also exists in the absence of quantum phase transitions. A
universal regime can be related to the existence of an energy scale separation
between the Hamiltonian of the environment and the one characterizing the
system-environment interaction. The results presented also indicate that in the
strong coupling regime the quantum phase transition does not produce an
enhancement of decoherence (as opposed to what happens in the weak coupling
regime).

high energy neutrinos and established signals. We show the first adaptation of
a Target of Opportunity strategy to collect simultaneous data of high energy
neutrinos and gamma-rays. Neutrino events with coordinates close to preselected
candidate sources are used to alert gamma-ray observations. The detection of a
positive coincidence can enhance the neutrino discovery chance. More generally,
this scheme of operation can increase the availability of simultaneous

observations will allow time correlation studies and therefore constraints on
the source modeling. A first technical implementation of this scheme involving
AMANDA-II and MAGIC has been realized for few pre-selected sources in a short

on the special nature of slope movements and the difficulties related to

reactivation and the catastrophic transition to rapid gravitational processes

between two limits: one in which both qubits interact with the same site of the

exhibit different behaviours in the weak and strong coupling regimes: when the
coupling is weak it is found that decoherence tends to decrease with distance,
while for strong coupling the result is the opposite. Also, in the weak
coupling case, the long distance limit is rapidly reached, while for strong
coupling there is clear evidence of an expected effect: environment-induced
interactions between the qubits of the system. A consequence of this is the
appearance of quasiperiodic events that can be interpreted as ``sudden deaths''

driving, continuum radiation driving, and thermal driving as mechanisms for
producing the wind. Entrainment of material by the magnetically driven jet is
the only plausible origin of such a high velocity flow, but numerical

material at high enough velocities to reproduce the soft X-ray excess. If the
soft excess is produced by absorption then it seems more likely that the

smooth one. Here, we investigate four oxadiazole compounds with the same
structure but terminal Br-substituent. The behaviour of the smectic and nematic
phases is like that observed in the compounds with Cl. The focus of the paper
is on the growth of toric domains from the nematic melt and on the role of
defects in the domain structure.

periodic chains (LPCs) of prolate and oblate metallic spheroids. We show that
the SPP group velocity can be efficiently controlled by varying the aspect
ratio of the spheroids. For sufficiently small aspect ratios, a gap appears in
the first Brillouin zone of the chain lattice in which propagating modes do not
exist. depending on the SPP polarization, the gap extends to certain intervals
of the Bloch wave number q. Thus, for transverse polarization, no propagating
SPPs exist with wave numbers q such that q_c^\perp < | q | < \pi/h, h being the
chain period. For longitudinally polarized SPPs, the gap spans the interval
|q|<q_c^\parallel. Here q_c^\perp and q_c^\parallel are different constants
which depend on the chain parameters, spheroid aspect ratio and its orientation
with respect to the chain axis. The dependence of the dispersion curves on the
spheroid aspect ratio leads to a number of interesting effects. In particular,
bandwidth of SPPs that can propagate in an LPC can be substantially increased
by utilizing prolate or oblate spheroids. When q is close to a critical value,
so that |q - q_c^\perp|<<\pi/h or |q - q_c^\parallel|<<\pi/h, the decay length
of the SPPs is dramatically increased. In addition, the dispersion curves
acquire a very large positive or negative slope. This can be used to achieve
superluminal group velocity for realistic chain parameters. We demonstrate
superluminal propagation of Gaussian wave packets in numerical simulations.
Both theory and simulations are based on Maxwell equations with account of
retardation and, therefore, are fully relativistic.

an application, the specific entropy along curves is used to refine Foellmer
