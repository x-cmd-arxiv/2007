(logical qubit) that is immune to collective noise acting on the Hilbert space
of the states supporting it. The logical qubit is comprised of three photonic
three-state systems (qutrits) and is generated by the process of spontaneous
parametric down conversion. The states are constructed using linear optical
elements along with three down-conversion sources, and are deemed successful by
the simultaneous detection of six events. We also show how to select a
maximally entangled state of two qutrits by similar methods. For this maximally
entangled state we describe conditions for the state to be decoherence-free
which do not correspond to collective errors.

introduce a new class of Distributed STBCs called Semi-orthogonal Precoded
Distributed Single-Symbol Decodable STBCs (S-PDSSDC) wherein, the source
performs co-ordinate interleaving of information symbols appropriately before
transmitting it to all the relays. It is shown that DOSTBCs are a special case
of S-PDSSDCs. A special class of S-PDSSDCs having diagonal covariance matrix at
the destination is studied and an upperbound on the maximal rate of such codes
is derived. The bounds obtained are approximately twice larger than that of the
DOSTBCs. A systematic construction of S-PDSSDCs is presented when the number of
relays $K \geq 4$. The constructed codes are shown to achieve the upperbound on
the rate when $K$ is of the form 0 or 3 modulo 4. For the rest of the values of
$K$, the constructed codes are shown to have rates higher than that of DOSTBCs.
It is shown that S-PDSSDCs cannot be constructed with any form of linear
processing at the relays when the source doesn't perform co-ordinate
interleaving of the information symbols. Simulation result shows that S-PDSSDCs
have better probability of error performance than that of DOSTBCs.

and its opacity to visible lasers. Nevertheless, useful vibrational spectra
from two-phonon processes are obtained with red lasers, probably because of a
resonance in the concomitant electronic transitions. Here we report temperature
dependent spectra, covering the 10-300 K range, for two samples with different
sulfur isotopic compositions. The results are analyzed by comparison with ab
initio calculations of the lattice dynamics of PbS and the corresponding
densities of one and two-phonon states. Emphasis is placed on the analysis of
the two phonon band centered at ~430 cm-1.

highly excited hadronic states which are produced below the phase transition
point to the quark-gluon plasma. The hadronic density of states has the
Gross-Witten critical point and exhibits a third order phase transition from a
hadronic phase dominated by the discrete low-lying hadronic mass spectrum
particles to another hadronic phase dominated by the continuous Hagedorn
states. The Hagedorn threshold production is found just above the highest known
experimental discrete low-lying hadronic mass spectrum. The subsequent Hagedorn
phase undergoes a first order deconfinement phase transition to an explosive

regularities in trading order flow in the London Stock Exchange. This can be
viewed as a very simple agent based model in which all components of the model
are validated against real data. Our empirical studies of order flow uncover
several interesting regularities in the way trading orders are placed and
cancelled. The resulting simple model of order flow is used to simulate price
formation under a continuous double auction, and the statistical properties of
the resulting simulated sequence of prices are compared to those of real data.
The model is constructed using one stock (AZN) and tested on 24 other stocks.
For low volatility, small tick size stocks (called Group I) the predictions are
very good, but for stocks outside Group I they are not good. For Group I, the
model predicts the correct magnitude and functional form of the distribution of
the volatility and the bid-ask spread, without adjusting any parameters based
on prices. This suggests that at least for Group I stocks, the volatility and
heavy tails of prices are related to market microstructure effects, and
supports the hypothesis that, at least on short time scales, the large
fluctuations of absolute returns are well described by a power law with an
exponent that varies from stock to stock.

boundary conditions are taken into account: periodic boundary conditions (where
the nth oscillator is coupled back to the first oscillator) and fixed wall
boundary conditions (where the first oscillator and the $n$th oscillator are
coupled to a fixed wall). The two systems are characterized by their
Hamiltonian. For their quantization, we treat these systems as Wigner Quantum
Systems (WQS), allowing more solutions than just the canonical quantization
solution. In this WQS approach, one is led to certain algebraic relations for
operators (which are linear combinations of position and momentum operators)
that should satisfy triple relations involving commutators and
anti-commutators. These triple relations have a solution in terms of the Lie
superalgebra gl(1|n). We study a particular class of gl(1|n) representations
V(p), the so-called ladder representations. For these representations, we
determine the spectrum of the Hamiltonian and of the position operators (for
both types of boundary conditions). Furthermore, we compute the eigenvectors of
the position operators in terms of stationary states. This leads to explicit
expressions for position probabilities of the n oscillators in the chain. An
analysis of the plots of such position probability distributions gives rise to
some interesting observations. In particular, the physical behavior of the
system as a WQS is very much in agreement with what one would expect from the
classical case, except that all physical quantities (energy, position and
momentum of each oscillator) have a finite spectrum.

outflow rate of ~1-20% of the accretion rate as in most popular models for jet
launching; in the present model these are termed fast-first-stage (FFS) jets.
However, the FFS jets encounter surrounding gas that originates in the mass
accretion process, and are terminated by strong shocks close to their origin.
Two hot bubbles are formed. These bubbles accelerate the surrounding gas to
form two SMW jets that are more massive and slower than the FFS jets. There are
two conditions for this mechanism to work. Firstly, the surrounding gas should
be massive enough to block the free expansion of the FFS jets. Most efficiently
this condition is achieved when the surrounding gas is replenished. Secondly,
the radiative energy losses must be small.

analysis of X-ray spectra, selected at different flux levels of the source,
allows us to distinguish between a very hard state, at a low countrate, and a
brighter, softer, highly absorbed spectrum during episodes of flaring activity,
when the unabsorbed source luminosity is about three times the value in the
hard state. The spectrum of the hard state clearly shows emission lines of
highly ionized elements, while, during the flaring state, the spectrum also
shows strong resonant absorption lines. The most intense and interesting
feature in this latter state is present in the Fe K alpha region: a very
broadened absorption line at energies ~ 6.5 keV that could result from a
smeared blending of resonant absorption lines of moderately ionized iron ions
(Fe XX - Fe XXIV). We also observe strong resonant absorption lines of Fe XXV
and Fe XXVI, together with a smeared absorption edge above 7 keV. We argue that
the emitting region during the quiescent/hard state is constituted of a purely
photo-ionized medium, possibly present above an accretion disk, or of a
photo-ionized plasma present in a beamed outflow. During the flaring states the
source undergoes enhanced turbulent accretion that modifies both the accretion
geometry and the optical depth of the gas surrounding the primary X-ray source.

offers a precious opportunity to study in detail the environment of a nearby

evolution with time of the spectroscopic quantities we derive. We analyse
HG031203 using a set of optical spectra acquired with the ESO-VLT and Keck
telescope. We compare the metallicity, luminosity and star formation properties
of this galaxy and of the other supernova-long gamma-ray burst hosts in the
local universe (z<0.2) against the KPNO International Spectroscopic Survey.
HG031203 is a metal poor, actively star forming galaxy (star formation rate of
12.9+/-2.2 {M_{sun} yr^-1) at z=0.1054. From the emission-line analysis we
derive an intrinsic reddening E_{HG}(B-V)\approx 0.4. This parameter doesn't
show a compelling evidence of evolution at a month time-scale. We find an
interstellar medium temperature of 12500 K and an electronic density of
N_{e}=160 cm^-3. After investigating for possible Wolf-Rayet emission features
in our spectra, we consider dubious the classification of HG031203 as a
Wolf-Rayet galaxy. Long gamma-ray burst (LGRB) and supernova hosts in the local
universe (z<0.2) show, on average, specific star formation rates higher than
ordinary star forming galaxy at the same redshift. On the other hand, we find
that half of the hosts follows the metallicity-luminosity relation found for
star-burst galaxies; HG031203 is a clear outlier, with its really low
metallicity (12+\log{{O/H}}=8.12+/-0.04).

ghost mode in de Sitter background cannot possess a de Sitter invariant vacuum
state. In order to avoid a negative norm state, we must associate the creation
operator of the ghost mode with a negative-energy mode function instead of a
positive-energy one as the mode function. Namely, we have to adopt a different
procedure of quantization for a ghost. When a theory has a symmetry mixing a
ghost mode with ordinary non-ghost modes, the choice of a ghost mode is not
unique. However, quantization of a ghost is impossible without specifying a
choice of ghost mode, which breaks the symmetry. For this reason, the vacuum
state cannot respect the symmetry. In the massive gravity theory with a
graviton ghost mode in de Sitter background, the ghost is the helicity-0 mode
of the graviton. This ghost mode is mixed with the other helicity graviton
modes under the action of de Sitter symmetry. Therefore, there is no de Sitter
invariant vacuum in such models. This leads to an interesting possibility that
non-covariant cutoff of the low energy effective theory may naturally arise. As
a result, the instability due to the pair production of a ghost and normal
non-ghost particles gets much milder and that the model may escape from being
rejected.

original auction, draw traffic, and run their own sub-auctions. The quality of
the additional capacity provided by a mediator is measured by its {\it fitness}
factor. We compute revenues and payoffs for all the different parties at a {\it

a mechanism currently being used by Google and Yahoo!, and then compare these
numbers with those obtained at a corresponding SNE for the same mechanism, but
without any mediators involved in the auctions. Such calculations allow us to
determine the value of the additional capacity. Our results show that the
revenue of the auctioneer, as well as the social value (i.e. efficiency),
always increase when mediators are involved; moreover even the payoffs of {\em
all} the bidders will increase if the mediator has a high enough fitness. Thus,
our analysis indicates that there are significant opportunities for

(at Re ~ 3300, Taylor Re ~ 790) and to a DNS. We derive the Karman-Howarth
equation for both the Clark-alpha and Leray-alpha models. We confirm one of two
possible scalings resulting from this equation for Clark as well as its
associated k^(-1) energy spectrum. At sub-filter scales, Clark-alpha possesses
similar total dissipation and characteristic time to reach a statistical
turbulent steady-state as Navier-Stokes, but exhibits greater intermittency. As
a SGS model, Clark reproduces the energy spectrum and intermittency properties
of the DNS. For the Leray model, increasing the filter width decreases the
nonlinearity and the effective Re is substantially decreased. Even for the
smallest value of alpha studied, Leray-alpha was inadequate as a SGS model. The
LANS energy spectrum k^1, consistent with its so-called ""rigid bodies,""
precludes a reproduction of the large-scale energy spectrum of the DNS at high
Re while achieving a large reduction in resolution. However, that this same
feature reduces its intermittency compared to Clark-alpha (which shares a
similar Karman-Howarth equation). Clark is found to be the best approximation
for reproducing the total dissipation rate and the energy spectrum at scales
larger than alpha, whereas high-order intermittency properties for larger
values of alpha are best reproduced by LANS-alpha.

around young stellar objects is predicted to vary greatly with far-UV and X-ray
irradiation by the central star. Aim We search for molecular tracers of

The Submillimeter Array (SMA) has observed the high-mass star forming region
AFGL 2591 in lines of CS, SO, HCN, HCN(v2=1), and HC15N with 0.6"" resolution at
350 GHz probing radial scales of 600-3500 AU for an assumed distance of 1 kpc.
The SMA observations are compared with the predictions of a chemical model
fitted to previous single-dish observations. RESULTS: The CS and SO main peaks
are extended in space at the FWHM level, as predicted in the model assuming
protostellar X-rays. However, the main peak sizes are found smaller than
modeled by nearly a factor of 2. On the other hand, the lines of CS, HCN, and
HC15N, but not SO and HCN(v2=1), show pedestal emissions at radii of about 3500
AU that are not predicted. All lines except SO show a secondary peak within the
approaching outflow cone. A dip or null in the visibilities caused by a sharp
decrease in abundance with increasing radius is not observed in CS and only
tentatively in SO. CONCLUSIONS: The emission of protostellar X-rays is
supported by the good fit of the modeled SO and CS amplitude visibilities
including an extended main peak in CS. The broad pedestals can be interpreted
by far-UV irradiation in a spherically non-symmetric geometry, possibly
comprising outflow walls on scales of 3500 -- 7000 AU. The extended CS and SO
main peaks suggest sulfur evaporation near the 100 K temperature radius.

diversity in ecosystems is promoted by cyclic, non-hierarchical interactions
among competing populations. Such non-transitive relations lead to an evolution
with central features represented by the `rock-paper-scissors' game, where rock
crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper wraps rock. In combination with
spatial dispersal of static populations, this type of competition results in
the stable coexistence of all species and the long-term maintenance of
biodiversity. However, population mobility is a central feature of real
ecosystems: animals migrate, bacteria run and tumble. Here, we observe a
critical influence of mobility on species diversity. When mobility exceeds a
certain value, biodiversity is jeopardized and lost. In contrast, below this
critical threshold all subpopulations coexist and an entanglement of travelling
spiral waves forms in the course of temporal evolution. We establish that this
phenomenon is robust, it does not depend on the details of cyclic competition
or spatial environment. These findings have important implications for
maintenance and evolution of ecological systems and are relevant for the
formation and propagation of patterns in excitable media, such as chemical
kinetics or epidemic outbreaks.

representations that aggregate the relationships at discrete intervals.
However, such an aggregation discards important temporal information, thus
inhibiting our understanding of the networks dynamic behaviour and evolution.
We have recorded patterns of human urban encounter using Bluetooth technology
thus retaining the temporal properties of this network. Here we show how this
temporal information influences the structural properties of the network. We
show that the temporal properties of human urban encounter are scale-free,
leading to an overwhelming proportion of brief encounters between individuals.
While previous research has shown preferential attachment to result in
scale-free connectivity in aggregated network data, we found that scale-free
connectivity results from the temporal properties of the network. In addition,
we show that brief encounters act as weak social ties in the diffusion of
non-expiring information, yet persistent encounters provide the means for
sustaining time-expiring information through a network.

structures of the standard model (SM) particles when they couple to

distinguish flavor generations. At the $\Lambda_{\UP}$ scale, $\BZ$ operators
and charges are matched onto unparticle operators and charges, respectively. In
this scenario, we find that tree flavor changing neutral currents (FCNCs) can
be induced by the rediagonalizations of the SM fermions. As an illustration, we
employ the Fritzsch ansatz to the SM fermion mass matrices and we find that the
FCNC effects could be simplified to be associated with the mass ratios denoted
by $\sqrt{m_{i}m_{j}/m^2_{3}}$, where $m_3$ is the mass of the heaviest
particle in each type of fermion generations and $i, j$ are the flavor indices.
In addition, we show that there is no new CP violating phase beside the unique
one in the CKM matrix. We use $\bar B_{q}\to \ell^{+} \ell^{-}$ as examples to
display the new FCNC effects. In particular, we demonstrate that the direct CP
asymmetries in the decays can be $O(10%)$ due to the peculiar CP conserving
phase in the unparticle propagator.

  Formation and Evolution of Galaxy Bulges",,"10.1017/S1743921308017274",,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate the hierarchical build-up of stars in bulges within the
standard $\Lambda$-cold dark matter scenario. By separating the population into
stars born during starbursts that accompany the formation of spheroids in major
mergers ({\it starburst} component), and stars that are previously formed in
discs of progenitor galaxies ({\it quiescent} component) and added to the
spheroid by dynamical interaction. Our results are summarised as follows:
bulges that form early have larger starburst fraction and hence should be
smaller than their counter parts that form later. The quiescent fraction in
bulges is an increasing function of bulge mass, becoming constant at
$M_{\rm{q}}/M_{\rm{bul}} \sim 0.8$, mainly due to the infall of satellite
galaxies that contribute disc stars to the bulge. Minor mergers are an order of
magnitude more frequent than major mergers and must play a significant role in
the evolution of bulges. Above the critical mass $M_{\rm{c}}\sim 3 \times
10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ most of the stars in the universe are in spheroids, which
at high redshift are exclusively elliptical galaxies and at low redshifts
partly bulges. Due to the enhanced evolution of galaxies ending up in high
density environments, the starburst fraction and the surface mass densities of
bulges below $M_{\rm{c}}$ should be enhanced with respect to field galaxies.
Dissipation during the formation of massive bulges in present day early-type
spirals is less important than for the formation of present day elliptical
galaxies of the same mass thereby explaining the possible difference in
phase-space densities between spiral galaxies and elliptical galaxies.

string compactifications that are called monodrofolds or T-folds in recent

the models from a microscopic world-sheet perspective. In these backgrounds
there are two kinds of D-branes that are analogous to bulk and fractional
branes in standard orbifold models. The bulk D-branes in T-folds allow
intuitive geometrical interpretations and are consistent with the classical
analysis based on the doubled torus formalism. The fractional branes, on the
other hand, are `non-geometric' at any point in the moduli space and their
geometric counterparts seem to be missing in the doubled torus analysis. We
compute cylinder amplitudes between the bulk and fractional branes, and find
that the lightest modes of the open string spectra show intriguing non-linear
dependence on the moduli (location of the brane or value of the Wilson line),
suggesting that the physics of T-folds, when D-branes are involved, could
deviate from geometric backgrounds even at low energies. We also extend our
analysis to the models with SU(2) WZW fibre at arbitrary levels.

is performed individually at each OFDM sub-carrier possibly interfered by the

fields, at the origin of their distortion, regardless of the occurrence of
non-linear coupling, is considered. It is shown that the distortion mechanism
can be regarded as mixing process and hence, standard ""phase mixing""
corresponds to the effect of an ""Alfvenic"" shear flow while enhanced
dissipation at a magnetic X-point corresponds to mixing by an ""Alfvenic"" strain
flow. The evolution of the global wave field is supposed to result from the
dynamics of a superposition of wave packets and a kinetic equation for the wave
energy is obtained following this eikonal (WKB) description. Since shear Alfven
wave packets experience continuous shearing/straining while transported by an
inhomogeneous Alfvenic flow $\mathbf{V}_{A}$, their mixing process, in physical
space, is also a cascade of wave energy in k-space. The wave energy spectrum
resulting from this linear mechanism of energy transfer is determined for the
special case of waves propagating along chaotic magnetic field lines, the
analog of a chaotic mixing process. The latter follows a $k^{-1}$ power-law, in
the energy conserving range in $k$ space.

Following the pioneering work of Banks, Bender and Wu, we describe quantum
field theory in terms of infinite dimensional quantum mechanics and utilize the
``Most probable escape path'' (MPEP) as the class of paths which dominate the
path integral in the classically forbidden region. Considering a 1+1
dimensional field theory example we show that there are five conditions that
any associated bound state in the classically allowed region must satisfy if
resonant tunnelling is to occur, and we then proceed to show that it is
impossible to satisfy all five conditions simultaneously.

pattern of chiral symmetry breaking : in particular large differences can occur
between the chiral limits of two and three massless flavours (i.e., whether
$m_s$ is kept at its physical value or sent to zero). We recall some
indications of such a scenario in QCD, in relation with the peculiar dynamics
of the scalar sector. We explain how this could affect the convergence of
three-flavour chiral series, commonly used to extrapolate the results of
lattice simulations. Finally, we indicate how lattice simulations with three
dynamical flavours could unveil such an effect through the quark-mass
dependence of light meson masses and decay constants.

phosphosilicate glasses and in a bioabsorbable soda-lime phosphate glass during
thermal poling were studied by means of thermally stimulated depolarization
current measurements, ac impedance spectroscopy, and SEM/EDX analyses. The
thermal poling was done by sputtering thin Pt electrode films onto the faces of
the glass samples and by applying voltages up to 1 kV to the electrodes at
temperatures up to 513 K. The poling leads to the formation of interfacial
layers under the electrodes which are responsible for two depolarization
current peaks and for one additional semicircle in a Nyquist plot of the ac
impedance. The SEM/EDX profiles suggest that redox and transport processes of
Na+ ions are responsible for the formation of the interfacial layers and that
Ca2+ ions are immobile under the poling conditions. The sodium depletion layer
under the anode leads to a negative surface charge of the glass samples which
may enhance their bioactivity.
