these sources, a pulsar is an evident association, which is often located
within an extended region of the TeV gamma-ray emission. These particular HESS
sources are promising candidates for yet not resolved pulsar wind nebulae. Here
we have undertaken a systematic search for X-ray counterparts of the sources,
using the archival Chandra data, within the spatial bounds of the unidentified
HESS sources. A number of X-ray sources have been detected in the Chandra
fields. Two of them, CXOU J161729.3-505512 and CXOU J170252.4-412848, are of a
special interest because of their excellent positional coincidence with the
pulsars PSR J1617-5055 and PSR J1702-4128, respectively. The first source is
extended, with a bright core of 2.6 arcsec (FWHM) in radius but the emission
can be seen up to roughly 20 arcsec. The second one is much fainter and
detected only with marginal significance (4.6 sigma). It might also be slightly
extended, although the situation is quite uncertain due to very limited

anisotropic version of the two-channel Anderson model at a particular manifold
in the space of parameters of the theory, where we establish an equivalence
with a Fermi-Majorana bi-resonant level model. The correspondence is rigorously
proved by explicitly constructing the new fermionic fields and Klein factors in
terms of the original ones and showing that the commutation properties between
original and new Klein factors are of semionic type. We also demonstrate that
the fixed points associated to the solvable manifold are renormalization-group
stable and generic, and therefore representative of the physics of the original
model. The simplicity of the solution found, allows for the computation of the
full set of thermodynamic quantities. In particular, we compute the entropy,
occupation and magnetization of the impurity as functions of temperature, and
identify the different physical energy scales. In absence of external fields,

residual entropy indicates that the model approaches a universal line of fixed
points of non-Fermi liquid type. An external field, even if small, introduces a
third energy scale and causes the quenching of the impurity entropy to zero,
taking the system to a corresponding Fermi-liquid fixed point.

size of neutron skin in $^{208}Pb$ have constrained considerably the density
dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy and, in turn, the equation of state
of neutron-rich nucleonic matter. These constraints could provide useful
information about the global properties of rapidly rotating neutron stars.
Models of rapidly rotating neutron stars are constructed applying several
nucleonic equations of state. Particular emphasis is placed on configurations
rotating rigidly at $716$ and $1122Hz$. The range of allowed hydrostatic
equilibrium solutions is determined and tested for stability. The effect of
rotation on the internal composition and thermal properties of neutron stars is
also examined. At a given rotational frequency, each equation of state yields a
range of possible neutron stars configurations restricted by the Keplerian
(mass-shedding) limit, corresponding to the maximal circumferential radius, and
the limit due to the onset of instabilities with respect to axial-symmetric
perturbations, corresponding to the minimal equatorial radius of a stable
neutron star model. We show that the mass of a neutron star rotating uniformly
at $1122Hz$ is between $1.7$ and $2.1M_{\sun}$. Central stellar density and
proton fraction decrease with increasing rotational frequency with respect to
static models, and depending on the exact stellar mass and angular velocity,
can drop below the Direct Urca threshold thus closing the fast cooling channel.

the form of XH3+ complexes (with X = argon, krypton or xenon) in gas phase

form very stable structures in the gas phase and that their binding energies
are much higher than those involved in the structures of X-H2O hydrates or pure

xenon are likely to remain sequestrated in the form of XH3+ complexes embedded
in the gas phase rather than forming ices during the cooling of protoplanetary
disks. The amount of the deficiency depends on how much H3+ is available and
efficient in capturing noble gases. In the dense gas of the mid-plane of solar
nebula, H3+ is formed by the ionization of H2 from energetic particles, as
those in cosmic rays or those ejected by the young Sun. Even using the largest
estimate of the cosmic rays ionization rate, we compute that the H3+ abundance
is two and three orders of magnitude lower than the xenon and krypton
abundance, respectively. Estimating the ionization induced by the young Sun, on
the other hand, is very uncertain but leaves the possibility to have enough H3+
to make krypton and xenon trapping efficent. Finally, additional source of H3+
formation may be provided by the presence of a nearby supernova, as discussed
in the literature. Recent solar system observations show a deficiency of Ar,
and, even more, of Kr and Xe in Titan and in comets. In this article, we
consider the possibility that this deficiency is caused by the afore-mentioned

breaks down spectacularly for antiferromagnets, particularly in low dimensions.

targets for indirect detection of dark matter. The boost factors, corresponding
to an enhancement of the signal and linked to the clumpiness properties of the
dark matter distribution, have been taken as high as thousands in the past. The
dramatic impact of these boost factors for indirect detection of antiparticles,
for instance with the PAMELA satellite or the coming AMS-02 experiment, asks
for their detailed calculation. We take into account the results of high
resolution N-body dark matter simulations to calculate the most likely energy
dependent boost factors linked to the cosmic ray propagation properties, for
anti-protons and positrons. Starting from the mass and space distributions of
sub-halos, the anti-proton and positron propagators are used to calculate the
mean value and the variance of the boost factor for the primary fluxes. We take
advantage of the statistical method introduced in Lavalle et al. (2007) and
cross-check the results with Monte Carlo computations. By spanning some extreme
configurations of sub-halo and propagation properties, we find that the average
contribution of the clumps is negligible compared to that of the smooth dark
matter component. Sub-halos do not lead to enhancement of the signals, unless
they are taken with some extreme (unexpected) properties. This result is
independent of the nature of the self-annihilating dark matter candidate
considered, and provides precise estimates of the theoretical and the
statistical uncertainties of the antimatter flux from dark matter
substructures. Spectral distortions can still be expected in antimatter flux
measurements, but scenarios invoking large and even mild clumpiness boost
factors are strongly disfavoured by our analysis.

significant difference in the properties of the environment as a function of
the orientation to the line of sight of the radio jet. This is in agreement
with unification schemes. Our results have important implications for cluster
surveys, as clusters around powerful radio sources tend to be excluded from
X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich surveys of galaxy clusters, and thus can introduce
an important bias in the cluster luminosity function. Most of the radio sources
are found close to pressure balance with the environment in which they lie, but
the two low-excitation radio galaxies of the sample are observed to be
under-pressured. This may be the first observational indication for the
presence of non-radiative particles in the lobes of some powerful radio
galaxies. We find that the clusters around radio sources in the redshift range

spectral chemometrics often renders the prediction of a dependent variable
uneasy. The number of variables hopefully can be reduced, by using either
projection techniques or selection methods; the latter allow for the
interpretation of the selected variables. Since the optimal approach of testing
all possible subsets of variables with the prediction model is intractable, an
incremental selection approach using a nonparametric statistics is a good
option, as it avoids the computationally intensive use of the model itself. It
has two drawbacks however: the number of groups of variables to test is still
huge, and colinearities can make the results unstable. To overcome these
limitations, this paper presents a method to select groups of spectral
variables. It consists in a forward-backward procedure applied to the
coefficients of a B-Spline representation of the spectra. The criterion used in
the forward-backward procedure is the mutual information, allowing to find
nonlinear dependencies between variables, on the contrary of the generally used
correlation. The spline representation is used to get interpretability of the
results, as groups of consecutive spectral variables will be selected. The
experiments conducted on NIR spectra from fescue grass and diesel fuels show
that the method provides clearly identified groups of selected variables,
making interpretation easy, while keeping a low computational load. The
prediction performances obtained using the selected coefficients are higher
than those obtained by the same method applied directly to the original
variables and similar to those obtained using traditional models, although
using significantly less spectral variables.

strategy offers a good trade-off between optimality of the selected feature
subset and computation time. However, it requires to set the parameter(s) of
the mutual information estimator and to determine when to halt the forward
procedure. These two choices are difficult to make because, as the
dimensionality of the subset increases, the estimation of the mutual
information becomes less and less reliable. This paper proposes to use
resampling methods, a K-fold cross-validation and the permutation test, to
address both issues. The resampling methods bring information about the
variance of the estimator, information which can then be used to automatically
set the parameter and to calculate a threshold to stop the forward procedure.
The procedure is illustrated on a synthetic dataset as well as on real-world
examples.

to functional data, for example spectra, temporal series, spatio-temporal
images, gesture recognition data, etc. Functional data are rarely known in
practice; usually a regular or irregular sampling is known. For this reason,
some processing is needed in order to benefit from the smooth character of
functional data in the analysis methods. This paper shows how to extend the
Radial-Basis Function Networks (RBFN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models
to functional data inputs, in particular when the latter are known through
lists of input-output pairs. Various possibilities for functional processing
are discussed, including the projection on smooth bases, Functional Principal
Component Analysis, functional centering and reduction, and the use of
differential operators. It is shown how to incorporate these functional
processing into the RBFN and MLP models. The functional approach is illustrated
on a benchmark of spectrometric data analysis.

We obtain consistency results which imply that the estimation of optimal

simulated and real world data that the proposed model performs in a very

  Journal","ApJ, 2007, 671, 1297","10.1086/522923",,"astro-ph",,"  We present spectra of a large sample of low-metallicity blue compact dwarf
galaxies which exhibit broad components in their strong emission lines, mainly
in Hbeta, [O III]4959, 5007 and Halpha. Twenty-three spectra have been obtained
with the MMT, 14 of which show broad emission. The remaining 21 spectra with
broad emission have been selected from the Data Release 5 of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey. The most plausible origin of broad line emission is the evolution
of massive stars and their interaction with the circumstellar and interstellar
medium. The broad emission with the lowest H$\alpha$ luminosities (10^36 -
10^39 erg/s) is likely produced in circumstellar envelopes around hot Ofp/WN9
and/or LBV stars. The broad emission with the highest Halpha luminosities
(10^40 - 10^42 erg/s) probably arises from type IIp or type IIn supernovae
(SNe). It can also come from active galactic nuclei (AGN) containing
intermediate-mass black holes, although we find no strong evidence for hard
non-thermal radiation in our sample galaxies. The oxygen abundance in the host
galaxies with SN candidates is low and varies in the range 12 + log O/H = 7.36
- 8.31. However, type IIn SN / AGN candidates are found only in galaxies with
12 + log O/H < 7.99. Spectroscopic monitoring of these type IIn SN / AGN
candidates over a time scale of several years is necessary to distinguish
between the two possibilities.

collimated jets can heat the ICM at large scale, and very little is known
concerning the effect of radio lobe expansion as they enter into pressure
equilibrium with the surrounding cluster gas. Cygnus A is one of the best
examples of a nearby powerful radio galaxy for which the synchrotron emitting
plasma and thermal emitting intra-cluster medium can be mapped in fine detail,
and previous observations have inferred possible shock structure at the
location of the cocoon. We use new XMM-Newton observations of Cygnus A, in
combination with deep Chandra observations, to measure the temperature of the
intra-cluster medium around the expanding radio cavities. We investigate how
inflation of the cavities may relate to shock heating of the intra-cluster gas,
and whether such a mechanism is sufficient to provide enough energy to offset
cooling to the extent observed.
