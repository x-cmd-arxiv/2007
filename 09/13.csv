determining the two parameters defining a black hole: mass and spin. I briefly
review here some of the physical processes that are conducive to the evolution

processes that are likely to place at early cosmic epochs, and how massive
black hole evolve in a hierarchical Universe. The mass of the black holes that
we detect today in nearby galaxy has mostly been accumulated by accretion of
gas. While black hole--black hole mergers do not contribute substantially to
the final mass of massive black holes, they influence the occupancy of galaxy
centers by black hole, owing to the chance of merging black holes being kicked
from their dwellings due to the gravitational recoil. Similarly, accretion
leaves a deeper imprint on the distribution of black hole spins than black hole
mergers do. The differences in accretion histories for black holes hosted in
elliptical or disc galaxies may reflect on different spin distributions.

First, we perform calculations for the vacuum initial state. In the obtained

separate the contributions due to particle creation, vacuum polarization, and
the contributions due to the work of the external field on the particles at the

regimes of weak and strong fields and low and high temperatures. The obtained
results allow us to establish restrictions on the electric field and its
duration under which QED with a strong constant electric field is consistent.
Under such restrictions, one can neglect the back-reaction of particles created
by the electric field. Some of the obtained results generalize the calculations

decrease and growth of entropy against the direction of effective gravitational
acceleration $g_{eff}$ give rise to growing surface gravity modes which are
stable with the same parameters in the case of homoentropic flow. At the same

showed also that growing internal gravity modes appear only in the flow
unstable to axisymmetric perturbations. At last, the analysis of boundary

field changes the properties of the shock interface between the tenuous,
overpressured jet ($V^z_j$) flowing tangentially to a dense external medium.
Magnetic fields can lead to more efficient acceleration of the jet, in
comparison to the pure-hydrodynamic case. A ``poloidal'' magnetic field
($B^z$), tangent to the interface and parallel to the jet flow, produces both a
stronger outward moving shock and a stronger inward moving rarefaction wave.
This leads to a large velocity component normal to the interface in addition to
acceleration tangent to the interface, and the jet is thus accelerated to
larger Lorentz factors than those obtained in the pure-hydrodynamic case.
Likewise, a strong ``toroidal'' magnetic field ($B^y$), tangent to the
interface but perpendicular to the jet flow, also leads to stronger
acceleration tangent to the shock interface relative to the pure-hydrodynamic
case. Overall, the acceleration efficiency in the ``poloidal'' case is less
than that of the ``toroidal'' case but both geometries still result in higher
Lorentz factors than the pure-hydrodynamic case. Thus, the presence and
relative orientation of a magnetic field in relativistic jets can significant
modify the hydrodynamic boost mechanism studied by Aloy & Rezzolla (2006).

shortest radio lobe, the gas covering factor is higher, and the ionization
parameter is lower. The contrasts in environmental density required to explain
the asymmetries in the line brightness and the radio arm-length asymmetries are
in fair agreement with each other. These results add further weight to the
conclusion of McCarthy, van Breugel & Kapahi (1991) - lobe distance asymmetries
in powerful radio sources are the result of an asymmetry in the environmental
density.
  We also note that the brightness of both the UV and optical continuum
emission shows a similar spatial asymmetry to that shown by the line emission.
While the UV continuum asymmetry can be wholly explained by the expected
asymmetry in the nebular continuum, the optical continuum asymmetry cannot. We
argue that, at least at optical wavelengths, the starlight and/or the scattered
light must also be strongly spatially asymmetric.

tensor $\epeff$ of electromagnetic waves propagating in a two-phase composite
random medium with isotropic components explicitly in terms of certain
integrals over the $n$-point correlation functions of the medium. Our focus is
the long-wavelength regime, i.e., when the wavelength is much larger than the
scale of inhomogeneities in the medium. Lower-order truncations of these
expansions lead to approximations for the effective dielectric constant that
depend upon whether the medium is below or above the percolation threshold. In
particular, we apply two- and three-point approximations for $\epeff$ to a
variety of different three-dimensional model microstructures, including
dispersions of hard spheres, hard oriented spheroids and fully penetrable
spheres as well as Debye random media, the random checkerboard, and
power-law-correlated materials. We demonstrate the importance of employing
$n$-point correlation functions of order higher than two for high
dielectric-phase-contrast ratio. We show that disorder in the microstructure
results in an imaginary component of the effective dielectric tensor that is
directly related to the {\it coarseness} of the composite, i.e., local
volume-fraction fluctuations for infinitely large windows. The source of this
imaginary component is the attenuation of the coherent homogenized wave due to
scattering. We also remark on whether there is such attenuation in the case of
a two-phase medium with a quasiperiodic structure.

the existence of radiation -and matter- dominated earlier stages of cosmic

the case of pure axion-dilaton gravity. During the matter dominated epoch the
scalar fields remain either frozen, due to the large expansion rate, or enter a
cosmological scaling regime. In both cases, oscillations of the effective
equation of state around the acceleration boundary value are impossible. Models
which enter an oscillatory stage in the low redshift regime, on the other hand,
are disfavored by observations. We also comment on the viability of the
axion-dilaton system as a candidate for dynamical dark energy. In a certain

number of Re~1300. The forcing is given by the Taylor-Green flow, which shares
similarities with the flow in several laboratory experiments, and the
computation is run for ten turnover times in the turbulent steady state. At
this Reynolds number the anisotropic large scale flow pattern, the inertial
range, the bottleneck, and the dissipative range are clearly visible, thus
providing a good test case for the study of turbulence as it appears in nature.
Triadic interactions, the locality of energy fluxes, and structure functions of
the velocity increments are computed. A comparison with runs at lower Reynolds
numbers is performed, and shows the emergence of scaling laws for the relative
amplitude of local and non-local interactions in spectral space. The scalings
of the Kolmogorov constant, and of skewness and flatness of velocity
increments, performed as well and are consistent with previous experimental
results. Furthermore, the accumulation of energy in the small-scales associated
with the bottleneck seems to occur on a span of wavenumbers that is independent

it. Finally, intermittency exponents seem to depart from standard models at
high Re, leaving the interpretation of intermittency an open problem.

technique based on the Einstein-Langevin equation can, however, deal naturally
with the perturbations of the scalar field even beyond the linear

from the binned data. The results obtained here reconfirm and sharpen the
conclusion drawn from our previous analysis of the WMAP 1st year data. A sharp
cut off around the horizon scale and a bump after the horizon scale seem to be
a common feature for all of these reconstructed primordial spectra. We have
shown that although the WMAP 3 year data prefers a lower value of matter
density for a power law form of the primordial spectrum, for a free form of the
spectrum, we can get a very good likelihood to the data for higher values of
matter density. We have also shown that even a flat CDM model, allowing a free
form of the primordial spectrum, can give a very high likelihood fit to the
data. Theoretical interpretation of the results is open to the cosmology
community. However, this work provides strong evidence that the data retains
discriminatory power in the cosmological parameter space even when there is
full freedom in choosing the primordial spectrum.

assumed to be still located just outside the progenitor star. Only a small
fraction of the expected mass is sufficient to efficiently decelerate the
fireball, leading to dissipation of most of its kinetic energy. Since the
scattering optical depths are still large at distances comparable to the
progenitor radius, the dissipated energy is trapped in the system, accelerating
it to relativistic velocities. The process resembles the birth of another
fireball at radii R~1e11 cm, not far from the transparency radius, and with a
starting bulk Lorentz factors Gamma_c~10. As seen in the observer frame, this

  Rapid Image Reconstruction",,,,,"q-bio.NC",,"  Over the brief time intervals available for processing retinal output,
roughly 50 to 300 msec, the number of extra spikes generated by individual
ganglion cells can be quite variable. Here, computer-generated spike trains
were used to investigate how signal/noise might be improved by utilizing
spatiotemporal correlations among retinal neurons responding to large,
contiguous stimuli. Realistic correlations were produced by modulating the
instantaneous firing probabilities of all stimulated neurons by a common
oscillatory input whose amplitude and temporal structure were consistent with
experimentally measured field potentials and correlograms. Whereas previous
studies have typically measured synergy between pairs of ganglion cells
examined one at a time, or alternatively have employed optimized linear filters
to decode activity across larger populations, the present study investigated a
distributed, non-linear encoding strategy by using Principal Components
Analysis (PCA) to reconstruct simple visual stimuli from up to one million
oscillatory pairwise correlations extracted on single trials from
massively-parallel spike trains as short as 25 msec in duration. By integrating
signals across retinal neighborhoods commensurate in size to classical
antagonistic surrounds, the first principal component of the pairwise
correlation matrix yielded dramatic improvements in signal/noise without
sacrificing fine spatial detail. These results demonstrate how local intensity
information can distributed across hundreds of neurons linked by a common,
stimulus-dependent oscillatory modulation, a strategy that might have evolved
to minimize the number of spikes required to support rapid image
reconstruction.

important role in learning and have inspired both theory and the design of
numerous machine learning algorithms. The new aspect in this paper is a focus
on integrating feedback from the learner. A quantitative approach to
interactive learning and adaptive behavior is proposed, integrating model- and
decision-making into one theoretical framework. This paper follows simple
principles by requiring that the observer's world model and action policy
should result in maximal predictive power at minimal complexity. Classes of
optimal action policies and of optimal models are derived from an objective
function that reflects this trade-off between prediction and complexity. The
resulting optimal models then summarize, at different levels of abstraction,
the process's causal organization in the presence of the learner's actions. A
fundamental consequence of the proposed principle is that the learner's optimal
action policies balance exploration and control as an emerging property.
Interestingly, the explorative component is present in the absence of policy
randomness, i.e. in the optimal deterministic behavior. This is a direct result
of requiring maximal predictive power in the presence of feedback.

For all clusters, we provide X-ray luminosities and temperatures as well as
masses. The cluster distribution peaks around z=0.3 and T =1.5 keV, half of the
objects being groups with a temperature below 2 keV. Our L-T(z) relation points
toward self-similar evolution, but does not exclude other physically plausible
models. Assuming that cluster scaling laws follow self-similar evolution, our
number density estimates up to z=1 are compatible with the predictions of the
concordance cosmology and with the findings of previous ROSAT surveys. Our well
monitored selection function allowed us to demonstrate that the inclusion of
selection effects is essential for the correct determination of the evolution
of the L-T relation, which may explain the contradictory results from previous
studies. Extensive simulations show that extending the survey area to 10deg2
has the potential to exclude the non-evolution hypothesis, but that constraints
on more refined ICM models will probably be limited by the large intrinsic
dispersion of the L-T relation. We further demonstrate that increasing the
dispersion in the scaling laws increases the number of detectable clusters,
hence generating further degeneracy [in addition to sigma8, Omega_m, L(M,z) and
T(M,z)] in the cosmological interpretation of the cluster number counts. We

inflation with the conformally coupled, rapidly rolling inflaton is yet
possible with N=37 efoldings, which requires low energy scales 1-100 TeV of

developed a method to optimise the parameters estimation based on genetic
algorithms (GA). This paper is dedicated to describe the implementation of the
new code, which has been applied for Herbig stars from the Pico dos Dias Survey
catalogue, in order to illustrate the quality of the fitting for a variety of
SED shapes. The star AB Aur was used as a test of the GA parameters estimation,
demonstrating that the new code reproduces successfully a canonical example of
the flared disc model. The GA method gives good quality of fittings, but the
range of input parameters must be chosen with caution, since unrealistic disc
parameters can be derived. The flared disc model is confirmed to fit the
flattened SEDs typical from Herbig stars, however the embedded objects
(increasing SED slope) and debris discs (steeper SED) are not well fitted with
this configuration. Even considering the limitation of the derived parameters,
the automatic process of SED fitting provides an interesting tool for the
statistical analysis of the circumstellar luminosity of large samples of young

stronger and flatter than that in the soft (0.2-0.5keV) band. Based on a short

the reprocessed hard X-ray emission. The high resolution spectrum of Akn564
obtained with the RGS shows evidence for a highly ionized and another weakly
ionized warm absorber medium. The smeared wind and blurred ionized reflection
models do not describe the pn data adequately. The spectrum is consistent with
a complex model consisting of optically thick Comptonization in a cool plasma

extreme parameters. The data suggest two component corona -- a cool, optically

The existence of a break in the soft band PDS suggests a compact cool corona
that can either be an ionized surface of the inner disk or an inner optically
thick region coupled to a truncated disk.

a rarely observed, but theoretically expected, double-source structure in the

nonthermal, while the emission at lower energies in the outer region is
primarily thermal. The two sources are both visible for about 12 minutes and

turbulence and/or particles from the reconnection site can be the source of the
observed radiation. The spatially resolved thermal emission below about 15 keV,
on the other hand, indicates that the lower source has a larger emission
measure but a lower temperature than the upper source. This is likely the
result of the differences in the magnetic field and plasma density of the two

Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd and Eu. For an
analysis with the known color-magnitude diagram (cmd) for 47 Tuc we obtain a

in good agreement with the mean of 5 recent high resolution abundance studies,
at -0.70 dex. Typical random errors on our mean [X/Fe] ratios are 0.07-0.10
dex, similar to studies of individual stars in 47 Tuc, although Na and Al
appear enhanced, perhaps due to proton burning in the most luminous cluster
stars. Our IL abundance analysis with an unknown cmd employed theoretical
Teramo isochrones; however, we apply zero-point abundance corrections to
account for the factor of 3 underprediction of stars at the AGB bump
luminosity. While line diagnostics alone provide only mild constraints on the
cluster age (ruling-out ages younger than ~2 Gyr), when theoretical IL B-V
colors are combined with metallicity derived from the Fe I lines, the age is
constrained to 10--15 Gyr and we obtain [Fe/H]=-0.70 +/-0.021 +/-0.052 dex. We
find that Fe I line diagnostics may also be used to constrain the horizontal
branch morphology of an unresolved cluster. Lastly, our spectrum synthesis of
5.4 million TiO lines indicates that the 7300-7600A TiO window should be useful

the anisotropies required to fit the los velocity dispersions are remarkably

and positivity of the distribution function is satisfied.

amount of data. Extracting scientific knowledge from these data will
increasingly demand both efficient algorithms as well as the power of parallel
computers. Nearly all efficient analyses of large astronomical datasets use
trees as their fundamental data structure. Writing efficient tree-based
techniques, a task that is time-consuming even on single-processor computers,
is exceedingly cumbersome on massively parallel platforms (MPPs). Most
applications that run on MPPs are simulation codes, since the expense of
developing them is offset by the fact that they will be used for many years by
many researchers. In contrast, data analysis codes change far more rapidly, are
often unique to individual researchers, and therefore accommodate little reuse.
Consequently, the economics of the current high-performance computing
development paradigm for MPPs does not favor data analysis applications. We
have therefore built a library, called Ntropy, that provides a flexible,
extensible, and easy-to-use way of developing tree-based data analysis
algorithms for both serial and parallel platforms. Our experience has shown
that not only does our library save development time, it can also deliver
excellent serial performance and parallel scalability. Furthermore, Ntropy
makes it easy for an astronomer with little or no parallel programming
experience to quickly scale their application to a distributed multiprocessor
environment. By minimizing development time for efficient and scalable data
analysis, we enable wide-scale knowledge discovery on massive datasets.

simulations by considering three different models for the ISM. Our first model
included only radiative cooling down to 300 K, our second model added an
additional background heating term due to photoelectric heating, and our third
model uses an isothermal equation of state with a temperature of 10^4 K and no
explicit heating or cooling. Two common prescriptions for star formation are
implemented in each case. The first is based on cosmological simulations with a
low threshold for star formation but also a low efficiency. The second assumes
stars form only in high density regions but with a higher efficiency. We also
explore the effects of including feedback from type II supernovae. We find that
the different ISM types produce marked differences in the structure of the disk
and temperature phases present in the gas, although inclusion of feedback
largely dominates these effects. In particular, size of the star-forming clumps
was increased both by background heating and by enforcing an isothermal ISM. We
also looked at the one dimensional profiles and found that a lognormal PDF
provides a good fit for all our simulations over several orders of magnitude in
density. Overall, despite noticeable structural differences, the star formation
properties in the disk are largely insensitive to ISM type and agree reasonably
well with observations.

negligible, we discuss the sensitivities to NSI and the simultaneous
determination of \theta_{13} and \delta by examining the effects in the
neutrino propagation of various systems in which two NSI parameters

spectra, especially if photon sources lie in the deepest parts of the

We use the spectrum of the hard X-ray background in order to constrain the
prevalence of such reflection-dominated sources. We first emphasize the need
for reflection and explore the broad-band properties of realistic spectra that
incorporate light bending. We then use these spectra, in conjunction with the
observed 2-10 keV AGN distribution, evolutionary and obscuration functions in
order to predict the hard X-ray background spectrum over 3-100 keV, and provide
limits on the fraction of reflection-dominated objects, dependent on the height
of the photon sources. Our results allow for a cosmologically-significant
fraction of sources that incorporate strong light bending. The luminosity
function based on intrinsic flare luminosities is derived and implications
discussed. We discuss prospects for future hard X-ray missions such as NeXT and

Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) observed with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array (ATCA) and the Parkes Telescope. The mosaic covers 10.8 x 12.3 square
degrees with an angular resolution of 40"", corresponding to a spatial scale of
10pc in the LMC. The final image is suitable for studying emission on all
scales between 40"" and the surveyed area. In this paper, we discuss i) the
characteristics of the LMC's diffuse and compact radio continuum emission, ii)
the fraction of the emission produced by thermal processes and the implied star
formation rate in the LMC, and iii) variations in the radio spectral index
across the LMC. Two non-standard reduction techniques that we used to process
the ATCA visibility data may be of interest for future wide-field radio
continuum surveys. The data are open to the astronomical community and should
be a rich resource for studies of individual objects such as supernova
remnants, HII regions and planetary nebulae, as well as extended features such
as the diffuse emission from synchrotron radiation.

stellar systems. This is possible because in the geometry of planetary binary
systems where the planet orbits one of the binary component and the other
binary star is located at a large distance, both planet and secondary companion
produce perturbations at a common region around the planet-hosting binary star
and thus the signatures of both planet and binary companion can be detected in
the light curves of high-magnification lensing events. We find that identifying
planets in binary systems is optimized when the secondary is located in a
certain range which depends on the type of the planet. The proposed method can
detect planets with masses down to one tenth of the Jupiter mass in binaries
with separations <~ 100 AU. These ranges of planet mass and binary separation
are not covered by other methods and thus microlensing would be able to make
the planetary binary sample richer.

on the tidal-flexure frequency. For example, Gerstenkorn (1955), MacDonald
(1964), and Kaula (1964) assumed constancy of the geometric lag angle, while
Singer (1968) and Mignard (1979, 1980) asserted constancy of the time lag.
Thus, each of these two models was based on a certain law of scaling of the
geometric lag.
  The actual dependence of the geometric lag on the frequency is more
complicated and is determined by the rheology of the planet. Besides, each
particular functional form of this dependence will unambiguously fix the
appropriate form of the frequency dependence of the tidal quality factor, Q.
Since at present we know the shape of the dependence of Q upon the frequency,
we can reverse our line of reasoning and single out the appropriate actual
frequency-dependence of the angular lag. This dependence turns out to be
different from those employed hitherto, and it entails considerable alterations
in the time scales of the tide-generated dynamical evolution. Phobos' fall on
Mars is an example we consider.

analyse the soliton-like nature of these solitary-waves, a particle analogy for
the solitary-waves is formulated. Exact soliton solutions exist in the absence
of an external trapping potential, which behave in a particle-like manner, and
we find the particle analogy we employ to be a good model also when a harmonic
trapping potential is present. In the case of two solitons, the particle model
is integrable, and the dynamics are completely regular. The extension to three
particles supports chaotic regimes. The agreement between the particle model
and the wave dynamics remains good even in chaotic regimes. In the case of a
system of two solitary waves of equal norm, the solitons are shown to retain
their phase difference for repeated collisions. This implies that soliton-like
regimes may be found in 3D geometries where solitary waves can be made to
repeatedly collide out of phase, stabilising the condensate against collapse.

diagrams (RPD) is analysed. Seismic models are computed considering rotation
effects on both equilibrium models and adiabatic oscillation frequencies
(including second-order near-degeneracy effects). Contamination of coupled
modes and coupling strength on the first radial modes are studied in detail.
Analysis of relative intrinsic amplitudes of near-degenerate modes reveals that
the identity of the fundamental radial mode and its coupled quadrupole pair are
almost unaltered once near-degeneracy effects are considered. However, for the
first overtone, a mixed radial/quadrupole identity is always predicted. The
effect of near-degeneracy on the oscillation frequencies becomes critical for
rotational velocities larger than 15-20 km/s, for which large wriggles in the
evolution of the period ratios are obtained (up $10^{-2}$). Such wriggles imply
uncertainties, in terms of metallicity determinations using RPD, reaching up to
0.50 dex, which can be critical for Pop. I HADS (High Amplitude \dss). In terms
of mass determinations, uncertainties reaching up to 0.5 M_sun are predicted.
The location of such wriggles is found to be independent of metallicity and
rotational velocity, and governed mainly by the avoided-crossing phenomenon.

Complexity Science from a statistical mechanics approach. Ecology is concerned
with understanding how systems level properties emerge out of the multitude of

possess the prototypical characteristics of complex systems. We argue that
statistical mechanics is at present the best methodology available to obtain a
quantitative description of complex systems, and that ecology is in urgent need
of ``integrative'' approaches that are quantitative and non-stationary. We
describe examples where combining statistical mechanics and ecology has led to
improved ecological modelling and, at the same time, broadened the scope of

deuterium/hydrogen ratios (D/H) of several sources of water in the solar
system. The average D/H of carbonaceous chondrites (CC's) is known to be close
to the current D/H of the Earth's ocean, while those of comets and the solar
nebula are larger by about a factor of two and smaller by about a factor of
seven, respectively, than that of the Earth's ocean. Thus, the main source of
the Earth's ocean has been thought to be CC's or adequate mixing of comets and
the solar nebula. However, those conclusions are correct only if D/H of water
on the Earth has remained unchanged for the past 4.5 Gyr. In this paper, we
investigate evolution of D/H in the ocean in the case that the early Earth had
a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, the existence of which is predicted by recent
theories of planet formation no matter whether the nebula remains or not. Then
we show that D/H in the ocean increases by a factor of 2-9, which is caused by
the mass fractionation during atmospheric hydrogen loss, followed by deuterium
exchange between hydrogen gas and water vapor during ocean formation. This
result suggests that the apparent similarity in D/H of water between CC's and
the current Earth's ocean does not necessarily support the CC's origin of water
and that the apparent discrepancy in D/H is not a good reason for excluding the
nebular origin of water.

do occur. A long-standing conjecture however asserts that when the candidate
degree is a prime number, a candidate cover is always realizable. In this paper
we analyze the question from the point of view of the geometry of 2-orbifolds,
and we provide strong supporting evidence for the conjecture. In particular, we
exhibit three different sequences of candidate covers, indexed by their degree,
such that for each sequence: (1) The degrees giving realizable covers have
asymptotically zero density in the naturals; (2) Each prime degree gives a

characteristics of extensively observed main-belt and Trojan binaries, mainly
taken from the LAOSA (Large Adaptive Optics Survey of Asteroids, Marchis et

Dimensionless quantities, such as the specific angular momentum and the primary
spin rate, are computed and discussed for each system. They suggest that these
asteroidal systems might be the outcome of rotational fission or mass shedding
of a parent body presumably subjected to an external torque.
  One of the most striking features of separated binaries composed of a large
primary (Rp > 100 km) with a much smaller secondary (Rs < 20 km) is that they
all have total angular momentum of 0.27. This value is quite close to the
Maclaurin-Jacobi bifurcation (0.308) of a spinning fluid body. Alternatively,
contact binaries and tidally locked double asteroids, made of components of
similar size, have an angular momentum larger than 0.48. They compare
successfully with the fission equilibrium sequence of a rotating fluid mass. In
conclusion, we find that total angular momentum is a useful proxy to assess
internal structure of such systems.

findings are: a) A proof of the existence of bounded domains in configuration
space which are devoid of nodal points, b) An analytical construction of formal
series representing regular orbits in the central domain as well as a numerical
investigation of its limits of applicability. c) A detailed exploration of the
phase-space structure near the nodal point. In this exploration we use an
adiabatic approximation and we draw the flow chart in a moving frame of
reference centered at the nodal point. We demonstrate the existence of a saddle
point (called X-point) in the vicinity of the nodal point which plays a key
role in the manifestation of exponential sensitivity of the orbits. One of the
invariant manifolds of the X-point continues as a spiral terminating at the
nodal point. We find cases of Hopf bifurcation at the nodal point and explore
the associated phase space structure of the nodal point - X-point complex. We
finally demonstrate the mechanism by which this complex generates chaos.
Numerical examples of this mechanism are given for particular chaotic orbits,

has formed self-consistently from the collapse of a molecular cloud core. The
global evolution of the disc is followed for several million years after its
formation. The capture of a wide range of spatial and temporal scales is made
possible by use of the thin-disc approximation. We focus on the role of
gravitational torques in transporting mass inward and angular momentum outward
during different evolutionary phases of a protostellar disc with disc-to-star
mass ratio of order 0.1. In the early phase, when the infall of matter from the
surrounding envelope is substantial, mass is transported inward by the
gravitational torques from spiral arms that are a manifestation of the
envelope-induced gravitational instability in the disc. In the late phase, when
the gas reservoir of the envelope is depleted, the distinct spiral structure is
replaced by ongoing irregular nonaxisymmetric density perturbations. The
amplitude of these density perturbations decreases with time, though this
process is moderated by swing amplification aided by the existence of the
disc's sharp outer edge. Our global modelling of the protostellar disc reveals
that there is typically a residual nonzero gravitational torque from these
density perturbations, i.e. their effects do not exactly cancel out in each
region. In particular, the net gravitational torque in the inner disc tends to
be negative during first several million years of the evolution, while the
outer disc has a net positive gravitational torque. Our global model of a
self-consistently formed disc shows that it is also self-regulated in the late
phase, so that it is near the Toomre stability limit, with a near-uniform
Toomre parameter Q\approx 1.5-2.0. (Abstract abridged).

homoepitaxial thin films. In particular, the key role of interlayer transport
controlled by step edge barriers of the Ehrlich-Schwoebel type in shaping the
morphology of multilayer films has been increasingly recognized. After a brief
review of the classical theory, this paper reports on a recent study of spiral
growth in the presence of step edge barriers. Our key observation is that step
edge barriers lead to unconventionally shaped spiral hillocks that display the
same characteristic ever-steepening height profiles as wedding cakes formed
during growth by two-dimensional nucleation. This prediction was verified
experimentally by inducing screw dislocations through ion bombardment of the
Pt(111) surface, thus creating a homoepitaxial growth system on which spiral
hillocks and wedding cakes coexist.

given by superpositions of four-valent spin networks, peaked on large spins.

operators and the existence of this regime for other models for the dynamics

stripes, as the density increases, is a well known phenomenon, the change of
the stripes into droplets as an effect of temperature is rather unexpected.
Depending on the wall separation and on the wall-fluid interaction parameters,
the stripes can switch from parallel to perpendicular to the walls and also a
mixed morphology can be stable.

use holography to map the amplitude describing the hadronic state in the fifth
dimension of Anti-de Sitter space to the light-front wavefunctions of hadrons
in physical space-time, thus providing a relativistic description of hadrons in
QCD at the amplitude level. In particular, we show that there is an exact

specific impact variable zeta which measures the separation of the quark and
gluonic constituents within the hadron in ordinary space-time. New relativistic
light-front equations in ordinary space-time can then be derived which
reproduce the results obtained using the 5-dimensional theory. The effective
light-front equations possess elegant algebraic structures and integrability
properties. This connection between the AdS and the light-front representations
allows one to compute the analytic form of the frame-independent light-front
wavefunctions, the fundamental entities which encode hadron properties and
allow the computation of decay constants, form factors, deeply virtual Compton
scattering, exclusive heavy hadron decays and other exclusive scattering

from tests of gravity per se but from precision measurements of the Casimir
force. The chameleonic force between two nearby bodies is more akin to a
Casimir-like force than a gravitational one: The chameleon force behaves as an
inverse power of the distance of separation between the surfaces of two bodies,
just as the Casimir force does. Additionally, experimental tests of gravity
often employ a thin metallic sheet to shield electrostatic forces, however this
sheet mask any detectable signal due to the presence of a strongly coupled
chameleon field. As a result of this shielding, experiments that are designed
to specifically test the behaviour of gravity are often unable to place any
constraint on chameleon fields with a strong coupling to matter. Casimir force
measurements do not employ a physical electrostatic shield and as such are able
to put tighter constraints on the properties of chameleons fields with a strong
matter coupling than tests of gravity. Motivated by this, we perform a full
investigation on the possibility of testing chameleon model with both present

able to detect the chameleon. However, future experiments have a strong
possibility of detecting or rule out a whole class of chameleon models.

debris is present over large regions of the Andromeda (M31) stellar halo. We
use a set of numerical models to determine whether extended metal-rich debris
is expected to exist in galaxy halos formed in a hierarchical LambdaCDM
universe. We identify tidal debris in the simulations according to the current
best surface brightness detection limits in M31 and demonstrate that bright
features in the outer halo regions usually originate from single satellites,
with very little contamination from other sources due to the low probability of
tidal streams from two overlapping accretion events. In contrast, high-surface
brightness features in the inner halo often originate from multiple
progenitors. We also compare the age and metallicity distribution of the debris
with the well-mixed stellar halos in which they reside. We find that
high-surface brightness tidal debris is produced almost exclusively by
relatively high mass progenitors (Mstar ~ 10^7- 10^9 Msun) and thus is expected
to be of moderate- to high-metallicity. Similarly, in our models the smooth
inner halo is expected to be metal-rich as this region has been built up mainly
from massive satellites. Our results imply that the stellar populations of
substructure observed around external galaxies with current techniques should
not resemble old and metal-poor dwarf spheroidal satellites, nor the underlying
component of the stellar halo.

point correlation coefficient, we find only a mild correlation between the
X-ray and the optical classifications, as up to 30% of the sources have
differing X-ray and optical classifications: on one hand, 10% of the type 1
sources present broad emission lines in their optical spectra and strong
absorption in the X-rays. These objects are highly luminous AGN lying at high
redshift and thus dilution effects are totally ruled out, their discrepant
nature being an intrinsic property. Their X-ray luminosities and redshifts
distributions are consistent with those of the unabsorbed X-ray sources with
broad emission lines. On the other hand, 25/32 are moderate luminosity AGN,
which are both unabsorbed in the X-rays and only present narrow emission lines
in their optical spectra. The majority of them have an optical spectrum which
is representative of the host galaxy. We finally infer that dilution of the AGN
by the host galaxy seems to account for their nature. 5/25 have been defined as
Seyfert 2. In conclusion, most of these 32 discrepant cases can be accounted
for by the standard AGN unified scheme, as its predictions are not met for only
12% of the 99 X-ray sources. ABRIDGED

central obstruction and combining defocus with spherical aberration. Sequences
of images recorded with a fast CCD detector are processed to determine the
defocus and its variations in time from the ring radii. The temporal structure
function of the defocus is fitted with a model to derive the atmospheric seeing
and time constant. We investigated by numerical simulation the data reduction
algorithm and instrumental biases. Bias caused by instrumental effects, such as
optical aberrations, detector noise, acquisition frequency, etc., is
quantified. The ring image must be well-focused, i.e. must have a sufficiently

that, quantum clique problem can be defined as follows; Given a quantum
channel, decide whether there are k states that are distinguishable, with no
error, after passing through channel. This definition comes from reconsidering
the clique problem in terms of the zero-error capacity of graphs, and then
redefining it in quantum information theory. We prove that, quantum clique
problem is QMA-complete. In the second part of paper, we consider the same
problem for the Holevo capacity. We prove that computing the Holevo capacity as

covering 17% of the sky at 21 cm, to study the HI content of Early-Type
galaxies (ETG) in an unbiased way. The aim is to get an overall picture of the
hot, warm and cold ISM of ETG, as a function of galaxy mass and environment, to
understand its origin and fate, and to relate it to the formation and evolution
history of these objects. Methods: This paper deals with the first part of our
study, which is devoted to the 8-16 deg. declination strip in the Virgo
cluster. In this sky region, using the Virgo Cluster Catalogue (VCC), we have
defined an optical sample of 939 ETG, 457 of which are brighter than the VCC
completeness limit at B_T=18.0. We have correlated this optical sample with the
catalogue of detected HI sources from ALFALFA. Results: Out of the 389 ETG from
the VCC with B_T<=18.0, outside the 1 deg. region of poor HI detection around
M87, and corrected for background contamination of VCC galaxies without a known
radial velocity, only 9 galaxies (2.3%) are detected in HI with a completeness
limit of 3.5 and 7.6 x 10^7 Mo of HI for dwarf and giant ETG, respectively. In
addition 4 VCC ETG with fainter magnitudes are also detected. Our HI detection
rate is lower than previously claimed. The majority of the detected ETG appear
to have peculiar morphology and to be located near the edges of the Virgo
cluster. Conclusions: Our preliminary conclusion is that cluster ETG contain
very little neutral gas, with the exceptions of a few peculiar dwarf galaxies
at the edge of the ETG classification and of very few larger ETG, where the
cold gas could have a recent external origin.

geometries. Two averaging methods are compared. In the first method, it is
assumed that the internal electronic evolution is much faster than the change

orthogonal coupling typically survives even extensive averaging over different

low-dimensional gases, turn out to be the most promising model systems.

telescopes and spectrographs makes this still an almost prohibitive method for
faint stars. In principle, stellar magnetic fields can be also measured on the
basis of low resolution spectropolarimetry, with very important results
obtained at the 8 m ESO telescopes with FORS1. The trade off between S/N and
spectral resolution in measuring stellar magnetic fields justify an attempt,
