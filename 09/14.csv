integrated over South America with the horizontal resolution of 40 km for the

outputs of HadAM3P. The data of HadAM3P represent simulation of modern climate
with the resolution about 150 km. In order to prepare climate regional model
from the Eta forecast model multiple modifications and corrections were made in
the original model. The run of climate Eta model was made on the supercomputer
SX-6. The detailed analysis of the results of dynamical downscaling experiment
includes an investigation of a consistency between the regional and AGCM models
as well as of ability of the regional model to resolve important features of
climate fields on the finer scale than that resolved by AGCM. In this work the
results of the investigation of a consistency between the output fields of the
Eta model and HadAM3P are presented. The geopotential, temperature and wind
fields of both models were analysed. For the evaluation of the likeness of
these two models outputs,there were used Fourier analysis of time series,
consistency index, constituted from linear regression coefficients, time mean
and space mean models' arithmetic difference and root mean square difference,
dispersion analysis,and some others characteristics. This investigation
demonstrates that there are not significant differences in behaviour and
spatial arragement of large-scale structures of the two models. Also, the
regional model characteristics do not have considerable positive or negative
trend during integration time in relation to the global model characteristics.
  From the total analysis we can affirm that in the description of large-scale
climate structures these two models are in consistency.

probabilistic interaction in the measurement process can lead to a violation of
the Bell inequalities. We first introduce two-particle phase-space
distributions in classical mechanics constructed to be the analogs of quantum
mechanical angular momentum eigenstates. These distributions are then employed
in four schemes characterized by different types of detectors measuring the
angular momenta. When the model includes an interaction between the detector
and the measured particle leading to ensemble dependencies, the relevant Bell
inequalities are violated if total angular momentum is required to be
conserved. The violation is explained by identifying assumptions made in the
derivation of Bell's theorem that are not fulfilled by the model. These
assumptions will be argued to be too restrictive to see in the violation of the
Bell inequalities a faithful signature of nonlocality.

arenas where the accretion of external material in the form of dwarf galaxies
and subsequent formation of streams is taking place. The Monoceros stream and
the Canis Major and Argo over-densities are notorious examples. VLT high
resolution spectra have been acquired for five distant open clusters. We derive
accurate radial velocities to distinguish field interlopers and cluster
members. For the latter we perform a detailed abundance analysis and derive the
iron abundance [Fe/H] and the abundance ratios of several $\alpha$ elements.
Our analysis confirms previous indications that the radial abundance gradient
in the outer Galactic disk does not follow the expectations extrapolated from
the solar vicinity, but exhibits a shallower slope. By combining the
metallicity of the five program clusters with eight more clusters for which
high resolution spectroscopy is available, we find that the mean metallicity in
the outer disk between 12 and 21 kpc from the Galactic center is [Fe/H]
$\approx -0.35$, with only marginal indications for a radial variation. In
addition, all the program clusters exhibit solar scaled or slightly enhanced
$\alpha$ elements, similar to open clusters in the solar vicinity and thin disk
stars. We investigate whether this outer disk cluster sample might belong to an
extra-galactic population, like the Monoceros ring. However, close scrutiny of
their properties - location, kinematics and chemistry - does not convincingly
favor this hypothesis. On the contrary, they appear more likely genuine
Galactic disk clusters. We finally stress the importance to obtain proper
motion measurements for these clusters to constrain their orbits.

a running parameter. In the first model, the running LCDM model, matter and DE
exchange energy, whereas in the second model, the LXCDM model, the total DE and
matter components are conserved separately. The LXCDM model was proposed as an
interesting solution to the cosmic coincidence problem. It includes an extra
dynamical component, the ""cosmon"" X, which interacts with the running \Lambda,
but not with matter. In our analysis we make use of the current value of the
linear bias parameter, b^2(0)= P_{GG}/P_{MM}, where P_{MM} ~
(\delta\rho/\rho)^2 is the present matter power spectrum and P_{GG} is the
galaxy fluctuation power spectrum. The former can be computed within a given
model, and the latter is found from the observed LSS data (at small z) obtained
by the 2dF galaxy redshift survey. It is found that b^2(0)=1 within a 10%
accuracy for the standard LCDM model. Adopting this limit for any DE model and
using a method based on the effective equation of state for the DE, we can set
a limit on the growth of matter density perturbations for the running LCDM
model, the solution of which is known. This provides a good test of the
procedure, which we then apply to the LXCDM model in order to determine the
physical region of parameter space, compatible with the LSS data. In this
region, the LXCDM model is consistent with known observations and provides at
the same time a viable solution to the cosmic coincidence problem.

Both reside within the cluster's core region, being separated in projection by

reside in clusters that are under formation and are accreting new material from
their outskirts. In this paper we study the intriguing appearance of Abell 194,
and test whether the cluster and radio source dynamics are consistent with the
cluster formation/merger model. We analyse data from the XMM-Newton satellite
and previously unpublished observations with the Very Large Array (VLA), as
well as presenting new data from the Giant Metre-Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT).
The shape of the jets, and the lack of significant stripping of the galaxies'
interstellar media, indicate that the radio galaxies are not moving at the
large velocities they would have had if they were falling into the cluster from
its outskirts; galaxy velocities of <=300 km s^-1 are adequate instead. A
plausible scenario that could explain the observations is that the dynamics of
the cluster centre are relatively quiescent, with the dominant system of
massive galaxies being bound and orbiting the cluster centre of mass. For
plausible jet/plume speeds and densities and the galaxy dynamics implied by
this picture of the cluster, we show that the observed jet structures can be
explained without invoking a major cluster merger event.

distant qubits is highly desirable for any quantum computer architecture, but
has not yet been demonstrated. An efficient way to achieve this goal is to
couple the qubits to a quantum bus, which distributes quantum information among
the qubits. Here we show the implementation of such a quantum bus, using
microwave photons confined in a transmission line cavity, to couple two
superconducting qubits on opposite sides of a chip. The interaction is mediated
by the exchange of virtual rather than real photons, avoiding cavity induced
loss. Using fast control of the qubits to switch the coupling effectively on
and off, we demonstrate coherent transfer of quantum states between the qubits.
The cavity is also used to perform multiplexed control and measurement of the
qubit states. This approach can be expanded to more than two qubits, and is an
attractive architecture for quantum information processing on a chip.

segment of length $l$ and its complement, the entanglement entropy between the

that in confining backgrounds there are generally two such surfaces. One
consists of two disconnected components localized at the endpoints of the line

disconnected surface dominates the entropy for $l$ above a certain critical
value $l_{\rm crit}$ while the connected one dominates below that value. The
change of behavior at $l=l_{\rm crit}$ is reminiscent of the finite temperature
deconfinement transition: for $l < l_{\rm crit}$ the entropy scales as $N_c^2$,
while for $l > l_{\rm crit}$ as $N_c^0$. We argue that a similar transition
should occur in any field theory with a Hagedorn spectrum of non-interacting

they both have very broad, asymmetric lines which can be roughly considered
single-peaked. Torus and disk lines may show very different red and blue line
wings, but the differences are due to the models for relativistic tori and
disks having differing inner boundary radii. Self-eclipse and lensing play some
role in shaping the torus lines, but they are effective only at high
inclination angles. If inner and outer radii of an accretion torus are the same

commutative algebras. We begin by recalling what are dualizing complexes. Next
we define rigid complexes, and explain their functorial properties. Due to the
possible presence of torsion, we must use differential graded algebras in the
constructions. We then discuss rigid dualizing complexes. Finally we show how
rigid complexes can be used to understand Cohen-Macaulay homomorphisms and
relative dualizing sheaves.

connection with integrable systems is that they are frequently
non-self-adjoint, making it difficult to determine where the spectrum lies. In
this paper, we consider the problem of locating and counting the discrete
eigenvalues associated with the scattering problem for which the sine-Gordon
equation is the isospectral flow. In particular, suppose that we take an
initially stationary pulse for the sine-Gordon equation, with a profile that
has either one extremum point of height less than pi and topological charge 0,
or is monotone with topological charge +-1. Then we show that the point
spectrum lies on the unit circle and is simple. Furthermore, we give a count of
the number of eigenvalues. This result is an analog of that of Klaus and Shaw
for the Zakharov-Shabat scattering problem. We also relate our results, as well
as those of Klaus and Shaw, to the Krein stability theory for symplectic
matrices. In particular we show that the scattering problem associated to the
sine-Gordon equation has a symplectic structure, and under the above conditions
the point eigenvalues have a definite Krein signature, and are thus simple and
lie on the unit circle.

relatively reliable means of measuring the energy injected into hot atmospheres

required to offset radiative losses and to suppress cooling in isolated giant
elliptical galaxies, and in larger systems up to the richest galaxy clusters.
This coincidence suggests that heating and cooling are coupled by feedback,
which suppresses star formation and the growth of luminous galaxies. How jet
energy is converted to heat and the degree to which other heating mechanisms
are contributing, eg. thermal conduction, are not well understood. Outburst

luminosities. The maximum lifetime of FRII sources was then determined via a
comparison of the observed and model projected length distributions. We
estimate the average FRII lifetime is 1.5x10^7 years and the duty cycle is
~8x10^8 years. Degeneracies between t_max and the model parameters: jet power

inverse boundary spectral problem. To formulate it, assume that $M$ is divided
by a hypersurface $\Sigma$ into two components and we know the eigenvalues
$\lambda_j$ of the Laplace operator on $(M,g)$ and also the Cauchy data, on
$\Sigma$, of the corresponding eigenfunctions $\phi_j$, i.e.
$\phi_j|_{\Sigma},\partial_\nu\phi_j|_{\Sigma}$, where $\nu$ is the normal to
$\Sigma$. We prove that these data determine $(M,g)$ uniquely, i.e. up to an
isometry. In the second problem we are given much less data, namely,
$\lambda_j$ and $\phi_j|_{\Sigma}$ only. However, if $\Sigma$ consists of at
least two components, $\Sigma_1, \Sigma_2$, we are still able to determine
$(M,g)$ assuming some conditions on $M$ and $\Sigma$. These conditions are
formulated in terms of the spectra of the manifolds with boundary obtained by

linearly stable} throughout the parameter range examined. Furthermore, this is
true for topological charges $m=0$ or $m=1$; solutions with higher topological
charge can be unstable even in that case. All higher excited states are found
to be unstable in a wide parametric regime. However, for the
focusing/attractive case the ground state with $n_r=0$ and $m=0$ can only be
stable for a sufficiently low number of atoms. Once again, excited states are
found to be generically unstable. For unstable profiles, the dynamical
evolution of the corresponding branches is also followed to monitor the
temporal development of the instability.

We may define many variants of Voronoi diagrams depending on the class of
objects, the distance functions and the embedding space. In this paper, we
investigate a framework for defining and building Voronoi diagrams for a broad
class of distance functions called Bregman divergences. Bregman divergences
include not only the traditional (squared) Euclidean distance but also various
divergence measures based on entropic functions. Accordingly, Bregman Voronoi
diagrams allow to define information-theoretic Voronoi diagrams in statistical
parametric spaces based on the relative entropy of distributions. We define
several types of Bregman diagrams, establish correspondences between those
diagrams (using the Legendre transformation), and show how to compute them
efficiently. We also introduce extensions of these diagrams, e.g. k-order and
k-bag Bregman Voronoi diagrams, and introduce Bregman triangulations of a set
of points and their connexion with Bregman Voronoi diagrams. We show that these
triangulations capture many of the properties of the celebrated Delaunay
triangulation. Finally, we give some applications of Bregman Voronoi diagrams
which are of interest in the context of computational geometry and machine
learning.

the strong-coupling superconductivity in CeIrSi$_3$. The large magnitude and

calculated the coefficient of determination, which represents the measurement

that the mean coefficient of determination of stocks with a large number of

deterministic factors to be taken into account when making a stock network.
Furthermore, stocks with a large number of links to other stocks can be more
affected by common factors.

solutions for the triaxial de Zeeuw & Carollo (1996) models with central
density cusps. ZC96 models are triaxial generalisations of spherical
$\gamma$-models of Dehnen whose densities vary as $r^{-\gamma}$ near the center
and $r^{-4}$ at large radii and hence, possess a central density core for
$\gamma=0$ and cusps for $\gamma > 0$. We consider four triaxial models from
ZC96, two prolate triaxials: $(p, q) = (0.65, 0.60)$ with $\gamma = 1.0$ and
1.5, and two oblate triaxials: $(p, q) = (0.95, 0.60)$ with $\gamma = 1.0$ and
1.5. We compute 4500 orbits in each model for time periods of $10^{5} T_{D}$.
We find that a large fraction of the orbits in each model are stochastic by
means of their nonzero Liapunov exponents. The stochastic orbits in each model
can sustain regular shapes for $\sim 10^{3} T_{D}$ or longer, which suggests
that they diffuse slowly through their allowed phase-space. Except for the
oblate triaxial models with $\gamma =1.0$, our attempts to construct
self-consistent solutions employing only the regular orbits fail for the
remaining three models. However, the self-consistent solutions are found to
exist for all models when the stochastic and regular orbits are treated in the
same way because the mixing-time, $\sim10^{4} T_{D}$, is shorter than the
integration time, $10^{5} T_{D}$. Moreover, the ``fully-mixed'' solutions can
also be constructed for all models when the stochastic orbits are fully mixed
at 15 lowest energy shells. Thus, we conclude that the self-consistent
solutions exist for our selected prolate and oblate triaxial models with
$\gamma = 1.0$ and 1.5.

previously searched damped Lyman-alpha absorption systems (DLAs) with the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. We add our results to other recent
studies in order to address the important issues regarding the detection of
cold gas, through 21-cm absorption, in DLAs: Although, due to the DLAs
identified with spiral galaxies, there is a mix of spin temperature/covering
factor ratios at low redshift, two recent high redshift end points confirm that
this ratio does not generally rise over the whole redshift range searched (up
to z = 3.39). That is, if the covering factors of many of these galaxies were a
factor of >2 smaller than for the spirals, then no significant difference in
the spin temperatures between these two classes would be required.
  Furthermore, although it is difficult to separate the relative contributions
of the spin temperature and covering factor, the new results confirm that 21-cm
detections tend to occur at low angular diameter distances, where the coverage
of a given absorption cross section is maximised.
  Finally, we also find an apparent 21-cm line strength--MgII equivalent width
correlation, which appears to be due to a coupling of the velocity structure
between the components that each species traces. That is, the gas seen in 21-cm
absorption could be the same as that seen in optical absorption. Combined with
the known equivalent width--metallicity relation, this may be manifest as a
spin temperature--metallicity anti-correlation, which is non-evolutionary in
origin.

introduce three heavy Majorana neutrinos N_i (for i = 1, 2, 3) into the
standard model and implement the seesaw mechanism. In this approach the
neutrino mixing matrix V appearing in the charged current interactions of \nu_i
is not unitary, and the strength of unitarity violation of V is associated with
the matrix R which describes the strength of charged current interactions of
N_i. We present an explicit parametrization of the correlation between V and R
in terms of nine rotation angles and nine phase angles, which can be measured
or constrained in the precision neutrino oscillation experiments and by
exploring possible signatures of N_i at the LHC and ILC. Two special but viable
scenarios, the Type-I seesaw model with two heavy Majorana neutrinos and the
Type-II seesaw model with one heavy Majorana neutrino and one Higgs triplet,
are taken into account to illustrate the simplified V-R correlation. The
implications of R \neq 0 on the low-energy neutrino phenomenology are also
discussed. In particular, we demonstrate that the non-unitarity of V is
possible to give rise to an appreciable CP-violating asymmetry between \nu_\mu

GeV, the first-order transition can be strong enough for the electroweak
baryogenesis, as long as the extra massive scalar bosons (required for the
linear realization) are kept heavier than the neutral scalar boson. Explicit
symmetry breaking terms reduce the strength of the first-order transition, but
the transition can remain strongly first-order even when the masses of pseudo

filters that can result in improved bit error performance compared to other
LPICs in the literature. The motivation for the proposed filters arises from
the possibility of avoiding the generation of certain interference and noise
terms in a given stage that would have been present in a conventional LPIC
(CLPIC). In the proposed filters, we achieve such avoidance of the generation
of interference and noise terms in a given stage by simply making the diagonal
elements of a certain matrix in that stage equal to zero. Hence, the proposed
filters do not require additional complexity compared to the CLPIC, and they
can allow achieving a certain error performance using fewer LPIC stages. We
also extend the proposed matrix filter solutions to a multicarrier DS-CDMA
system, where we consider two types of receivers. In one receiver (referred to
as Type-I receiver), LPIC is performed on each subcarrier first, followed by
multicarrier combining (MCC). In the other receiver (called Type-II receiver),
MCC is performed first, followed by LPIC. We show that in both Type-I and
Type-II receivers, the proposed matrix filters outperform other matrix filters.
Also, Type-II receiver performs better than Type-I receiver because of enhanced
accuracy of the interference estimates achieved due to frequency diversity
offered by MCC.

the case of uncoupled quintessence models, if the mass of the field is of order
the Hubble scale today or smaller, dark energy fluctuations are always small
compared to the matter density contrast. Even when the matter perturbations
enter the non-linear regime, the dark energy perturbations remain linear. We
find that virialised clusters and voids correspond to local overdensities in
dark energy, with $\delta_{\phi}/(1+w) \sim \Oo(10^{-5})$ for voids,
$\delta_{\phi}/(1+w) \sim \Oo(10^{-4})$ for super-voids and

voids with radii of $100-300 {\rm Mpc}$ exist within the visible Universe then
$\delta_{\phi}$ may be as large as $10^{-3}(1+w)$. Linear overdensities of

for a typical super-cluster: $\delta_{\phi}/(1+w) \sim \Oo(-10^{-5})$. The

the 14 - 195 keV variability of the 44 brightest AGN. The sources have been
selected due to their detection significance of >10 sigma. We tested the
variability using a maximum likelihood estimator and by analysing the structure
function.
  Results: Probing different time scales, it appears that the absorbed AGN are
more variable than the unabsorbed ones. The same applies for the comparison of
Seyfert 2 and Seyfert 1 objects. As expected the blazars show stronger
variability. 15% of the non-blazar AGN show variability of >20% compared to the
average flux on time scales of 20 days, and 30% show at least 10% flux
variation. All the non-blazar AGN which show strong variability are

only led to further developments in mathematics but has also been and remains
an important catalyst for the further development of theories in physics. At
the same time, Hestenes geometric algebra provides a didactically promising
instrument to model phenomena in physics mathematically and in a tangible
manner. Quaternions particularly have a catchy interpretation in the context of
geometric algebra which can be used didactically. The relation between
quaternions and geometric algebra is presented with a view to analysing its
didactical possibilities.

have found that the middle position is occupied by the Cu2+, whereas the end
positions are equally populated with the Cu2+ and Ni2+ for (x=1) while in the
(x=2) the trimers were found to be of only one type Ni-Cu-Ni. Below TN = 20 K

by a model containing only one arm of the propagation vector star. The
Cu/Ni-spins form both parallel and antiparallel configurations in the different
trimers, implying substantial effect of the inter-trimer interaction on the
overall magnetic structure.

location updates generate by mobile nodes in IEEE802.11-based wireless mesh
networks. Existing location services use node identifiers to determine the
locator (aka anchor) that is responsible for keeping track of a node's
location. Such a strategy can be inefficient because: (i) identifiers give no
clue on the node's mobility and (ii) locators can be far from the
source/destination shortest path, which increases both location delays and
bandwidth consumption. To solve these issues, Otiy introduces a new strategy
that identifies nodes to play the role of locators based on the likelihood of a
destination to be close to these nodes- i.e., locators are identified depending
on the mobility pattern of nodes. Otiy relies on the cyclic mobility patterns
of nodes and creates a slotted agenda composed of a set of predicted locations,
defined according to the past and present patterns of mobility. Correspondent
nodes fetch this agenda only once and use it as a reference for identifying
which locators are responsible for the node at different points in time. Over a
period of about one year, the weekly proportion of nodes having at least 50% of
exact location predictions is in average about 75%. This proportion increases
by 10% when nodes also consider their closeness to the locator from only what
they know about the network.

include input SW conditions affecting three selected fields, as well as
shadowing targets observed with XMM-Newton, Chandra and Suzaku and calculate

residual emission to attribute to the galactic soft X-ray background. We obtain

compare to X-ray data. The local 3/4 keV emission (O VII and O VIII) detected

heliospheric emission. No emission from the LB is needed at these energies.

1-1.7 fb^-1, where we are able to probe our knowledge of the Standard Model Top
quark. This article will focuss on those analysis results dedicated to find new
physics in the Top quark production: measurement of relative fractions of Top
pair production mechanisms, searches for a massive resonant state decaying to
tt-bar pairs as well as a heavy Top-like quark decaying as the Standard Model
Top quark. Besides its production, the Top quark decay is also an interesting
probe to find Physics Beyond the Standard Model by measuring possibly anomalous
values of the helicity fractions of the W boson in the decay t-->W(-->l+v_l)b
by searching for flavour changing neutral current decays t-->Zq or by testing
the Top quark charge to be +2/3 or -4/3.

dominated by the molecular polarizability that allows a weakly attractive

to trigger internal mixing processes which allow stars to produce significant
amounts of primary nitrogen 14 and carbon 13. Very metal poor massive stars
produce much more primary nitrogen than PopIII stars for a given initial mass
and rotation velocity. The very metal poor stars undergo strong mass loss
induced by rotation. One can distinguish two types of rotationnaly enhanced
stellar winds: 1) Rotationally mechanical winds occurs when the surface
velocity reaches the critical velocity at the equator, {\it i.e.} the velocity
at which the centrifugal acceleration is equal to the gravity; 2) Rotationally
radiatively line driven winds are a consequence of strong internal mixing which
brings large amounts of CNO elements at the surface. This enhances the opacity
and may trigger strong line driven winds. These effects are important for an
initial value of $\upsilon/\upsilon_{\rm crit}$ of 0.54 for a 60 M$_\odot$ at
$Z=10^{-8}$, {\it i.e.} for initial values of $\upsilon/\upsilon_{\rm crit}$
higher than the one ($\sim$0.4) corresponding to observations at solar $Z$.
These two effects, strong internal mixing leading to the synthesis of large
amounts of primary nitrogen and important mass losses induced by rotation,
occur for $Z$ between about 10$^{-8}$ and 0.001. For metallicities above 0.001
and for reasonable choice of the rotation velocities, internal mixing is no
longer efficient enough to trigger these effects.

to the other during Roche-lobe overflow. The efficiency of this process is not
well understood and constitutes one of the largest uncertainties in binary
evolution.
  One of the problems lies in the transfer of angular momentum, which will spin
up the accreting star. In very tight systems tidal friction can prevent
reaching critical rotation, by locking the spin period to the orbital period.
Accreting stars in systems with orbital periods larger than a few days reach
critical rotation after accreting only a fraction of their mass, unless there
is an effective mechanism to get rid of angular momentum. In low mass stars
magnetic field might help. In more massive stars angular momentum loss will be
accompanied by strong mass loss. This would imply that most interacting
binaries with initial orbital periods larger than a few days evolve very
non-conservatively.
  In this contribution we wish to draw attention to the unsolved problems
related to mass and angular momentum transfer in binary systems. We do this by
presenting the first results of an implementation of spin up by accretion into
the TWIN version of the Eggleton stellar evolution code.

geometry and toric degenerations, relating affine manifolds with singularities,
log Calabi-Yau spaces, and toric degenerations of Calabi-Yaus. The main focus
of this paper is the calculation of the cohomology of a Calabi-Yau variety
associated to a given affine manifold with singularities B. We show that the
Dolbeault cohomology groups of the Calabi-Yau associated to B are described in
terms of some cohomology groups of sheaves on B, as expected. This is proved
first by calculating the log de Rham and log Dolbeault cohomology groups on the
log Calabi-Yau space associated to B, and then proving a base-change theorem
for cohomology in our logarithmic setting.
  As applications, this shows that our mirror symmetry construction via
Legendre duality of affine manifolds results in the usual interchange of Hodge
numbers expected in mirror symmetry, and gives an explicit description of the
monodromy of a smoothing.

involving the wobble of Titan is hinted. This paper studies this scenario and
its consequences. The first step is to build an accurate analytical model that
would help to find the likely resonances in the rotation of every synchronous
body. In this model, I take the orbital eccentricity of the body into account,
as well as its variable inclination with respect to Saturn's equator. Then an
analytical study using the second fundamental model of the resonance is
performed to study the resonance of interest. Finally, I study the dissipative
consequences of this resonance. I find that this resonance may have increased
the wobble of Titan by several degrees. For instance, if Titan's polar momentum
C is equal to 0.355MR_T^2 (M and R_T being respectively Titan's mass and
radius), the wobble might be forced to 41 degrees. Thanks to an original
formula, I find that the dissipation associated with the forced wobble might
not be negligible compared to the contribution of the eccentricity. I also
suspect that, due to the forced wobble, Titan's period of rotation may be
somewhat underestimated by observers. Finally, I use the analytical model
presented in this paper to compute the periods of the free librations of the
four Galilean satellites as well as the Saturnian satellite Rhea. For Io and
Europa, the results are consistent with previous studies. For the other
satellites, the periods of the free librations are respectively 186.37 d, 23.38
y and 30.08 y for Ganymede, 2.44 y, 209.32 y and 356.54 y for Callisto, and

However, this sector might be more complicated than we currently believe: there
might be more than one dark matter species (for example two components of cold
dark matter or a mixture of hot and cold dark matter) and there may be new
interactions between these particles. In this paper we study the possibility of
multiple dark matter species and interactions mediated by a dark energy field.
We study both the background and the perturbation evolution in these scenarios.
We find that the background evolution of a system of multiple dark matter
particles (with constant couplings) mimics a single fluid with a time-varying
coupling parameter. However, this is no longer true on the perturbative level.
We study the case of attractive and repulsive forces as well as a mixture of

the system. This allowed us to measure the total mass and gas fraction in the
cluster and define overdensity radii R500 and R2500. The global properties of
XLSSC 029 were measured within these radii and compared with those of the local
population. The gas mass fraction was found to be consistent with local
clusters. The mean metal abundance was 0.18 +0.17 -0.15 Zsol, with the cluster
core regions excluded, consistent with the predicted and observed evolution.

semiconductor CdMnTe by means of site selective spectroscopy. In zero magnetic
field we detect a broad and asymmetric band with a characteristic spectral
width of about 5 meV. When external magnetic fields are applied a new line
appears in the emission spectrum. Remarkably, the spectral width of this line
is reduced greatly down to 0.24 meV. We attribute such unusual behavior to the
formation of BMP, effected by sizable fluctuations of local magnetic moments.
The modifications of the optical spectra have been simulated by the Monte-Carlo
method and calculated within an approach considering the nearest Mn ion. A
quantitative agreement with the experiment is achieved without use of fitting
parameters. It is demonstrated that the low-energy part of the emission spectra
originates from the energetic relaxation of a complex consisting of a hole and
its nearest Mn ion. It is also shown that the contribution to the narrow line
arises from the remote Mn ions.

propose an alternative to the Viterbi training -- adjusted Viterbi training --

superconductor)-insulator transition, as follows from well-known domain-wall
arguments. If the conducting regions are large enough (i.e. when the T=0
superconducting gap is much larger than the single-electron level spacing), and
if they have superconducting correlations, it becomes energetically favorable
for the system to go into a Josephson-coupled zero-resistance state before
(i.e. at higher resistance than) becoming a ""real"" metal. We show that this is
plausible by a simple comparison of the relevant coupling constants. For small
grains in the above sense, the electronic grain structure is washed out by
delocalization and thus becomes irrelevant. When the proposed ""Josephson state""
is quenched by a magnetic field, an insulating, rather then a metallic, state
should appear. This has been shown to be consistent with the existing data on
oxide materials as well as ultra-thin films. We discuss the Uemura correlations
versus the Homes law, and derive the former for the large-grain Josephson array
(inhomogenous superconductor) model. The small-grain case behaves like a dirty
homogenous metal. It should obey the Homes law provided that the system is in
the dirty supeconductivity limit. A speculation why that is typically the case
for d-wave superconductors is presented.

fields $\bu(\bx)$ lead to both standard and anomalous diffusion equation. When
the field $\bu(\bx)$ is spatially correlated each particle performs a simple
free Brownian motion, but the trajectories of different particles result to be
mutually correlated. The two-point statistical properties of the field
$\bu(\bx)$ induce two-point spatial correlations in the particle distribution
satisfying a simple but non-trivial diffusion-like equation. These
displacement-displacement correlations lead the system to three possible
regimes: coalescence, simple clustering and a combination of the two. The
existence of these different regimes, in the one-dimensional system, is shown
through computer simulations and a simple theoretical argument.
