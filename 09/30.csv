i'-band dropout objects, many of which were recently confirmed to be young
star-forming galaxies at z~4-6. These galaxies are too faint individually to
accurately measure their radial surface brightness profiles. Their average
light profiles are potentially of great interest, since they may contain clues
to the time since the onset of significant galaxy assembly. We separately
co-add V, i' and z'-band HUDF images of sets of z~4,5 and 6 objects,
pre-selected to have nearly identical compact sizes and the roundest shapes.
  From these stacked images, we are able to study the averaged radial structure
of these objects at much higher signal-to-noise ratio than possible for an
individual faint object. Here we explore the reliability and usefulness of a
stacking technique of compact objects at z~4-6 in the HUDF. Our results are:
(1) image stacking provides reliable and reproducible average surface
brightness profiles; (2) the shape of the average surface brightness profiles
show that even the faintest z~4-6 objects are resolved; and (3) if late-type
galaxies dominate the population of galaxies at z~4-6, as previous HST studies
have shown, then limits to dynamical age estimates for these galaxies from
their profile shapes are comparable with the SED ages obtained from the
broadband colors. We also present accurate measurements of the sky-background
in the HUDF and its associated 1-sigma uncertainties.

by the exponential dependence of $\Delta (t)$ on $t$, $\Delta (t)\sim \exp

  The Chandra images reveal three dramatically different embedded stellar

the inferred ages of the central OB stars illuminating the UCHIIs. We suggest
that different formation mechanisms are necessary to explain the diversity of

protocols can be exponentially more efficient than classical protocols on
_total_ Boolean functions in the two-party interactive model. The answer
appears to be ``No''. In 2002, Razborov proved this conjecture for so far the
most general class of functions
  F(x, y) = f(x_1 * y_1, x_2 * y_2, ..., x_n * y_n), where f is a_symmetric_
Boolean function on n Boolean inputs, and x_i, y_i are the i'th bit of x and y,
respectively. His elegant proof critically depends on the symmetry of f.
  We develop a lower-bound method that does not require symmetry and prove the
conjecture for a broader class of functions. Each of those functions F(x, y) is
obtained by what we call the ``block-composition'' of a ``building block'' g :
{0, 1}^k by {0, 1}^k --> {0, 1}, with an f : {0, 1}^n -->{0, 1}, such that
  F(x, y) = f(g(x_1, y_1), g(x_2, y_2), ..., g(x_n, y_n)), where x_i and y_i

  We show that as long as g itself is ``hard'' enough, its block-composition
with an_arbitrary_ f has polynomially related quantum and classical
communication complexities. Our approach gives an alternative proof for
Razborov's result (albeit with a slightly weaker parameter), and establishes
new quantum lower bounds. For example, when g is the Inner Product function for
k=\Omega(\log n), the_deterministic_ communication complexity of its
block-composition with_any_ f is asymptotically at most the quantum complexity

nomadic transmitter with several antennas, which is received by multiple
agents, exhibiting independent channel gains and additive circular-symmetric
complex Gaussian noise. In the nomadic regime, we assume that the agents do not
have any decoding ability. These agents process their channel observations and
forward them to the final destination through lossless links with a fixed
capacity. We propose new achievable rates based on elementary compression and
also on a Wyner-Ziv (CEO-like) processing, for both fast fading and block
fading channels, as well as for general discrete channels. The simpler two
agents scheme is solved, up to an implicit equation with a single variable.
Limiting the nomadic transmitter to a circular-symmetric complex Gaussian
signalling, new upper bounds are derived for both fast and block fading, based
on the vector version of the entropy power inequality. These bounds are then
compared to the achievable rates in several extreme scenarios. The asymptotic
setting with numbers of agents and transmitter's antennas taken to infinity is
analyzed. In addition, the upper bounds are analytically shown to be tight in
several examples, while numerical calculations reveal a rather small gap in a
finite $2\times2$ setting. The advantage of the Wyner-Ziv approach over
elementary compression is shown where only the former can achieve the full
diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. We also consider the non-nomadic setting, with
agents that can decode. Here we give an achievable rate, over fast fading
channel, which combines broadcast with dirty paper coding and the decentralized
reception, which was introduced for the nomadic setting.

conclusion on this important problem may be questionable due to an error in
logic about the orthorhombicity delta_0 characterizing the lattice structure of
YBCO. In Ref. [1], a single band at delta_0>0 is proved to be in accordance
with the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on untwinned YBCO.
But in their Erratum in PRL[3], they admit that delta_0= -0.03 was used to fit
the INS data. Hence publications [1,3] contain errors that we believe
invalidate their approach.

that has successfully resisted cryptanalysis for thirty years. The original
version, based on Goppa codes, is able to guarantee a high level of security,
and is faster than competing solutions, like RSA. Despite this, it has been
rarely considered in practical applications, due to two major drawbacks: i)
large size of the public key and ii) low transmission rate. Low-Density
Parity-Check (LDPC) codes are state-of-art forward error correcting codes that
permit to approach the Shannon limit while ensuring limited complexity.
Quasi-Cyclic (QC) LDPC codes are a particular class of LDPC codes, able to join
low complexity encoding of QC codes with high-performing and low-complexity
decoding of LDPC codes. In a previous work it has been proposed to adopt a
particular family of QC-LDPC codes in the McEliece cryptosystem to reduce the
key size and increase the transmission rate. Recently, however, new attacks
have been found that are able to exploit a flaw in the transformation from the
private key to the public one. Such attacks can be effectively countered by
changing the form of some constituent matrices, without altering the system
parameters. This work gives an overview of the QC-LDPC codes-based McEliece
cryptosystem and its cryptanalysis. Two recent versions are considered, and
their ability to counter all the currently known attacks is discussed. A third
version able to reach a higher security level is also proposed. Finally, it is
shown that the new QC-LDPC codes-based cryptosystem scales favorably with the
key length.

studied in this paper. Three membranes are located at $z=-h$, $z=0$ and

which has a narrow pore. A polymer with length $N$ is initially sandwiched
between the membranes placed at $z=-h$ and $z=0$ and translocates through this
pore. We consider strong confinement (small $h$), where the polymer is
essentially reduced to a two-dimensional polymer, with a radius of gyration
scaling as $R^{\tinytext{(2D)}}_g \sim N^{\nu_{\tinytext{2D}}}$; here,
$\nu_{\tinytext{2D}}=0.75$ is the Flory exponent in two dimensions. The polymer
performs Rouse dynamics. Based on theoretical analysis and high-precision
simulation data, we show that in the unbiased case $h=h_1$, the dwell-time
$\tau_d$ scales as $N^{2+\nu_{\tinytext{2D}}}$, in perfect agreement with our
previously published theoretical framework. For $h_1=\infty$, the situation is
equivalent to field-driven translocation in two dimensions. We show that in
this case $\tau_d$ scales as $N^{2\nu_{\tinytext{2D}}}$, in agreement with
several existing numerical results in the literature. This result violates the
earlier reported lower bound $N^{1+\nu}$ for $\tau_d$ for field-driven
translocation. We argue, based on energy conservation, that the actual lower
bound for $\tau_d$ is $N^{2\nu}$ and not $N^{1+\nu}$. Polymer translocation in
such theoretically motivated geometries thus resolves some of the most
fundamental issues that are the subjects of much heated debate in recent times.
