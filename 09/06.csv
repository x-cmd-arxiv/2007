quantum optimization, based on the structure of the energy levels in the

number of local minima close to the global minimum, the gap becomes
exponentially small making the computation time exponentially long. The quantum
advantage of adiabatic quantum computation may then be accessed only via the
local adiabatic evolution, which requires phase coherence throughout the
evolution and knowledge of the spectrum. Such problems, therefore, are not
suitable for adiabatic quantum computation.

summarized. It is pointed out that a line of electric dipoles and a line of

shifts similar to that produced by introducing a rectangular block of glass
behind one slit of a double-slit interference pattern; the double-slit pattern
is shifted while the single-slit envelope remains undisplaced. The quantum
explanation for the magnetic interference pattern shift introduced by Aharonov

We re-examine the implications of the limits on decay lifetimes of solar
neutrinos for unparticle interactions. We study in detail the fundamental
parameter space (\Lambda, M) and derive bounds on the energy scale M
characterizing the new physics. We work strictly within the framework where
conformal invariance holds down to low energies. We first assume that couplings
of the unparticle sector to the Higgs field are suppressed and derive bounds
with \Lambda in the TeV region from neutrino decay into scalar unparticles.
These bounds are significant for values of the anomalous dimension of the
unparticle operator 1.0 < d < 1.2. For a region of the parameter space, we show
that the bounds are comparable to those arising from production rates at high
energy colliders. We then relax our assumption, by considering a more natural
framework which does not require a priori restrictions on couplings of
Higgs-unparticle operators, and derive bounds with \Lambda in meV region from
neutrino decay into vector unparticles. Such low scales for the IR fixed point
are relevant in gauge theories with many flavors.

non-unitary process arising from a unitary co-evolution of the pion creation
process with a quantum environment. The purpose of this work is to identify the
interacting degrees of freedom of the environment in a high resolution
amplitude analysis of CERN data on polarized target for dipion masses 580-1080
MeV. The S-wave spectra |S|^2 show presence of rho0(770) while P-wave spectra
|L|^2 show a dip at f0(980) mass. The observed rho0(770)-f0(980) mixing is
encoded in all measured density matrix elements which also encode a level
splitting of the spectra arising from the interaction of the pion creation

reveals the existence of a new quantum number characterizing the environment.
We propose a model for the CPT violating interaction of the pion creation
process with the environment in which non-diagonal transitions between resonant
qqbar modes and pi(-)pi(+) states lead to vector-scalar mixing and a dynamic
entanglement of the pi(-)pi(+) isospin states. The final states pi(-)p(+)n do
not posses CPT cojugate states and the concept of CPT symmetry looses its

Kinematical long-slit observations cover at least the major and minor axis and
extend to 1-4 effective radii. Axisymmetric Schwarzschild models are used to
derive stellar mass-to-light ratios and dark halo parameters. In every galaxy
models with a dark matter halo match the data better than models without. The
statistical significance is over 95 percent for 8 galaxies, around 90 percent
for 5 galaxies and for four galaxies it is not significant. For the highly
significant cases systematic deviations between observed and modelled
kinematics are clearly seen; for the remaining galaxies differences are more
statistical in nature. Best-fit models contain 10-50 percent dark matter inside
the half-light radius. The central dark matter density is at least one order of
magnitude lower than the luminous mass density. The central phase-space density
of dark matter is often orders of magnitude lower than in the luminous
component, especially when the halo core radius is large. The orbital system of
the stars along the major-axis is slightly dominated by radial motions. Some
galaxies show tangential anisotropy along the minor-axis, which is correlated
with the minor-axis Gauss-Hermite coefficient H4. Changing the balance between
data-fit and regularisation constraints does not change the reconstructed mass
structure significantly. Model anisotropies tend to strengthen if the weight on
regularisation is reduced, but the general property of a galaxy to be radially
or tangentially anisotropic, respectively, does not change. (abridged)

Treating the field lines as effectively rigid, we develop hydrodynamical
equations describing the 1-dimensional flow along each, subject to pressure,
radiative, gravitational, and centrifugal forces. We solve these equations
numerically for a large ensemble of field lines, to build up a 3-dimensional
time-dependent simulation of a model star with parameters similar to the
archetypal Bp star sigma Ori E. Since the flow along each field line can be
solved for independently of other field lines, the computational cost of this
approach is a fraction of an equivalent magnetohydrodynamical treatment.
  The simulations confirm many of the predictions of previous analytical and
numerical studies. Collisions between wind streams from opposing magnetic
hemispheres lead to strong shock heating. The post-shock plasma cools initially
via X-ray emission, and eventually accumulates into a warped, rigidly rotating
disk defined by the locus of minima of the effective (gravitational plus
centrifugal) potential. But a number of novel results also emerge. For field
lines extending far from the star, the rapid area divergence enhances the
radiative acceleration of the wind, resulting in high shock velocities (up to
~3,000 km/s) and hard X-rays. Moreover, the release of centrifugal potential
energy continues to heat the wind plasma after the shocks, up to temperatures
around twice those achieved at the shocks themselves. Finally, in some
circumstances the cool plasma in the accumulating disk can oscillate about its
equilibrium position, possibly due to radiative cooling instabilities in the
adjacent post-shock regions.

that cannot be associated with a single type; these most likely have dubious
classifications into two or three types. Statistical methods can greatly
contribute in providing a better characterization of planetary nebulae groups.
We use the Bayes Theorem to calculate the posterior probabilities for an object
to be member of each of the types I, IIa, IIb, III and IV. This calculation is
particularly important for planetary nebulae that are ambiguously classified in
the traditional method. The posterior probabilities are defined from the
probability density function of classificatory parameters of a well-defined
sample, composed only by planetary nebulae unambiguously fitted into the
Peimbert types. Because the probabilities depend on the available observational
data, they are conditional probabilities, and, as new observational data are
added to the sample, the classification of the nebula can be improved, to take
into account this new information. This method differs from the original
classificatory scheme, because it provides a quantitative result of the
representativity of the object within its group. Also, through the use of
marginal distributions it is possible to extend the Peimbert classification
even to those objects for which only a few classificatory parameters are known.

stretching but are unable to sustain shear stresses. This property gives
membranes the ability to adopt dramatic shape changes. In this paper, a finite

In particular, a viscous regularization method is proposed to stabilize
tangential mesh deformations and improve the convergence rate of nonlinear
solvers. The Augmented Lagrangian method is used to enforce global constraints
on area and volume during membrane deformations. As a validation of the method,
equilibrium shapes for a shape-phase diagram of lipid bilayer vesicle are
calculated. These numerical techniques are also shown to be useful for
simulations of three-dimensional large-deformation problems: the formation of
tethers (long tube-like exetensions); and Ginzburg-Landau phase separation of a

systems. The explanation of the origin of the second law based on these
ingredients goes back to Maxwell, Thomson and particularly Boltzmann. Common
alternate explanations, such as those based on the ergodic or mixing properties
of probability distributions (ensembles) already present for chaotic dynamical
systems having only a few degrees of freedom or on the impossibility of having
a truly isolated system, are either unnecessary, misguided or misleading.
Specific features of macroscopic evolution, such as the diffusion equation, do
however depend on the dynamical instability (deterministic chaos) of
trajectories of isolated macroscopic systems.
  The extensions of these classical notions to the quantum world is in many
ways fairly direct. It does however also bring in some new problems. These will
be discussed but not resolved.

(IRX), the ratio of far IR to far UV luminosity, and specific star formation

above which the SSFR drops increase with redshift (downsizing). At any given
epoch, IRX is an increasing function of mass up to M_0. Above this mass IRX
falls, suggesting gas exhaustion. In a given mass bin below M_0 IRX increases
with time in a fashion consistent with enrichment. We interpret these trends
using a simple model with a Schmidt-Kennicutt law and extinction that tracks
gas density and enrichment. We find that the average IRX and SSFR follows a
galaxy age parameter which is determined mainly by the galaxy mass and time
since formation. We conclude that blue sequence galaxies have properties which
show simple, systematic trends with mass and time such as the steady build-up
of heavy elements in the interstellar media of evolving galaxies and the
exhaustion of gas in galaxies that are evolving off the blue sequence. The IRX
represents a tool for selecting galaxies at various stages of evolution.

measurements to constrain their spectrum and composition as injected from their
sources and, in turn, use these results to estimate the spectrum of cosmogenic
neutrinos generated in their propagation through intergalactic space. We find
that the PAO measurements can be well fit if the injected cosmic rays consist
entirely of nuclei with masses in the intermediate (C, N, O) to heavy (Fe, Si)
range. A mixture of protons and heavier species is also acceptable but (on the
basis of existing hadronic interaction models) injection of pure light nuclei
(p, He) results in unacceptable fits to the new elongation rate data. The
expected spectrum of cosmogenic neutrinos can vary considerably, depending on
the precise spectrum and chemical composition injected from the cosmic ray
sources. In the models where heavy nuclei dominate the cosmic ray spectrum and
few dissociated protons exceed GZK energies, the cosmogenic neutrino flux can
be suppressed by up to two orders of magnitude relative to the all-proton
prediction, making its detection beyond the reach of current and planned
neutrino telescopes. Other models consistent with the data, however, are
proton-dominated with only a small (1-10%) admixture of heavy nuclei and
predict an associated cosmogenic flux within the reach of upcoming experiments.
Thus a detection or non-detection of cosmogenic neutrinos can assist in
discriminating between these possibilities.

methods. These problems are a special case of a more general problem which has
been largely unacknowledged for approximately 25 years, and affects results of
all dark matter simulations on small scales (the definition of 'small' varying
with time). Extensive numerical experiments with multiple types of N-body codes
have demonstrated that spurious fluctuations due to particle discreteness grow
rapidly even in the presence of substantial small-scale power from the intended
model spectrum, and modify the results on scales smaller than the mean comoving
interparticle separation. This implies that the spatial resolution of such
simulations is typically limited not by the force softening length, often
referred to as the 'resolution', and not by the particle density in halos.
Instead it is approximately N^-1/3, where N is the mean particle density, and
of course depends on and improves very slowly with increased number of
particles. This calls into question many results on smaller scales over more

the algebraic combinatoric structures of association schemes such as

this property for these particular networks and assume that all of the

procedure for evaluating effective resistances on these networks. The
preference of this procedure is that one can evaluate effective resistances by
using the structure of their Bose-Mesner algebra without any need to know the

the sample examined, we find no evidence for the association of gravitational
radiation with GRBs, either on a single-GRB basis or on a statistical basis.

in polymer glasses. While stress-strain curves for a wide range of temperature
can be fit to the functional form predicted by entropic network models, many
other results are fundamentally inconsistent with the physical picture
underlying these models. Stresses are too large to be entropic and have the
wrong trend with temperature. The most dramatic hardening at large strains
reflects increases in energy as chains are pulled taut between entanglements
rather than a change in entropy. A weak entropic stress is only observed in
shape recovery of deformed samples when heated above the glass transition.
While short chains do not form an entangled network, they exhibit partial shape
recovery, orientation, and strain hardening. Stresses for all chain lengths
collapse when plotted against a microscopic measure of chain stretching rather
than the macroscopic stretch. The thermal contribution to the stress is
directly proportional to the rate of plasticity as measured by breaking and
reforming of interchain bonds. These observations suggest that the correct
microscopic theory of strain hardening should be based on glassy state physics
rather than rubber elasticity.

using chirped pulses for enhancing charge transfer in unbiased junctions where
the bridging molecule is characterized by a strong charge-transfer transition.
An approximate analytical solution of the resulting dynamical equation is
supported by a full numerical solution. When energy transfer between the
molecule and electron-hole excitations in the leads is absent, the optical
control problem for inducing charge transfer with linearly chirped pulse can be
reduced to the Landau-Zener transition to a decaying level. When chirp is fast
with respect to the rate of the electron transfer, the Landau theory is
recovered. The proposed control mechanism is potentially useful for developing
novel opto-electronic single-electron devices with optical gating based on
molecular nanojunctions.

$d\le \alpha / \beta$. In this paper we show that by introducing high density
of the initial Poisson configuration, limits are obtained for all dimensions,
and they coincide with the previous ones if $d>\alpha/\beta$. We also give
high-density limits for the systems with finite intensity measures (without
high density no limits exist in this case due to extinction); the results are
different and harder to obtain due to the non-invariance of the measure for the
particle motion. In both cases, i.e., Lebesgue and finite intensity measures,
for low dimensions ($d<\alpha(1+\beta)/\beta$ and
$d<\alpha(2+\beta)/(1+\beta)$, respectively) the limits are determined by
non-L\'evy self-similar stable processes. For the corresponding high dimensions
the limits are qualitatively different: ${\cal S}'(R^d)$-valued L\'evy
processes in the Lebesgue case, stable processes constant in time on
$(0,\infty)$ in the finite measure case. For high dimensions, the laws of all
limit processes are expressed in terms of Riesz potentials. If $\beta=1$, the
limits are Gaussian. Limits are also given for particle systems without
branching, which yields in particular weighted fractional Brownian motions in
low dimensions. The results are obtained in the setup of weak convergence of

level of modularity, and to some extent, topological modules of networks
overlap with known functional modules. However, how the modular topology of the

In this work, the functional and evolutionary modularity of Homo sapiens (H.
sapiens) metabolic network were investigated from a topological point of view.
Network decomposition shows that the metabolic network is organized in a highly
modular core-periphery way, in which the core modules are tightly linked
together and perform basic metabolism functions, whereas the periphery modules
only interact with few modules and accomplish relatively independent and
specialized functions. Moreover, over half of the modules exhibit
co-evolutionary feature and belong to specific evolutionary ages. Peripheral
modules tend to evolve more cohesively and faster than core modules do. The
correlation between functional, evolutionary and topological modularity
suggests that the evolutionary history and functional requirements of metabolic
systems have been imprinted in the architecture of metabolic networks. Such
systems level analysis could demonstrate how the evolution of genes may be
placed in a genome-scale network context, giving a novel perspective on
molecular evolution.

downsizing', with the comoving number density of high-luminosity objects
peaking at higher redshifts (z about 2) than low-luminosity AGN (z<1). Aims: We
test whether downsizing is caused by activity shifting towards low-mass black
holes accreting at near-Eddington rates, or by a change in the average rate of
accretion onto supermassive black holes. We estimate the black hole masses and
Eddington ratios of an X-ray selected sample of AGN in the Chandra Deep Field
South at z<1, probing the epoch where AGN cosmic downsizing has been reported.
Methods: Black hole masses are estimated both from host galaxy stellar masses,
which are estimated from fitting to published optical and near-infrared
photometry, and from near-infrared luminosities, applying established
correlations between black hole mass and host galaxy properties. Both methods
give consistent results. Comparison and calibration of possible
redshift-dependent effects is also made using published faint host galaxy
velocity dispersion measurements. Results: The Eddington ratios in our sample
span the range 10^{-5} to 1, with median log(L_bol/L_Edd)=-2.87, and with
typical black hole masses about 10^{8} solar masses. The broad distribution of
Eddington ratios is consistent with that expected for AGN samples at low and
moderate luminosity. We find no evidence that the CDF-S AGN population is
dominated by low-mass black holes accreting at near-Eddington ratios and the
results suggest that diminishing accretion rates onto average-sized black holes
are responsible for the reported AGN downsizing at redshifts below unity.

self-consistent field (SCF) method of simulation of the N-body problem. Our
criterion is based on a comparison of the orbits found in N-body realizations
of analytical potential-density models of triaxial galaxies, in which the
potential is fitted by the SCF method using a variety of basis sets, with those
of the original models. Our tests refer to maximally triaxial Dehnen
gamma-models for values of $\gamma$ in the range 0<=gamma<=1. When an N-body
realization of a model is fitted by the SCF method, the choice of radial basis
functions affects significantly the way the potential, forces, or derivatives
of the forces are reproduced, especially in the central regions of the system.
We find that this results in serious discrepancies in the relative amounts of
chaotic versus regular orbits, or in the distributions of the Lyapunov
characteristic exponents, as found by different basis sets. Numerical tests
include the Clutton-Brock and the Hernquist-Ostriker (HO) basis sets, as well
as a family of numerical basis sets which are `close' to the HO basis set. The
family of numerical basis sets is parametrized in terms of a quantity
$\epsilon$ which appears in the kernel functions of the Sturm-Liouville (SL)
equation defining each basis set. The HO basis set is the $\epsilon=0$ member
of the family. We demonstrate that grid solutions of the SL equation yielding
numerical basis sets introduce large errors in the variational equations of
motion. We propose a quantum-mechanical method of solution of the SL equation
which overcomes these errors. We finally give criteria for a choice of optimal
value of $\epsilon$ and calculate the latter as a function of the value of
gamma.

We harness the sensitivity of the UV to young (<1 Gyr old) stars to quantify
the recent star formation history of early-type galaxies across a range of
luminosities (-23.5 < M(V) < -18). Comparisons to simple stellar populations
forming at high redshift indicate that only ~1.1 percent of early-types in this

recent star formation (RSF) in terms of the mass fraction of stars less than a
Gyr old, we find that the early-type population as a whole shows a typical RSF
between 5 and 13% in the redshift range 0.5<z<1. Early-types on the UV red
sequence show RSF values less than 5% while the reddest early-types are
virtually quiescent with RSF values of ~1%. We find compelling evidence that
early-types of all luminosities form stars over the lifetime of the Universe,
although the bulk of their star formation is already complete at high redshift.
This tail-end of star formation is measurable and not negligible, with luminous
(-23<M(V)<-20.5) early-types potentially forming 10-15% of their mass since

debris discs. Particular attention is paid to UV sputtering of water ice, which
has so far not been studied in detail in this context. We present a
photosputtering model based on available experimental and theoretical studies.
We quantitatively estimate the erosion rate of icy and ice-silicate grains,
under the influence of both sublimation and photosputtering, as a function of
grain size, composition and distance from the star. The effect of erosion on
the grain's location is investigated through numerical simulations coupling the
grain size to its dynamical evolution. Our model predicts that photodesorption
efficiently destroy ice in optically thin discs, even far beyond the
sublimation snow line. For the reference case of beta Pictoris, we find that
only > 5mm grains can keep their icy component for the age of the system in the
50-150AU region. When taking into account the collisional reprocessing of
grains, we show that the water ice survival on grains improves (grains down to
~ 20 um might be partially icy). However, estimates of the amount of gas
photosputtering would produce on such a hypothetical population of big icy
grains lead to values for the OI column density that strongly exceed
observational constraints for beta Pic, thus ruling out the presence of a
significant amount of icy grains in this system. Erosion rates and icy grains
survival timescales are also given for a set of 11 other debris disc systems.
We show that, with the possible exception of M stars, photosputtering cannot be
neglected in calculations of icy grain lifetimes.

derive, for the first time, the typical moonless night-sky optical spectrum for

pollution lines, in particular from Mercury lines, which contribution to the
sky-brightness in the different bands is of the order of ~0.09 mag, ~0.16 mag

moonless night-sky surface brightness are 22.39, 22.86, 22.01, 21.36 and 19.25

particularly dark site for optical observations up to the I-band. The fraction
of astronomical useful nights at the observatory is ~70%, with a ~30% of
photometric nights. The typical extinction at the observatory is k_V~0.15 mag
in the Winter season, with little dispersion. In summer the extinction has a
wider range of values, although it does not reach the extreme peaks observed at
other sites. The median seeing for the last two years (2005-6) was ~0.90"",

have been in the literature for some decades, but their origin has still not
been specifically addressed, although, they could be related to the growth
process of bars. But even though ansae have been known for a long time, no
statistical analysis of their relative frequency of occurrence has been
performed yet. Similarly, there has been no study of the varieties in
morphology of ansae even though significant morphological variations are known
to characterise the features. In this paper, we make a quantitative analysis of

of SB0's show ansae in their bars, thus confirming that ansae are common
features in barred lenticulars. The ansa frequency decreases dramatically with
later types, and hardly any ansae are found in galaxies of type Sb or later.
The bars in galaxies with ansae are stronger in the median than those in
galaxies without ansae, but the presence of inner and outer rings is not
related to the presence of ansae. Implications of these results and theories

detected a trigonometric parallax of 189+/-8 micro-arcsec, corresponding to the
source distance of 5.28 +0.24/-0.22 kpc. This is the smallest parallax ever
measured, and the first one detected beyond 5 kpc. The source distance as well
as proper motions are used to constrain the outer rotation curve of the Galaxy,
demonstrating that the difference of rotation velocities at the Sun and at S269
(which is 13.1 kpc away from the Galaxy's center) is less than 3%. This gives
the strongest constraint on the flatness of the outer rotation curve and
provides a direct confirmation on the existence of large amount of dark matter
in the Galaxy's outer disk.

In this work, we present our recent results by SPheRIO hydrodynamical
calculations inspired by this picture. In our model, multi-strange hadrons go
through chemical freeze-out when the system reaches some temperature close to
the phase transition, stopping to make inelastic collisions, and their
abundances are therefore determined only by partonic EOS. At a lower
temperature thermal freeze-out takes place where elastic collisions are brought
to a halt. We calculate the spectra for various hadrons at different centrality
windows, with chemical and thermal freeze-out temperature being fit as a
function of centrality. As it is shown, the result provides a reasonable
panoramic description of the spectra of identified particles. Chemical
freeze-out gives good correction of the multiplicity of certain species of
particles, especially for multi-strange hadrons.

attention in recent years is the question of multiplicativity of the so-called
maximal output purity (MOP) of a quantum channel. This quantity is defined as
the maximum value of the purity one can get at the output of a channel by
varying over all physical input states, when purity is measured by the Schatten
$q$-norm, and is denoted by $\nu_q$. The multiplicativity problem is the
question whether two channels used in parallel have a combined $\nu_q$ that is
the product of the $\nu_q$ of the two channels. A positive answer would imply a
number of other additivity results in QIT.
  Very recently, P. Hayden has found counterexamples for every value of $q>1$.
Nevertheless, these counterexamples require that the dimension of these
channels increases with $1-q$ and therefore do not rule out multiplicativity
for $q$ in intervals $[1,q_0)$ with $q_0$ depending on the channel dimension. I
argue that this would be enough to prove additivity of entanglement of
formation and of the classical capacity of quantum channels.
  More importantly, no counterexamples have as yet been found in the important
special case where one of the channels is a qubit-channel, i.e. its input
states are 2-dimensional. In this paper I focus attention to this qubit case
and I rephrase the multiplicativity conjecture in the language of block
matrices and prove the conjecture in a number of special cases.

contains naturally the essential aspects of the Higgs fields and its associated
mechanics of mass generation. It permits one also to extend some previous
constructions, as for instance symmetric reduction of (here noncommutative)
connections. From a mathematical point of view, these geometrico-algebraic
considerations highlight some new point on view, in particular we introduce a

D-term contributions to scalar masses. These are generated by the presence of
an anomalous U(1), providing more flexibility in the resulting soft terms, and
are crucial in order to avoid charge and colour breaking minima. Thanks to the

are published here for the first time. The spectroscopic measurements made on
this data set are used determine if these distant SNe comprise a population
similar to those observed locally. Methods: Rest-frame equivalent width and
ejection velocity measurements are made on four spectroscopic features.
Corresponding measurements are presented for a set of 167 spectra from 24 low-z
SNe Ia from the literature. Results: We show that there exists a sample at high
redshift with properties similar to nearby SNe. No significant difference was
found between the distributions of measurements at low and high redsift for
three of the features. The fourth feature displays a possible difference that
should be investigated further. Correlations between Type Ia SNe properties and
host galaxy morphology were also found to be similar at low and high z, and
within each host galaxy class we see no evidence for redshift-evolution in SN
properties. A new correlation between SNe Ia peak magnitude and the equivalent
width of SiII absorption is presented. We demonstrate that this correlation
reduces the scatter in SNe Ia luminosity distances in a manner consistent with
the lightcurve shape-luminosity corrections that are used for Type Ia SNe
cosmology. Conclusions: We show that this new sample of SNLS SNe Ia has
spectroscopic properties similar to nearby objects. (Abridged)

error-in-variables models (SEIVM and FEIVM), revisiting in this context
generalized and modified least squares estimators of the slope and intercept,
and some methods of moments estimators of unknown variances of the measurement
errors. New joint central limit theorems (CLT's) are established for these
estimators in the SEIVM and FEIVM under some first time, so far the most
general, respective conditions on the explanatory variables, and under the
existence of four moments of the measurement errors. Moreover, due to them
being in Studentized forms to begin with, the obtained CLT's are a priori
nearly, or completely, data-based, and free of unknown parameters of the
distribution of the errors and any parameters associated with the explanatory
variables. In contrast, in related CLT's in the literature so far, the
covariance matrices of the limiting normal distributions are, in general,
complicated and depend on various, typically unknown parameters that are hard
to estimate. In addition, the very forms of the CLT's in the present paper are
universal for the SEIVM and FEIVM. This extends a previously known interplay
between a SEIVM and a FEIVM. Moreover, though the particular methods and
details of the proofs of the CLT's in the SEIVM and FEIVM that are established
in this paper are quite different, a unified general scheme of these proofs is
constructed for the two models herewith.

around an expanding Friedmann--Robertson--Walker universe decay. This makes
them largely irrelevant for late time cosmology, assuming that all modes
started out at a similar magnitude at some early stage. By now, however,
bouncing models are frequently considered which exhibit a collapsing phase.
Before this phase reaches a minimum size and re-expands, vector modes grow.
Such modes are thus relevant for the bounce and may even signal the breakdown
of perturbation theory if the growth is too strong. Here, a gauge invariant
formulation of vector mode perturbations in Hamiltonian cosmology is presented.
This lays out a framework for studying possible canonical quantum gravity
effects, such as those of loop quantum gravity, at an effective level. As an
explicit example, typical quantum corrections, namely those coming from inverse
densitized triad components and holonomies, are shown to increase the growth
rate of vector perturbations in the contracting phase, but only slightly.
Effects at the bounce of the background geometry can, however, be much
stronger.

main-sequence and non-accreting T Tauri stars (Telleschi et al. 2007). We
compare these samples to identify the source of the excess. A sample of
recently discovered X-ray stars with a soft component attributed to jet
emission is also considered. We discuss data obtained from the XMM-Newton
Extended Survey of the Taurus Molecular Cloud (XEST) project, complemented by
data from the published literature. We also present data from the CTTS RU Lup.
All CTTS in the sample show an anomalous OVII/OVIII flux ratio when compared
with WTTS or MS stars. The anomaly is due to an excess of cool, OVII emitting
material rather than a deficiency of hotter plasma. The excess plasma must
therefore have temperatures of <~2 MK. This soft excess does not correlate with
UV excesses of CTTS, but seems to be related with the stellar X-ray luminosity.
The spectra of the jet-driving TTS do not fit into this picture. The soft
excess depends both on the presence of accretion streams in CTTS and on
magnetic activity. The gas may be shock-heated near the surface, although it
may also be heated in the magnetospheric accretion funnels. The soft component
of the jet-driving sources is unlikely to be due to the same process.

Lett. 100, 159701 (2008)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.159701",,"cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  In a recent interesting Letter Contucci {\it et al.} have investigated
several properties of the three-dimensional (3d) Edwards-Anderson (EA) Ising
spin glass. They claim to have found strong numerical evidence for the presence
of a complex ultrametric structure similar to the one described by the replica
symmetry breaking solution of the mean field model. We illustrate by numerical
simulations that the relations used by Contucci {\it et al.} as evidence for an
ultrametric structure in the 3d EA model are fulfilled to similar accuracy in
the two-dimensional EA model, which is well-described by the droplet picture
and has no spin glass phase at finite temperature. We conclude that the data
presented in the Contucci {\it et al.} Letter is not sufficient to dismiss the
possibility that, e.g., the droplet model might describe the behavior of the 3d
EA model.

  effective magnetic fields","7 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cond-mat.other",,"  We numerically simulate vortex nucleation in a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC)
subject to an effective magnetic field. The effective magnetic field is
generated from the interplay between light with a non-trivial phase structure
and the BEC, and can be shaped and controlled by appropriate modifications to
the phase and intensity of the light. We demonstrate that the nucleation of
vortices is seeded by instabilities in surface excitations which are coupled to
by an asymmetric trapping potential (similar to the case of condensates subject
to mechanical rotation) and show that this picture also holds when the applied
effective magnetic field is not homogeneous. The eventual configuration of
vortices in the cloud depends on the geometry of the applied field.

general relativity inevitably indicates an intrinsic imprecision in space-time
structure which has to do with space-time dimension as well. The operational
dimension of space-time turns out to be a scale dependent quantity slightly
smaller than four at distances $\gg l_P$. Close to the Planck length the
deviation of space-time dimension from four becomes appreciable. The
experimental bounds on the deviation of space-time dimension from four coming
from the electron ${\tt g} - 2$ factor, Lamb shift in hydrogen atom and the
perihelion shift in the planetary motion are still far from the theoretical
predictions.

initial center-of-mass energy of 500 GeV which is upgradable to about 1 TeV
later on. Its goal is to study the physics at TeV scale with unprecedented high
sensitivities. The main topics include precision measurements of the Higgs
particle properties, studies of supersymmtric particles and the underlying
theoretical structure if supersymmetry turns out to be realized in nature,
probing alternative possibilities for the origin of mass, and the cosmological
connections thereof. In many channels, Higgs and leptonic sector in particular,
ILC is substantially more sensitive than LHC, and is complementary to LHC
overall. In this short article, we will have a quick look at the capabilities
of ILC.

with meson field self-interactions, those with density-dependent meson-nucleon
couplings, and the point-coupling models without meson fields, we have studied
the isospin-dependent bulk and single-particle properties of asymmetric nuclear
matter. In particular, we have determined the density dependence of nuclear
symmetry energy from these different relativistic mean-field models and compare
the results with the constraints recently extracted from analyses of
experimental data on isospin diffusion and isotopic scaling in
intermediate-energy heavy ion collisions as well as from measured isotopic
dependence of the giant monopole resonances in even-A Sn isotopes. Among the 23
parameter sets in the relativistic mean-filed model that are commonly used for
nuclear structure studies, only a few are found to give symmetry energies that
are consistent with the empirical constraints. We have also studied the nuclear
symmetry potential and the isospin-splitting of the nucleon effective mass in
isospin asymmetric nuclear matter. We find that both the momentum dependence of
the nuclear symmetry potential at fixed baryon density and the
isospin-splitting of the nucleon effective mass in neutron-rich nuclear matter
depend not only on the nuclear interactions but also on the definition of the
nucleon optical potential.
