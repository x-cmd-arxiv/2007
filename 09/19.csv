using Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). The resulting distribution in the
two-jet region T~1 is found to agree with the corresponding expression derived
by the standard approach. A matching procedure to account for finite
corrections at T < 1 is then described. There are two important advantages of
the SCET approach. First, SCET manifests a dynamical seesaw scale q = p^2/Q in
addition to the center-of-mass energy Q and the jet mass scale p ~ Q ~ sqrt(1 -
T). Thus, the resummation of logs of p/q can be cleanly distinguished from the
resummation of logs of Q/p. Second, finite parts of loop amplitudes appear in
specific places in the perturbative distribution: in the matching to the hard
function, at the scale Q, in matching to the jet function, at the scale p, and
in matching to the soft function, at the scale q. This allows for a consistent
merger of fixed order corrections and resummation. In particular, the total NLO
e+e- cross section is reproduced from these finite parts without having to
perform additional infrared regulation.

coined thermal fragility. The autocorrelation time for the non-local

then these autocorrelation times, albeit finite, can be made large. The
physical engine behind the loss of correlations at large spatial and/or

understand the range of shapes observed in the outer envelopes of PNe, we have
run a comprehensive set of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, from the
beginning of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) superwind phase until the end of
the post--AGB/PN phase. A 'triple-wind' model is used, including a slow AGB
wind, fast post--AGB wind and third wind reflecting the linear movement through
the ISM. A wide range of stellar velocities, mass-loss rates and ISM densities
have been considered. We find ISM interaction strongly affects outer PN
structures, with the dominant shaping occuring during the AGB phase. The
simulations predict four stages of PN--ISM interaction whereby the PN is
initially unaffected (1), then limb-brightened in the direction of motion (2),
then distorted with the star moving away from the geometric centre (3) and
finally so distorted that the object is no longer recognisable as a PN and may
not be classed as such (4). Parsec-size shells around PN are predicted to be
common. The structure and brightness of ancient PNe is largely determined by
the ISM interaction, caused by rebrightening during the second stage; this
effect may address the current discrepancies in Galactic PN abundance. The
majority of PNe will have tail structures. Evidence for strong interaction is
found for all known planetary nebulae in globular clusters.

ground state in a tangent bifurcation. This indicates the existence of an
unstable collectively excited state of the condensate for negative scattering

new kind of traffic phenomenon called neo-synchronized flow is resulted.
Furthermore, we give the criterion for distinguishing the high-speed and
low-speed neo-synchronized flows and clarify the mechanism of this kind of
traffic phenomena. In addition, the result that the time evolution of
distribution of headways is displayed as a normal distribution further
validates the reasonability of the neo-synchronized flow. These findings
suggest that the diversity and randomicity of drivers and vehicles has indeed
remarkable effect on traffic dynamics.

interacting soft colloidal particles has been developed, based on the solution
of liquid-state integral equations. The Ornstein-Zernike equation is solved to
provide a mesoscopic description of the diblock copolymer system at the level
of block centers of mass, and at the level of polymer centers of mass.
Analytical forms of the total correlation functions for block-block,
block-monomer, and center-of-mass pairs are obtained for a liquid of
structurally symmetric diblock copolymers as a function of temperature,
density, chain length, and chain composition. The theory correctly predicts
thermodynamically-driven segregation of diblocks into microdomains as a
function of temperature ($chi$ parameter). The coarse-grained description
contains contributions from density and concentration fluctuations, with the
latter becoming dominant as temperature decreases. Numerical calculations for
the block coarse-grained total correlation functions, as a function of the
proximity of the system to its phase transition, are presented. Comparison with
united atom molecular dynamics simulations are carried out in the athermal
regime, where simulations and theory quantitatively agree with no need of
adjustable parameters.

terms of dispersion integrals. We show that the Sudakov exponent can be written
as a dispersion integral over spectral density functions, weighted by
characteristic functions that encode information on power corrections. The
characteristic functions are defined and computed analytically in the
large-beta_0 limit. The spectral density functions encapsulate the non-Abelian
nature of the interaction. They are defined by the time-like discontinuity of
specific effective charges (couplings) that are directly related to the
familiar Sudakov anomalous dimensions and can be computed order-by-order in
perturbation theory. The dispersive approach provides a realization of Dressed
Gluon Exponentiation, where Sudakov resummation is enhanced by an internal
resummation of running-coupling corrections. We establish all-order relations
between the scheme-invariant Borel formulation and the dispersive one, and
address the difference in the treatment of power corrections. We find that in
the context of Sudakov resummation the infrared-finite-coupling hypothesis is
of special interest because the relevant coupling can be uniquely identified to
any order, and may have an infrared fixed point already at the perturbative
level. We prove that this infrared limit is universal: it is determined by the
cusp anomalous dimension. To illustrate the formalism we discuss a few examples
including B-meson decay spectra, deep inelastic structure functions and
Drell-Yan or Higgs production.

dust continuum shape exhibits a strong peak at 21 micron. A line-free map of 21
micron-peak dust made from the 19-23 micron range closely resembles the [Ar

in the ejecta. Spectral fitting implies the presence of SiO2, Mg
protosilicates, and FeO grains in these regions. The second dust type exhibits
a rising continuum up to 21 micron and then flattens thereafter. This ``weak 21
micron'' dust is likely composed of Al2O3 and C grains. The third dust
continuum shape is featureless with a gently rising spectrum and is likely
composed of MgSiO3 and either Al2O3 or Fe grains. Using the least massive
composition for each of the three dust classes yields a total mass of 0.02
Msun. Using the most-massive composition yields a total mass of 0.054 Msun. The
primary uncertainty in the total dust mass stems from the selection of the dust
composition necessary for fitting the featureless dust as well as 70 micron

collapse of a prestellar dense core. We investigate the effect of the magnetic
field during the first collapse up to the formation of the firstcore, focusing
particularly on the magnetic braking and the launching of outflows. We perform
3D AMR high resolution numerical simulations of a magnetically supercritical
collapsing dense core using the RAMSES MHD code and develop semi-analytical
models that we compare with the numerical results. We study in detail the
various profiles within the envelope of the collapsing core for various
magnetic field strengths. Even modest values of magnetic field strength modify
the collapse significantly. This is largely due to the amplification of the
radial and toroidal components of the magnetic field by the differential
motions within the collapsing core. For a weak magnetic intensity corresponding
to an initial mass-to-flux over critical mass-to-flux ratio, $\mu$ equals to
20, a centrifugally supported disk forms. The strong differential rotation
triggers the growth of a slowly expanding magnetic tower. For a higher magnetic
field strengths corresponding to $\mu=2$, the collapse occurs primarily along
the field lines, therefore delivering weaker angular momentum in the inner part
whereas at the same time, strong magnetic braking occurs. As a consequence no
centrifugally supported disk forms. An outflow is launched from the central
thermally supported core. Detailed comparisons with existing analytical
predictions indicate that it is magneto-centrifugally driven. For cores having
a mass-to-flux over critical mass-to-flux radio $\mu < 5$, the magnetic field
appears to have a significant impact.....

therefore important for our understanding of the star formation process, to
investigate the fragmentation of dense molecular cores. We study the influence
of the magnetic field, ideally coupled to the gas, on the fragmentation in
multiple systems of collapsing cores. We present high resolution numerical
simulations performed with the RAMSES MHD code starting with a uniform sphere
in solid body rotation and a uniform magnetic field parallel to the rotation
axis. We pay particular attention to the strength of the magnetic field and
interpret the results using the analysis presented in a companion paper. The
results depend much on the amplitude, $A$, of the perturbations seeded
initially. For a low amplitude, $A=0.1$, we find that for values of the
mass-to-flux over critical mass-to-flux ratio, $\mu$, as high as $\mu = 20$,
the centrifugally supported disk which fragments in the hydrodynamical case, is
stabilized and remains axisymmetric. Detailed investigations reveals that this
is due to the rapid growth of the toroidal magnetic field induced by the
differential motions within the disk. For values of $\mu$ smaller $\simeq 5$,
corresponding to larger magnetic intensities, there is no centrifugally
supported disk because of magnetic braking. When the amplitude of the
perturbation is equal to $A=0.5$, each initial peak develops independently and
the core fragments for a large range of $\mu$. Only for values of $\mu$ close
to 1 is the magnetic field able to prevent the fragmentation. Since a large
fraction of stars are binaries, the results of low magnetic intensities
preventing the fragmentation in case of weak perturbations, is problematic. We
discuss three possible mechanisms...

Significantly revised with additional results",,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the evolution of a family of 2D dispersive turbulence models. The
members of this family involve the nonlinear advection of a dynamically active
scalar field, the locality of the streamfunction-scalar relation is denoted by
$\alpha$, with smaller $\alpha$ implying increased locality. The dispersive
nature arises via a linear term whose strength is characterized by a parameter
$\epsilon$. Setting $0 < \epsilon \le 1$, we investigate the interplay of
advection and dispersion for differing degrees of locality. Specifically, we
study the forward (inverse) transfer of enstrophy (energy) under large-scale
(small-scale) random forcing. Straightforward arguments suggest that for small
$\alpha$ the scalar field should consist of progressively larger eddies, while
for large $\alpha$ the scalar field is expected to have a filamentary structure
resulting from a stretch and fold mechanism. Confirming this, we proceed to
forced/dissipative dispersive numerical experiments under weakly non-local to
local conditions. For $\epsilon \sim 1$, there is quantitative agreement
between non-dispersive estimates and observed slopes in the inverse energy
transfer regime. On the other hand, forward enstrophy transfer regime always
yields slopes that are significantly steeper than the corresponding
non-dispersive estimate. Additional simulations show the scaling in the inverse
regime to be sensitive to the strength of the dispersive term : specifically,
as $\epsilon$ decreases, the inertial-range shortens and we also observe that
the slope of the power-law decreases. On the other hand, for the same range of
$\epsilon$ values, the forward regime scaling is fairly universal.

by mechanisms such as dynamical symmetry breaking etc, the high sensitivity of
the energy scale parameter (\Lambda) to the dimensionless coupling constant can
affect the reliability of the sensitivity parameter through the renormalization

are similar to the problems associated with the time-varying coupling constant

of quantum gravity that also has a well defined semi-classical interpretation
as the quantum version of a classical spacetime, namely de Sitter or anti-de
sitter space. Despite this, the state fails to pass some of the key tests of a
physically realistic quantum state. In an attempt to resolve this problem, we
track down the root of the problem to a choice for a particular parameter: the
Immirzi parameter. The Kodama state takes this parameter to be complex, whereas
modern formulations of canonical quantum gravity require that the parameter is
real. We generalize the Kodama state to real values of the Immirzi parameter,
and find that the generalization opens up a large Hilbert space of states, one
of which can be directly interpreted as particular slicing of de Sitter space.
We then show that these states resolve, or are expected to resolve many of the
problems associated with the original version of the Kodama state. In order to
resolve the interpretation of the multitude of states, we develop a new model
of covariant classical and quantum gravity where the full Lorentz group is
retained as a local symmetry group, and the canonical evolution generated by
the constraints has a close relation to a larger group: the de Sitter group.
This formalism gives strong evidence that the multitude of generalized Kodama
states can be unified into a single quantum state that is quantum de Sitter
space.

galaxies with weak emission lines. At high redshifts,however, most known radio
AGN have strong emission lines. In this paper, we examine a subset of radio AGN
with emission lines selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The probability
for a nearby radio AGN to have emission lines is a strongly decreasing function
of galaxy mass and an increasing function of radio luminosity above 10^25 W/Hz.
Emission line and radio luminosities are correlated, but with large dispersion.
At a given radio power, AGN with small black holes have higher [OIII]
luminosities (which we interpret as higher accretion rates) than AGN with big
black holes. However, if we scale both radio and emission line luminosities by
the black hole mass, we find a correlation between normalized radio power and
accretion rate in Eddington units that is independent of black hole mass. There
is also a clear correlation between normalized radio power and the age of the
stellar population in the galaxy. Present-day AGN with the highest normalized
radio powers are confined to galaxies with small black holes. High-redshift,
high radio-luminosity AGN could be explained if big black holes were similarly
active at earlier cosmic epochs. To investigate why only a small fraction of
emission line AGN become radio loud, we create matched samples of radio-loud
and radio-quiet AGN and compare their host galaxy properties and environments.
The main difference lies in their environments; our local density estimates are
a factor 2 larger around the radio-loud AGN. We propose a scenario in which
radio-loud AGN with emission lines are located in galaxies where accretion of
both cold and hot gas can occur simultaneously. (Abridged)

term takes a specific form, \Gamma=\Gamma(\phi), analyzing two models in the

developing intuition about the predictions from these models through analytic
approximations, we compute the predicted cosmological observables through full
numerical evolution of the equations of motion, relating the mass scale and
scale of dissipation to the characteristic amplitude and shape of the
primordial power spectrum. We then use Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to
constrain a subset of the models with cosmological data from the cosmic
microwave background (WMAP three-year data) and large scale structure (SDSS
Luminous Red Galaxy power spectrum). We find that the posterior distributions
of the dissipative parameters are highly non-Gaussian and their allowed ranges
agree well with the expectations obtained using analytic approximations. In the
weak regime, only the mass scale is tightly constrained; conversely, in the
strong regime, only the dissipative coefficient is tightly constrained. A lower
limit is seen on the inflation scale: a sub-Planckian inflaton is disfavoured
by the data. In both weak and strong regimes, we reconstruct the limits on the
primordial power spectrum and show that these models prefer a {\it red}
spectrum, with no significant running of the index. We calculate the reheat
temperature and show that the gravitino problem can be overcome with large
dissipation, which in turn leads to large levels of non-Gaussianity: if
dissipative inflation is to evade the gravitino problem, the predicted level of
non-Gaussianity might be seen by the Planck satellite.

range from 1 Myr to 10 Myrs throughout the rings. We find that approximately
half of the rings contain azimuthal age gradients that encompass at least 25%
of the ring, although there is no apparent relationship between the presence or
absence of age gradients and the morphology of the rings or their host
galaxies. NGC1343, NGC1530, and NGC4321 show clear bipolar age gradients, where
the youngest HII regions are located near the two contact points of the bar and

increased mass inflow rate and/or an overall higher gas density in the ring,
which would allow for massive star formation to occur on short timescales,
after which the galactic rotation would transport the HII regions around the
ring as they age. Two-thirds of the barred galaxies show correlation between
the locations of the youngest HII region(s) in the ring and the location of the

more general formulation of the TFT junction we allow for potential scattering
at the barrier and an arbitrary orientation of the ferromagnetic moment.
Several new effects are found upon the inclusion of these extra terms: for
example, we find that a Josephson current can flow even when there is vanishing
phase difference between the superconducting condensates on either side of the
barrier. The critical current for a barrier with magnetization parallel to the
interface is calculated as a function of the junction parameters, and is found
to display strong non-analyticities. Furthermore, the Josephson current
switches first identified in our previous work are found to be robust features
of the junction, while the unconventional temperature-dependence of the current
is very sensitive to the extra terms in the barrier Hamiltonian.

thousands, of features in regression and classification problems.
  There are two situations where such high dimensional features arise. One is
when high dimensional measurements are available, for example, gene expression
data produced by microarray techniques. For computational or other reasons,
people may select only a small subset of features when modelling such data, by
looking at how relevant the features are to predicting the response, based on
some measure such as correlation with the response in the training data.
Although it is used very commonly, this procedure will make the response appear
more predictable than it actually is. In Chapter 2, we propose a Bayesian
method to avoid this selection bias, with application to naive Bayes models and
mixture models.
  High dimensional features also arise when we consider high-order
interactions. The number of parameters will increase exponentially with the
order considered. In Chapter 3, we propose a method for compressing a group of
parameters into a single one, by exploiting the fact that many predictor
variables derived from high-order interactions have the same values for all the
training cases. The number of compressed parameters may have converged before
considering the highest possible order. We apply this compression method to
logistic sequence prediction models and logistic classification models.
  We use both simulated data and real data to test our methods in both
chapters.

large-scale real-world networks require a priori information such as the number
and sizes of communities or are computationally expensive. In this paper we
investigate a simple label propagation algorithm that uses the network
structure alone as its guide and requires neither optimization of a pre-defined
objective function nor prior information about the communities. In our
algorithm every node is initialized with a unique label and at every step each
node adopts the label that most of its neighbors currently have. In this
iterative process densely connected groups of nodes form a consensus on a
unique label to form communities. We validate the algorithm by applying it to
networks whose community structures are known. We also demonstrate that the
algorithm takes an almost linear time and hence it is computationally less
expensive than what was possible so far.

Survey provides, for the first time, a sample of 6 AM CVn stars (out of a total

the population in some detail.
  We use the Sloan sample to `calibrate' theoretical population synthesis
models for the space density of AM CVn stars. We consider optimistic and
pessimistic models for different theoretical formation channels, which yield
predictions for the local space density that are more than two orders of
magnitude apart. When calibrated with the observations, all models give a local
space density of 1-3x10^{-6} pc^{-3}, which is lower than expected.
  We discuss the implications for the formation of AM CVn stars, and conclude
that at least one of the dominant formation channels (the double-degenerate
channel) has to be suppressed relative to the optimistic models. In the
framework of the current models this suggests that the mass transfer between
white dwarfs usually cannot be stabilized. We furthermore discuss evolutionary
effects that have so far not been considered in population synthesis models,
but which could be of influence for the observed population. We finish by
remarking that, with our lower space density, the expected number of Galactic
AM CVn stars resolvable by gravitational-wave detectors like LISA should be
lowered from current estimates, to about 1,000 for a mission duration of one

its relative closeness to the orbital period minimum for hydrogen-rich donors,
there is no evidence for hydrogen in the spectra. We thus classify SDSS J1552

V396 Hya (P=65.5 min). The continuum of SDSS J1552 is compatible with either a
blackbody or helium atmosphere of 12,000-15,000 K. If this represents the

Ly-alpha absorbers (such as gas rich galaxies) down to a redshift z~3.5. The
inferred power spectrum of 21cm fluctuations at all redshifts will show
acoustic oscillations, whose co-moving scale can be used as a standard ruler to
infer the evolution of the equation of state for the dark energy. We find that
the first generation of low-frequency experiments (such as MWA or LOFAR) will
be able to constrain the acoustic scale to within a few percent in a redshift
window just prior to the end of the reionization era, provided that foregrounds
can be removed over frequency band-passes of >8MHz. This sensitivity to the
acoustic scale is comparable to the best current measurements from galaxy
redshift surveys, but at much higher redshifts. Future extensions of the first
generation experiments (involving an order of magnitude increase in the
antennae number of the MWA) could reach sensitivities below one percent in
several redshift windows and could be used to study the dark energy in the
unexplored redshift regime of 3.5<z<12. Moreover, new experiments with antennae
designed to operate at higher frequencies would allow precision measurements
(<1%) of the acoustic peak to be made at more moderate redshifts (1.5<z<3.5),
where they would be competitive with ambitious spectroscopic galaxy surveys
covering more than 1000 square degrees. Together with other data sets,
observations of 21cm fluctuations will allow full coverage of the acoustic
scale from the present time out to z~12.

profile - frequency evolutions (which we call as ""beam evolution"" figure), e.g.
some pulsars show that mean pulse profiles are wider and core emission is
higher at higher frequencies than that at lower frequencies, but some other
pulsars show completely the contrary results. We show that all these ""beam

principle. In addition, the equations of continuity and entropy are derived
from the variations. Equations of conserved currents are deduced as the Noether
theorem in the space of Lagrangian coordinate $\ba$. Without $\Lambda_A$, the
action principle results in the Clebsch solution with vanishing helicity. The
Lagrangian $\Lambda_A$ yields non-vanishing vorticity and provides a source
term of non-vanishing helicity. The vorticity equation is derived as an
equation of the gauge field, and the $\Lambda_A$ characterizes topology of the
field. The present formulation is comprehensive and provides a consistent basis
for a unique transformation between the Lagrangian $\ba$ space and the Eulerian
$\bx$ space. In contrast, with translation symmetry alone, there is an
arbitrariness in the ransformation between these spaces.

amount of extended ionized gas structures, in some cases at kpc-distance away
from any place of current star forming activity. A kinematic analysis of
especially the faint structures in the halo of dwarf galaxies allows insights
into the properties and the origin of this gas component. This is important for
the chemical evolution of galaxies, the enrichment of the intergalactic medium,
and for the understanding of the formation of galaxies in the early universe.
  Aims: We want to investigate whether the ionized gas detected in two
irregular dwarf galaxies (NGC 2366 and NGC 4861) stays gravitationally bound to
the host galaxy or can escape from it by becoming a freely flowing wind.
  Methods: Very deep H\alpha images of NGC 2366 and NGC 4861 were obtained to
detect and catalog both small and large scale ionized gas structures down to
very low surface brightnesses. Subsequently, high-resolution long-slit echelle
spectroscopy of the H\alpha line was performed for a detailed kinematic
analysis of the most prominent filaments and shells. To calculate the escape
velocity of both galaxies and to compare it with the derived expansion
velocities of the detected filaments and shells, we used dark matter halo
models.
  Results: We detected a huge amount of both small scale (up to a few hundred
pc) and large scale (about 1-2 kpc of diameter or length) ionized gas
structures on our H\alpha images. Many of the fainter ones are new detections.
The echelle spectra reveal outflows and expanding bubbles/shells with
velocities between 20 and 110 km/s. Several of these structures are in
accordance with filaments in the H\alpha images. A comparison with the escape
velocities of the galaxies derived from the NFW dark matter halo model shows
that all gas features stay gravitationally bound.

report results in the sequential double ionization regime above 2 10^{14}

metallicities has yet to be found. Here, we report on a new artificial
intelligence-based approach to determine metallicity indicators that shows
promise for the provision of improved empirical fits. The method hinges on the
application of an evolutionary neural network to observational emission line
data. The network's DNA, encoded in its architecture, weights and neuron
transfer functions, is evolved using a genetic algorithm. Furthermore,
selection, operating on a set of 10 distinct neuron transfer functions, means
that the empirical relation encoded in the network solution architecture is in
functional rather than numerical form. Thus the network solutions provide an
equation for the metallicity in terms of line ratios without a priori
assumptions. Tapping into the mathematical power offered by this approach, we
applied the network to detailed observations of both nebula and auroral
emission lines in the optical for a sample of 96 HII-type regions and we were
able to obtain an empirical relation between Z and S23 with a dispersion of

surfaces. Since then, the link between matrix models and combinatorics of
discrete surfaces has strongly tightened. This manuscript aims to investigate
these deep links and extend them beyond the matrix models, following my work's
evolution. First, I take care to define properly the hermitian 2 matrix model
which gives rise to generating functions of discrete surfaces equipped with a
spin structure. Then, I show how to compute all the terms in the topological
expansion of any observable by using algebraic geometry tools. They are
obtained as differential forms on an algebraic curve associated to the model:
the spectral curve. In a second part, I show how to define such differentials
on any algebraic curve even if it does not come from a matrix model. I then
study their numerous symmetry properties under deformations of the algebraic
curve. In particular, I show that these objects coincide with the topological
expansion of the observable of a matrix model if the algebraic curve is the
spectral curve of this model. Finally, I show that fine tuning the parameters
ensure that these objects can be promoted to modular invariants and satisfy the
holomorphic anomaly equation of the Kodaira-Spencer theory. This gives a new
hint that the Dijkgraaf-Vafa conjecture is correct.

A key example is the
measurement of optical phase, used in length metrology and many other
applications. Advances in precision measurement have consistently led to
important scientific discoveries. At the fundamental level, measurement
precision is limited by the number N of quantum resources (such as photons)
that are used. Standard measurement schemes, using each resource independently,
lead to a phase uncertainty that scales as 1/sqrt(N) - known as the standard
quantum limit. However, it has long been conjectured that it should be possible
to achieve a precision limited only by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,
dramatically improving the scaling to 1/N. It is commonly thought that
achieving this improvement requires the use of exotic quantum entangled states,
such as the NOON state. These states are extremely difficult to generate.
Measurement schemes with counted photons or ions have been performed with N <=
6, but few have surpassed the standard quantum limit and none have shown
Heisenberg-limited scaling. Here we demonstrate experimentally a
Heisenberg-limited phase estimation procedure. We replace entangled input
states with multiple applications of the phase shift on unentangled
single-photon states. We generalize Kitaev's phase estimation algorithm using
adaptive measurement theory to achieve a standard deviation scaling at the
Heisenberg limit. For the largest number of resources used (N = 378), we
estimate an unknown phase with a variance more than 10 dB below the standard
quantum limit; achieving this variance would require more than 4,000 resources
using standard interferometry. Our results represent a drastic reduction in the
complexity of achieving quantum-enhanced measurement precision.

{intrinsic} to Einstein's Theory. The road leading to this generalization
starts, in the very spirit of Relativity, from enhancing full equivalence
between the four spacetime directions by requiring full equivalence between the
""motions"" along these four spacetime directions as well. So far, no measurable
spatial velocity in the direction of the time axis has ever been defined, on
the same footing of the usual velocities in the local three-space of a given

time- and space-velocity vectors sum up to define a spacelike ""world-velocity""
vector, the modulus of which turns out to be equal to the Maxwell's constant c,
irrespective of the observer who measures it. This {measurable} world-velocity
therefore represents the speed at which ""all"" kinds of particles move in

distributions of magnetic flux are investigated in the context of the
solar-stellar connection by applying the solar flux eruption and surface flux
transport models to stars with different rotation rates, mass, and evolutionary
stage. The rise of magnetic flux tubes through the convection zone is primarily
buoyancy-driven, though their evolution can be strongly affected by the
Coriolis force. The poleward deflection of the tube's trajectory increases with
the stellar rotation rate, which provides an explanation for magnetic flux
eruption at high latitudes. The formation of proper polar spots likely requires
the assistance of meridional flows both before and after the eruption of
magnetic flux on the stellar surface. Since small radiative cores support the
eruption of flux tubes at high latitudes, low-mass pre-main sequence stars are
predicted to show high mean latitudes of flux emergence. In addition to flux
eruption at high latitudes, main sequence components of close binary systems
show spot distributions which are non-uniform in longitude. Yet these
`preferred longitudes' of flux eruption are expected to vanish beyond a certain

composed of spatio-temporal patterns associated to numerous and various
phenomena. Bayesian methods have been previously proposed in (Heas and Datcu,
2005) to code the information contained in satellite image sequences in a graph
representation using Bayesian methods. Based on such a representation, this
paper further presents a supervised learning methodology of semantics
associated to spatio-temporal patterns occurring in satellite image sequences.
It enables the recognition and the probabilistic retrieval of similar events.
Indeed, graphs are attached to statistical models for spatio-temporal
processes, which at their turn describe physical changes in the observed scene.
Therefore, we adjust a parametric model evaluating similarity types between
graph patterns in order to represent user-specific semantics attached to
spatio-temporal phenomena. The learning step is performed by the incremental
definition of similarity types via user-provided spatio-temporal pattern
examples attached to positive or/and negative semantics. From these examples,
probabilities are inferred using a Bayesian network and a Dirichlet model. This
enables to links user interest to a specific similarity model between graph
patterns. According to the current state of learning, semantic posterior
probabilities are updated for all possible graph patterns so that similar
spatio-temporal phenomena can be recognized and retrieved from the image

inclusion of so-called AGN feedback. The energy input from an active central
massive black hole is invoked to suppress star formation in early-type galaxies
at later epochs. A major problem is that this process is poorly understood, and
compelling observational evidence for its mere existence is still missing. In
search for signatures of AGN feedback, we have compiled a sample of 16,000
early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.05<z<0.1 from the SDSS database.
Key in our approach is the use of a purely morphological selection criterion
through visual inspection which produces a sample that is not biased against
recent star formation and nuclear activity. The objects with emission (~20 per
cent) are offset from the red sequence and form a well-defined pattern in the
colour-mass diagram. Star forming early-types inhabit the blue cloud, while
early-types with AGN are located considerably closer to and almost on the red
sequence. Star formation-AGN composites are found right between these two
extremes. We further derive galaxy star formation histories using a novel
method that combines multiwavelength photometry from near-UV to near-IR and
stellar absorption indices. We find that in those objects deviating from the
red sequence star formation occurred several 100 Myr in the past involving 1-10
per cent of the total stellar mass. We identify an evolutionary sequence from
star formation via nuclear activity to quiescence. This transition process
lasts about 1 Gyr, and the peak AGN phase occurs roughly half a Gyr after the
starburst. The most likely interpretation is that star formation is suppressed
by nuclear activity in these objects before they settle on the red sequence.

believed to arise in plasma shock environments in extragalactic sources. In
this paper, we present a systematic study of particle acceleration by
relativistic shocks, in particular concerning the dependence on bulk Lorentz
factor and the angle between the magnetic field and the shockflow. For the
first time, simulation results of super- and subluminal shocks with boost
factors up to $\Gamma=1000$ are investigated and compared systematically. While
superluminal shocks are shown to be inefficient at the highest energies
($E>10^{18.5}$ eV), subluminal shocks may provide particles up to $10^{21}$ eV,
limited only by the Hillas-criterion. For the subluminal case, we find that
mildly relativistic shocks, thought to occur in jets of Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN, $\Gamma\sim 10-30$) yield energy spectra of $dN/dE\sim E^{-2}$. Highly
relativistic shocks expected in Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs, $100<\Gamma<1000$), on
the other hand, have spectra as flat as $E^{-1.5}$. The model results are
compared to the measured flux of Cosmic Rays at the highest energies and it is
shown that, while AGN spectra are well-suited, GRB spectra are too flat to
explain the observed flux. The first evidence of a correlation between the
Cosmic Ray flux above $5.7\cdot 10^{10}$ GeV and the distribution of AGN by
Auger are explained by the model. Neutrino production is expected in GRBs,
either in mildly or highly relativistic shocks and although these sources are
excluded as the principle origin of UHECRs, superluminal shocks in particular
may be observable via neutrino and photon fluxes, rather than as protons.

efficient in data complexity and is based on hypergraphs. More expressive forms
of taxonomies are also investigated, which however lead to intractability. We
then move to the distributed case, and introduce a logical model of a network
of taxonomy-based sources. On such network, a distributed version of the
centralized algorithm is then presented, based on a message passing paradigm,
and its correctness is proved. We finally discuss optimization issues, and
relate our work to the literature.

diodes (APD) for characterising photon statistics at high data rates. To
identify the regime of linear APD operation we employ a ps-pulsed diode laser
with variable repetition rates between 0.5MHz and 80MHz. We modify the mean
optical power of the coherent pulses by applying different levels of
well-calibrated attenuation. The linearity at high repetition rates is limited
by the APD dead time and a non-linear response arises at higher photon-numbers
due to multiphoton events. Assuming Poissonian input light statistics we
ascertain the effective mean photon-number of the incident light with high
accuracy. Time multiplexed detectors (TMD) allow to accomplish photon- number
resolution by photon chopping. This detection setup extends the linear response
function to higher photon-numbers and statistical methods may be used to
compensate for non-linearity. We investigated this effect, compare it to the
single APD case and show the validity of the convolution treatment in the TMD
data analysis.
