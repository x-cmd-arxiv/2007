FSR584, which is projected in the direction of the molecular cloud W3 and may
be the nearest globular cluster to the Sun. 2MASS CMDs, the stellar radial
density profile, and proper motions are employed to derive fundamental and
structural parameters. The CMD morphology and the radial density profile show
that FSR584 is an old star cluster. With proper motions, the properties of
FSR584 are consistent with a metal-poor globular cluster with a well-defined
turnoff and evidence of a blue horizontal-branch. FSR584 might be a
Palomar-like halo globular cluster that is moving towards the Galactic plane.
The distance from the Sun is approx 1.4kpc, and it is located at approx 1kpc
outside the Solar circle. The radial density profile is characterized by a core
radius of rc=0.3+/-0.1 pc. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of an old
open cluster. Near-infrared photometry coupled to proper motions support the
scenario where FSR584 is a new globular cluster in the Galaxy. The absorption
is A_V=9.2+/-0.6$, which makes it a limiting object in the optical and explains
why it has so far been overlooked

annihilation around massive black holes is presented. A black hole can leave
its parent halo, by means of gravitational radiation recoil, in a merger event
or in the asymmetric collapse of its progenitor star. A recoiled black hole
which moves on an almost-radial orbit outside the virial radius of its central
halo, in the cold dark matter background, reaches its apapsis in a finite time.
Near or at the apapsis passage, a high-density wake extending over a large
radius of influence, forms around the black hole. It is shown that significant
gamma-ray emission can result from the enhancement of neutralino annihilation
in these wakes. At its apapsis passage, a black hole is shown to produce a
flash of high-energy gamma-rays whose duration is determined by the mass of the
black hole and the redshift at which it is ejected. The ensemble of such black
holes in the Hubble volume is shown to produce a diffuse high-energy gamma-ray
background whose magnitude is compared to the diffuse emission from dark matter
haloes alone.

comparing the projected two-point correlation function we obtain to that from
the SDSS. A systematic error arises because different semi-analytic modelling
assumptions allow us to fit the r-band luminosity function equally well.
Combining our estimate of the error from this source with the statistical
error, we find sigma_8=0.97 +/- 0.06. We obtain consistent results if we use
galaxy samples with a different magnitude threshold, or if we select galaxies
by b_J-band rather than r-band luminosity and compare to data from the 2dFGRS.
Our estimate for sigma_8 is higher than that obtained for other analyses of

that give the energy level populations of collisionally-excited ions in

maintain a parity between improvements in the quantum-mechanically evaluated
values for collision strengths and transition probabilities from the Iron and
Opacity Projects on the one hand, and 3D photoionisation codes such as MOCASSIN
and astrophysical software for producing nebular diagnostics such as the
Nebular package for IRAF, on the other. We have taken advantage of the fact
that mathematics programs such as MATLAB and Mathematica have proven to be very
adept at symbolic manipulation providing a route to exact solutions for the
n-level ion. In particular, we have avoided the substitution of estimated
values. We provide the matrix solution for the 5-level ion as an example and
show how the equations faithfully reduce to the exact solution for the 3-level
ion. Through the forbidden line ratio R23, we compare the exact solution with
a) that obtained from the observed emission of the spherical planetary nebula
Abell 39, b) 3D Monte-Carlo photoionisation modelling of the same nebula, c)
the approximate 5-level program TEMDEN and d) the exact 3-level ion. The
general solution presented here means that programs for the calculation of
level populations can obtain solutions for ions with a user-specified number of
excited levels. The use of a separate and updatable database of atomic and
ionic constants such as that provided by NIST, means that software of more
general application can now be made available; particularly for the study of
high excitation objects such as active galactic nebulae (AGNs) and supernovae

component separations of 3 to 6"". Only 3 of 49 spectroscopically identified
objects are non-quasars, confirming that the quasar selection efficiency of the
KDE technique is $\sim95$%. Several of our observed binaries are
wide-separation lens candidates that merit additional higher-resolution
observations. One interesting pair may be an M star binary, or an M star-binary
quasar superposition. Our candidates are initially selected by UV-excess ($u-g
< 1$), but are otherwise selected irrespective of the relative colors of the
quasar pair, and we thus use them to suggest optimal color similarity and
photometric redshift approaches for targeting binary quasars, or projected
quasar pairs. From a sample that is complete on proper scales of $23.7 <
R_{prop} < 29.7\kpch$, we determine the projected quasar correlation function
to be $W_p=24.0 \pm^{16.9}_{10.8}$, which is $2\sigma$ lower than recent
estimates. We argue that our low $W_p$ estimates may indicate redshift
evolution in the quasar correlation function from $z\sim1.9$ to $z\sim1.4$ on
scales of $R_{prop} \sim25\kpch$. The size of this evolution broadly tracks
quasar clustering on larger scales, consistent with merger-driven models of
quasar origin. Although our sample alone is insufficient to detect evolution in
quasar clustering on small scales, an $i$-selected DR6 KDE quasar catalog,
which will contain several hundred $z \leqsim 5$ binary quasars, could easily
constrain any clustering evolution at $R_{prop} \sim25\kpch$.

far simpler answers than the Feynman diagram approach might suggest. In some
cases scattering amplitudes can be constructed for processes with any desired
number of external legs yielding compact expressions which are inaccessible
from the point of view of conventional perturbation theory. In this thesis we
discuss some attempts to address the nature of this underlying simplicity and
then use the results to calculate some previously unknown amplitudes of
interest. Witten's twistor string theory is introduced and the CSW rules at
tree-level and one-loop are described. We use these techniques to calculate the
one-loop gluonic MHV amplitudes in N=1 super-Yang-Mills as a verification of
their validity and then proceed to evaluate the general MHV amplitudes in pure
Yang-Mills with a scalar running in the loop. This latter amplitude is a new
result in QCD. In addition to this, we review some recent on-shell recursion
relations for tree-level amplitudes in gauge theory and apply them to gravity.
As a result we present a new compact form for the n-graviton MHV amplitudes in
general relativity. The techniques and results discussed are relevant to the
understanding of the structure of field theory and gravity and the
non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills amplitudes in-particular are pertinent to
background processes at the LHC. The gravitational recursion relations provide
new techniques for perturbative gravity and have some bearing on the
ultraviolet properties of Einstein gravity.

QCD, obtained from the corresponding non-linear Schwinger-Dyson equation
formulated in the Feynman gauge of the background field method. These solutions
reach a finite value in the deep infrared and may be fitted using a massive
propagator, with the crucial characteristic that the effective ``mass''
employed depends on the momentum transfer. Specifically, the gluon mass falls
off as the inverse square of the momentum, as expected from the
operator-product expansion. In addition, one may define a dimensionless
quantity, which constitutes the generalization in a non-Abelian context of the
universal QED effective charge. This strong effective charge displays
asymptotic freedom in the ultraviolet whereas in the low-energy regime it
freezes at a finite value, giving rise to an infrared fixed point for QCD.

the effective theory leading order interaction Lagrangian, to the Isgur-Wise

supersymmetric four-quark operators mediating heavy neutral meson mixing. Bare
values of the effective strong couplings are extracted from the measured decay
widths of charmed resonances. Chiral behavior of the couplings, Isgur-Wise

approximation. In semileptonic heavy to light decays we determine resonance
contributions to the various form factors within an effective theory inspired

Freeman Type I and II profiles, their origins, and their possible relation to

our classification system, and presents $R$-band profiles and classifications
for all galaxies in the sample.
  The profiles are derived from a variety of different sources, including the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Data Release 5). For about half of the galaxies, we
have profiles derived from more than one telescope; this allows us to check the
stability and repeatability of our profile extraction and classification. The
vast majority of the profiles are reliable down to levels of mu_R ~ 27 mag
arcsec^-2; in exceptional cases, we can trace profiles down to mu_R > 28. We
can typically follow disk profiles out to at least 1.5 times the traditional
optical radius R_25; for some galaxies, we find light extending to ~ 3 R_25.
  We classify the profiles into three main groups: Type I (single-exponential),
Type II (down-bending), and Type III (up-bending). The frequencies of these
types are approximately 27%, 42%, and 24%, respectively, plus another 6% which
are combinations of Types II and III. We further classify Type II profiles by
where the break falls in relation to the bar length, and in terms of the
postulated mechanisms for breaks at large radii (""classical trunction"" of star
formation versus the influence of the Outer Lindblad Resonance of the bar). We
also classify the Type III profiles by the probable morphology of the outer
light (disk or spheroid). Illustrations are given for all cases. (Abridged)

representations relative to involutions of reductive p-adic groups. Symmetric
space methods are used to illuminate various aspects of Yu's construction.
Necessary conditions for a tame supercuspidal representation of G to be
distinguished by (the fixed points of) an involution of G are expressed in
terms of properties of the G-orbit of the associated G-datum. When these
conditions are satisfied, the question of whether a tame supercuspidal
representation is distinguished reduces to the question of whether certain
cuspidal representations of finite groups of Lie type are distinguished
relative to particular quadratic characters. As an application of the main
results, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for equivalence of two

galaxies in the local Universe. We find that the merger--driven star formation
is a strong function of merger mass ratio, with very little, if any, induced
star formation for large mass ratio mergers. We define a burst efficiency that
is useful to characterize the merger--driven star formation and test that it is
insensitive to uncertainties in the feedback parameterization. In accord with
previous work we find that the burst efficiency depends on the structure of the
primary galaxy. In particular, the presence of a massive stellar bulge
stabilizes the disk and suppresses merger--driven star formation for large mass
ratio mergers. Direct, co--planar merging orbits produce the largest tidal
disturbance and yield that most intense burst of star formation. Contrary to
naive expectations, a more compact distribution of gas or an increased gas
fraction both decrease the burst efficiency. Owing to the efficient feedback
model and the newer version of SPH employed here, the burst efficiencies of the
mergers presented here are smaller than in previous studies.

the adiabatic index (Gamma = 2)--the observed Type II critical solution has
approximately the same scaling exponent as that calculated for an

that move along two parallel lattices and interact with underlying molecular
tracks, is investigated theoretically by analyzing discrete-state stochastic
continuous-time burnt-bridge models. In these models the motion of molecular
motors is viewed as a random walk along the lattices with periodically
distributed weak links (bridges). When the particle crosses the weak link it
can be destroyed with a probability $p$, driving the molecular motor motion in
one direction. Dynamic properties and effective generated forces of dimer
molecular motors are calculated exactly as a function of a concentration of
bridges $c$ and burning probability $p$ and compared with properties of the
monomer motors. It is found that the ratio of the velocities of the dimer and
the monomer can never exceed 2, while the dispersions of the dimer and the
monomer are not very different. The relative effective generated force of the
dimer (as compared to the monomer) also cannot be larger than 2 for most sets
of parameters. However, a very large force can be produced by the dimer in the
special case of $c=1/2$ for non-zero shift between the lattices. Our
calculations do not show the significant increase in the force generated by
collagenase motor proteins in real biological systems as predicted by previous
computational studies. The observed behavior of dimer molecular motors is
discussed by considering in detail the particle dynamics near burnt bridges.

magnitude more massive than modern star formation. It has been proposed that
the transition from primordial to modern initial mass functions occurs due to
the onset of effective metal line cooling at a metallicity Z/Z_sun = 10^{-3.5}.
However, these simulations neglected molecular hydrogen cooling. We perform
simulations using the same initial conditions, but including molecular cooling,
using a complex network that follows molecular hydrogen formation and also
directly follows carbon monoxide and water. We find that molecular hydrogen
cooling allows roughly equivalent fragmentation to proceed even at zero
metallicity for these initial conditions. The apparent transition just
represents the point where metal line cooling becomes more important than
molecular cooling. In all cases, the fragments are massive enough to be
consistent with models of primordial stellar masses, suggesting that the
transition to the modern initial mass function may be determined by other
physics such as dust formation. We conclude that such additional cooling
mechanisms, combined with the exact initial conditions produced by cosmological
collapse are likely more important than metal line cooling in determining the
initial mass function, and thus that there is unlikely to be a sharp transition
in the initial mass function at Z/Z_sun = 10^{-3.5}.

up to the dense regime approaching to the physiological lens concentration. A
comparison with experimental data from intact bovine lenses was advanced
revealing differences between dispersions and lenses at similar concentrations.
In the dilute regime two scattering entities were detected and identified with
the long-time, self-diffusion modes of alpha-crystallins and their aggregates,
which naturally exist in lens nucleus. Self-diffusion coefficients are
temperature insensitive, whereas the collective diffusion coefficient depends
strongly on temperature revealing a reduction of the net repulsive
interparticle forces with lowering temperature. While there are no rigorous
theoretical approaches on particle diffusion properties for multi-component,
non-ideal hard-sphere, polydispersed systems, as the suspensions studied here,
a discussion of the volume fraction dependence of the long-time, self-diffusion
coefficient in the context of existing theoretical approaches was undertaken.
This study is purported to provide some insight into the complex light
scattering pattern of intact lenses and the interactions between the
constituent proteins that are responsible for lens transparency. This would
lead to understand basic mechanisms of specific protein interactions that lead
to lens opacification (cataract) under pathological conditions.

currently limited by speckle noise originating from the telescope and
instrument optics, and it is expected that such noise will also limit future

Previous theoretical analysis have shown that the time intensity variations of
a single speckle follows a modified Rician. It is first demonstrated here that
for a circular pupil this temporal intensity distribution also represents the
speckle spatial intensity distribution at a fix separation from the point
spread function center; this fact is demonstrated using numerical simulations
for coronagraphic and non-coronagraphic data. The real statistical distribution
of the noise needs to be taken into account explicitly when selecting a
detection threshold appropriate for some desired confidence level. In this
paper, a technique is described to obtain the pixel intensity distribution of
an image and its corresponding confidence level as a function of the detection
threshold. Using numerical simulations, it is shown that in the presence of
speckles noise, a detection threshold up to three times higher is required to
obtain a confidence level equivalent to that at 5sigma for Gaussian noise. The
technique is then tested using TRIDENT CFHT and angular differential imaging
NIRI Gemini adaptive optics data. It is found that the angular differential
imaging technique produces quasi-Gaussian residuals, a remarkable result
compared to classical adaptive optic imaging. A power-law is finally derived to
predict the 1-3*10^-7 confidence level detection threshold when averaging a

out continuum observations of 130 extragalactic radio sources selected from the

simultaneous 20 and 95 GHz flux densities. We show that the ATCA can measure
95GHz flux densities to ~10% accuracy in a few minutes for sources above
~50mJy.
  The median 20-95GHz spectral index does not vary significantly with flux
density for extragalactic sources with S20>150 mJy. This allows us to estimate
the extragalactic radio source counts at 95GHz by combining our observed
20-95GHz spectral-index distribution with the accurate 20GHz source counts
measured in the AT20G survey. The resulting 95GHz source counts down to 80 mJy
are significantly lower than those found by several previous studies. The main
reason is that most radio sources with flat or rising spectra in the frequency
range 5-20GHz show a spectral turnover between 20 and 95 GHz. As a result,
there are fewer 95GHz sources (by almost a factor of two at 0.1 Jy) than would
be predicted on the basis of extrapolation from the source populations seen in
lower-frequency surveys. We also derive the predicted confusion noise in CMB
surveys at 95GHz and find a value 20-30% lower than previous estimates.
  The 95GHz source population at the flux levels probed by this study is
dominated by QSOs with a median redshift z~1. We find a correlation between
optical magnitude and 95GHz flux density which suggests that many of the
brightest 95 GHz sources are relativistically beamed, with both the optical and
millimetre continuum significantly brightened by Doppler boosting.

initially formed in low-mass halos at high redshifts and we investigate final
kinematics of GCs in their host halos at $z=0$. We find that GCs formed in
halos virialized at z>10 show lower velocity dispersions on average than those
formed at z>6 for halos with GCs at z=0. We thus suggest that the origin of the
observed lower velocity dispersion for the Galactic GCs with EHBs is closely
associated with earlier formation epochs (z>10) of halos initially hosting the
GCs in the course of the Galaxy formation. Considering that the origin of EHBs
can be due to the presence of helium-enhanced second-generation stars in GCs,
we discuss the longstanding second parameter problem of GCs in the context of
different degrees of chemical pollution in GC-forming gas clouds within
low-mass halos virialized at different redshifts.

coefficients outside a disc of ``uniform'' size yield hyperbolic structures.
Here the size of a surgery coefficient is measured using the Euclidean metric
on a horospherical cross section to a cusp in the complete hyperbolic metric,
rescaled to have area 1. We also obtain good estimates on the change in

related to the relative orientation of the SRRs in the MM, both in one and two
spatial dimensions. In the latter case we also consider anisotropic MMs. Using
standard numerical methods we construct several types of linearly stable
breather excitations both in Hamiltonian and dissipative MMs (dissipative
breathers). The study of stability in both cases is performed using standard
Floquet analysi s. In both cases we found that the increase of dimensionality
from one to two spatial dimensions does not destroy the DBs, which may also
exist in the case of moderate anisotropy (in two dimensions). In dissipative
MMs, the dynamics is governed by a power balance between the mainly Ohmic
dissipation and driving by an alternating magnetic field. In that case it is
demonstrated that DB excitation locally alters the magnetic response of MMs
from paramagnetic to diamagnetic. Moreover, when the frequency of the applied
field approaches the SRR resonance frequency, the magnetic response of the MM
in the region of the DB excitation may even become negative (extreme
diamagnetic).

time-dependent local momentum-space anisotropy. A phenomenological model for
the hard momentum scale, p_hard(tau), and plasma anisotropy parameter, xi(tau),
is constructed which interpolates between free streaming behavior at early
times (tau << tau_iso) and ideal hydrodynamic behavior at late times (tau >>
tau_iso). We show that high-energy dilepton production is sensitive to the
assumed plasma isotropization time, tau_iso, and can therefore be used to
experimentally determine the time of onset for hydrodynamic expansion of a
quark-gluon plasma and the magnitude of expected early-time momentum-space
anisotropies.

B 77, 045125 (2008).","10.1103/PhysRevB.77.045125",,"cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  We propose a new concept for the dynamics of a quantum bath, the Chebyshev
space, and a new method based on this concept, the Chebyshev space method. The
Chebyshev space is an abstract vector space that exactly represents the
fermionic or bosonic bath degrees of freedom, without a discretization of the
bath density of states. Relying on Chebyshev expansions the Chebyshev space
representation of a bath has very favorable properties with respect to
extremely precise and efficient calculations of groundstate properties, static
and dynamical correlations, and time-evolution for a great variety of quantum
systems. The aim of the present work is to introduce the Chebyshev space in
detail and to demonstrate the capabilities of the Chebyshev space method.
Although the central idea is derived in full generality the focus is on model
systems coupled to fermionic baths. In particular we address quantum impurity
problems, such as an impurity in a host or a bosonic impurity with a static
barrier, and the motion of a wave packet on a chain coupled to leads. For the
bosonic impurity, the phase transition from a delocalized electron to a
localized polaron in arbitrary dimension is detected. For the wave packet on a
chain, we show how the Chebyshev space method implements different boundary
conditions, including transparent boundary conditions replacing infinite leads.
Furthermore the self-consistent solution of the Holstein model in infinite
dimension is calculated. With the examples we demonstrate how highly accurate
results for system energies, correlation and spectral functions, and
time-dependence of observables are obtained with modest computational effort.

  deduction","14 pages, 3 figures. Submitted to New Journal of Physics (IOP)",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.gen-ph",,"  On the verge of the centenary of dimensional analysis (DA), we present a
generalisation of the theory and a methodology for the discovery of empirical
laws from observational data. It is well known that DA: a) reduces the number
of free parameters, b) guarantees scale invariance through dimensional
homogeneity and c) extracts functional information encoded in the dimensionless
grouping of variables. Less known are the results of Rudolph and co-workers
that DA also gives rise to a new pair of transforms - the similarity transform
(S) that converts physical dimensional data into dimensionless space and its
inverse (S'). Here, we present a new matrix generalisation of the Buckingham
Theorem, made possible by recent developments in the theory of inverse
non-square matrices, and show how the transform pair arises naturally. We
demonstrate that the inverse transform S' is non-unique and how this casts
doubt on scaling relations obtained in cases where observational data has not
been referred to in order to break the degeneracy inherent in transforming back
to dimensional (physical) space. As an example, we show how the underlying
functional form of the Planck Radiation Law can be deduced in only a few lines
using the matrix method and without appealing to first principles; thus
demonstrating the possibility of a priori knowledge discovery; but that
subsequent data analysis is still required in order to identify the exact
causal law. It is hoped that the proof presented here will give theoreticians
confidence to pursue inverse problems in physics using DA.

hierarchically organized metastable states. The initial configuration is chosen
to have a large energy excess, relative to the thermal equilibrium value at the
running temperature. We show that the initial energy surplus is dissipated in a
series of intermittent bursts, or quakes, whose rate decreases as the inverse
of the age of the system. In addition, one observes energy fluctuations with a
zero centered Gaussian distribution. These pertain to the pseudo equilibrium
dynamics within a single metastable state, and do not contribute to the energy
dissipation. The derivative of the thermal energy with respect to the logarithm
of time is asymptotically constant, and comprises a temperature independent
part, and a part with an Arrhenius temperature dependence. The findings closely
mirror recent numerical simulation results obtained for microscopic glassy
models. For these models, record-sized energy fluctuations have been claimed to
trigger intermittent events during low temperature thermalization. In the
present model record-sized fluctuations are by construction needed to trigger
changes from one metastable state to another. This property thus suffices to
explain the statistical property of intermittent energy flow in complex
metastable systems.

flexible and general solution for this adaptation is to use a (dis)similarity

generally possible to define a measure that can be used to make pairwise
comparison between observations. General data analysis methods are then
obtained by adapting existing methods to (dis)similarity matrices. In this
article, we propose an adaptation of Kohonen's Self Organizing Map (SOM) to
