QCD-like gauge theories formulated on small $S^1 \times \R^3$ based on
symmetries, an index theorem, and Abelian duality. Here, we give the
microscopic derivation. The solution reveals a new mechanism of confinement in
QCD(adj) in the regime where we have control over both perturbative and
nonperturbative aspects. In particular, consider SU(2) QCD(adj) theory with $1
\leq n_f \leq 4$ Majorana fermions, a theory which undergoes gauge symmetry
breaking at small $S^1$. If the magnetic charge of the BPS monopole is
normalized to unity, we show that confinement occurs due to condensation of
objects with magnetic charge 2, not 1. Because of index theorems, we know that
such an object cannot be a two identical monopole configuration. Its net
topological charge must vanish, and hence it must be topologically
indistinguishable from the perturbative vacuum. We construct such non-self-dual
topological excitations, the magnetically charged, topologically null molecules
of a BPS monopole and ${\bar{\rm KK}}$ antimonopole, which we refer to as
magnetic bions. An immediate puzzle with this proposal is the apparent Coulomb
repulsion between the BPS-${\bar{\rm KK}}$ pair. An attraction which overcomes
the Coulomb repulsion between the two is induced by $2n_f$-fermion exchange.
Bion condensation is also the mechanism of confinement in $\N=1$ SYM on the
same four-manifold. The SU(N) generalization hints a possible hidden
integrability behind nonsupersymmetric QCD of affine Toda type, and allows us
to analytically compute the mass gap in the gauge sector. We currently do not
know the extension to $\R^4$.

from these stars. This mass loss extends down to the level of the horizontal
branch and increases with luminosity. The mass loss is episodic, occurring in
only a fraction of stars at a given luminosity. Using a simple model and our
observations we derive mass loss rates for these stars. Finally, we obtain the
first empirical mass loss formula calibrated with observations of Population II
stars. The dependence on luminosity of our mass loss rate is considerably
shallower than the widely used Reimers Law. The results presented here are the

few-photon interference effects. In these proposals, the photons are treated as
being indistinguishable particles. However, single photon sources are typically
subject to variation from device to device. Thus the photons emitted from
different sources will not be perfectly identical, and there will be some
variation in their frequencies. Here, we analyse the effect of this frequency
mismatch on QIP schemes. As examples, we consider the distributed QIP protocol
proposed by Barrett and Kok, and Hong-Ou-Mandel interference which lies at the
heart of many linear optical schemes for quantum computing. In the distributed
QIP protocol, we find that the fidelity of entangled qubit states depends
crucially on the time resolution of single photon detectors. In particular,
there is no reduction in the fidelity when an ideal detector model is assumed,
while reduced fidelities may be encountered when using realistic detectors with
a finite response time. We obtain similar results in the case of Hong-Ou-Mandel
interference -- with perfect detectors, a modified version of quantum
interference is seen, and the visibility of the interference pattern is reduced
as the detector time resolution is reduced. Our findings indicate that problems
due to frequency mismatch can be overcome, provided sufficiently fast detectors
are available.

photon rocket in a cosmological background are obtained by performing the same
conformal transformation as is used to obtain the Robertson-Walker metric from
Minkowski spacetime. In the case of the cosmological radiating stellar
exterior, a two-fluid solution is found that obeys all of the energy conditions
and consists of a null fluid and a perfect fluid that asymptotically falls off
to the standard cosmological values for pressure and density at infinite
radius. For the cosmological photon rocket, the massless case is first
interpreted to obtain a solution for an accelerating cosmological reference
frame, and then the general case is interpreted: in both cases, a two-fluid
solution is found that consists of a null fluid and an imperfect fluid that
possesses heat conduction and anisotropic stress. The imperfect fluid appears
to contain an inhomogeneous dark energy component that acts to accelerate the
matter through space via a pressure gradient, but this component has negative
energy density on the trailing side of the rocket, meaning only the leading
side of the rocket is guaranteed to satisfy the weak and dominant energy
conditions. Unlike spacetimes that have rotation but no acceleration, the
cosmological photon rocket can serve as an example of a spacetime that
contradicts Mach's notion of acceleration, since an observer would see
empirical evidence of acceleration even though the matter does not accelerate
relative to the universe's background matter distribution.

a GIM-suppression can occur that will strongly reduce the rates of lepton
flavour violating effects even if they are in principle present in a certain

we recall a nonsupersymmetric version of heterotic M-theory, in which bubbles
of nothing -- connecting the two E_8 boundaries by a throat -- are expected to

string coupling, where the nonperturbative instanton instability is expected to
turn into a perturbative tachyonic one. We identify the unique string theory
that could describe this process: The heterotic model with one E_8 gauge group
and a singlet tachyon. We then use worldsheet methods to study the tachyon
condensation in the NSR formulation of this model, and show that it induces a
worldsheet super-Higgs effect. The main theme of our analysis is the
possibility of making meaningful alternative gauge choices for worldsheet
supersymmetry, in place of the conventional superconformal gauge. We show in a
version of unitary gauge how the worldsheet gravitino assimilates the goldstino
and becomes dynamical. This picture clarifies recent results of Hellerman and
Swanson. We also present analogs of R_\xi gauges, and note the importance of
logarithmic CFT in the context of tachyon condensation.

dictated by the spin hamiltonian under consideration) toward a steady-state
distribution representing an approximation to the true ground state. Unknown
transition coefficients in the master equation are treated as variational
parameters. We illustrate the method by applying it to the J1-J2
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. Without frustration (J2=0), the amplitudes
are radially symmetric and fall off as 1/r^3 in the bond length. As the
frustration increases, there are precursor signs of columnar or plaquette VBS
order: the bonds preferentially align along the axes of the square lattice and
weight accrues in the nearest-neighbour bond amplitudes. The Marshall sign rule
holds over a large range of couplings, J2/J1 < 0.418. It fails when the r=(2,1)
bond amplitude first goes negative, a point also marked by a cusp in the ground
state energy. A nonrigourous extrapolation of the staggered magnetic moment
(through this point of nonanalyticity) shows it vanishing continuously at a
critical value J2/J1 = 0.447. This may be preempted by a first-order transition

are expected to produce a cosmological population of structure-formation cosmic
rays (SFCRs). Interactions between SFCRs and ambient baryons will produce
lithium isotopes via \alpha+\alpha \to ^{6,7}Li. This pre-Galactic (but
non-primordial) lithium should contribute to the primordial 7Li measured in
halo stars and must be subtracted in order to arrive to the true observed
primordial lithium abundance. In this paper we point out that the recent halo
star 6Li measurements can be used to place a strong constraint to the level of
such contamination, because the exclusive astrophysical production of 6Li is
from cosmic-ray interactions. We find that the putative 6Li plateau, if due to
pre-Galactic cosmic-ray interactions, implies that SFCR-produced lithium
represents Li_{SFCR}/Li_{plateau}\approx 15% of the observed elemental Li
plateau. Taking the remaining plateau Li to be cosmological 7Li, we find a
revised (and slightly worsened) discrepancy between the Li observations and Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis predictions by a factor of ^7Li_{BBN}/^7Li_{plateau}
\approx 3.7. Moreover, SFCRs would also contribute to the extragalactic
gamma-ray background (EGRB) through neutral pion production. This gamma-ray
production is tightly related to the amount of lithium produced by the same
cosmic rays; the 6Li plateau limits the pre-Galactic (high-redshift) SFCR
contribution to be at the level of I_{\pi_{\gamma}SFCR}/I_{EGRB} < 5% of the
currently observed EGRB.

survey to show that there exists a rare population of nearby compact
UV-luminous galaxies (UVLGs) that closely resembles high redshift Lyman break
galaxies (LBGs). We present HST images in the UV, optical, and Ha, and
resimulate them at the depth and resolution of the GOODS/UDF fields to show
that the morphologies of UVLGs are also similar to those of LBGs. Our sample of
8 LBG analogs thus provides detailed insight into the connection between star
formation and LBG morphology. Faint tidal features or companions can be seen in
all of the rest-frame optical images, suggesting that the starbursts are the
result of a merger or interaction. The UV/optical light is dominated by
unresolved (~100-300 pc) super starburst regions (SSBs). A detailed comparison
with the galaxies Haro 11 and VV 114 at z=0.02 indicates that the SSBs
themselves consist of diffuse stars and (super) star clusters. The structural
features revealed by the new HST images occur on very small physical scales and
are thus not detectable in images of high redshift LBGs, except in a few cases
where they are magnified by gravitational lensing. We propose, therefore, that
LBGs are mergers of gas-rich, relatively low-mass (~10^10 Msun) systems, and
that the mergers trigger the formation of SSBs. If galaxies at high redshifts
are dominated by SSBs, then the faint end slope of the luminosity function is
predicted to have slope alpha~2. Our results are the most direct confirmation
to date of models that predict that the main mode of star formation in the

scientific opportunities that result from new fundamental cross-cutting
research involving three core research communities: (1) experts in modeling and
simulation of electronic devices and systems; (2) high performance computing
relevant to devices and systems; and (3) the quantum many-body principles
relevant to devices and systems. ECCS is especially interested in learning how
work in these areas could enable whole new classes of systems or devices,
beyond what is already under development in existing mainstream research. The
workshop helped identify technical areas that will enable fundamental
breakthroughs in the future. Modeling and simulation in the electronics and
optoelectronics areas, in general, have already resulted in important
fundamental scientific understanding and advances in design and development of
devices and systems. With the increasing emphasis on the next generation of
devices and systems at the nano, micro, and macro scales and the
interdisciplinary nature of the research, it is imperative that we explore new
mathematical models and simulation techniques. This workshop report provides a
better understanding of unmet emerging new opportunities to improve modeling,
simulation and design techniques for hybrid devices and systems. The purpose
the QMHP workshop was to define the field and strengthen the focus of the
thrust. The ultimate goal of the workshop was to produce a final report (this
document) that will be posted on the web so that the NSF can use it to guide
reviewers and researchers in this field.

according to the sensitivity of their column densities to the rate
uncertainties. The first group includes CO, C$^+$, H$_3^+$, H$_2$O, NH$_3$,
N$_2$H$^+$, and HCNH$^+$. For these species, the column densities are not very
sensitive to the rate uncertainties but the abundances in specific regions are.
The second group includes CS, CO$_2$, HCO$^+$, H$_2$CO, C$_2$H, CN, HCN, HNC
and other, more complex species, for which high abundances and abundance
uncertainties co-exist in the same disk region, leading to larger scatters in
the column densities. However, even for complex and heavy molecules, the
dispersion in their column densities is not more than a factor of ~4. We
perform a sensitivity analysis of the computed abundances to rate uncertainties
and identify those reactions with the most problematic rate coefficients. We
conclude that the rate coefficients of about a hundred of chemical reactions
need to be determined more accurately in order to greatly improve the

provides an additional evidence that the 3D NSV with the small regularization

redshift performance. We find that they greatly increase the scatter, but this

still equivalent to that of a much shallower survey with Gaussian photometry
errors. We also estimate the impact of non-Gaussian errors on the spectroscopic
sample size required to verify the photometric redshift rms scatter to a given
precision. Even with Gaussian {\it photometry} errors, photometric redshift
errors are sufficiently non-Gaussian to require an order of magnitude larger
sample than simple Gaussian statistics would indicate. The requirements
increase from this baseline if non-Gaussian photometry errors are included.
Again the impact can be mitigated by incorporating the correct noise model, but
only to the equivalent of a survey with much larger Gaussian photometry errors.
However, these requirements may well be overestimates because they are based on
a need to know the rms, which is particularly sensitive to tails. Other
parametrizations of the distribution may require smaller samples.

believed to be synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated in relativistic
collisionless shocks propagating in the ambient medium of the sources. However,
the fraction $f$ of electrons that are coupled to protons and accelerated
remains unclear and a large number of thermal electrons that are not coupled to
protons may be left behind. If $f<1$, the true explosion energies of GRBs are
$f^{-1}$ times larger than those commonly estimated with $f=1$. Thus the value
of $f$ gives an important constraint on the nature of the central engine of
GRBs and the physics of collisionless shocks. Although early-time radio
observations can probe the thermal electrons, they are difficult at present. We
show that the Faraday rotation effects of the thermal electrons may suppress
the linear polarization of the afterglow at frequencies higher than the

"0709.3333","Douglas Smylie Prof","D. E. Smylie and Andrew Palmer","Viscosity of Earth's Outer Core","30 pages, 8 figures",,,,"physics.geo-ph",,"  A viscosity profile across the entire fluid outer core is found by
interpolating between measured boundary values, using a differential form of
the Arrhenius law governing pressure and temperature dependence. The discovery
that both the retrograde and prograde free core nutations are in free decay
(Palmer and Smylie, 2005) allows direct measures of viscosity at the top of the
outer core, while the reduction in the rotational splitting of the two
equatorial translational modes of the inner core allows it to be measured at
the bottom. We find 2,371 plus/minus 1,530 Pa.s at the top and 1.247 plus/minus
0.035 x 10^11 Pa.s at the bottom. Following Brazhkin (1998) and Brazhkin and
Lyapin (2000) who get 10^2 Pa.s at the top, 10^11 Pa.s at the bottom, by an
Arrhenius extrapolation of laboratory experiments, we use a differential form
of the Arrhenius law to interpolate along the melting temperature curve to find
a viscosity profile across the outer core. We find the variation to be closely
log-linear between the measured boundary values. The close agreement of the
boundary values of viscosity, found by Arrhenius extrapolation of laboratory
experiments, with those found from the free core nutations, and the inner core
translational modes, suggests that core flows are laminar and that the returned
viscosities are measures of their molecular values. This would not be the case
in the presence of the vigorous turbulent convection sometimes postulated by
dynamo theorists. The local Ekman number is found to range from 10^-2 at the
bottom of the outer core to 10^-10 at the top. Except in the very lower part of
the outer core, Ekman numbers are in the range 10^-4 to 10^-5, or below, in
which the laminar flows of numerical dynamos and laboratory rotating fluids
experiments occur.

zero orbital phase using the High-Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer
(HETGS) onboard Chandra. In both observations the source did not show the P
Cygni lines we observed during the high-flux phases of the source in 2000 and
2001. During pre-zero phase the source did not exhibit significant variability
and exhibited an emission-line spectrum rich in H- and He-like lines from high
Z elements such as Si, S, Ar, and Ca. We analyzed all high resolution X-ray
spectra by fitting photoionization and absorption models from the most recent
version of the XSTAR code. The pre-zero phase spectrum could be fully modeled
with a very hot photoionized plasma with an ionization parameter of log xi =
3.0. Post-zero phase episodes feature absorbers with variable high columns,
ionization parameter, and luminosity. While cold absorption remains at levels
quite similar to the one observed in previous years, the new observations show
unprecedented levels of variable warm absorption. The line emissivities also
indicate that the observed low source luminosity is inconsistent with a static
hot accretion disk corona (ADC), an effect that seems common to other near
edge-on ADC sources as well. We conclude that unless there exists some means of
coronal heating other than X-rays, the true source luminosity is likely much
higher and we observe obscuration in analogy to the extragalactic Seyfert II
sources. We discuss possible consequences and relate cold, luke-warm, warm, and
hot absorbers to dynamic accretion scenarios.

decayed gradually to a pore. The spectroscopic observations were obtained with
the Fabry-P\'{e}rot based Visible-Light Imaging Magnetograph (VIM) in
conjunction with the high-order adaptive optics (AO) system operated at the 65
cm vacuum reflector of the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). We apply local

white-light images around 600 nm to infer horizontal proper motions while the
Doppler shifts of the scanned \FeI line at 630.15 nm are used to calculate
line-of-sight (LOS) velocities with sub-arcsecond resolution. We find that the
dividing line between radial inward and outward proper motions in the inner and
outer penumbra, respectively, survives the decay phase. In particular the moat
flow is still detectable after the penumbra disappeared. Based on our
observations three major processes removed flux from the sunspot: (a)
fragmentation of the umbra, (b) flux cancelation of moving magnetic features
(MMFs; of the same polarity as the sunspot) that encounter the leading opposite
polarity network and plages areas, and (c) flux transport by MMFs (of the same

or transition state, between the denatured and the native state. The folding
kinetics of these proteins is usually explored via mutational analysis. A
central question is which structural information on the transition state can be
derived from the mutational data. In this article, we model and structurally
interpret mutational Phi-values for two small beta-sheet proteins, the PIN and
the FBP WW domain. The native structure of these WW domains comprises two
beta-hairpins that form a three-stranded beta-sheet. In our model, we assume
that the transition state consists of two conformations in which either one of
the hairpins is formed. Such a transition state has been recently observed in
Molecular Dynamics folding-unfolding simulations of a small designed
three-stranded beta-sheet protein. We obtain good agreement with the
experimental data (i) by splitting up the mutation-induced free-energy changes
into terms for the two hairpins and for the small hydrophobic core of the
proteins, and (ii) by fitting a single parameter, the relative degree to which
hairpin 1 and 2 are formed in the transition state. The model helps to
understand how mutations affect the folding kinetics of WW domains, and
captures also negative Phi-values that have been difficult to interpret.

universal boundary conditions, succeeds to yield experimentally acceptable
b-quark masses by moderately violating Yukawa unification. It is known that
this model can lead to new shifted or new smooth hybrid inflation. We show that
a successful two-stage inflationary scenario can be realized within this model
based only on renormalizable superpotential interactions. The cosmological
scales exit the horizon during the first stage of inflation, which is of the
standard hybrid type and takes place along the trivial flat direction with the
inflaton driven by radiative corrections. Spectral indices compatible with the
recent data can be achieved in global supersymmetry or minimal supergravity by
restricting the number of e-foldings of our present horizon during the first
inflationary stage. The additional e-foldings needed for solving the horizon
and flatness problems are naturally provided by a second stage of inflation,
which occurs mainly along the built-in new smooth hybrid inflationary path
appearing right after the destabilization of the trivial flat direction at its
critical point. Monopoles are formed at the end of the first stage of inflation
and are, subsequently, diluted by the second stage of inflation to become
utterly negligible in the present universe for almost all (for all) the allowed
values of the parameters in the case of global supersymmetry (minimal
supergravity).

dynamical freeze-out in nuclear collisions and their subsequent applications to
ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, leading to the discovery of a
freeze-out hierarchy where chemical freeze-out of hadron yields precedes the
thermal decoupling of their momentum spectra. Following Zimanyi's lines of
reasoning we show that kinetic freeze-out necessarily leads to a dependence of
the corresponding freeze-out temperature on collision centrality. This
centrality dependence can be predicted within hydrodynamic models, and for
Au+Au collisions at RHIC this prediction is shown to reproduce the
experimentally observed centrality dependence of the thermal decoupling
temperature, extracted from hadron momentum spectra. The fact that no such
centrality dependence is observed for the chemical decoupling temperature,
extracted from the hadron yields measured in these collisions, excludes a
similar kinetic interpretation of the chemical decoupling process. We argue
that the chemical decoupling data from Au+Au collisions at RHIC can only be
consistently understood if the chemical freeze-out process is driven by a phase
transition, and that the measured chemical decoupling temperature therefore
measures the critical temperature of the quark-hadron phase transition. We
propose additional experiments to further test this interpretation.

post-Newtonian terms, which we include up to order PN2.5. Arbitrarily extreme

even for the two-body problem, independent of eccentricity. An important

  Accretion Flows onto Neutron Stars","9 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ",,"10.1093/pasj/59.5.1033",,"astro-ph",,"  We performed two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of
supercritical accretion flows around neutron stars (NSs). In contrast with the
accretion flows onto black holes (BHs), we find that the shell-shaped
high-density regions form around the NSs, since the radiation force is enhanced
in the innermost regions. The enhanced radiation force drives strong outflows
above and below the disk. The mass-accretion rate onto the NS exceeds the
critical rate, $L_{\rm E}/c^2$, with $L_{\rm E}$ being the Eddington
luminosity. However it is about $20-30%$ of that onto the BH, under the
condition that we employ the same mass-input rate, $\dot{M}_{\rm input}$, which
is mass injected from the outer disk boundary per unit time. The mass-outflow
rate is a few-times larger in flows around NSs than in flows around BHs. The
supercritical NS accretion flows mainly release the accretion energy as the
kinetic energy of the outflows, though the disk luminosity is predominant over
the kinetic energy output rate in the BH accretion flows. The resulting
velocity and mass-outflow rate of the outflows are $0.2-0.3c$ and
$150-700L_{\rm E}/c^2$, respectively, for the mass-input rate of $3\times
10^2\lsim \dot{M}_{\rm input}/(L_{\rm E}/c^2)\lsim 3\times 10^3$. This implies
that the SS433 jets can be roughly explained by the supercritical accretion
onto a NS. However, the collimation angle of the outflows in our simulations
($\sim 20^\circ$) is larger than that of the SS433 jets (a few degrees).

breaking. We use the Interacting Instanton Liquid Model (IILM) as a tool to
investigate the microscopic dynamical mechanisms which underly the dependence
on the quark mass and drive the transition into the chiral regime of QCD. To
ensure the validity of the model, we first verify that the dependence on the
quark mass for several observables calculated in the IILM agrees well with the
predictions of chiral perturbation theory and with lattice simulations. We then
show that a quark mass m*~80 MeV emerging naturally from the model specifies
the mass scale above which the dynamics associated with low-lying eigenmodes of
the Direac operator becomes sub-leading and the contribution of the fermion

spectral resolution VLT/UVES spectroscopy of its central star-forming region.
The central region contains several clusters, the two brightest of which are
clusters 1 and 6 from Hunter, O'Connell & Gallagher, located within
star-forming knots A and B, respectively. Nebular analysis indicates that the
knots have an LMC-like metallicity of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.29 +/- 0.09. According
to continuum subtracted H alpha ACS imaging, cluster 1 dominates the nebular
emission of the brighter knot A. Conversely, negligible nebular emission in
knot B originates from cluster 6. Evolutionary synthesis modelling implies an
age of 5 +/- 1 Myr for cluster 1, from which a photometric mass of (1.1 +/-
0.3) x 10^6 Msun is obtained. For this age and photometric mass, the modelling
predicts the presence of ~5900 late O stars within cluster 1. Wolf-Rayet
features are observed in knot A, suggesting 550 late-type WN and 200 early-type
WC stars. Therefore, N(WR)/N(O) ~ 0.1, assuming that all the WR stars are
located within cluster 1. The velocity dispersions of the clusters were
measured from constituent red supergiants as sigma ~ 23 +/- 1 km/s for cluster
1 and sigma ~ 26 +/- 1 km/s for cluster 6. Combining sigma with half-light
radii of 8 +/- 2 pc and 6.0 +/- 0.2 pc measured from the F625W ACS image
implies virial masses of (10 +/- 3) x 10^6 Msun and (9.1 +/- 0.8) x 10^6 Msun
for clusters 1 and 6, respectively. The most likely reason for the difference
between the dynamical and photometric masses of cluster 1 is that the velocity
dispersion of knot A is not due solely to cluster 1, as assumed, but has an
additional component associated with cluster 2.

learning, and have analyzed its asymptotic property through the statistical

students independently learn from a teacher, and then the students learn from
each other through the mutual learning. In mutual learning, students learn from
each other and the generalization error is improved even if the teacher has not
taken part in the mutual learning. However, in the case of different initial
overlaps(direction cosine) between teacher and students, a student with a
larger initial overlap tends to have a larger generalization error than that of
before the mutual learning. To overcome this problem, our proposed optimization
method of mutual learning optimizes the step sizes of two students to minimize
the asymptotic property of the generalization error. Consequently, the
optimized mutual learning converges to a generalization error identical to that
of the optimal ensemble learning. In addition, we show the relationship between
the optimum step size of the mutual learning and the integration mechanism of

Discrete isothermic nets are defined as circular Koenigs nets. This is a new

spin-orbit couplings has reached a point in which nowadays materials may
display spin-orbit splitting energies ranging from a few to hundreds of meV.
This situation calls for a better understanding of the interplay between the
spin-orbit coupling and other interactions ubiquitously present in solids, in
particular when the spin-orbit splitting is comparable in magnitude with
characteristic energy scales such as the Fermi energy and the phonon frequency.
  In this article, the two-dimensional Fr\""ohlich electron-phonon problem is
reformulated by introducing the coupling to a spin-orbit Rashba potential,
allowing for a description of the spin-orbit effects on the electron-phonon
interaction. The ground state of the resulting Fr\""ohlich-Rashba polaron is
studied in the weak and strong coupling limits of the electron-phonon
interaction for arbitrary values of the spin-orbit splitting. The weak coupling
case is studied within the Rayleigh-Schr\""odinger perturbation theory, while
the strong-coupling electron-phonon regime is investigated by means of
variational polaron wave functions in the adiabatic limit. It is found that,
for both weak and strong coupling polarons, the ground state energy is
systematically lowered by the spin-orbit interaction, indicating that the
polaronic character is strengthened by the Rashba coupling. It is also shown
that, consistently with the lowering of the ground state, the polaron effective
mass is enhanced compared to the zero spin-orbit limit. Finally, it is argued
that the crossover between weakly and strongly coupled polarons can be shifted
by the spin-orbit interaction.

phenomenon and clarify the mechanism underlying it: Upon continuously removing
the non-invertibility of the system, the set of two unstable attractors becomes
a set of two non-attracting saddle states that are heteroclinically connected
to each other. This transition from a network of unstable attractors to a
heteroclinic cycle constitutes a new type of bifurcation in dynamical systems.

ideal granular hydrodynamics (IGHD), an initially smooth hydrodynamic flow of a
granular gas can produce an infinite gas density in a finite time. Exact
solutions that exhibit this property have been derived. Close to the
singularity, the granular gas pressure is finite and almost constant. This work
reports molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a freely cooling gas of nearly
elastically colliding hard disks, aimed at identifying the ""attempted"" density
blowup regime. The initial conditions of the simulated flow mimic those of one
particular solution of the IGHD equations that exhibits the density blowup. We
measure the hydrodynamic fields in the MD simulations and compare them with
predictions from the ideal theory. We find a remarkable quantitative agreement
between the two over an extended time interval, proving the existence of the
attempted blowup regime. As the attempted singularity is approached, the
hydrodynamic fields, as observed in the MD simulations, deviate from the
predictions of the ideal solution. To investigate the mechanism of breakdown of
the ideal theory near the singularity, we extend the hydrodynamic theory by
accounting separately for the gradient-dependent transport and for finite
density corrections.

picture of galaxies, in particular for the minor mergers that are frequent and
highly likely to have occured several times for most present-day galaxies.
However, the effect of repeated minor mergers on galactic structure and
evolution has not been studied systematically so far. We present a numerical
study of multiple, subsequent, minor galaxy mergers, with various mass ratios
ranging from 4:1 to 50:1. The N-body simulations include gas dynamics and star
formation. We study the morphological and kinematical properties of the
remnants, and show that several so-called ""minor"" mergers can lead to the
formation of elliptical-like galaxies that have global morphological and
kinematical properties similar to that observed in real elliptical galaxies.
The properties of these systems are compared with those of elliptical galaxies
produced by the standard scenario of one single major merger. We thus show that
repeated minor mergers can theoretically form elliptical galaxies without major
mergers, and can be more frequent than major mergers, in particular at moderate
redshift. This process must then have formed some elliptical galaxies seen
today, and could in particular explain the high boxiness of massive
ellipticals, and some fundamental relations observed in ellipticals. In
addition, because repeated minor mergers, even at high mass ratios, destroy
disks into spheroids, these results indicate that spiral galaxies cannot have
grown only by a succession of minor mergers.

key feature here is the fact that we do not allow the dihedral groups to be
broken in an arbitrary way, but in all cases some
  (non-trivial) subgroup has to be preserved. In this way we arrive at only
five possible (Dirac) mass matrix structures which can arise, if we require
that the matrix has to have a non-vanishing determinant and that at least two
of the three generations of left-handed (conjugate) fermions are placed into an
irreducible two-dimensional representation of the flavor group. We show that
there is no difference between the mass matrix structures for single- and
double-valued dihedral groups. Furthermore, we comment on possible forms of
Majorana mass matrices. As a first application we find a way to express the
Cabibbo angle, i.e. the CKM matrix element |V_{us}|, in terms of group theory
quantities only, the group index n, the representation index j and the index
m_{u,d} of the different preserved subgroups in the up and down quark sector:
|V_{us}|=|cos(pi(m_{u}-m_{d})j/n)| which is |cos(3 pi/7)| = 0.2225 for n=7,
j=1, m_{u}=3 and m_{d}=0. We prove that two successful models which lead to
maximal atmospheric mixing and vanishing theta_{13} in the lepton sector are
based on the fact that the flavor symmetry is broken in the charged lepton,
Dirac neutrino and Majorana neutrino sector down to different preserved
subgroups whose mismatch results in the prediction of these mixing angles. This
also demonstrates the power of preserved subgroups in connection with the
prediction of mixing angles in the quark as well as in the lepton sector.

abundances for the sample of 32 EMP giant stars studied earlier in this series,
including 22 stars with [Fe/H] $< -$3.0. Based on high-resolution, high S/N
spectra from the ESO VLT/UVES, 1D, LTE model atmospheres, and synthetic
spectrum fits, we determine abundances or upper limits for the 16 elements Sr,
Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, and Yb in all stars. As
found earlier, [Sr/Fe], [Y/Fe], [Zr/Fe] and [Ba/Fe] are below Solar in the EMP
stars, with very large scatter. However, we find a tight anti-correlation of
[Sr/Ba], [Y/Ba], and [Zr/Ba] with [Ba/H] for $-4.5 <$ [Ba/H] $< -2.5$, also
when subtracting the contribution of the main $r$-process as measured by
[Ba/H]. The huge, well-characterised scatter of the [n-capture/Fe] ratios in
our EMP stars is in stark contrast to the negligible dispersion in the
[$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe-peak/Fe] ratios for the same stars found in Paper V.
These results demonstrate that a second (``weak'' or LEPP) $r$-process
dominates the production of the lighter neutron-capture elements for [Ba/H] $<
-2.5$. The combination of very consistent [$\alpha$/Fe] and erratic
[n-capture/Fe] ratios indicates that inhomogeneous models for the early
evolution of the halo are needed. Our accurate data provide strong constraints
on future models of the production and mixing of the heavy elements in the
early Galaxy.

  of Large-Scale Structures","Published in ApJ, 2008, 675, 1025; 17 pages, 14 figures",,"10.1086/527283",,"astro-ph",,"  We present an analysis of 109 moderate-luminosity (41.9 < Log L{0.5-8.0 keV}
< 43.7) AGN in the Extended Chandra Deep Field-South survey, which is drawn
from 5,549 galaxies from the COMBO-17 and GEMS surveys having 0.4 < z < 1.1.
These obscured or optically-weak AGN facilitate the study of their host
galaxies since the AGN provide an insubstantial amount of contamination to the
galaxy light. We find that the color distribution of AGN host galaxies is
highly dependent upon (1) the strong color-evolution of luminous (M_V < -20.7)
galaxies, and (2) the influence of ~10 Mpc scale structures. When excluding
galaxies within the redshift range 0.63 < z < 0.76, a regime dominated by
sources in large-scale structures at z=0.67 and z=0.73, we observe a bimodality
in the host galaxy colors. Galaxies hosting AGN at z > 0.8 preferentially have
bluer (rest-frame U-V < 0.7) colors than their z <~ 0.6 counterparts (many of
which fall along the red sequence). The fraction of galaxies hosting AGN peaks
in the ``green valley'' (0.5 < U-V < 1.0); this is primarily due to enhanced
AGN activity in the redshift interval 0.63 < z < 0.76. The AGN fraction in this
redshift and color interval is 12.8% (compared to its `field' value of 7.8%)
and reaches a maximum of 14.8% at U-V~0.8. We further find that blue,
bulge-dominated (Sersic index n>2.5) galaxies have the highest fraction of AGN
(21%) in our sample. We explore the scenario that the evolution of AGN hosts is
driven by galaxy mergers and illustrate that an accurate assessment requires a
larger area survey since only three hosts may be undergoing a merger with
timescales <1 Gyr following a starburst phase.

charge qubits and other tunnel devices is usually derived through cannonical
quantisation of the classical macroscopic Josephson relations. However, this
approach may neglect effects due to the fact that the charge qubit consists of
a superconducting island of finite size connected to a large superconductor.
  We show that the well known quantised Josephson equation can be derived
directly and simply from a microscopic many-body Hamiltonian. By choosing the
appropriate strong coupling limit we produce a highly simplified Hamiltonian
that nevertheless allows us to go beyond the mean field limit and predict
further finite-size terms in addition to the basic equation.

vectors. In those situations, one possible solution is to rely on dissimilarity
measures that enable sensible comparison between observations. Kohonen's
Self-Organizing Map (SOM) has been adapted to data described only through their
dissimilarity matrix. This algorithm provides both non linear projection and
clustering of non vector data. Unfortunately, the algorithm suffers from a high
cost that makes it quite difficult to use with voluminous data sets. In this
paper, we propose a new algorithm that provides an important reduction of the
theoretical cost of the dissimilarity SOM without changing its outcome (the
results are exactly the same as the ones obtained with the original algorithm).
Moreover, we introduce implementation methods that result in very short running
times. Improvements deduced from the theoretical cost model are validated on
simulated and real world data (a word list clustering problem). We also
demonstrate that the proposed implementation methods reduce by a factor up to 3
the running time of the fast algorithm over a standard implementation.

the integrated power using the full resolution of Hinode (0.05'' pixels, 0.16''

Combining this result with the estimates of the acoustic flux based on TRACE
data of Fossum & Carlsson (2006), we conclude that the total energy flux in
acoustic waves of frequency 5-40 mHz entering the internetwork chromosphere of
the quiet Sun is less than 800 W m$^{-2}$, inadequate to balance the radiative
losses in a static chromosphere by a factor of five.

chain of atoms trapped in an optical superlattice. The quantum ratchet is
created by a continuous modulation of the optical superlattice which is
periodic in time and in space. Though there is zero average force acting on the
atoms, we show that indeed the ratchet effect permits atoms on even and odd
sites to move along opposite directions. By loading the optical lattice with
two-level bosonic atoms, this scheme permits to perfectly transport a qubit or
entangled state imprinted in one or more atoms to any desired position in the
lattice. From the quantum computation point of view, the transport is achieved
by a smooth concatenation of perfect swap gates. We analyze setups with
noninteracting and interacting particles and in the latter case we use the
tools of optimal control to design optimal modulations. We also discuss the
feasibility of this method in current experiments.

scale separates the essential geometry and a low energy effective theory, which
is described as degrees of freedom in the lattice gauge theory. If this idea
