explored. The Gibbs scheme is modified aiming to describe the statistical
properties of a class of non-equilibrium and metastable states. The system is
assumed to maximize the usual definition of the Entropy, subject to the
standard constant energy and norm restrictions, plus additional constraints.
The central assumption is that the existence of the considered metastable state
is determined by the action of this additional dynamical constraint, that
blocks the evolution of the system up to its maximum Entropy state, thus
maintaining it in the metastable or stationary configuration. After requiring
from the statistical description to be valid for the combination of two nearly
independent subsystems, it follows that the eigenvalues of the constraint
operators C should have the restricted homogeneous form C(p{i})=p{i}^{q}, in
terms of the eigenvalues of the density matrix p{i}, where q is a fixed real
number. Therefore, the distribution of the eigenvalues of the constraint
function have the Tsallis structure. This conclusion suggests the
interpretation of the q parameter as reflecting the homogeneous dependence of
the constraint determining the metastable state on the density matrix. An
application to the plasma experiments of Huang and Driscoll is expected to be
considered elsewhere in order to compare the results with Tsallis scheme and
the minimal Enstrophy one.

variations of hadronic masses, including meson, nucleon, and nucleon-resonance
masses. Small variations in hadronic masses may have occurred over time; the
present results can help evaluate the consequences for big bang
nucleosynthesis. Larger variations may be relevant to current attempts to
extrapolate properties of nucleon-nucleon interactions from lattice QCD
calculations. Results are presented as derivatives of the energy with respect
to the different masses so they can be combined with different predictions of
the hadronic mass-dependence on the underlying current-quark mass $m_q$. As an
example, we employ a particular set of relations obtained from a study of
hadron masses and sigma terms based on Dyson-Schwinger equations and a
Poincar\'{e}-covariant Faddeev equation for confined quarks and diquarks. We
find that nuclear binding decreases moderately rapidly as the quark mass
increases, with the deuteron becoming unbound when the pion mass is increased
by $\sim$60% (corresponding to an increase in $X_q=m_q/\Lambda_{QCD}$ of 2.5).
In the other direction, the dineutron becomes bound if the pion mass is
decreased by $\sim$15% (corresponding to a reduction of $X_q$ by $\sim$30%). If
we interpret the disagreement between big bang nucleosynthesis calculations and
measurements to be the result of variation in $X_q$, we obtain an estimate
$\delta X_q/X_q=K \cdot (0.013 \pm 0.002)$ where $K \sim 1$ (the expected
accuracy in $K$ is about a factor of 2). The result is dominated by $^7$Li

so that one cannot rely on the usual approach of looking for inconsistencies in
the expansion history and perturbations growth in order to discriminate between
JBD and GR. However, we show that a similar technique can be successfully
applied to early and late times observables instead. Cosmological parameters
inferred extrapolating early-time observations to the present will match those
recovered from direct late-time observations only if the correct gravity theory
is used. We use the primary CMB, as will be seen by the Planck satellite, as

the rich phenomenology (which ranges from unconventional superconductivity to
enhanced thermopower) has been hampered by the difficulty of controlling pure
phases. We discovered that certain Na concentrations are specially stable and
are associated with superlattice ordering of the Na clusters. This leads
naturally to a picture of co-existence of localized spins and itinerant charge
carriers. For x = 0.84 we found a remarkably small Fermi energy of 87 K. Our
picture brings coherence to a variety of measurements ranging from NMR to

system Eta Carinae during the spectroscopic event might be explained by
accreted mass that absorbs the radiation from the secondary star, and by that
reduces the heating of the dust that is responsible for the near-IR emission.
This binary system has an orbital period of 2024 days and eccentricity of
e~0.9. The emission in several bands declines for several weeks near every
periastron passages, in what is termed the spectroscopic event. In the
accretion model for the spectroscopic event the secondary star accretes mass
from the primary's wind for ~10 weeks near every periastron passage. The mass
is accreted mainly in the equatorial plane. The disk and its wind block the
secondary's radiation from heating dust that does not reside within narrow
cones along the symmetry axis. This, we propose, might explain the decline in
the near-IR flux occurring at the beginning of each spectroscopic event. We
also argue that the increase in the near-IR prior to the event might be
accounted for by enhanced hot (T~1700 K) dust formation in the collision region
of the winds from the two stars. This dust resides within ~60 degrees from the
equatorial plane, and most of it cannot be heated by the secondary during the
accretion phase.

exchanges. When a srong bar pattern develops with the same pattern speed all

strong bars are not long lived in presence of gas, and multiple-speed spiral

  tool to constrain the temperature of the hottest stars","Accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20078152",,"astro-ph",,"  For the first time, we have identified NeVIII absorption lines in far-UV
spectra of the hottest known (Teff>150,000 K) hydrogen-deficient (pre-) white
dwarfs of spectral type PG1159. They are of photospheric origin and can be
matched by synthetic non-LTE line profiles. We also show that a number of UV
and optical emission lines in these stars can be explained as being
photospheric NeVIII features and not, as hitherto suspected, as ultrahigh
ionised OVIII lines created along shock-zones in the stellar wind.
Consequently, we argue that the long-standing identification of the same
emission lines in hot [WR]-type central stars as being due to ultrahigh-ionised
species (OVII-VIII, CV-VI) must be revised. These lines can be entirely
attributed to thermally excited species (NeVII-VIII, NV, OVI). Photospheric
NeVIII lines are also identified in the hottest known He-rich white dwarf
KPD0005+5106 some of which were also attributed to OVIII previously. This is a
surprise because it must be concluded that KPD0005+5106 is much hotter
(Teff=200,000 K) than hitherto assumed (Teff=120,000 K). This is confirmed by a
re-assessment of the HeII line spectrum. We speculate that the temperature is
high enough to explain the mysterious, hard X-ray emission (1 keV) as being of
photospheric origin.

an algorithm which calculates explicitely a generating idempotent for a

of a a fixed eigenvalue \mu of the Hamiltonian with weight (r_1,r_2). If one

jumps of the symmetry behaviour. For ''generic'' v all smallest symmetry
classes have the same maximal dimension d and structure. But U can contain
linear subspaces on which the dimension of the smallest symmetry class of v
jumps to a value smaller than d. Then the stability subgroup of v can increase.
We can calculate such jumps explicitely. In our investigations we use computer

baryonic distribution and the gravitational field in spiral galaxies without
resorting to dark matter (DM), the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) paradigm
still requires DM in X-ray bright systems. Here, to get a handle on the
distribution and importance of this DM, and thus on its possible form, we
deconstruct the mass profiles of 26 X-ray emitting systems in MOND, with
temperatures ranging from 0.5 to 9 keV. Initially we compute the MOND dynamical
mass as a function of radius, then subtract the known gas mass along with a
component of galaxies which includes the cD galaxy with $M/L_K=1$. Next we test
the compatibility of the required DM with ordinary massive neutrinos at the
experimental limit of detection ($m_{\nu}=2$ eV), with density given by the
Tremaine-Gunn limit. Even by considering that the neutrino density stays
constant and maximal within the central 100 or 150 kpc (which is the absolute
upper limit of a possible neutrino contribution there), we show that these
neutrinos can never account for the required DM within this region. The natural
corollary of this finding is that, whereas clusters (T $\ga$ 3 keV) might have
most of their mass accounted for if ordinary neutrinos have a 2 eV mass, groups
(T $\lsim$ 2 keV) cannot be explained by a 2 eV neutrino contribution. This
means that, for instance, cluster baryonic dark matter (CBDM, Milgrom 2007) or
even sterile neutrinos would present a more satisfactory solution to the
problem of missing mass in MOND X-ray emitting systems.
