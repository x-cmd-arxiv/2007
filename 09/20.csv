restricted to a spatially periodic domain play a prominent role in shaping the
invariant sets of its chaotic dynamics. The continuous spatial translation
symmetry leads to relative equilibrium (traveling wave) and relative periodic
orbit (modulated traveling wave) solutions. The discrete symmetries lead to
existence of equilibrium and periodic orbit solutions, induce decomposition of
state space into invariant subspaces, and enforce certain structurally stable
heteroclinic connections between equilibria. We show, on the example of a
particular small-cell Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system, how the geometry of its
dynamical state space is organized by a rigid `cage' built by heteroclinic
connections between equilibria, and demonstrate the preponderance of unstable
relative periodic orbits and their likely role as the skeleton underpinning
spatiotemporal turbulence in systems with continuous symmetries. We also offer
novel visualizations of the high-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky state space

exponentially and its decay time constant was a power function of the incident

into electron-positron pairs in the field of soft photons with the consequent
isotropization and emission of new high-energy photons by Compton scattering
can lead to the runaway cascade of the high-energy photons and
electron-positron pairs fed by the bulk energy of the flow. This is the essence
of the photon breeding mechanism. We study the problem of high-energy emission
of relativistic jets in blazars via photon breeding mechanism using 2D
ballistic model for the jet with the detailed treatment of particle propagation
and interactions. The gamma-ray background of similar energy density as
observed at Earth is sufficient to trigger the photon breeding. As a result, a
jet can convert up to 80 per cent of its total power into radiation. Photon
breeding produces a population of high-energy pairs and predicts the spectra in
agreement with observations of blazars (e.g. the blazar sequence). It also
decelerates the jet at subparsec scales and induces the transversal gradient of
the Lorentz factor which reconcile the discrepancy between the high Doppler
factors determined from the spectra of TeV blazars and the low apparent
velocities observed at VLBI scales. The broad angular distribution of radiation
predicted by the mechanism reconciles the observed statistics and luminosity
ratio of FR I and BL Lac objects with the large Lorentz factors of the jets as

zero as a power law and as a power law with logarithmic correction,
respectively. The target is thus reached with certainty, but it takes the trap
an infinite time on average to do so. In three dimensions a single trap may
never reach the target and so the survival probability is finite and, in fact,
does not depend on whether the traps move diffusively or subdiffusively. When
the target is surrounded by a sea of traps, on the other hand, its survival
probability decays as a stretched exponential in all dimensions (with a
logarithmic correction in the exponent for $d=2$). A trap will therefore reach
the target with certainty, and will do so in a finite time. These results may

The intrinsic surface stress, magneto- and electrostriction as well as
piezoelectric and piezomagnetic effects are included into the free energy. The
intrinsic surface stress under the curved nanoparticle surface is shown to play
an important role in the shift of ferroelectric and ferromagnetic transition
temperatures and built-in magnetic and electric fields appearance, which are
inversely proportional to the nanorod radius. We consider the case of quadratic
and linear magnetoelectric coupling coefficients. The linear coupling
coefficient is radius independent, whereas the quadratic ones include terms
inversely proportional to the nanorod radius and thus strongly increase with
decrease of the radius. The predicted giant relative dielectric tunability in
the vicinity of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric phase transition points induced
by quadratic magnetoelectric coupling increases by 2-50 times. The quadratic
magnetoelectric coupling dramatically changes the phase diagrams of ferroic
nanorods when the radius decreases. In particular the second order phase
transition may become a first one, the triple point state characterized by
continuous set of order parameters appears at zero external electric and
magnetic fields and the tricritical points appear under external fields.

(spontaneous magnetisation). By identifying a dimensionless parameter \Delta
(\delta M) and a universal constant \Delta_c, they showed in the limit of large
system sizes that for \Delta < \Delta_c the excess is absorbed in the
background (``evaporated'' system), while for \Delta > \Delta_c a droplet of
the dense phase occurs (``condensed'' system).
  To check the applicability of the analytical results to much smaller,
practically accessible system sizes, we performed several Monte Carlo
simulations for the 2D Ising model with nearest-neighbour couplings on a square
lattice at fixed magnetisation M. Thereby, we measured the largest minority
droplet, corresponding to the condensed phase, at various system sizes (L=40,
>..., 640). With analytic values for for the spontaneous magnetisation m_0, the
susceptibility \chi and the Wulff interfacial free energy density \tau_W for
the infinite system, we were able to determine \lambda numerically in very good
agreement with the theoretical prediction.
  Furthermore, we did simulations for the spin-1/2 Ising model on a triangular
lattice and with next-nearest-neighbour couplings on a square lattice. Again,
finding a very good agreement with the analytic formula, we demonstrate the
universal aspects of the theory with respect to the underlying lattice. For the

a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free energy functional whose coefficients are determined
by the mean-field transition temperature T_{c0} and the zero-temperature
penetration depth \lambda(0). We find that if (i) T_{c0} and \lambda(0) are
functions of position, and (ii) \lambda^2(0) is proportional to T_{c0}^y, with
y greater than 0, then the vortices tend to be pinned where T_{c0}, and hence
the magnitude of the superconducting order parameter \Delta, are large. This
behavior is in contrast to the usual picture of pinning in Type-II
superconductors, where pinning occurs in the small-gap regions. We also compute
the local density of states of a model BCS Hamiltonian with d-wave symmetry, in
which the pairing field is obtained from Monte Carlo simulations of a GL free
energy. Several features observed in scanning tunneling spectroscopy
measurements on YBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x} and Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+x} are well reproduced

small gap and sharp coherence peaks, while near the cores it has a larger gap
with low, broad peaks. Additionally, also in agreement with experiment, the
spectrum near the core does not exhibit a zero-energy peak which is, however,

central star) of the nebula (900 K), showing that the excitation temperature
varies across the nebula. The obtained intensities are reasonably well fitted
with 27 km s-1 C-type shock model. This ambient gas velocity is slightly higher
than the observed [HeII] wind velocity of 13 km s-1. The gas excitation can
also be reproduced with a PDR (photo dominant region) model, but this requires
an order of magnitude higher UV radiation. Both models have limitations,
highlighting the need for models that treats both hydrodynamical physics and
the PDR.

the emission line fluxes have enabled us to characterize the mid-IR properties
of Seyfert 1.8/1.9s. We find that the equivalent widths of the 10 um silicate
feature are generally weak in all Seyfert galaxies, as previously reported by
several studies. The few Seyfert galaxies in this sample that show deep 10 um
silicate absorption features are highly inclined and/or merging galaxies. It is
likely that these absorption features originate primarily in the dusty
interstellar medium of the host galaxy rather than in a dusty torus on parsec
scales close to the central engine. We find that the equivalent width of the
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) band at 6.2 um correlates strongly with
the 20-30 um spectral index. Either of these quantities are good indicators of
the amount of starburst contribution to the mid-IR spectra. The spectra of
Seyfert 1.8 and 1.9s are dominated by these starburst features, similar to most
Seyfert 2s. They show strong PAH bands and a strong red continuum toward 30 um.

restoration phase transition at finite density hadrons are deconfined and there
appears the quark matter. We address this question within the only known

The chiral symmetry breaking and the quark Green function are obtained from the
Schwinger-Dyson (gap) equation while the color-singlet meson spectrum results
from the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We solve this model at T=0 and finite
chemical potential $\mu$ and obtain a clear chiral restoration phase transition
at the critical value \mu_{cr}. Below this value the spectrum is similar to the
previously obtained one at \mu = 0. At \mu > \mu_{cr} the quarks are still
confined and the physical spectrum consists of bound states which are arranged
into a complete set of exact chiral multiplets. This explicitly demonstrates
that a chirally symmetric matter consisting of confined but chirally symmetric
hadrons at finite chemical potential is also possible in QCD. If so, there must
be nontrivial implications for astrophysics.

or T Tauri star) is subjected to periodic vertical magnetic forces from the
star, with the forcing frequency equal to the stellar spin frequency or twice
the spin frequency. This gives rise bending waves in the disk that may
influence the variabilities of the system. We study the excitation, propagation
and dissipation of these waves using a hydrodynamical model coupled with a
generic model description of the magnetic forces. The $m=1$ bending waves are
excited at the Lindblad/vertical resonance, and propagate either to larger
radii or inward toward the corotation resonance where dissipation takes place.
While the resonant torque is negligible compared to the accretion torque, the
wave nevertheless may reach appreciable amplitude and can cause or modulate
flux variabilities from the system. We discuss applications of our result to
the observed quasi-periodic oscillations from various systems, in particular
neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries.

produce X-winds and funnel flows. With the assumption of axial symmetry and
steady state flow, the problem can be formulated in terms of quantities that
are conserved along streamlines, such as the Bernoulli integral (BI), plus a
partial differential equation (PDE), called the Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE),
that governs the distribution of streamlines in the meridional plane. The GSE
plus BI yields a PDE of mixed type, elliptic before critical surfaces where the
flow speed equals certain characteristic wave speeds are crossed and hyperbolic
afterward. The computational difficulties are exacerbated by the locations of
the critical surfaces not being known in advance. To overcome these obstacles,
we consider a variational principle by which the GSE can be attacked by
extremizing an action integral, with all other conserved quantities of the
problem explicitly included as part of the overall formulation. To simplify
actual applications we adopt the cold limit of a negligibly small ratio of the
sound speed to the speed of Keplerian rotation in the disk where the X-wind is
launched. We also ignore the obstructing effects of any magnetic fields that
might thread a disk approximated to be infinitesimally thin. We then introduce
trial functions with adjustable coefficients to minimize the variations that
give the GSE. We tabulate the resulting coefficients so that other workers can
have analytic forms to reconstruct X-wind solutions for various astronomical,
cosmochemical, and meteoritical applications.

Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) towards a sample of outflows from massive young
stellar objects. The sample is drawn from a single-distance study by Ridge &
Moore. In a sample of 12 sources, the 5-4 line was detected in 5, a detection
rate of 42 per cent. This detection rate is higher than that found for a sample
of low-luminosity outflow sources, although for sources of comparable
luminosity, it is in good agreement with the results of a previous survey of
high luminosity sources. For most of the detected sources, the 5-4 emission is
compact or slightly extended along the direction of the outflow. NGC6334I shows
a clear bipolar flow in the 5-4 line. Additional data were obtained for
W3-IRS5, AFGL5142 and W75N for the 2-1 transition of SiO using the
Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) millimetre interferometer. There
is broad agreement between the appearance of the SiO emission in both lines,
though there are some minor differences. The 2-1 emission in AFGL5142 is
resolved into two outflow lobes which are spatially coincident on the sky, in
good agreement with previous observations. In general the SiO emission is
clearly associated with the outflow. The primary indicator of SiO 5-4
detectability is the outflow velocity, i.e. the presence of SiO is an indicator
of a high velocity outflow. This result is consistent with the existence of a
critical shock velocity required to disrupt dust grains and subsequent SiO
formation in post-shock gas. There is also weak evidence that higher luminosity
sources and denser outflows are more likely to be detected.

to be $\rho_q \equiv 3 \alpha^2 m_P^2/\eta^2$, where $\eta$ is the conformal
time and $\alpha$ is a numerical constant. In the absence of an interaction
between the ordinary matter and dark energy field $q$, the model may be
adjusted to the present values of the dark energy density fraction $\Omega\Z{q}
\simeq 0.73$ and the equation of state parameter $w\Z{q} < -0.78$, if the
numerical constant $\alpha$ takes a reasonably large value, $\alpha\gtrsim
2.6$. However, in the presence of a nontrivial gravitational coupling of
$q$-field to matter, say $\widetilde{Q}$, the model may be adjusted to the
values $\Omega\Z{q}\simeq 0.73$ and $w\Z{q}\simeq -1$, even if $\alpha\sim
{\cal O}(1)$, given that the present value of $\widetilde{Q}$ is large. Unlike
for the model in [R.G. Cai, arXiv:0707.4049], the bound $\Omega\Z{q} <0.1$

the black-hole hosting globular cluster is based on two independent fiber
spectra obtained at the VLT with FLAMES, which cover a wavelength range of
5000-5800 Angstrom at a spectral resolution of about 6000. In each of these
spectra we find an emission line at 5031.2 Angstrom with an uncertainty of
several tenths of an Angstrom. These are consistent with [OIII] 5007 emission
at the 1475 +/- 7 km/s radial velocity of the globular cluster previously
determined from an analysis of its absorption lines. This agreement within the
small uncertainties argues strongly in favor of the interpretation of the line
as [OIII] 5007 emission from the black-hole hosting globular cluster. We also
find that the emission line most likely has a velocity width of several hundred
km/s. Such a velocity width rules out a planetary nebula explanation for the

stands in contradiction to the identification of QCD quasi-particles with the
thermodynamic degrees of freedom in the early (fluid) stage of heavy ion
collisions. The empirical observation of constituent quark ``$n_q$'' scaling of
elliptic flow is juxtaposed with the lack of such scaling behavior in
hydrodynamic fluid calculations followed by Cooper-Frye freeze-out to hadrons.
A ``quasi-particle transport'' time stage after viscous effects break down the
hydrodynamic fluid stage, but prior to hadronization, is proposed to reconcile
these apparent contradictions. However, without a detailed understanding of the
transitions between these stages, the ``$n_q$'' scaling is not a necessary
consequence of this prescription. Also, if the duration of this stage is too
short, it may not support well defined quasi-particles. By comparing and
contrasting the coalescence of quarks into hadrons with the similar process of
producing light nuclei from nucleons, it is shown that the observation of
``$n_{q}$'' scaling in the final state does not necessarily imply that the
constituent degrees of freedom were the relevant ones in the initial state.

exists in binaries with wide separations and roughly equal masses, has
motivated a variety of new theories explaining their formation. Goldreich et
al. (2002) proposed two formation scenarios: In the first, a transient binary
is formed, which becomes bound with the aid of dynamical friction from the sea
of small bodies (L^2s mechanism); in the second, a binary is formed by three
body gravitational deflection (L^3 mechanism). Here, we accurately calculate
the L^2s and L^3 formation rates for sub-Hill velocities. While the L^2s
formation rate is close to previous order of magnitude estimates, the L^3
formation rate is about a factor of 4 smaller. For sub-Hill KBO velocities (v
<< v_H) the ratio of the L^3 to the L^2s formation rate is 0.05 (v/v_H)
independent of the small bodies' velocity dispersion, their surface density or
their mutual collisions. For Super-Hill velocities (v >> v_H) the L^3 mechanism
dominates over the L^2s mechanism. Binary formation via the L^3 mechanism
competes with binary destruction by passing bodies. Given sufficient time, a
statistical equilibrium abundance of binaries forms. We show that the frequency
of long-lived transient binaries drops exponentially with the system's lifetime
and that such transient binaries are not important for binary formation via the
L^3 mechanism, contrary to Lee et al. (2007). For the L^2s mechanism we find
that the typical time, transient binaries must last, to form Kuiper Belt
binaries (KBBs) for a given strength of dynamical friction, D, increases only
logarithmically with D. Longevity of transient binaries only becomes important
for very weak dynamical friction (i.e. D \lesssim 0.002) and is most likely not
crucial for KBB formation.

extra dimensions) annihilating with a cross section on the order of sigma
v~3x10^-26 cm^3/s and distributed with a cusped halo profile. No further exotic
astrophysical or annihilation boost factors are required. If dark matter
annihilations are in fact responsible for the observed Haze, then other
annihilation products will also be produced, including gamma rays. In this
article, we study the prospects for the GLAST satellite to detect gamma rays
from dark matter annihilations in the Galactic Center region in this scenario.
We find that by studying only the inner 0.1 degrees around the Galactic Center,
GLAST will be able to detect dark matter annihilating to heavy quarks or gauge
bosons over astrophysical backgrounds with 5sigma (3sigma) significance if they
are lighter than approximately 320-500 GeV (500-750 GeV). If the angular window
is broadened to study the dark matter halo profile's angular extension (while
simultaneously reducing the astrophysical backgrounds), WIMPs as heavy as
several TeV can be identified by GLAST with high significance. Only if the dark
matter particles annihilate mostly to electrons or muons will GLAST be unable

arrow of time is necessarily aligned with the thermodynamic arrow, is correct.
Schulman gives an explicit physical mechanism for this connection, based on the
brain being representable as a computer, together with certain thermodynamic
properties of computational processes. [Haw94] presents similar, if briefer,
arguments. The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the support for
the link between thermodynamics and an arrow of time for computers. The
principal arguments put forward by Schulman and Hawking will be shown to fail.
It will be shown that any computational process that can take place in an
entropy increasing universe, can equally take place in an entropy decreasing
universe. This conclusion does not automatically imply a psychological arrow
can run counter to the thermodynamic arrow. Some alternative possible explana-
tions for the alignment of the two arrows will be briefly discussed.

lattice cutoff of 1/a = 1.3 GeV and light quark masses down to about 1/4 the

action and domain wall fermions. The physical volume of our largest lattice is
about (3.6 fm)^3, where the finite volume effects on form factors become
negligible and the lower momentum transfers (q^2 = 0.1 GeV^2) are accessible.
The q^2-dependences of form factors in the low q^2 region are examined. It is
found that the vector, induced tensor, axial-vector form factors are well
described by the dipole form, while the induced pseudo-scalar form factor is
consistent with pion-pole dominance. We obtain the ratio of axial to vector

non-thermal component, and discovered their spatial distributions are different
from each other. The low temperature plasma is dominated at the east rim,
whereas the non-thermal emission is the brightest at the northeast rim which is
spatially connected from the east rim. The high temperature plasma, found to
contain the ~6.42keV line (K alpha of low-ionized iron), is enhanced at the
inward region with respect to the east rim and has no spatial correlation with
the non-thermal X-ray (the northeast). The Fe-Kalpha line, therefore, is not
related to the non-thermal emission but originates from Fe-rich ejecta heated
to the high temperatures by the reverse shock. Since the metal abundances of
the low temperature plasma are sub-solar, the most possible origin of this
component is interstellar medium heated by a blast wave. The non-thermal X-ray,
which has a power-law index of ~2.8, is likely to be synchrotron emission. A
possible scenario to explain these morphologies and spectra is: A fast moving
blast wave in a thin cavity of OB association collided with a dense
interstellar medium or cloud at the east region very recently. As the result,
the reverse shock in this interior decelerated, and arrived at the Fe-rich
region of the ejecta and heated it. In the northeast rim, on the other hand,
the blast wave is still moving fast, and accelerated high energy electrons to
emit synchrotron X-rays.

which represents quasi-spherical dust collapse - has been studied on numerous
occasions in the context of the cosmic censorship conjecture. The various
results derived have assumed that there exist radial null geodesics in the
space-time. We show that such geodesics do not exist in general, and so
previous results on the visibility of the singularity are not generally valid.
More precisely, we show that the existence of a radial geodesic in Szekeres
space-time implies that the space-time is axially symmetric, with the geodesic
along the polar direction (i.e. along the axis of symmetry). If there is a
second non-parallel radial geodesic, then the space-time is spherically
symmetric, and so is a Lema\^{\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) space-time. For the
case of the polar geodesic in an axially symmetric Szekeres space-time, we give
conditions on the free functions (i.e. initial data) of the space-time which
lead to visibility of the singularity along this direction. Likewise, we give a
sufficient condition for censorship of the singularity. We point out the
complications involved in addressing the question of visibility of the
singularity both for non-radial null geodesics in the axially symmetric case
and in the general (non-axially symmetric) case, and suggest a possible
approach.

  profiles","19 pages, 6 figures",,,,"q-bio.GN q-bio.MN",,"  In unicellular organisms such as bacteria the same acquired mutations
beneficial in one environment can be restrictive in another. However, evolving
Escherichia coli populations demonstrate remarkable flexibility in adaptation.
The mechanisms sustaining genetic flexibility remain unclear. In E. coli the
transcriptional regulation of gene expression involves both dedicated
regulators binding specific DNA sites with high affinity and also global
regulators - abundant DNA architectural proteins of the bacterial chromoid
binding multiple low affinity sites and thus modulating the superhelical
density of DNA. The first form of transcriptional regulation is dominantly
pairwise and specific, representing digitial control, while the second form is
(in strength and distribution) continuous, representing analog control. Here we
look at the properties of effective networks derived from significant gene
expression changes under variation of the two forms of control and find that
upon limitations of one type of control (caused e.g. by mutation of a global
DNA architectural factor) the other type can compensate for compromised
regulation. Mutations of global regulators significantly enhance the digital
control; in the presence of global DNA architectural proteins regulation is
mostly of the analog type, coupling spatially neighboring genomic loci;
together our data suggest that two logically distinct types of control are
balancing each other. By revealing two distinct logical types of control, our
approach provides basic insights into both the organizational principles of
transcriptional regulation and the mechanisms buffering genetic flexibility. We
anticipate that the general concept of distinguishing logical types of control
will apply to many complex biological networks.

a model of a quantum Hall edge system with a gate-voltage controlled

from a Landauer-Buttiker analysis as arising from the splitting of edge current
caused by the difference in the filling fractions of the bulk ($\nu_{1}$) and
constriction ($\nu_{2}$) quantum Hall fluid regions. We develop a hydrodynamic
theory for bosonic edge modes inspired by this model. The constriction region
splits the incident long-wavelength chiral edge density-wave excitations among
the transmitting and reflecting edge states encircling it. The competition
between two interedge tunneling processes taking place inside the constriction,
related by a quasiparticle-quasihole (qp-qh) symmetry, is accounted for by
computing the boundary theories of the system. This competition is found to
determine the strong coupling configuration of the system. A separatrix of
qp-qh symmetric gapless critical states is found to lie between the relevant RG
flows to a metallic and an insulating configuration of the constriction system.
This constitutes an interesting generalisation of the Kane-Fisher quantum
impurity model. The features of the RG phase diagram are also confirmed by
computing various correlators and chiral linear conductances of the system. In
this way, our results find excellent agreement with many recent puzzling
experimental results for the cases of $\nu_{1}=1/3,~1$. We also discuss and
make predictions for the case of a constriction system with $\nu_{2}=5/2$.

  June 2007, Rila mountains, Bulgaria",,,,"nucl-th",,"  Lately we have been tackling the problem of describing nuclear collective
excitations starting from correlated realistic nucleon-nucleon (NN)
interactions. The latter are constructed within the Unitary Correlation
Operator Method (UCOM), starting from realistic NN potentials. It has been
concluded that first-order RPA with a two-body UCOM interaction is not capable,
in general, of reproducing quantitatively the properties of giant resonances
(GRs), due to missing higher-order configurations and long-range correlations
as well as neglected three-body terms in the Hamiltonian.
  Here we report results on GRs obtained by employing a UCOM interaction based
on the Argonne V18 potential in Second RPA (SRPA) calculations. The same
interaction is used to describe the Hartree-Fock (HF) ground state and the
residual interactions. We find that the inclusion of second-order
configurations -- which effectively dress the underlying HF single-particle
states with self-energy insertions -- produces sizable corrections. The effect
appears essential for a realistic description of GRs when using the UCOM. We
argue that effects of higher than second order should be negligible. Therefore,
the UCOM-SRPA emerges as a promising tool for consistent calculations of
collective states in closed-shell nuclei. This is an interesting development,
given that SRPA can accommodate more physics than RPA (e.g., fragmentation).
Remaining discrepancies due to the missing three-body terms and
self-consistency issues of the present SRPA model are pointed out.

suspension has a yield stress. From classical rheology it follows that as a
function of the applied stress the suspension is first solid (yield stress),
then liquid and then solid again when it shear thickens. The onset shear rate
for thickening is found to depend on the measurement geometry: the smaller the
gap of the shear cell, the lower the shear rate at which thickening occurs.
Shear thickening can then be interpreted as the consequence of the Reynolds
dilatancy: the system under flow wants to dilate but instead undergoes a
jamming transition because it is confined, as confirmed by measurement of the
dilation of the suspension as a function of the shear rate.

attention is paid to the transverse regime of the scattering, which holds in a

induced transverse scattering of the radio beam into the background, which
takes place in the open field line tube of a pulsar. In this case, the
radiation is predominantly scattered backwards and the scattered component may
grow considerably. Based on this effect, we for the first time suggest a
physical explanation of the interpulse emission observed in the profiles of
some pulsars. Our model can naturally account for the peculiar spectral and
polarization properties of the interpulses. Furthermore, it implies a specific
connection of the interpulse to the main pulse, which may reveal itself in the
consistent intensity fluctuations of the components at different timescales.
Diverse observational manifestations of this connection, including the moding
behavior of PSR B1822-09, the peculiar temporal and frequency structure of the
giant interpulses in the Crab pulsar, and the intrinsic phase correspondence of
the subpulse patterns in the main pulse and the interpulse of PSR B1702-19, are
discussed in detail. It is also argued that the pulse-to-pulse fluctuations of
the scattering efficiency may lead to strong variability of the interpulse,
which is yet to be studied observationally. In particular, some pulsars may
exhibit transient interpulses, i.e. the scattered component may be detectable

the formation of a young star, during the collapse of the dense molecular cloud
core. It is currently not well understood at what stage of the collapse the
disk is formed or how it subsequently evolves. We aim to identify whether an
embedded Keplerian protoplanetary disk resides in the L1489 IRS system. Given
the amount of envelope material still present, such a disk would respresent a
very young example of a protoplanetary disk. Using the Submillimeter Array
(SMA) we have observed the HCO$^+$ $J=$ 3--2 line with a resolution of about
1$''$. At this resolution a protoplanetary disk with a radius of a few hundred
AUs should be detectable, if present. Radiative transfer tools are used to
model the emission from both continuum and line data. We find that these data
are consistent with theoretical models of a collapsing envelope and Keplerian
circumstellar disk. Models reproducing both the SED and the interferometric
continuum observations reveal that the disk is inclined by 40$^\circ$ which is
significantly different to the surrounding envelope (74$^\circ$). This
misalignment of the angular momentum axes may be caused by a gradient within
the angular momentum in the parental cloud or if L1489 IRS is a binary system

for variability at sub-arcsecond scales may be able to constrain these
dynamical variations directly. However, if stars form from turbulent cores, the
accreting material will not have a constant angular momentum axis (although the
average is well defined and conserved) in which case it is more likely to have
a misalignment of the angular momentum axes of the disk and the envelope.

  September 19; in original form 2007 April 2",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12498.x",,"astro-ph",,"  We have compared numerical simulations to observations for the nearby (< 40
Mpc) groups of galaxies (Huchra & Geller 1982 and Ramella et al. 2002). The
group identification is carried out using a group-finding algorithm developed
by Huchra and Geller (1982). Using cosmological N-body simulation code with the
LambdaCDM cosmology, we show that the dynamical properties of groups of
galaxies identified from the simulation data are, in general, in a moderate,
within 2sigma, agreement with the observational catalogues of groups of
galaxies. As simulations offer more dynamical information than observations, we
used the N-body simulation data to calculate whether the nearby groups of
galaxies are gravitationally bound objects by using their virial ratio. We show
that in a LambdaCDM cosmology about 20 per cent of nearby groups of galaxies,
identified by the same algorithm as in the case of observations, are not bound,
but merely groups in a visual sense. This is quite significant, specifically
because estimations of group masses in observations are often based on an
assumption that groups of galaxies found by the friends-of-friends algorithm
are gravitationally bound objects. Simulations with different resolutions show
the same results. We also show how the fraction of gravitationally unbound
groups varies when the apparent magnitude limit of the sample and the value of
the cosmological constant is changed. In general, a larger value of the
Omega_Lambda generates slightly more unbound groups.

neighborhood and in both Oosterhoff type I (OoI) and type II (OoII) Galactic
globular clusters (GGCs). The distribution of cluster RR_ab in the PA_V plane
depends not only on the metal abundance, but also on the cluster Horizontal
Branch (HB) morphology. On average the observed k_puls parameter, connecting
the period to the visual amplitude, increases when moving from metal-poor to
metal-rich GGCs. However, this parameter shows marginal changes among OoI
clusters with intermediate to red HB types and iron abundances -1.8<= [Fe/H]
<=-1.1, whereas its value decreases in OoII clusters with the bluer HB
morphology. Moreover, at [Fe/H]=-1.7+-0.1 the OoI clusters present redder HB
types and larger <k_puls> values than the OoII clusters. The RR_ab variables in
Omega Cen and in the solar neighborhood further support the evidence that the
spread in [Fe/H], at fixed k_puls, is of the order of +-0.5 dex. Synthetic HB
simulations show that the PA_V plane can provide accurate cluster distance
estimates. The RR_ab variables in OoI and in OoII clusters with very blue HB
types obey a well-defined M_V(RR)-k_puls relation, while those in OoII clusters
with moderately blue HB types present a zero-point that is ~0.05 mag brighter.
Regarding field variables, we show that with [Fe/H]=> -1.0 a unique
M_V(RR)-k_puls relation can be adopted, independently of the parent HB
morphology. Current findings suggest that the PA_V distribution does not seem
to be a robust diagnostic for the metal abundance of RR_ab variables. However,
the same observables can be used to estimate the absolute magnitude of globular
cluster and field RR_ab variables. We show that over the metallicity range
-2.4<= [Fe/H] <= 0.0 the M_V(RR)-[Fe/H] relation shows a parabolic behavior.

consideration of bulk and surface energies to generate rates of growth and

an approximation of local free energy changes that depend only on immediate

reversible changes between amorphous and crystalline regimes are used to store

good agreement to experimental incubation times at low temperatures while

evolved binaries and their impact on the evolution of the central system. Aims:
To study in detail the binary nature of RUCen and ACHer, as well as the
structure and mineralogy of the circumstellar environment. Methods: We combine
multi-wavelength observations with a 2D radiative transfer study. Our radial
velocity program studies the central stars, while our Spitzer spectra and
broad-band SEDs are used to constrain mineralogy, grain sizes and physical
structure of the circumstellar environment. Results: We determine the orbital
elements of RUCen showing that the orbit is highly eccentric with a rather long
period of 1500 days. The infrared spectra of both objects are very similar and
the spectral dust features are dominated by Mg-rich crystalline silicates. The
small peak-to-continuum ratios are interpreted as being due to large grains.
Our model contains two components with a cold midplain dominated by large
grains, and the near- and mid-IR which is dominated by the emission of smaller
silicates. The infrared excess is well modelled assuming a hydrostatic passive
irradiated disc. The profile-fitting of the dust resonances shows that the
grains must be very irregular. Conclusions: These two prototypical RVTauri
pulsators with circumstellar dust are binaries where the dust is trapped in a
stable disc. The mineralogy and grain sizes show that the dust is highly
processed, both in crystallinity and grain size. The cool crystals show that
either radial mixing is very efficient and/or that the thermal history at grain
formation has been very different from that in outflows. The physical processes
governing the structure of these discs are similar to those observed in
protoplanetary discs around young stellar objects.

is calculated for a broad range of grain sizes and for different intensities of
the interstellar radiation field, relevant to diffuse clouds and to PDRs. The
dependence of the average grain temperature on its size is shown for different
irradiation intensities. It is found that the average temperatures of grains
with radii smaller than about 0.02 $\mu$m are reduced due to the fluctuations.
The average temperatures of grains of radii larger than about 0.35 $\mu$m are
also slightly reduced due to their more efficient emission of infrared
radiation, particularly when exposed to high irradiation intensities. The
average temperatures <T> of silicate and carbonaceous grains are found to
depend on the radiation field intensity X_MMP according to <T>~X_MMP^gamma,
where the exponent gamma depends on the grain size and composition. This
fitting formula is expected to be useful in simulations of interstellar
processes, and can replace commonly used approximations which do not account
for the grain temperature fluctuations and for the detailed properties of
interstellar dust particles. The implications of the results on molecular
hydrogen formation are also discussed. It is concluded that grain-temperature

cannot account for the observations of H_2 in photon dominated regions, even in

(dSph) galaxy, using the Infrared Spectrometer on board the Spitzer Space
Telescope. The stars were selected from a near-infrared survey of Fornax and
include the three reddest stars, with presumably the highest mass-loss rates,
in that galaxy. Such carbon stars probably belong to the intermediate-age
population (2-8 Gyr old and metallicity of [Fe/H] -1) of Fornax. The primary
aim of this paper is to investigate mass-loss rate, as a function of luminosity
and metallicity, by comparing AGB stars in several galaxies with different
metallicities. The spectra of three stars are fitted with a radiative transfer
model. We find that mass-loss rates of these three stars are 4-7x10^-6 Msun
yr-1. The other two stars have mass-loss rates below 1.3x10^-6 Msun yr-1. We
find no evidence that these rates depend on metallicity, although we do suggest
that the gas-to-dust ratio could be higher than at solar metallicity, in the
range 240 to 800. The C2H2 bands are stronger at lower metallicity because of
the higher C/O ratio. In contrast, the SiC fraction is reduced at low
metallicity, due to low silicon abundance. The total mass-loss rate from all
known carbon-rich AGB stars into the interstellar medium of this galaxy is of
the order of 2x10^-5 Msun yr-1. This is much lower than that of the dwarf
irregular galaxy WLM, which has a similar visual luminosity and metallicity.
The difference is attributed to the younger stellar population of WLM. The
suppressed gas-return rate to the ISM accentuates the difference between the
relatively gas-rich dwarf irregular and the gas-poor dwarf spheroidal galaxies.
Our study will be useful to constrain gas and dust recycling processes in low
metallicity galaxies.

recognized as dark lanes. In G-band, they showed their shapes almost the same
as in Stokes I images. These magnetic flux appeared as dark filaments in Ca II
H images. Stokes V images of Fe 6302 angstrom showed pairs of opposite
polarities at footpoints of each filament. These magnetic concentrations are
identified to correspond to bright points in G-band/Ca II H images. From the
analysis of time-sliced diagrams, we derived following properties of emerging
flux, which are consistent with the previous works. (1) Two footpoints separate
each other at a speed of 4.2 km/s during the initial phase of evolution and
decreases to about 1 km/s in 10 minutes later. (2) Ca II H filaments appear
almost simultaneously with the formation of dark lanes in Stokes I in the
observational cadence of 2 minutes. (3) The lifetime of the dark lanes in
Stokes I and G-band is 8 minutes, while that of Ca filament is 12 minutes. An
interesting phenomena was observed that an emerging flux tube expands laterally

finite width and interacting with the walls of the slit via an attractive
potential has been calculated recently. The walks can be considered to model
the polymer-induced steric stabilisation and sensitised floculation of
colloidal dispersions. The large width asymptotics led to a phase diagram
different to that of a polymer attached to, and attracted to, a single wall.
The question that arises is: can one interpolate between the single wall and
two wall cases? In this paper we calculate the exact scaling functions for the
partition function by considering the two variable asymptotics of the partition
function for simultaneous large length and large width. Consequently, we find
the scaling functions for the force induced by the polymer on the walls. We
find that these scaling functions are given by elliptic theta-functions. In
some parts of the phase diagram there is more a complex crossover between the
single wall and two wall cases and we elucidate how this happens.

into the cavity (when approaching the lead mouths from the cavity interior) to
play a key role. Diffractive scattering couples transmitted and reflected paths
and is thus essential to reproduce the weak-localization peak in reflection and
the corresponding anti-peak in transmission. A comparison of semiclassical
calculations featuring these diffractive paths yields good agreement with full
quantum calculations and experimental data. Our theory provides system-specific
predictions for the quantum regime of few open lead modes and can be expected
to be relevant also for mixed as well as chaotic systems.

results that rely on several approximations. We find that the simulations
always lead to a somewhat smaller diffusion coefficient than our analytical

positions on the membrane, such that forces along the trajectory are on average

However, as the preceding paper has claimed (HSPS 37 Suppl. (2007), 73-121),
Rupp's success was the result of scientific fraud. This paper will argue, after
exploring their interpretation, that the experiments were a relevant part of
the background to such celebrated contributions to quantum mechanics as Born's
statistical interpretation of the wave function and Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle. Yet, the Einstein-Rupp experiments have hardly received attention in
the history of quantum mechanics literature. In part, this is a consequence of
self-censorship in the physics community, enforced in the wake of the Rupp

the laminar state without any indication of the imminent decay. In this

of the largest Schmidt coefficient. On the other hand, in many cases,
estimation of separable states by LOCC is worse than the global optimal
estimate by $O(\frac{1}{n})$.
  To show that the gap is exponentially small for entangled states, we propose
self-teleportation protocol as the key component of construct of LOCC
protocols. Objective of the protocol is to transfer Alice's part of quantum
information by LOCC, using intrinsic entanglement of $| \phi_{\theta}>
^{\otimes n}$ without using any extra resources. This protocol itself is of
interest in its own right.

  Evidence for Roll Convection?","16 pages, 7 figures; accepted by Solar Physics","Solar Physics, v. 248, no. 2, pp. 233-245, 2008","10.1007/s11207-007-9056-9",,"astro-ph",,"  Time-averaged series of granulation images are analysed using COLIBRI, a
purpose-adapted version of a code originally developed to detect straight or
curvilinear features in aerospace images. The algorithm of image processing
utilises a nonparametric statistical criterion that identifies a straight-line
segment as a linear feature (lineament) if the photospheric brightness at a
certain distance from this line is on both sides stochastically lower or higher
than at the line itself. Curvilinear features can be detected as chains of
lineaments, using a criterion modified in some way. Once the input parameters
used by the algorithm are properly adjusted, the algorithm highlights
``ridges'' and ``trenches'' in the relief of the brightness field, drawing
white and dark lanes. The most remarkable property of the trenching patterns is
a nearly-universally-present parallelism of ridges and trenches. Since the
material upflows are brighter than the downflows, the alternating parallel
light and dark lanes should reflect the presence of roll convection in the
subphotospheric layers. If the numerous images processed by us are
representative, the patterns revealed suggest a widespread occurrence of roll
convection in the outer solar convection zone. In particular, the roll systems
could form the fine structure of larger-scale, supergranular and/or
mesogranular convection flows. Granules appear to be overheated blobs of
material that could develop in convection rolls due to some instabilities of
roll motion.

dimension, namely of co-homogeneity 1, can be canonically simplified, a
property that is shown to hold to any order in perturbation theory. Recalling
that the problem naturally reduces to 1d, a procedure is described whereby for
each gauge function in 1d two 1d fields are eliminated from the action - one is
gauge and can be eliminated without a constraint and the other is auxiliary.
These results generalize the results of hep-th/0609001 from linear to
non-linear perturbations and they unify two cases of physical interest:
cosmological perturbations and perturbations to static spherically symmetric
backgrounds. An application to black strings is discussed in some detail.

discussion since metallicity effects have been assumed to play a role in the
value of the intercept and, more recently, of the slope of these relations. The
goal of the present study is to calibrate the Galactic PL relations in various
photometric bands (from B to K) and to compare the results to the
well-established PL relations in the LMC. We use a set of 59 calibrating stars,
the distances of which are measured using five different distance indicators:
Hubble Space Telescope and revised Hipparcos parallaxes, infrared surface
brightness and interferometric Baade-Wesselink parallaxes, and classical
Zero-Age-Main-Sequence-fitting parallaxes for Cepheids belonging to open
clusters or OB stars associations. A detailed discussion of absorption
corrections and projection factor to be used is given. We find no significant
difference in the slopes of the PL relations between LMC and our Galaxy. We
conclude that the Cepheid PL relations have universal slopes in all photometric
bands, not depending on the galaxy under study (at least for LMC and Milky
Way). The possible zero-point variation with metal content is not discussed in
the present work, but an upper limit of 18.50 for the LMC distance modulus can
be deduced from our data.

zero-temperature energies and they are always gapped. For the staggered
dimerization order, we find the quantum critical lines, in agreement with
earlier analyses. The bond mean-field theory we apply, demonstrates its
quantitative accuracy and agrees with available numerical results. We conclude
that unless some mechanism for locking dimerization into the energetically less
favorable staggered configuration is provided, the dimerized ladders do not
order into the phase where the quantum criticality occurs.

Type IIn supernova (SN) 1997eg that indicate the presence of a flattened
disk-like concentration of circumstellar material surrounding nonspherical
ejecta, with which the disk is misaligned. The polarization across the broad H
alpha, H beta, and He I 5876 lines of SN 1997eg forms closed loops when viewed
in the Stokes q-u plane. Such loops occur when the geometrical symmetry of one
or both of the Stokes parameters across spectral lines is broken, in this case
most likely by occultation of the ejecta by the equatorial circumstellar matter
concentration. The polarization of the narrow Balmer lines possesses an
intrinsic axis that differs by 12 degrees from that of the elongated ejecta and
probably indicates the orientation of the disk-like circumstellar material. The
existence of two different axes of symmetry in SN 1997eg suggests that neither
rotation of the progenitor nor the influence of a companion star can be the
sole mechanism creating a preferred axis within the supernova system. Our model
supports the emerging hypothesis that the progenitors of some Type IIn
supernovae are luminous blue variable stars, whose pre-supernova mass eruptions
form the circumstellar shells that physically characterize the SN IIn subclass.
These conclusions, which are independent of interstellar polarization effects,
would have been unobservable with only a single epoch of spectropolarimetry.
