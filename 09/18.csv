large-scale structure than conventional dark energy models, in that different
observables are not described by a single growth factor even in the linear
regime. We examine the relationships between perturbations in the metric
potentials, density and velocity fields, and discuss strategies for measuring
them using gravitational lensing, galaxy cluster abundances, galaxy
clustering/dynamics and the ISW effect. We show how a broad class of gravity
theories can be tested by combining these probes. A robust way to interpret
observations is by constraining two key functions: the ratio of the two metric
potentials, and the ratio of the Gravitational ``constant'' in the Poisson
equation to Newton's constant. We also discuss quasilinear effects that carry
signatures of gravity, such as through induced three-point correlations.
  Clustering of dark energy can mimic features of modified gravity theories and
thus confuse the search for distinct signatures of such theories. It can
produce pressure perturbations and anisotropic stresses, which breaks the
equality between the two metric potentials even in general relativity. With
these two extra degrees of freedom, can a clustered dark energy model mimic
modified gravity models in all observational tests? We show with specific
examples that observational constraints on both the metric potentials and
density perturbations can in principle distinguish modifications of gravity
from dark energy models. We compare our result with other recent studies that
have slightly different assumptions (and apparently contradictory conclusions).

Hawking emission from a microscopic black hole is significantly modified by the
formation of a photosphere around the black hole due to QED or QCD interactions
between the emitted particles. In this paper we analyze these claims and
identify a number of physical and geometrical effects which invalidate these
scenarios. We point out two key problems. First, the interacting particles must
be causally connected to interact, and this condition is satisfied by only a
small fraction of the emitted particles close to the black hole. Second, a
scattered particle requires a distance ~ E/m_e^2 for completing each
bremsstrahlung interaction, with the consequence that it is improbable for
there to be more than one complete bremsstrahlung interaction per particle near
the black hole. These two effects have not been included in previous analyses.
We conclude that the emitted particles do not interact sufficiently to form a
QED photosphere. Similar arguments apply in the QCD case and prevent a QCD
photosphere (chromosphere) from developing when the black hole temperature is
much greater than Lambda_QCD, the threshold for QCD particle emission.
Additional QCD phenomenological arguments rule out the development of a
chromosphere around black hole temperatures of order Lambda_QCD. In all cases,
the observational signatures of a cosmic or Galactic halo background of
primordial black holes or an individual black hole remain essentially those of
the standard Hawking model, with little change to the detection probability. We
also consider the possibility, as proposed by Belyanin et al. and D. Cline et
al., that plasma interactions between the emitted particles form a photosphere,
and we conclude that this scenario too is not supported.

from classical kit string state representations in two ways: the freedom of
choice of basis states, and the fact that each quantum theory representation is

labeled by different k values, different basis or gauge choices, and different

of the most promising proposals of physical realization, and opens new
perspectives for parallelization by taking advantage of quantum entanglement.
Since a one-way quantum computation is based on quantum measurement, which is a
fundamentally nondeterministic evolution, a sufficient condition of global
determinism has been introduced as the existence of a causal flow in a graph
that underlies the computation. A O(n^3)-algorithm has been introduced for
finding such a causal flow when the numbers of output and input vertices in the
graph are equal, otherwise no polynomial time algorithm was known for deciding
whether a graph has a causal flow or not. Our main contribution is to introduce
a O(n^2)-algorithm for finding a causal flow, if any, whatever the numbers of
input and output vertices are. This answers the open question stated by Danos
and Kashefi and by de Beaudrap. Moreover, we prove that our algorithm produces
an optimal flow (flow of minimal depth.)
  Whereas the existence of a causal flow is a sufficient condition for
determinism, it is not a necessary condition. A weaker version of the causal
flow, called gflow (generalized flow) has been introduced and has been proved
to be a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of deterministic
computations. Moreover the depth of the quantum computation is upper bounded by
the depth of the gflow. However, the existence of a polynomial time algorithm
that finds a gflow has been stated as an open question. In this paper we answer
this positively with a polynomial time algorithm that outputs an optimal gflow
of a given graph and thus finds an optimal correction strategy to the
nondeterministic evolution due to measurements.

neglected. We derive the lower bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio by
considering the back-reaction of the scalar perturbations as a source of
gravitational waves. These results show that no cosmological model that is
compatible with a metric scalar amplitude of $\approx 10^{-5}$ can have a ratio
of the tensor to scalar power spectra less than $\approx 10^{-8}$ at
recombination and that higher-order terms leads to logarithmic growth for r
during radiation domination. Our lower bound also applies to non-inflationary

053059-683542 that was discovered in the Reid-Parker AAO/UKST H-alpha survey of
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The emission from this object appears
entirely nebular, with the central star apparently obscured by a central band
of absorption that bisects the nebula. The light curves, which were derived
from images from the SuperMACHO project at CTIO, showed significant, spatially
resolved variability over the period 2002 January through 2005 December.
Remarkably, the emission from the two bright lobes of the nebula vary either
independently, or similarly but with a phase lag of at least one year. The
optical spectra show a low level of nebular excitation, and only modest N
enrichment. Infrared photometry from the 2MASS and SAGE surveys indicates the
presence of a significant quantity of dust. The available data imply that the
central star has a close binary companion, and that the system has undergone
some kind of outburst event that caused the nebular emission to first brighten
and then fade. Further monitoring, high-resolution imaging, and detailed IR
polarimetry and spectroscopy would uncover the nature of this nebula and the
unseen ionizing source.

X-ray binaries, Sco X-1, Cyg X-2 and GRS1915+105. The slopes of the spectra are
shallower than what is expected from a standard steady-state accretion disc,
and can be explained if the near-infrared flux contains a contribution from an
optically thin jet. For the neutron star systems, Sco X-1 and Cyg X-2, the
polarization levels at 2.4um are 1.3+/-0.10% and 5.4+/-0.7% respectively which
is greater than the polarization level at 1.65um. This cannot be explained by
interstellar polarization or electron scattering in the anisotropic environment
of the accretion flow. We propose that the most likely explanation is that this
is the polarimetric signature of synchrotron emission arising from close to the
base of the jets in these systems. In the black hole system GRS1915+105 the
observed polarization, although high (5.0+/-1.2% at 2.4um), may be consistent
with interstellar polarization. For Sco X-1 the position angle of the radio jet
on the sky is approximately perpendicular to the near-infrared position angle
(electric vector), suggesting that the magnetic field is aligned with the jet.
These observations may be a first step towards probing the ordering, alignment
and variability of the outflow magnetic field in a region closer to the central
accreting object than is observed in the radio band.

adatom fluxes transverse and parallel to step edges obey different laws,
yielding a tensor mobility for the continuum surface flux. The partial

enables the theory to explain a number of phenomena involving spin-dependent
current through the Schottky barrier, especially the counter-intuitive spin
polarization direction in the semiconductor due to current extraction seen in
recent experiments. A possible explanation of this phenomenon involves taking
into account the spin-dependent inelastic scattering via the bound states in
the interface region. The quantum-mechanical treatment of spin transport
through the interface is coupled with the semiclassical description of
transport in the adjoining media, in which we take into account the in-plane
spin diffusion along the interface in the planar geometry used in experiments.
The theory forms the basis of the calculation of spin-dependent current flow in
multi-terminal systems, consisting of a semiconductor channel with many
ferromagnetic contacts attached, in which the spin accumulation created by spin
injection/extraction can be efficiently sensed by electrical means. A
three-terminal system can be used as a magnetic memory cell with the bit of
information encoded in the magnetization of one of the contacts. Using five
terminals we construct a reprogrammable logic gate, in which the logic inputs
and the functionality are encoded in magnetizations of the four terminals,
while the current out of the fifth one gives a result of the operation.

similar to disk galaxies in the local universe. Assuming that the LBGs have a
disk-shape, we compared their size-luminosity and size-stellar mass relation
with those of z=0 and z=1 disk galaxies. The LBGs are brighter than z=0 and z=1
disk galaxies at the same effective radius. The rest-frame V-band surface
brightness of the LBGs are 2.2-2.9 mag and 1.2-1.9 mag brighter than the disk
galaxies at z=0 and z=1, respectively. The size-stellar mass relation of the

mass. For the LBGs brighter than Mv*, the average surface stellar mass density
is 3-6 times larger than those of the z=0 and z=1 disk galaxies. We also
examine the profiles of the serendipitously observed DRGs. They are also fitted

quasars with larger black hole masses have larger percentage flux variations.
Partial rank correlation analysis shows that the correlation cannot explained

whether the correlation is a manifestation of a relation between BH mass and
accretion disk thermal time scales, or if it is due to changes in the optical
depth of the accretion disk with black hole mass. Perhaps the most likely
explanation is that the more massive black holes are starving, and produce
larger flux variations because they do not have a steady inflow of gaseous

epitaxial growth through step flow. The step stiffness, $\tbe(\theta)$, is
determined via perturbations of the kinetic steady state for small edge Peclet

(TDGs) that would have survived several Gyr after the collision lying at their
origin. Such survivors, which would by now have become independent relaxed
galaxies, would be ideal laboratories, if nearby enough, to tackle a number of
topical issues, including the distribution of Dark Matter in and around
galaxies. However finding old dwarf galaxies with a confirmed tidal origin is
an observational challenge. A dwarf galaxy in the Virgo Cluster, VCC 2062,
exhibits several unusual properties that are typical of a galaxy made out of
recycled material. We discuss whether it may indeed be a TDG. We analysed
multi-wavelength observations of VCC 2062, including an IRAM CO map, an optical
spectrum of its HII regions, GALEX ultraviolet and archival broad-band and
narrow-band optical images as well as a VLA HI datacube, originally obtained as
part of the VIVA project. VCC 2062 appears to be the optical, low surface
brightness counterpart of a kinematically detached, rotating condensation that
formed within an HI tail apparently physically linked to the disturbed galaxy
NGC 4694. In contrast to its faint optical luminosity, VCC 2062 is
characterised by strong CO emission and a high oxygen abundance more typical of
spiral disks. Its dynamical mass however, is that of a dwarf galaxy. VCC 2062
was most likely formed within a pre-enriched gaseous structure expelled from a
larger galaxy as a result of a tidal interaction. The natural provider for the
gaseous tail is NGC 4694 or rather a former companion which subsequently has
been accreted by the massive galaxy. According to that scenario, VCC 2062 has
been formed by a past tidal encounter. Since its parent galaxies have most
probably already totally merged, it qualifies as an old TDG.

Bonnor-Ebert isothermal cloud rotating in a uniform magnetic field, we
calculate the cloud evolution from the molecular cloud core (n=10^4 cm^-3) to
the stellar core (n \simeq 10^22 cm^-3). We calculated 147 models with
different initial magnetic, rotational, and thermal energies, and the
amplitudes of the non-axisymmetric perturbation. In a collapsing cloud,
fragmentation is mainly controlled by the initial ratio of the rotational to
the magnetic energy, regardless of the initial thermal energy and amplitude of
the non-axisymmetric perturbation. When the clouds have large rotational
energies in relation to magnetic energies, fragmentation occurs in the
low-density evolution phase (10^12 cm^-3 < n < 10^15 cm^-3) with separations of
3-300 AU. Fragments that appeared in this phase are expected to evolve into
wide binary systems. On the other hand, fragmentation does not occur in the
low-density evolution phase, when initial clouds have large magnetic energies
in relation to the rotational energies. In these clouds, fragmentation only
occurs in the high-density evolution phase (n > 10^17 cm^-3) after the clouds
experience significant reduction of the magnetic field owing to Ohmic
dissipation in the period of 10^12 cm^-3 < n < 10^15 cm^-3. Fragments appearing
in this phase have separations of < 0.3 AU, and are expected to evolve into
close binary systems. As a result, we found two typical fragmentation epochs,
which cause different stellar separations. Although these typical separations
are disturbed in the subsequent gas accretion phase, we might be able to
observe two peaks of binary separations in extremely young stellar groups.

spiral structure. We follow the growth of the spiral structure deeply into the
non-linear regime by solving the Boltzmann moment equations up to second order.
By adopting the thin-disc approximation, we restrict our study of the stellar
velocity distribution to the plane of the stellar disc. We find that the outer
(convex) edges of stellar spiral arms are characterized by peculiar properties
of the stellar velocity ellipsoids, which make them distinct from most other
galactic regions. In particular, the ratio \sigma_1:\sigma_2 of the smallest
versus largest principal axes of the stellar velocity ellipsoid can become
abnormally small (as compared to the rest of the disc) near the outer edges of
spiral arms. Moreover, the epicycle approximation fails to reproduce the ratio
of the tangential versus radial velocity dispersions in these regions. These
peculiar properties of the stellar velocity distribution are caused by
large-scale non-circular motions of stars, which in turn are triggered by the
non-axisymmetric gravitational field of stellar spiral arms. The magnitude of
the vertex deviation appears to correlate globally with the amplitude of the
spiral stellar density perturbations. However, locally there is no simple
correlation between the vertex deviation and the density perturbations.

populations. As a consequence, the population can suffer an irreversible
accumulation of deleterious mutations, a phenomenon known as Muller's ratchet.
We formulate discrete and continuous time versions of Muller's ratchet.
Inspired by Haigh's (1978) analysis of a dynamical system which arises in the
limit of large populations, we identify the parameter gamma =
N*lambda/(Ns*log(N*lambda)) as most important for the speed of accumulation of
deleterious mutations. Here N is population size, s is the selection
coefficient and lambda is the deleterious mutation rate. For large parts of the
parameter range, measuring time in units of size N, deleterious mutations
accumulate according to a power law in N*lambda with exponent gamma if
gamma>0.5. For gamma<0.5 mutations cannot accumulate. We obtain diffusion
approximations for three different parameter regimes, depending on the speed of
the ratchet. Our approximations shed new light on analyses of Stephan et al.
(1993) and Gordo & Charlesworth (2000). The heuristics leading to the
approximations are supported by simulations.

is presented. These data are used to investigate the blue-red-near-infrared
colours and the colour gradients of the host galaxies of BL Lacs in comparison
with other elliptical galaxies with and without nuclear activity. In all cases
galaxies are well represented by an elliptical model, with average absolute
magnitude M_B=-21.6+-0.7 and average scale length R_e=7.6+-3.2 kpc. The
best-fit B-band Kormendy relation is in reasonable agreement with that obtained
for normal ellipticals and radio galaxies. This structural and dynamical
similarity indicates that all massive elliptical galaxies can experience
nuclear activity without significant perturbation of their global structure.
The distributions of the integrated blue/near-infrared colour (with average
B-H=3.5+-0.5) and colour gradient (with average Delta(B-R)/Delta(log
r)=-0.14+-0.75) of the BL Lac hosts are much wider than those for normal
ellipticals, and most BL Lac objects have bluer hosts and/or steeper colour
gradients than those in normal ellipticals. The blue colours are likely caused
by a young stellar population component, and indicates a link between star
formation caused by an interaction/merging event and the onset of the nuclear
activity. This result is corroborated by stellar population modelling,
indicating a presence of young/intermediate age populations in the majority of
the sample, in agreement with low redshift quasar hosts. The lack of strong
signs of interaction may require a significant time delay between the event
with associated star formation episodes and the start of the nuclear activity.

selected from the FIRST/2MASS Red Quasar Survey. These quasars have high
intrinsic luminosities after correction for dust obscuration (-23.5 > M_B >
-26.2 from K-magnitude). The images show strong evidence of recent or ongoing
interaction in eleven of the thirteen cases, even before the quasar nucleus is
subtracted. None of the host galaxies are well fit by a simple elliptical
profile. The fraction of quasars showing interaction is significantly higher
than the 30% seen in samples of host galaxies of normal, unobscured quasars.
There is a weak correlation between the amount of dust reddening and the
magnitude of interaction in the host galaxy, measured using the Gini
coefficient and the Concentration index. Although few host galaxy studies of
normal quasars are matched to ours in intrinsic quasar luminosity, no evidence
has been found for a strong dependence of merger activity on host luminosity in
samples of the host galaxies of normal quasars. We thus believe that the high
merger fraction in our sample is related to their obscured nature, with a
significant amount of reddening occurring in the host galaxy. The red quasar
phenomenon seems to have an evolutionary explanation, with the young quasar
spending the early part of its lifetime enshrouded in an interacting galaxy.
This might be further indication of a link between AGN and starburst galaxies.

slightly better results and thus appears as potentially fruitful. In a more
non-linear regime, when Tropical Instability Waves develop, the global nature
of the variational approach helps control model dynamics better than the
sequential approach of the SEEK filter. This aspect is probably enhanced by the
context of the experiments in that there is a limited amount of assimilated

to a very good description of all measured data. Values of the extracted

that the high energy particles emerge from pre-equilibrium processes consisting
in a breakup of the target into three groups of nucleons; small, fast and hot
fireball of $\sim$ 8 nucleons, and two larger, excited prefragments, which
emits the light charged particles and intermediate mass fragments. The smaller

  Dynamically Unstable High-Dimensional Biochemical Networks","34 pages, 8 figures",,,,"q-bio.MN q-bio.GN",,"  The goal of this paper is to outline a scenario of emerging stochasticity in
high-dimensional highly nonlinear systems, such as genetic regulatory networks
(GRN). We focus attention on the fact that in such systems confluence of all
the factors necessary for gene expression is a comparatively rare event, and
only massive redundancy makes such events sufficiently frequent. An immediate
consequence of this rareness is burstiness in mRNA and protein copy numbers, a
well known experimentally observed effect. We introduce the concept of
stochastic cooperativity and show that this phenomenon is a natural consequence
of high dimensionality coupled with highly nonlinearity of a dynamical system.
In mathematical terms, burstiness is associated with heavy-tailed probability
distributions of stochastic processes describing the dynamics of the system.
The sequence of stochastic cooperativity events allows for transition from
continuous deterministic dynamics expressed in terms of ordinary differential
equations (ODE) to discrete stochastic dynamics expressed in terms of Langevin
and Fokker-Plank equations. We demonstrate also that high-dimensional nonlinear
systems, even in the absence of explicit mechanisms for suppressing inherent
instability, may nevertheless reside in a state of stationary pseudo-random
fluctuations which for all practical purposes may be regarded as stochastic
process. This type of stochastic behavior is an inherent property of such
systems and requires neither an external random force, nor highly specialized
conditions of bistability.

approach to the resummation of large logarithms in the perturbative expansion
due to soft and collinear multiparton emissions. In particular, we present a
generalization of this approach to prompt photon production. It is interesting
to see that also with the more intricate two-scale kinematics that
characterizes prompt photon production in the soft limit, it remains true that
resummation simply follows from general kinematic properties of the phase
space. Also, this approach does not require a separate treatment of individual
colour structures when more than one colour structure contributes to fixed
order results. However, the resummation formulae obtained here turn out to be
less predictive than previous results: this depends on the fact that here
neither specific factorization properties of the cross section in the soft
limit is assumed, nor that soft emission satisfies eikonal-like relations. We
also derive resumation formulae to all logarithmic accuracy and valid for all
values of rapidity for the prompt photon production and the Drell-Yan rapidity
distributions. We show that for the fixed-target experiment E866/NuSea, the NLL
resummation corrections are comparable to NLO fixed-order corrections and are
crucial to obtain agreement with the data. Finally we outline also possible
future applications of the renormalization group approach.

31-epoch from October 2004 to December 2006 is carried out with non-variable
foreground stars observed simultaneously with the quasar. The quasar spectra
are further decomposed into a continuum component and several broad emission
lines to infer the variations of these spectral components. We find prominent
microlensing events in the quasar images A and B, while images C and D are
almost quiescent on a timescale of a few months. The strongest variations are
observed in the continuum of image A. Their amplitude is larger in the blue
(0.7 mag) than in the red (0.5 mag), consistent with microlensing of an
accretion disk. Variations in the intensity and profile of the broad emission
lines are also reported, most prominently in the wings of the CIII] and center
of the CIV emission lines. During a strong microlensing episode observed in
June 2006 in quasar image A, the broad component of the CIII] is more highly
magnified than the narrow component. In addition, the emission lines with
higher ionization potentials are more magnified than the lines with lower
ionization potentials, consistent with the results obtained with reverberation
mapping. Finally, we find that the V-band differential extinction by the lens,
between the quasar images, is in the range 0.1-0.3 mag.

extended to a more general transmission scheme that can achieve full
cooperative diversity for any number of relays. The conditions on the
distributed space time code (DSTC) structure that admit its application in the

recently proposed full diversity four group decodable DSTCs from precoded

population of very hot stars below the hot end of the horizontal branch (HB),
the so-called blue hook stars. This feature might be explained either as
results of the late hot flasher scenario where stars experience the helium
flash while on the white dwarf cooling curve or by the progeny of the
helium-enriched sub-population recently postulated to exist in some clusters.
Moderately high resolution spectra of stars at the hot end of the blue HB in
omega Cen were analysed for atmospheric parameters and abundances using LTE and
Non-LTE model atmospheres. In the temperature range 30,000K to 50,000K we find
that 35% of our stars are helium-poor (log(n_He/n_H) < -2), 51% have solar
helium abundance within a factor of 3 (-1.5 <= log(n_He/n_H) <= -0.5) and 14%
are helium-rich (log(n_He/n_H)> -0.4). We also find carbon enrichment in step
with helium enrichment, with a maximum carbon enrichment of 3% by mass. At
least 14% of the hottest HB stars in omega Cen show helium abundances well
above the highest predictions from the helium enrichment scenario (Y = 0.42
corresponding to log(n_He/n_H) ~ -0.74). In addition, the most helium-rich
stars show strong carbon enrichment as predicted by the late hot flasher
scenario. We conclude that the helium-rich HB stars in omega Cen cannot be
explained solely by the helium-enrichment scenario invoked to explain the blue

model describing the chain configurations [J. Palmeri, M. Manghi, and N.
Destainville, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 088103 (2007)]. This coupled model is
exactly solved using a transfer matrix technique that presents an analogy with
the path integral treatment of a quantum two-state diatomic molecule. When the
chain fluctuations are integrated out, the denaturation transition temperature
and width emerge naturally as an explicit function of the model parameters of a
well defined Hamiltonian, revealing that the transition is driven by the
difference in bending (entropy dominated) free energy between bubble and
double-stranded segments. The calculated melting curve (fraction of open base
pairs) is in good agreement with the experimental melting profile of
polydA-polydT. The predicted variation of the mean-square-radius as a function
of temperature leads to a coherent novel explanation for the experimentally
observed thermal viscosity transition. Finally, the influence of the DNA strand
length is studied in detail, underlining the importance of finite size effects,
even for DNA made of several thousand base pairs.

between these two kinds of order and compare the GFMC results with the ones
obtained by the simple variational approach. By using a generalization of the
forward-walking technique, we are able to calculate true FN ground-state
expectation values of the pair-pair correlation functions. In the case of
$t^\prime=0$, there is a large region with a coexistence of superconductivity
and antiferromagnetism, that survives up to $\delta_c \sim 0.10$ for $J/t=0.2$
and $\delta_c \sim 0.13$ for $J/t=0.4$. The presence of a finite $t^\prime/t<0$
induces a strong suppression of both magnetic (with $\delta_c \lesssim 0.03$,
for $J/t=0.2$ and $t^\prime/t=-0.2$) and pairing correlations. In particular,
the latter ones are depressed both in the low-doping regime and around $\delta

  Capacity scaling laws","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Sept. 2007",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  We address the optimization of the sum rate performance in multicell
interference-limited singlehop networks where access points are allowed to
cooperate in terms of joint resource allocation. The resource allocation
policies considered here combine power control and user scheduling. Although
very promising from a conceptual point of view, the optimization of the sum of
per-link rates hinges, in principle, on tough issues such as computational
complexity and the requirement for heavy receiver-to-transmitter channel
information feedback across all network cells. In this paper, we show that, in
fact, distributed algorithms are actually obtainable in the asymptotic regime
where the numbers of users per cell is allowed to grow large. Additionally,
using extreme value theory, we provide scaling laws for upper and lower bounds
for the network capacity (sum of single user rates over all cells),
corresponding to zero-interference and worst-case interference scenarios. We
show that the scaling is either dominated by path loss statistics or by
small-scale fading, depending on the regime and user location scenario. We show
that upper and lower rate bounds behave in fact identically, asymptotically.
This remarkable result suggests not only that distributed resource allocation
is practically possible but also that the impact of multicell interference on
the capacity (in terms of scaling) actually vanishes asymptotically.

the ZBCP is related to the macroscopic phase coherence of the superconducting

must occur below the upper critical field $B_{c2}(T)$ of the superconductor. We
find $B_{ZBCP}(0) \approx 25 $T which is at least a factor of 2.5 higher than

AdS_5 x S^5 background. These geometries correspond to certain chiral primary
operators of the N=1 superconformal quiver theories, dual to IIB theory on

doubling the number of preserved supersymmetries. We then solve the

imposing asymptotic AdS_5 x Y^{p,q} boundary conditions. We compute the global
baryonic and mesonic charges, including the R-charge. As for the computation of
the mass, i.e. the conformal dimension D of the dual field theory operators,
which is notoriously subtle in asymptotically AdS backgrounds, we adopt the
general formalism due to Wald and collaborators, which gives a finite result,
