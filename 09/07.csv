maps of the wavefunctions are affected by chaos in those regions of the phase
space where the classical dynamics produces features that are comparable to
hbar. We also investigate the possibility for quantum control in the dynamics
of excitations in these systems. Controlled excitations are mediated by pulsed
signals that cause Stimulated Raman Adiabatic passage (STIRAP) from the ground
state to a state of higher energy. The dynamics of this transition is affected
by chaos caused by the pulses in certain regions of the phase space. A
transition to chaos can thus provide a method of controlling STIRAP.

The first step is the availability of field-of-view (FOV) models. These can
then be submitted to various instrumental models, which in turn produce
simulated data, enabling the testing of processing algorithms. We aim to set
the specifications of a physical model for typical FOVs of these instruments.
  The dynamic in resolution and flux between the various sources present in
such a FOV imposes a multiscale, independent layer approach. From review of
current literature and through extrapolations from currently available data and
models, we derive the features of each source-type in the field of view likely
to pass the instrumental filter at exo-Earth level.
  Stellar limb darkening is shown to cause bias in leakage calibration if
unaccounted for. Occurrence of perturbing background stars or galaxies in the
typical FOV is unlikely. We extract galactic interstellar medium background
emissions for current target lists. Galactic background can be considered
uniform over the FOV, and it should show no significant drift with parallax.
Our model specifications have been embedded into a Java simulator, soon to be
made open-source. We have also designed an associated FITS input/output format
standard that we present here.

inclusive electron-nucleon scattering with unpolarized beam. Such dependence is
absent in the one-photon exchange approximation (Christ-Lee theorem) and arises
only in higher orders of the QED expansion, from the interference of one-photon
and absorptive two-photon exchange amplitudes as well as from real photon
emission (bremsstrahlung). We demonstrate that the transverse spin-dependent
two-photon exchange cross section is free of QED infrared and collinear
divergences. We argue that in DIS kinematics the transverse spin dependence
should be governed by a ""parton-like"" mechanism in which the two-photon
exchange couples mainly to a single quark. We calculate the normal spin
asymmetry in an approximation where the dominant contribution arises from quark
helicity flip due to interactions with non-perturbative vacuum fields
(constituent quark picture) and is proportional to the quark transversity
distribution in the nucleon. Such helicity-flip processes are not significantly
Sudakov-suppressed if the infrared scale for gluon emission in the photon-quark
subprocess is of the order of the chiral symmetry breaking scale, mu_chiral^2
>> Lambda_QCD^2. We estimate the asymmetry in the kinematics of the planned
Jefferson Lab Hall A experiment to be of the order 10^{-4}, with different sign

distributions and backwards evolution models of star formation rates can be
used to calculate the past history of intergalactic photon densities and, from
them, the present and past optical depth of the universe. This procedure can be
reversed by looking for sharp cutoffs in the spectra of extragalactic gamma-ray
sources at high redshifts in the multi-GeV energy range with GLAST. Determining
the cutoff energies of sources with known redshifts and little intrinsic
absorption can enable a more precise determination of the past intergalactic
photon density and thus allow a better determination of the past history of the
total star formation rate, including that from galaxies too faint to be
observed. Conversely, observations of sharp high energy cutoffs in the
gamma-ray spectra of blazars at unknown redshifts can be used instead of
spectral lines to give a measure of their redshifts. Also, given a knowledge
photon densities, one can derive the intrinsic gamma-ray spectra and
luminosities of blazars over a range of redshifts and look for possible trends
in blazar evolution. I present some evidence hinting that TeV blazars with
flatter spectra have higher intrinsic TeV gamma-ray luminosities and that there
may be a correlation of flatness and luminosity with redshift. (abridged)

members and 41 photometric candidates of the ~10 Myr 25 Orionis aggregate in
the OB1a subassociation, and 106 confirmed members and 65 photometric
candidates of the 5 Myr region located in the OB1b subassociation. The 25
Orionis aggregate shows a disk frequency of 6% while the field in the OB1b
subassociation shows a disk frequency of 13%. Combining IRAC, MIPS and 2MASS
photometry we place stars bearing disks in several classes: stars with
optically thick disks (class II systems), stars with an inner transitional
disks (transitional disk candidates) and stars with ""evolved disks""; the last
exhibit smaller IRAC/MIPS excesses than class II systems. In all, we identify 1
transitional disk candidate in the 25 Orionis aggregate and 3 in the OB1b
field; this represents ~10% of the disk bearing stars, indicating that the
transitional disk phase can be relatively fast. We find that the frequency of
disks is a function of the stellar mass, suggesting a maximum around stars with
spectral type M0. Comparing the infrared excess in the IRAC bands among several
stellar groups we find that inner disk emission decays with stellar age,
showing a correlation with the respective disk frequencies. The disk emission
at the IRAC and MIPS bands in several stellar groups indicates that disk
dissipation takes place faster in the inner region of the disks. Comparison
with models of irradiated accretion disks, computed with several degrees of
settling, suggests that the decrease in the overall accretion rate observed in
young stellar groups is not sufficient to explain the weak disk emission
observed in the IRAC bands for disk bearing stars with ages 5 Myr or older.

appropriate to rest a moment and to have a look at what is known so far and

account in view pages is destined to fail already for Arveson systems since
Tsirelson, Powers and Liebscher have discovered their powerful methods to
construct large classes of examples. In this survey we concentrate on that part
of the theory that works also for Hilbert modules. This does not only help to
make a selection among the possible topics, but it also helps to shed some new
light on the case of Arveson systems. Often, proofs that work for Hilbert
modules also lead to simpler proofs in the case of Hilbert spaces. We put
emphasis on those aspects that arise from recent results about commutants of
von Neumann correspondences, which, in the case of Hilbert spaces, explain the

surmount a high mountain in spite of the fact that they don't have the
necessary energy cannot be explained by classical physics. However, this so
called tunneling became allowed by quantum mechanics. Experimental tunneling
studies with different photonic barriers from microwave frequencies up to
ultraviolet frequencies pointed towards a universal tunneling time
(Haibel,Esposito). Experiments and calculations have shown that the tunneling
time of opaque photonic barriers (optical mirrors, e.g.) equals approximately
the reciprocal frequency of the corresponding electromagnetic wave. The
tunneling process is described by virtual photons. Virtual particles like
photons or electrons are not observable. However, from the theoretical point of
view, they represent necessary intermediate states between observable real
states. In the case of tunneling there is a virtual particle between the
incident and the transmitted particle. Tunneling modes have a purely imaginary
wave number. They represent solutions of the Schroedinger equation and of the
classical Helmholtz equation. Recent experimental and theoretical data of
electron and sound tunneling confirmed the conjecture that the tunneling
process is characterized by a universal tunneling time independent of the kind
of field. Tunneling proceeds at a time of the order of the reciprocal frequency
of the wave.

distance to NGC 4258 accurate to possibly ~3%. We measure accelerations using a
formal analysis method that involves simultaneous decomposition of maser
spectra for all epochs into multiple, Gaussian components. Components are
coupled between epochs by linear drifts (accelerations) from their centroid
velocities at a reference epoch. For high-velocity emission, accelerations lie
in the range -0.7 to +0.7 km/s/yr indicating an origin within 13 degrees of the
disk midline (the perpendicular to the line-of-sight to the black hole).
Comparison of high-velocity emission projected positions in VLBI images, with
those derived from acceleration data, provides evidence that masers trace real
gas dynamics. High-velocity emission accelerations do not support a model of
trailing shocks associated with spiral arms in the disk. However, we find
strengthened evidence for spatial periodicity in high-velocity emission, of
wavelength 0.75 mas. This supports suggestions of spiral structure due to
density waves in the nuclear accretion disk of an active galaxy. Accelerations
of low-velocity (systemic) emission lie in the range 7.7 to 8.9 km/s/yr,
consistent with emission originating from a concavity where the thin, warped
disk is tangent to the line-of-sight. A trend in accelerations of low-velocity
emission as a function of Doppler velocity may be associated with disk geometry
and orientation, or with the presence of spiral structure.

probably a universal one - of a percolation-type (1-bond->2-mode). The change
of paradigm from the `VCA insight' (an averaged microscopic one) to the
`percolation insight' (a mesoscopic one) offers a promising link towards the
understanding of alloy disorder. The discussion is supported by ab initio
simulation of the phonon density of states at the zone-center of representative
supercells at intermediary composition (ZnTeSe) and at the impurity-dilute
limits (all systems). In particular, we propose a simple ab initio `protocol'

properties and half-metallic nature of finite rectangular graphene nanoribbons
is presented. We identify the bisanthrene isomer of the C28H14 molecule to be
the smallest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon to present a spin polarized ground
state. Even at this quantum dot level, the spins are predicted to be aligned
antiferromagnetically at the two zigzag edges of the molecule. As a rule of
thumb, we find that zigzag edges that are at least three consecutive units
long, will present spin polarization if the width of the system is 1 nm or
wider. Room temperature detectability of the magnetic ordering is predicted for
molecules with zigzag edges 1 nm and longer. For the longer systems studied,
spin wave structures appear in some high spin multiplicity states. Energy gap
oscillations with the length of the zigzag edge are observed. The amplitude of
these oscillations is found to be smaller than that predicted for infinite
ribbons. The half-metallic nature of the ribbons under an external in-plane
electric field is found to be preserved even for finite and extremely short
systems.

of the rest-frame optical and near-infrared light of galaxies and AGN to much
higher redshift than is possible from the ground. This white paper explores the
merits of different survey strategies for studying the distant universe during
the warm mission. A three-tiered approach serves a wide range of science goals
and uses the spacecraft effectively: 1) an ultra-deep survey of ~0.04 square
degrees to a depth of ~250 hrs (in conjunction with an HST/WFC3 program), to
study the Universe at 7<z<14; 2) a survey of ~2 square degrees to the GOODS
depth of 20 hrs, to identify luminous galaxies at z>6 and characterize the
relation between the build-up of dark matter halos and their constituent
galaxies at 2<z<6, and 3) a 500 square degree survey to the SWIRE depth of 120
s, to systematically study large scale structure at 1<z<2 and characterize high
redshift AGN. One or more of these programs could conceivably be implemented by
the SSC, following the example of the Hubble Deep Field campaigns. As
priorities in this field continuously shift it is also crucial that a fraction
of the exposure time remains unassigned, thus enabling science that will
reflect the frontiers of 2010 and beyond rather than those of 2007.

supersymmetric gauge field theories. They can arise, for example, from D-terms
associated with an extra abelian gauge symmetry. Even when supersymmetry is
broken softly, there often remain directions in the scalar field space along
which the potential is almost flat. Upon breaking a gauge symmetry along one of
these almost flat directions, cosmic strings may form. Relative to the standard
cosmic string picture based on the abelian Higgs model, these flat-direction
cosmic strings have the extreme Type-I properties of a thin gauge core
surrounded by a much wider scalar field profile. We perform a comprehensive
study of the microscopic, macroscopic, and observational characteristics of
this class of strings. We find many differences from the standard string
scenario, including stable higher winding mode strings, the dynamical formation
of higher mode strings from lower ones, and a resultant multi-tension scaling
string network in the early universe. These strings are only moderately
constrained by current observations, and their gravitational wave signatures
may be detectable at future gravity wave detectors. Furthermore, there is the
interesting but speculative prospect that the decays of cosmic string loops in
the early universe could be a source of ultra-high energy cosmic rays or
non-thermal dark matter. We also compare the observational signatures of
flat-direction cosmic strings with those of ordinary cosmic strings as well as
(p,q) cosmic strings motivated by superstring theory.

is the role of outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN). Using
large-scale cosmological simulations, we compute the impact of such outflows on

gravitationally-heated structures, AGN outflows induce CMB distortions both
through thermal motions and peculiar velocities, by processes known as the
thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects, respectively. For AGN
outflows the thermal SZ effect is dominant, doubling the angular power spectrum
on arcminute scales. But the most distinct imprint of AGN feedback is a
substantial increase in the thermal SZ distortions around elliptical galaxies,
post-starburst ellipticals, and quasars, which is linearly proportional to the
outflow energy. While point source subtraction is difficult for quasars, we
show that by appropriately stacking microwave measurements around early-type
galaxies, the new generation of small-scale microwave telescopes will be able

relevant parameter for its hydrodynamical evolution, for the mechanism of

X-ray observations, we present a study of the ambient medium density of the
historical supernova remnant SN 1006. We modelled the post-shock thermal
emission to constrain the ambient medium density. Our study is focused on the
North-West and the South-East rims of the remnant, where the thermal emission
dominates. We used a plane-parallel shock plasma model plus another component
for the ejecta that are not negligible in the regions of our study. The
importance of the synchrotron component is also studied. In order to improve
statistics, we combined several observations of the remnant.
  The density found in the South-East rim is low, roughly 0.05 cm-3, and seems
to be representative of the rest of the remnant. However, in the North-West rim
(close to the bright optical filament), the density is significantly higher
(about 0.15-0.25 cm-3). This confirms a picture of SN 1006 evolving in a
tenuous ambient medium, except in the North-West where the remnant has recently
encountered a denser region.
  A density this low is compatible with the non-detection of the remnant by the
HESS gamma-ray observatory. The lower density in the South-East implies a
higher shock speed of 4900 km/s, higher than that of 2890 km/s measured in the
North-West. This new estimate of the velocity could increase the maximum energy

it transmits and thus change the topology of the network to save energy by
choosing the neighbors with which it directly communicates. Many previous
algorithms for distributed topology control have assumed an ability at each
node to deduce some location-based information such as the direction and the
distance of its neighbor nodes with respect to itself. Such a deduction of
location-based information, however, cannot be relied upon in real environments
where the path loss exponents vary greatly leading to significant errors in
distance estimates. Also, multipath effects may result in different signal
paths with different loss characteristics, and none of these paths may be
line-of-sight, making it difficult to estimate the direction of a neighboring
node. In this paper, we present Step Topology Control (STC), a simple
distributed topology control algorithm which reduces energy consumption while
preserving the connectivity of a heterogeneous sensor network without use of
any location-based information. We show that the STC algorithm achieves the
same or better order of communication and computational complexity when
compared to other known algorithms that also preserve connectivity without the
use of location-based information. We also present a detailed simulation-based
comparative analysis of the energy savings and interference reduction achieved
by the algorithms. The results show that, in spite of not incurring a higher
communication or computational complexity, the STC algorithm performs better
than other algorithms in uniform wireless environments and especially better
when path loss characteristics are non-uniform.

is debatable whether this mechanism can function in the inner regions (R<40 AU)

and the equation of state, which accounts for radiative transfer effects in SPH
simulations of circumstellar discs. The different chemical and internal states

cannot cool fast enough and in the latter because it is not gravitationally

different treatments for the hydrodynamics and the radiative transfer, and (b)
confirm our own earlier analytic predictions. We conclude that disc

automata. The essential difficulty of fault-tolerant computation is present in
the special case of simply remembering a bit in the presence of faults, and
that is the case we treat in this paper. We are concerned with the degree (the
number of neighboring cells on which the state transition function depends)
needed to achieve fault tolerance when the fault rate is high (nearly 1/2). We
consider both the traditional transient fault model (where faults occur
independently in time and space) and a recently introduced combined fault model
which also includes manufacturing faults (which occur independently in space,
but which affect cells for all time). We also consider both a purely
probabilistic fault model (in which the states of cells are perturbed at
exactly the fault rate) and an adversarial model (in which the occurrence of a
fault gives control of the state to an omniscient adversary). We show that
there are cellular automata that can tolerate a fault rate $1/2 - \xi$ (with
$\xi>0$) with degree $O((1/\xi^2)\log(1/\xi))$, even with adversarial combined
faults. The simplest such automata are based on infinite regular trees, but our
results also apply to other structures (such as hyperbolic tessellations) that
contain infinite regular trees. We also obtain a lower bound of
$\Omega(1/\xi^2)$, even with purely probabilistic transient faults only.

distinctive prediction of models with cosmic strings. These signatures are
visible in anisotropy maps with good angular resolution and should be
identifiable using edge detection algorithms. One such algorithm is the Canny
algorithm. We study the potential of this algorithm to pick out the line
discontinuities generated by cosmic strings. By applying the algorithm to
small-scale microwave anisotropy maps generated from theoretical models with
and without cosmic strings, we find that, given an angular resolution of
several minutes of arc, cosmic strings can be detected down to a limit of the
mass per unit length of the string which is one order of magnitude lower than
the current upper bounds.

to study the radial dependence of the luminosity function (LF). The dynamical
radius of each cluster, r200, was estimated from the photometric measurement of
cluster richness, Bgc. The shape of the LFs are found to correlate with radius
such that the faint-end slope, alpha, is generally steeper on the cluster
outskirts. The sum of two Schechter functions provides a more adequate fit to
the composite LFs than a single Schechter function. LFs based on the selection
of red and blue galaxies are bimodal in appearance. The red LFs are generally
flat for -22 < M_Rc < -18, with a radius-dependent steepening of alpha for M_Rc
> -18. The blue LFs contain a larger contribution from faint galaxies than the
red LFs. The blue LFs have a rising faint-end component (alpha ~ -1.7) for M_Rc
> -21, with a weaker dependence on radius than the red LFs. The dispersion of
M* was determined to be 0.31 mag, which is comparable to the median measurement
uncertainty of 0.38 mag. This suggests that the bright-end of the LF is
universal in shape at the 0.3 mag level. We find that M* is not correlated with
cluster richness when using a common dynamical radius. Also, we find that M* is
weakly correlated with BM-type such that later BM-type clusters have a brighter
M*. A correlation between M* and radius was found for the red and blue galaxies
such that M* fades towards the cluster center.

We passes through unity. We also identify two distinct collision regimes: in
one regime the collision is largely elastic and deformation of the cluster is
relatively small but in the second regime the deformation is large and the
adhesion energy starts to depend on the kinetic energy. If the transition
between these two regimes occurs at a similar kinetic energy to that of the
transition between reflection and adhesion, then we find that the probability
of adhesion for a cluster can be bimodal. In addition we investigate the
effects of the angle of incidence on adhesion and reflection. Finally we
compare our findings both with recent experimental results and with macroscopic

a shallow bound state even in finite volume through determination of whether
the second lowest energy state appears just above the threshold. We also
consider the bound-state pole condition in finite volume, based on Luscher's
phase-shift formula and then find that the condition is fulfilled only in the
infinite volume limit, but its modification by finite size corrections is
exponentially suppressed by the spatial lattice size L. These theoretical
considerations are also numerically checked through lattice simulations to

the projected tidal gravitational field of the deflecting mass distribution. To
lowest order, the shear is proportional to the mean image ellipticity. If the
image sizes are not small compared to the scale over which the shear varies,
higher-order distortions occur, called flexion. For ordinary weak lensing, the
observable quantity is not the shear, but the reduced shear, owing to the
mass-sheet degeneracy. Likewise, the flexion itself is unobservable. Rather,
higher-order image distortions measure the reduced flexion, i.e., derivatives
of the reduced shear. We derive the corresponding lens equation in terms of the
reduced flexion and calculate the resulting relation between brightness moments
of source and image. Assuming an isotropic distribution of source orientations,
estimates for the reduced shear and flexion are obtained; these are then tested
with simulations. In particular, the presence of flexion affects the
determination of the reduced shear. The results of these simulations yield the
amount of bias of the estimators, as a function of the shear and flexion. We
point out and quantify a fundamental limitation of the flexion formalism, in
terms of the product of reduced flexion and source size. If this product
increases above the derived threshold, multiple images of the source are formed
locally, and the formalism breaks down. Finally, we show how a general
(reduced) flexion field can be decomposed into its four components: two of them
are due to a shear field, carrying an E- and B-mode in general. The other two
components do not correspond to a shear field; they can also be split up into
corresponding E- and B-modes.

(LTB) inhomogeneous dust solutions as a 3--dimensional dynamical system
characterized by six critical points. One of the coordinates of the phase space
is an average density parameter, $<\Omega>$, which behaves as the ordinary
$\Omega$ in Friedman-Lema\^\i tre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) dust spacetimes.
The other two coordinates, a shear parameter and a density contrast function,
convey the effects of inhomogeneity. As long as shell crossing singularities
are absent, this phase space is bounded or it can be trivially compactified.
This space contains several invariant subspaces which define relevant
particular cases, such as: ``parabolic'' evolution, FLRW dust and the
Schwarzschild--Kruskal vacuum limit. We examine in detail the phase space
evolution of several dust configurations: a low density void formation
scenario, high density re--collapsing universes with open, closed and wormhole
topologies, a structure formation scenario with a black hole surrounded by an
expanding background, and the Schwarzschild--Kruskal vacuum case. Solution
curves start expanding from a past attractor (source) in the plane
$<\Omega>=1$, associated with self similar regime at an initial singularity.
Depending on the initial conditions and specific configurations, the curves
approach several saddle points as they evolve between this past attractor and
other two possible future attractors: perpetually expanding curves terminate at
a line of sinks at $<\Omega>=0$, while collapsing curves reach maximal
expansion as $<\Omega>$ diverges and end up in sink that coincides with the
past attractor and is also associated with self similar behavior.

CMB signal and instrumental noise, a single power law foreground component with
free amplitude and spectral index for each pixel, a thermal dust template with
a single free overall amplitude, and free monopoles and dipoles at each
frequency. This simple model yields a surprisingly good fit to the data over
the full frequency range from 23 to 94 GHz. We obtain a new estimate of the CMB
sky signal and power spectrum, and a new foreground model, including a
measurement of the effective spectral index over the high-latitude sky. A
particularly significant result is the detection of a common spurious offset in
all frequency bands of ~ -13muK, as well as a dipole in the V-band data.
Correcting for these is essential when determining the effective spectral index
of the foregrounds. We find that our new foreground model is in good agreement

reconstruction. We believe the latter may be at least partially compromised by
the residual offsets and dipoles in the data. Fortunately, the CMB power
spectrum is not significantly affected by these issues, as our new spectrum is
in excellent agreement with that published by the WMAP team. The corresponding

astrophysics as the properties of neutron stars and the evolution of
astrophysical systems as proto-neutron stars, core-collapse supernovae and
neutron star mergers. Most recent pulsar mass measurements and constraints on
neutron star radii are critically discussed. Astrophysical signals for exotic
matter and phase transitions in high-density matter proposed recently in the
literature are outlined. A strong first order phase transition leads to the
emergence of a third family of compact stars besides white dwarfs and neutron
stars. The different microphysics of quark matter results in an enhanced r-mode
stability window for rotating compact stars compared to normal neutron stars.
Future telescope and satellite data will allow to extract signals from phase
transitions in dense matter in the heavens and will reveal properties of the
phases of dense QCD. Spectral line profiles out of x-ray bursts will determine
the mass-radius ratio of compact stars. Gravitational wave patterns from
collapsing neutron stars or neutron star mergers will even be able to constrain
the stiffness of the quark matter equation of state. Future astrophysical data
can therefore provide a crucial cross-check to the exploration of the QCD phase

meridional flow speed. We further examine the persistence of memory of past
cycles in the advection and diffusion dominated regimes through stochastically
forced dynamo simulations. We find that in the advection-dominated regime, this
memory persists for up to three cycles, whereas in the diffusion-dominated
regime, this memory persists for mainly one cycle. This indicates that solar
cycle predictions based on these two different regimes would have to rely on
fundamentally different inputs - which may be the cause of conflicting
predictions. Our simulations also show that the observed solar cycle
amplitude-period relationship arises more naturally in the diffusion dominated
regime, thereby supporting those dynamo models in which diffusive flux
transport plays a dominant role in the solar convection zone.

Maxwell molecules under uniform shear flow are exactly determined from the
Boltzmann kinetic equation. A normal solution is obtained via a
Chapman--Enskog-like expansion around a local shear flow distribution that
retains all the hydrodynamics orders in the shear rate. In the first order of
the expansion the mass flux is proportional to the gradients of mole fraction,
pressure, and temperature but, due to the anisotropy induced in the system by
the shear flow, mutual diffusion, pressure diffusion and thermal diffusion
tensors are identified instead of the conventional scalar coefficients. These
tensors are obtained in terms of the shear rate and the parameters of the
mixture (particle masses, concentrations, and force constants). The description
is made both in the absence and in the presence of an external thermostat
introduced in computer simulations to compensate for the viscous heating. As
expected, the analysis shows that there is not a simple relationship between
the results with and without the thermostat. The dependence of the three
diffusion tensors on the shear rate is illustrated in the tracer limit case,
the results showing that the deviation of the generalized transport
coefficients from their equilibrium forms is in general quite important.
Finally, the generalized transport coefficients associated with the momentum
and heat transport are evaluated from a model kinetic equation of the Boltzmann
equation.

presence of low concentrations of a monovalent salt (NaCl) and of the
surfactant sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) in the aqueous subphase, have been
studied using laser tweezers. In the absence of electrolyte and surfactant,
particle interactions exhibit a long-range repulsion, yet the variation of the
interaction for different particle pairs is found to be considerable. Averaging
over several particle pairs was hence found to be necessary to obtain reliable
assessment of the effects of salt and surfactant. It has previously been
suggested that the repulsion is consistent with electrostatic interactions
between a small number of dissociated charges in the oil phase, leading to a
decay with distance to the power -4 and an absence of any effect of electrolyte
concentration. However, the present work demonstrates that increasing the
electrolyte concentration does yield, on average, a reduction of the magnitude
of the interaction force with electrolyte concentration. This implies that
charges on the water side also contribute significantly to the electrostatic
interactions. An increase in the concentration of SDS leads to a similar
decrease of the interaction force. Moreover the repulsion at fixed SDS
concentrations decreases over longer times. Finally, measurements of three-body
interactions provide insight into the anisotropic nature of the interactions.
The unique time-dependent and anisotropic interactions between particles at the
oil-water interface allow tailoring of the aggregation kinetics and structure
of the suspension structure.

notion of angular momentum in a radiating space-time; the difficulties and
ambiguities previously encountered are attached to attempts to express this in
special-relativistic terms, and in particular to attempts to identify a single
Minkowski space of origins. Unlike the special-relativistic case, the angular
momentum cannot be represented by a purely j=1 quantity M_{ab}, but has
higher-j contributions as well. Applying standard kinematic prescriptions,
these higher-j contributions are shown to correspond precisely to the shear.
Thus it appears that shear and angular momentum should be regarded as different

off-equilibrium aging dynamics crucially depends on the connection between
spontaneous and induced fluctuations. The hypothesis that linear response
fluctuations are statistically subordinated to irreversible outbursts of
energy, so-called quakes, leads to predictions for averages and fluctuations
spectra of physical observables in reasonable agreement with experimental
results [see e.g. Sibani et al., Phys. Rev. B74:224407, 2006]. Using
simulational data from a simple but representative Ising model with plaquette
interactions, direct statistical evidence supporting the hypothesis is
presented and discussed in this work.
  A strict temporal correlation between quakes and intermittent magnetization
fluctuations is demonstrated. The external magnetic field is shown to bias the
pre-existent intermittent tails of the magnetic fluctuation distribution, with
little or no effect on the Gaussian part of the latter. Its impact on energy
fluctuations is shown to be negligible.
  Linear response is thus controlled by the quakes and inherits their temporal
statistics. These findings provide a theoretical basis for analyzing
intermittent linear response data from aging system in the same way as thermal
energy fluctuations, which are far more difficult to measure.

were exposed to test beams in order to assess their performance, ascertain the
production quality and reproducibility, and to scrutinize the complete energy
reconstruction chain from the readout and calibration electronics to the signal
and energy reconstruction. It was also possible to check the full Monte Carlo
simulation of the calorimeter. The analysis of the uniformity, resolution and
extraction of constant term is presented. Typical non-uniformities of 0.5% and
typical global constant terms of 0.6% are measured for the barrel and end-cap
modules.

NICMOS instrument of the Hubble Space Telescope during 9 visits in April-June
2003. During epochs of high X-ray/radio activity near the beginning and end of
this period, we find that the $1.87 $\um infrared flux is generally low ($\sim
2$ mJy) and relatively steady. However, during the X-ray/radio ``plateau''
state between these epochs, we find that the infrared flux is significantly
higher ($\sim 4-6$ mJy), and strongly variable. In particular, we find events
with amplitudes $\sim 20-30$% occurring on timescales of $\sim 10-20$s
(e-folding timescales of $\sim 30$s). These flickering timescales are several
times faster than any previously-observed infrared variability in GRS 1915+105
and the IR variations exceed corresponding X-ray variations at the same ($\sim
8s$) timescale. These results suggest an entirely new type of infrared
variability from this object. Based on the properties of this flickering, we
conclude that it arises in the plateau-state jet outflow itself, at a distance
$<2.5$ AU from the accretion disk. We discuss the implications of this work and
the potential of further flickering observations for understanding jet
formation around black holes.

infinite well after the latter is suddenly expanded. It turns out that the
probability density $|\Psi(x, t)|^{2}$ shows up quite a surprising behaviour:
for definite times, {\it plateaux} appear for which $|\Psi(x, t)|^{2}$ is
constant on finite intervals for $x$. Elements of theoretical explanation are
given by analyzing the singular component of the second derivative
$\partial_{xx}\Psi(x, t)$. Analytical closed expressions are obtained for some
specific times, which easily allow to show that, at these times, the density
organizes itself into regular patterns provided the size of the box in large
enough; more, above some critical time-dependent size, the density patterns are
independent of the expansion parameter. It is seen how the density at these
times simply results from a construction game with definite rules acting on the
pieces of the initial density.

supernova feedback, gas accretion and enriched outflows, reproducing the
history of cosmic star formation, metallicity, supernovae type II rates and the
fraction of baryons allocated to structures. We present a new statistical
treatment of the available observational data on the star formation rate and
metallicity that accounts for the presence of possible systematics. We then
employ a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to compare the predictions of
our model with observations and derive constraints on the 7 free parameters of
the model. We find that the dust correction scheme one chooses to adopt for the
star formation data is critical in determining which scenario is favoured
between a hierarchical star formation model, where star formation is prolonged
by accretion, infall and merging, and a monolithic scenario, where star
formation is rapid and efficient. We distinguish between these modes by
defining a characteristic minimum mass, M > 10^{11} M_solar, in our fiducial
model, for early type galaxies where star formation occurs efficiently. Our
results indicate that the hierarchical star formation model can achieve better
agreement with the data, but that this requires a high efficiency of
supernova-driven outflows. In a monolithic model, our analysis points to the
need for a mechanism that drives metal-poor winds, perhaps in the form of
supermassive black hole-induced outflows. Furthermore, the relative absence of
star formation beyond z ~ 5 in the monolithic scenario requires an alternative
mechanism to dwarf galaxies for reionizing the universe at z ~ 11, as required
by observations of the microwave background. While the monolithic scenario is
less favoured in terms of its quality-of-fit, it cannot yet be excluded.
