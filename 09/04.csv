by a jargon barrier, where an intimidating profusion of orientifolds, Kahler

astrophysical observables of specific string theory solutions from the recent
literature. We attempt to help bridge this gap by giving a pedagogical
exposition with detailed examples, aimed at astrophysicists and high energy
theorists alike, of how to compute predictions for familiar cosmological
parameters when starting with a 10-dimensional string theory action. This is
done by investigating inflation in string theory, since inflation is the
dominant paradigm for how early universe physics determines cosmological
parameters.
  We analyze three explicit string models from the recent literature, each
containing an infinite number of ""vacuum"" solutions. Our numerical
investigation of some natural candidate inflatons, the so-called ""moduli
fields"", fails to find inflation. We also find in the simplest models that,
after suitable field redefinitions, vast numbers of these vacua differ only in
an overall constant multiplying the effective inflaton potential, a difference
which affects neither the potential's shape nor its ability to support
slow-roll inflation. This illustrates that even having an infinite number of
vacua does not guarantee having inflating ones. This may be an artifact of the
simplicity of the models that we study. Instead, more complicated string theory
models appear to be required, suggesting that explicitly identifying the
inflating subset of the string landscape will be challenging.

the extent and morphology of the nuclear dust distribution in the Circinus
galaxy using high resolution interferometric observations in the mid-infrared

that the dust distribution in the nucleus of Circinus can be explained by two
components, a dense and warm disk-like component of 0.4 pc size and a slightly
cooler, geometrically thick torus component with a size of 2.0 pc. The disk
component is oriented perpendicular to the ionisation cone and outflow and
seems to show the silicate feature at 10 micron in emission. It coincides with
a nuclear maser disk in orientation and size. From the energy needed to heat
the dust, we infer a luminosity of the accretion disk corresponding to 20% of
the Eddington luminosity of the nuclear black hole. We find that the
interferometric data are inconsistent with a simple, smooth and axisymmetric
dust emission. The irregular behaviour of the visibilities and the shallow
decrease of the dust temperature with radius provide strong evidence for a
clumpy or filamentary dust structure. We see no evidence for dust reprocessing,
as the silicate absorption profile is consistent with that of standard galactic
dust. We argue that the collimation of the ionising radiation must originate in
the geometrically thick torus component. Our findings confirm the presence of a
geometrically thick, torus-like dust distribution in the nucleus of Circinus,
as required in unified schemes of Seyfert galaxies. Several aspects of our data
require that this torus is irregular, or ""clumpy"".

the narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark~564. When combined with earlier RXTE and
ASCA observations, these data produce a power spectrum covering seven decades
of frequency which is well described by a power law with two very clear breaks.
This shape is unlike the power spectra of almost all other AGN observed so far,
which have only one detected break, and resemble Galactic binary systems in a
soft state. The power spectrum can also be well described by the sum of two
Lorentzian-shaped components, the one at higher frequencies having a hard
spectrum, similar to those seen in Galactic binary systems. Previously we have
demonstrated that the lag of the hard band variations relative to the soft band
in Ark 564 is dependent on variability time-scale, as seen in Galactic binary
sources. Here we show that the time-scale dependence of the lags can be
described well using the same two-Lorentzian model which describes the power
spectrum, assuming that each Lorentzian component has a distinct time lag. Thus
all X-ray timing evidence points strongly to two discrete, localised, regions
as the origin of most of the variability. Similar behaviour is seen in Galactic
X-ray binary systems in most states other than the soft state, i.e. in the
low-hard and intermediate/very high states. Given the very high accretion rate
of Ark 564 the closest analogy is with the very high (intermediate) state
rather than the low-hard state. We therefore strengthen the comparison between
AGN and Galactic binary sources beyond previous studies by extending it to the
previously poorly studied very high accretion rate regime.

within effective-mass theory using a scaled hydrogenic wave-function. However
such a wave-function is only applicable to shallow impurities; here we present
a simple but robust generalization to treat deep donors, in which we treat the
long-range part of the wavefunction using the well established quantum defect
theory, and include a model central-cell correction to fix the bound-state
eigenvalue at the experimentally observed value. This allows us to compute the
effect of binding energy on exchange interactions as a function of donor
distance; this is a significant quantity given recent proposals to carry out
quantum information processing using deep donors. As expected, exchange
interactions are suppressed (or increased), compared to the hydrogenic case, by
the greater localization (or delocalization) of the wavefunctions of deep
donors (or `super-shallow' donors with binding energy less then the hydrogenic
value). The calculated results are compared with a simple scaling of the
Heitler-London hydrogenic exchange; the scaled hydrogenic results give the
correct order of magnitude but fail to reproduce quantitatively our
calculations. We calculate the donor exchange in silicon including inter-valley
interference terms for donor pairs along the $\{100\}$ direction, and also show
the influence of the donor type on the distribution of nearest-neighbour
exchange constants at different concentrations. Our methods can be used to
compute the exchange interactions between two donor electrons with arbitrary

forced systems has attracted considerable interest over the last two decades,
in particular since it provides a rich class of examples for the possibility of
complicated dynamics in the absence of chaos. Their existence was discovered in
the early 1980's, independently by Herman for quasiperiodic SL(2,R)-cocycles
and by Grebogi et al for so-called 'pinched skew products'. However, except for
these two particular classes there are still hardly any rigorous results on the
topic, despite a large number of numerical studies which all confirmed the
widespread existence of SNA in quasiperiodically forced systems.
  Here, we prove the existence of SNA in quasiperiodically forced circle maps
under rather general conditions, which can be stated in terms of C 1
-estimates. As a consequence, we obtain the existence of strange non-chaotic
attractors for parameter sets of positive measure in suitable parameter
families. Further, we show that the considered systems have minimal dynamics.
The results apply in particular to a forced version of the Arnold circle map.
For this particular example, we also describe how the first Arnold tongue
collapses and looses its regularity due to the presence of strange non-chaotic
attractors and a related unbounded mean motion property.

second friction parameter for tuning the transport properties of the system.

viscosity, on the strength of the new friction parameter. We envisage that the

of the period differences of 0.88 s. The model has an effective temperature of
81500 K, a stellar mass of 0.556 Msun, a surface gravity log g= 7.65, a stellar
luminosity and radius of log(L/Lsun)= 1.14 and log(R/Rsun)= -1.73,

of the period-fit analysis carried out in this work suggest that the

is how to puzzle together a collection $\mathcal P$ of partial trees
(leaf-labelled trees whose leaves are bijectively labelled by species or, more
generally, taxa, each supported by e. g. a gene) into an overall parental
structure that displays all trees in $\mathcal P$. This already difficult
problem is complicated by the fact that the trees in $\mathcal P$ regularly
support conflicting phylogenetic relationships and are not on the same but only
overlapping taxa sets. A desirable requirement on the sought after parental
structure therefore is that it can accommodate the observed conflicts.
Phylogenetic networks are a popular tool capable of doing precisely this.
However, not much is known about how to construct such networks from partial
trees, a notable exception being the $Z$-closure super-network approach and the
recently introduced $Q$-imputation approach. Here, we propose the usage of
closure rules to obtain such a network. In particular, we introduce the novel
$Y$-closure rule and show that this rule on its own or in combination with one
of Meacham's closure rules (which we call the $M$-rule) has some very desirable
theoretical properties. In addition, we use the $M$- and $Y$-rule to explore
the dependency of Rivera et al.'s ``ring of life'' on the fact that the
underpinning phylogenetic trees are all on the same data set. Our analysis
culminates in the presentation of a collection of induced subtrees from which
this ring can be reconstructed.

follow the empirical Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) law for surface densities above a
constant threshold. While the observed law involves surface densities,
theoretical models and simulations generally work with volume density laws
(i.e. Schmidt laws). We derive analytic relations between star formation laws
expressed in terms of surface densities, volume densities, and pressures and we
show how these relations depend on parameters such as the effective equation of
state of the multiphase interstellar medium. Our analytic relations enable us
to implement observed surface density laws into simulations. Because the
parameters of our prescription for star formation are observables, we are not
free to tune them to match the observations. We test our theoretical framework
using high-resolution simulations of isolated disc galaxies that assume an
effective equation of state for the multiphase interstellar medium. We are able
to reproduce the star formation threshold and both the slope and the
normalisation of arbitrary input KS laws without tuning any parameters and with
very little scatter, even for unstable galaxies and even if we use poor
numerical resolution. Moreover, we can do so for arbitrary effective equations
of state. Our prescription therefore enables simulations of galaxies to bypass
our current inability to simulate the formation of stars. On the other hand,
the fact that we can reproduce arbitrary input thresholds and KS laws, rather
than just the particular ones picked out by nature, indicates that simulations
that lack the physics and/or resolution to simulate the multiphase interstellar
medium can only provide limited insight into the origin of the observed star
formation laws.

shortcomings: it requires gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking, which
generically violates flavor constraints, and its thermal relic density \Omega
is typically too large. We propose a simple solution to both problems:
neutralinos freezeout with \Omega ~10-100, but then decay to ~1 GeV gravitinos,
which are simultaneously light enough to satisfy flavor constraints and heavy
enough to be all of dark matter. This scenario is naturally realized in
high-scale gauge-mediation models, ameliorates small scale structure problems,

(z >~ 7) sources through their Lyman-alpha (Ly-alpha) emission, using the
narrow-band imaging method. However, to date the surveys have only yielded
non-detections and upper limits as no survey has reached the necessary
combination of depth and area to detect these very young star forming galaxies.
  Aims: We aim to calculate model luminosity functions and mock surveys of
Ly-alpha emitters at z >~ 7 based on a variety of approaches.
  Methods: We calculate model luminosity functions at different redshifts based
on three different approaches: a semi-analytical model based on CDM, a simple
phenomenological model, and an extrapolation of observed Schechter functions at
lower redshifts. The results of the first two models are compared with
observations made at redshifts z ~ 5.7 and z ~ 6.5, and they are then
extrapolated to higher redshift.
  Results: We present model luminosity functions for redshifts between z = 7 -
12.5 and give specific number predictions for future planned or possible
narrow-band surveys for Ly-alpha emitters. We also investigate what constraints
future observations will be able to place on the Ly-alpha luminosity function
at very high redshift.
  Conclusion: It should be possible to observe z = 7 - 10 Ly-alpha emitters
with present or near-future instruments if enough observing time is allocated.
In particular, large area surveys such as ELVIS (Emission Line galaxies with
VISTA Survey) will be useful in collecting a large sample. However, to get a
large enough sample to constrain well the z >= 10 Ly-alpha luminosity function,
instruments further in the future, such as an ELT, will be necessary.

and velocity dispersion. We construct two parameters (eta and zeta) as linear

episodes of star formation, and eta to be strongly dependent on the average age
of the stellar populations. The distribution of the eta component of the
composites appear to be indistinguishable between high and low density regions,
whereas the distribution of zeta parameters have a significant skew towards
lower values for galaxies in low density regions. This result suggests that
galaxies in lower density environments are less likely to present weak episodes
of recent star formation. In contrast, a significant number of galaxies from
our high density subsample -- which includes clusters (both outer regions and

high metallicity, in agreement with recent estimates targeting elliptical
galaxies in Hickson Compact Groups and in the field (Ferreras et al.).

processes controlling the amplitude of the wind of Rayleigh-Benard convection.
We analyze results from direct simulation of an L/H = 4 aspect-ratio domain
with periodic sidewalls at Ra = 1e5; 1e6; 1e7; 1e8 and at Pr = 1 by decomposing
independent realizations into wind and fluctuations. It is shown that deep
inside the thermal boundary layer, horizontal heat-fuxes exceed the average
vertical heat-fux by a factor 3 due to the interaction between the wind and the
mean temperature field. These large horizontal heat-fluxes are responsible for
spatial temperature differences that drive the wind by creating pressure
gradients. The wall fluxes and turbulent mixing in the bulk provide damping.
Using the DNS results to parameterise the unclosed terms, a simple model
capturing the essential processes governing the wind structure is derived. The
model consists of two coupled differential equations for wind velocity and
temperature amplitude. The equations indicate that the formation of a wind
structure is inevitable due to the positive feedback resulting from the
interaction between the wind and temperature field. Furthermore, the wind
velocity is largely determined by the turbulence in the bulk rather than by the
wall-shear stress. The model reproduces the Ra dependence of wind Reynolds
number and temperature amplitude.

scale galaxy and weak lensing surveys to this problem is that, while the mildly
nonlinear regime is important, there is a lack of numerical simulations of
nonlinear growth in modified gravity theories. A major question exists as to
whether existing analytical fits, created using simulations of standard
gravity, can be confidently applied. In this paper we address this, presenting
results of N-body simulations of a variety of models where gravity is altered
including the Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati model. We consider modifications
that alter the Poisson equation and also consider the presence of anisotropic
shear stress that alters how particles respond to the gravitational potential
gradient. We establish how well analytical fits of the matter power spectrum by
Peacock and Dodds and Smith et al. are able to predict the nonlinear growth
found in the simulations from z=50 up to today, and also consider implications
for the weak lensing convergence power spectrum. We find that the analytical
fits provide good agreement with the simulations, being within 1\sigma of the
simulation results for cases with and without anisotropic stress and for
scale-dependent and independent modifications of the Poisson equation. No
strong preference for either analytical fit is found.

Finite-Time Thermodynamics exhibit loop-shaped curves of power output versus
efficiency, such as it occurs with actual dissipative thermal engines. Within
the context of First-Order Irreversible Thermodynamics (FOIT), in this work we
show that for an energy converter consisting of two coupled fluxes it is also
possible to find loop-shaped curves of both power output and the so-called
ecological function against efficiency. In a previous work Stucki [J.W. Stucki,
Eur. J. Biochem. vol. 109, 269 (1980)] used a FOIT-approach to describe the
modes of thermodynamic performance of oxidative phosphorylation involved in
ATP-synthesis within mithochondrias. In that work the author did not use the
mentioned loop-shaped curves and he proposed that oxidative phosphorylation
operates in a steady state simultaneously at minimum entropy production and
maximum efficiency, by means of a conductance matching condition between
extreme states of zero and infinite conductances respectively. In the present
work we show that all Stucki's results about the oxidative phosphorylation
energetics can be obtained without the so-called conductance matching
condition. On the other hand, we also show that the minimum entropy production
state implies both null power output and efficiency and therefore this state is
not fulfilled by the oxidative phosphorylation performance. Our results suggest
that actual efficiency values of oxidative phosphorylation performance are
better described by a mode of operation consisting in the simultaneous
maximization of the so-called ecological function and the efficiency.

two-layered network of contacts. Players obtain payoffs from five-person public
goods interactions on a square lattice (the interaction layer). Also, they
update strategies after communicating with neighbours in learning layer, where
two players build up mutual communication with a power law probability
depending on their spatial distance. Our simulation results indicate that the
evolution of cooperation is indeed sensitive to how players choose others to
communicate with, including the amount as well as the locations. The tendency
of localised communication is proved to be a new mechanism to promote
cooperation.

  With the numerical solutions thus obtained, we found the followings; i) The
fermion wave function renormalization function $A(P)$ always deviates largely
from unity even at the momentum where the mass is defined, thus the
corresponding solutions explicitly contradict with the Ward-Takahashi identity.
ii) As a result, the obtained solutions strongly depend on the choice of gauge
parameters: the critical temperatures and the critical coupling constants
significantly change gauge by gauge. In all gauges we studied in the present
analysis, we could not find any solution, having a possibility to be consistent
with the Ward-Takahashi identity. Thus we are forced to investigate the
procedure to find a gauge which enables us to get a solution being consistent

[1,2], including the scaling of the lifetime of near-critical configurations,

one-mode-unstable boson stars. In addition, we make a detailed study of the
long-time evolution of marginally subcritical configurations. Contrary to
previous claims [1,2], we find that the end state in such cases does not
involve dispersal of the bulk of the boson star field to large radial
distances, but instead can be generically described by a stable boson star
executing large amplitude oscillations. Furthermore we show that these
oscillations can be largely identified as excitations of the fundamental mode

required to change orbits is used to quantitatively identify objects near the

diffused in resonances (like 2003 EL61) is also developed. Known family members
are among the very closest KBOs to the collision and two new likely family

once (many) more resonant objects are identified. The ancient nature of the
collision contrasts with the seemingly fresh surfaces of known family members,

and relaxation processes in complex media provided one of the most impressive
impulses to the development of statistical physics during the last decade. In
particular the so-called fractional diffusion equation enabled one to capture
the main features of anomalous diffusion. However the price for this
achievement is rather high - the fractional diffusion coefficient becomes an
involved function of a characteristic of the media (e.g., that of the radius of
pores in the case of the porous one). Revealing this dependence from the first
principles is one of the main problems in this field of science. Another one
still remains that of extracting this dependence from the experiment. The
latter problem is tackled in the present paper. Our aim is to provide detailed
and pedagogical deriving the relationship of the fractional diffusion
coefficient with experimentally observable value from nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spin-lattice relaxation data. The result obtained promotes the
NMR relaxation method to become a powerful tool in solving the problem of
experimental measuring the fractional diffusion coefficient. Also the merits
and limitations of NMR relaxation method and pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR

stiff polyelectrolytes such as actin is studied in the solution of multivalent
salt. The dominant kinetic mode of aggregation is found to be the case of one
end of one rod meeting others at right angle due to electrostatic interactions.
The kinetic pathway to bundle formation involves a hierarchical structure of
small clusters forming initially and then feeding into larger clusters, which
is reminiscent of the flocculation dynamics of colloids. For the first few
cluster sizes, the Smoluchowski formula for the time evolution of the cluster
size gives a reasonable account for the results of our simulation without a
single fitting parameter. The description using Smoluchowski formula provides
evidence for the aggregation time scale to be controlled by diffusion, with no
appreciable energy barrier to overcome.

target object (67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko), was observed after the 2002
perihelion passage. The neckline structure or dust trail nature of this cloud
is controversial. In this paper, we definitively identify the dust trail and
the neckline structure using a wide-field CCD camera attached to the Kiso
1.05-m Schmidt telescope. The dust trail of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko was
evident as scattered sunlight in all images taken between September 9, 2002 and
February 1, 2003, whereas the neckline structure became obvious only after late
2002.
  We compared our images with a semi-analytical dynamic model of dust grains
emitted from the nucleus. A fading of the surface brightness of the dust trail
near the nucleus enabled us to determine the typical maximum size of the
grains. Assuming spherical compact particles with a mass density of 103 kg m-3
and an albedo of 0.04, we deduced that the maximum diameter of the dust
particles was approximately 1 cm. We found that the mass-loss rate of the comet
at the perihelion was 180 +/- 50 kg s-1 on or before the 1996 apparition, while
the mass-loss rate averaged over the orbit reached 20 +/- 6 kg s-1. The result
is consistent with the studies of the dust cloud emitted in the 2002/2003
return. Therefore, we can infer that the activity of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
has showed no major change over the past dozen years or so, and the largest
grains are cyclically injected into the dust tube lying along the cometary
orbit.

dust formation and how mass is lost to the interstellar medium in evolved

atmosphere of Betelgeuse has been proposed to account for the near- and
mid-infrared spectroscopic observations of Betelgeuse. The goal is to further
test this hypothesis and to identify some of the molecules in this MOLsphere.
We report on measurements taken with the mid-infrared two-telescope beam
combiner of the VLTI, MIDI, operated between 7.5 and 13.5 $\mu$m. The data are
compared to a simple geometric model of a photosphere surrounded by a warm
absorbing and emitting shell. Physical characteristics of the shell are
derived: size, temperature and optical depth. The chemical constituents are
determined with an analysis consistent with available infrared spectra and
interferometric data. We are able to account for the measured optical depth of
the shell in the N band, the ISO-SWS spectrum and K and L band interferometric
data with a shell whose inner and outer radii are given by the above range and
with the following species: H2O, SiO and Al2O3. These results confirm the
MOLsphere model. We bring evidence for more constituents and for the presence
of species participating in the formation of dust grains in the atmosphere of
the star, i.e. well below the distance at which the dust shell is detected. We
believe these results bring key elements to the understanding of mass loss in
Betelgeuse and red supergiants in general and bring support to the dust-driven
scenario.

shows a superior stability in terms of the variance of both the number of true

important in the presence of correlations between individual $p$-values. Its

approximate deconvolution models based on the van Cittert method are reported.
The Legendre spectral element method is used for the spatial discretization to
solve the filtered Navier--Stokes equations. A novel variant of approximate
deconvolution models blended with a mixed scale model using a dynamic
evaluation of the subgrid-viscosity constant is proposed. This model is
validated by comparing the large-eddy simulation with the direct numerical
simulation of the flow in a lid-driven cubical cavity, performed at a Reynolds
number of 12'000. Subgrid modeling in the case of a flow with coexisting
laminar, transitional and turbulent zones such as the lid-driven cubical cavity
flow represents a challenging problem. Moreover, the coupling with the spectral
element method having very low numerical dissipation and dispersion builds a
well suited framework to analyze the efficiency of a subgrid model. First- and
second-order statistics obtained using this new model are showing very good
agreement with the direct numerical simulation. Filtering operations rely on an
invertible filter applied in a modal basis and preserving the C0-continuity
across elements. No clipping on dynamic parameters was needed to preserve
numerical stability.

bootstrap percolation-like dynamics. Each site can be either empty or occupied
by a single particle and the dynamics follows a deterministic updating rule at
discrete times which allows only emptying sites. We prove that the threshold
density $\rho_c$ for convergence to a completely empty configuration is non
trivial, $0<\rho_c<1$, contrary to standard bootstrap percolation. Furthermore
we prove that in the subcritical regime, $\rho<\rho_c$, emptying always occurs
exponentially fast and that $\rho_c$ coincides with the critical density for
two-dimensional oriented site percolation on $\bZ^2$. This is known to occur
also for some cellular automata with oriented rules for which the transition is
continuous in the value of the asymptotic density and the crossover length
determining finite size effects diverges as a power law when the critical
density is approached from below. Instead for our model we prove that the
transition is {\it discontinuous} and at the same time the crossover length
diverges {\it faster than any power law}. The proofs of the discontinuity and
the lower bound on the crossover length use a conjecture on the critical
behaviour for oriented percolation. The latter is supported by several
numerical simulations and by analytical (though non rigorous) works through
renormalization techniques. Finally, we will discuss why, due to the peculiar
{\it mixed critical/first order character} of this transition, the model is
particularly relevant to study glassy and jamming transitions. Indeed, we will
show that it leads to a dynamical glass transition for a Kinetically
Constrained Spin Model. Most of the results that we present are the rigorous
proofs of physical arguments developed in a joint work with D.S.Fisher.

propose a new motion protocol for self-driven flocks. The small-world
connections are implemented by randomly adding long-range interactions from the
leader to a few distant agents, namely pseudo-leaders. The leader can directly
affect the pseudo-leaders, thereby influencing all the other agents through
them efficiently. Moreover, these pseudo-leaders are able to predict the
leader's motion several steps ahead and use this information in decision making
towards coherent flocking with more stable formation. It is shown that drastic
improvement can be achieved in terms of both the consensus performance and the
communication cost. From the industrial engineering point of view, the current
protocol allows for a significant improvement in the cohesion and rigidity of
the formation at a fairly low cost of adding a few long-range links embedded
with predictive capabilities. Significantly, this work uncovers an important
feature of flocks that predictive capability and long-range links can
compensate for the insufficiency of each other. These conclusions are valid for
both the attractive/repulsive swarm model and the Vicsek model.

the accretion disc (disc instability model, DIM).

tractable expressions for flavor conversion probabilities from which effects of

``steering'', a type of quantum nonlocality that is logically distinct from
both nonseparability and Bell-nonlocality. In the bipartite setting, it hinges
on the question of whether Alice can affect Bob's state at a distance through
her choice of measurement. More precisely and operationally, it hinges on the
question of whether Alice, with classical communication, can convince Bob that
they share an entangled state, under the circumstances that Bob trusts nothing
that Alice says. We argue that if she can, then this demonstrates the nonlocal
effect first identified in the famous EPR paper [Phys. Rev. {\bf 47}, 777
(1935)] as a universal effect for pure entangled states. This ability of Alice
to remotely prepare Bob's state was subsequently called steering by
Schr\""odinger, whose terminology we adopt. The phenomenon of steering has been
largely overlooked, and prior to our work had not even been given a rigorous
definition that is applicable to mixed states as well as pure states. Armed
with our rigorous definition, we proved that steerable states are a strict
subset of the entangled states, and a strict superset of the states that can
exhibit Bell-nonlocality. In this work we expand on these results and provide
further examples of steerable states. We also elaborate on the connection with
the original EPR paradox.

briefly reviewing its importance, we discuss the impact of the recently
proposed downward revision of mass loss rates due to clumping (difficulty to
form Wolf-Rayet stars and production of critically rotating stars). Although a
small reduction might be allowed, large reduction factors around ten are
disfavoured.
  We then discuss the possibility of significant mass loss at very low
metallicity due to stars reaching break-up velocities and especially due to the
metal enrichment of the surface of the star via rotational and convective
mixing. This significant mass loss may help the first very massive stars avoid
the fate of pair-creation supernova, the chemical signature of which is not
observed in extremely metal poor stars. The chemical composition of the very
low metallicity winds is very similar to that of the most metal poor star known
to date, HE1327-2326 and offer an interesting explanation for the origin of the
metals in this star.
  We also discuss the importance of mass loss in the context of long and soft
gamma-ray bursts and pair-creation supernovae. Finally, we would like to stress
that mass loss in cooler parts of the HR-diagram (luminous blue variable and
yellow and red supergiant stages) are much more uncertain than in the hot part.
More work needs to be done in these areas to better constrain the evolution of
the most massive stars.

considerably simplifies the modeling. Using TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping
Spectrometer) measurements of total column ozone over a six-day period, this
work investigates the modeling of axially symmetric processes on the sphere
using expansions in spherical harmonics. It turns out that one can capture many
of the large scale features of the spatial covariance structure using a
relatively small number of terms in such an expansion, but the resulting fitted
model provides a horrible fit to the data when evaluated via its likelihood
because of its inability to describe accurately the process's local behavior.
Thus, there remains the challenge of developing computationally tractable
models that capture both the large and small scale structure of these data.

conclusively that W Vir exhibits modest but detectable cycle-to-cycle
variations, the cause of which appears to be multiperiodicity rather than
nonlinearity. We combined our V-band data with the five available years of
ASAS-3 V-band photometry to obtain a 6.5-year light curve that we then analyzed
to obtain the pulsation spectrum of W Vir. We find a best-fit period P(0) =
17.27134 d; along with this period and its integer harmonics, we clearly detect
two additional periods, P(1) and P(low), that are close to but not exactly
2P(0)/3 and 2P(0), respectively. The former, P(1) = 11.52562 d, we interpret to
be the first overtone mode; the latter, P(low) = 34.59760 d is close to the
beat period of P(0) and P(1), as well as to the value of 2P(0). We interpret
the previously reported but thus far unconfirmed descriptions of alternating
minima as manifestations of this multiperiodicity. Finally, we use the period
derived from the V-band light curve to define a new ephemeris: HJD(max) =
2452758.172 + 17.27134E. The resulting (O-C) diagram using 75 years of data
from 1932 to 2007 yields a period change term for the ephemeris of -9.9 times

order to determine the dates of the eclipses. Two X-ray and UV measurements
were secured close to the center of the eclipse. The UV flux is the highest
just before the eclipse starts and the lowest towards the end of it. We model
the UV flux variations with a weekly modulation (inner disk eclipse), plus a
daily modulation, which suggests a non-steady accretion. No eclipses are
detected in X-rays. For one measurement, the X-ray count rate was nearly 50
times stronger than the minimum observed level, and the plasma temperature
reached 60 MK, i.e., a factor of 2-3 higher than in the other observations.
This X-ray event, observed close to the center of the optical eclipse, is
interpreted as an X-ray flare. We identify the variable column density with the
low-density accretion funnel flows blanketing the magnetosphere. The lack of
X-ray eclipses indicates that X-ray emitting regions are located at high
latitudes. Furthermore, the occurrence of a strong X-ray flare near the center
of the optical eclipse suggests that the magnetically active areas are closely
associated with the base of the high-density accretion funnel flow. We
speculate that the impact of this free falling accretion flow onto the strong

thrust exerted on matter at the scale of elementary particles by an imagined
perfect fluid (""ether""): the gravity acceleration is expressed by a formula in
which the ""ether pressure"" p_e plays the role of the Newtonian potential. The
instantaneous propagation of Newtonian gravity is obtained with an
incompressible ether, giving a field equation for p_e. For a compressible
ether, this equation holds in the static case. The extension to non-static
situations follows the lines of acoustics and leads to gravitational (pressure)
waves. To account for metric effects, the modern version of the
Lorentz-Poincare interpretation of special relativity is used. Einstein's
equivalence principle (EP) is seen as a correspondence between the metric
effects of gravity and those of uniform motion with respect to the ether: a
gravitational contraction (dilation) of space (time) standards is assumed. This
implies geodesic motion for test particles in a static field. The scalar field
equation is now expressed in terms of the physical space and time metrics in
the frame of ether. Since both metrics depend on p_e due to the EP, it becomes
non-linear in p_e. In the spherical static situation, Schwarzschild's exterior
metric is predicted, but the interior metric differs from GR. Since pressure
produces gravitation also in the investigated theory, no equilibrium is
possible for very massive objects. But the gravitational collapse in free fall
does not lead to any singularity. Moreover, gravitational waves, and even shock
ones, can exist in vacuo also with spherical symmetry.

theory of gravity was previously investigated. It assumes gravitational
contraction (dilation) of space (time) standards. In the static case, the same
Newton law as in special relativity was expressed in terms of these distorted
local standards, and was found to imply geodesic motion. Here, the formulation
of motion is reexamined in the most general situation. A consistent Newton law
can still be defined, which accounts for the time variation of the space
metric, but it is not compatible with geodesic motion for a time-dependent
field. The energy of a test particle is defined: it is constant in the static
case. Starting from 'dust', a balance equation is then derived for the energy
of matter. If the Newton law is assumed, the field equation of the theory
allows to rewrite this as a true conservation equation, including the
gravitational energy. The latter contains a Newtonian term, plus the square of
the relative rate of the local velocity of gravitation waves (or that of
light), the velocity being expressed in terms of absolute standards.

Results for light neutrino mass spectrum with normal and inverted ordering

real and CP-conserving and the lightest neutrino mass m_3 in the case of
inverted hierarchical spectrum lies the interval 5 \times 10^{-4} eV < m_3 < 7

pressure associated with a hurricane, can compound the effects of inland
flooding caused by rainfall, leading to loss of property and loss of life for
residents of coastal areas. Numerical ocean models are essential for creating
storm surge forecasts for coastal areas. These models are driven primarily by
the surface wind forcings. Currently, the gridded wind fields used by ocean
models are specified by deterministic formulas that are based on the central
pressure and location of the storm center. While these equations incorporate
important physical knowledge about the structure of hurricane surface wind
fields, they cannot always capture the asymmetric and dynamic nature of a
hurricane. A new Bayesian multivariate spatial statistical modeling framework
is introduced combining data with physical knowledge about the wind fields to
improve the estimation of the wind vectors. Many spatial models assume the data
follow a Gaussian distribution. However, this may be overly-restrictive for
wind fields data which often display erratic behavior, such as sudden changes
in time or space. In this paper we develop a semiparametric multivariate
spatial model for these data. Our model builds on the stick-breaking prior,
which is frequently used in Bayesian modeling to capture uncertainty in the
parametric form of an outcome. The stick-breaking prior is extended to the
spatial setting by assigning each location a different, unknown distribution,
and smoothing the distributions in space with a series of kernel functions.
This semiparametric spatial model is shown to improve prediction compared to
usual Bayesian Kriging methods for the wind field of Hurricane Ivan.

Target presentation mode, scene spatial structure and task difficulty were
chosen as independent variables. Two conditions were defined: the visual target
presentation mode (VP condition) and the multimodal target presentation mode
(MP condition). Each participant carried out two blocks of visual search tasks
(120 tasks per block, and one block per condition). Scene target presentation
mode, scene structure and task difficulty were found to be significant factors.
Multimodal target presentation proved to be more efficient than visual target
presentation. In addition, participants expressed very positive judgments on
multimodal target presentations which were preferred to visual presentations by
a majority of participants. Besides, the contribution of spatial messages to
visual search speed and accuracy was influenced by scene spatial structure and
task difficulty: (i) messages improved search efficiency to a lesser extent for
2D array layouts than for some other symmetrical layouts, although the use of
2D arrays for displaying pictures is currently prevailing; (ii) message

formation when the dimensionless mass-to-flux ratio is close to, or less than,
unity (lambda<~1). We show that, in disk formation, the requirement is far less
stringent. This conclusion is drawn from a set of 2D (axisymmetric) simulations
of the collapse of rotating, magnetized, singular isothermal cores. We find
that a weak field corresponding to 1ambda~100 can begin to disrupt the
rotationally supported disk through magnetic braking, by creating regions of
rapid, supersonic collapse in the disk. These regions are separated by one or
more centrifugal barriers, where the rapid infall is temporarily halted. The
number of centrifugal barriers increases with lambda. When lambda>~100, they
merge together to form a more or less contiguous, rotationally supported disk.
Even though the magnetic field in such a case is extremely weak on the scale of
dense cores, it is amplified by collapse and differential rotation, to the
extent that its pressure dominates the thermal pressure in both the disk and
its surrounding region. For relatively strongly magnetized cores with
lambda<~10, the disk formation is suppressed completely, as found previously. A
new feature is that the mass accretion is highly episodic, due to reconnection
of the accumulated magnetic field lines. For rotationally supported disks to
appear during the protostellar mass accretion phase of star formation in dense
cores with realistic field strengths, the powerful magnetic brake must be
weakened, perhaps through nonideal MHD effects and/or protostellar winds. We
discuss the possibility of observing a generic product of the magnetic braking,
an extended circumstellar region that is supported by a combination of toroidal
magnetic field and rotation - a ""magnetogyrosphere"".

function of $\theta$ is admissible under squared error loss. Eaton [Ann.
Statist. 20 (1992) 1147--1179] has shown that a sufficient condition for strong
admissibility of $\nu$ is the local recurrence of the Markov chain whose
transition function is $R(\theta,\mathrm{d}\eta)=\int
Q(\mathrm{d}\eta|x)P(\mathrm {d}x|\theta)$. Applications of this result and its
extensions are often greatly simplified when the Markov chain associated with
$R$ is irreducible. However, establishing irreducibility can be difficult. In
this paper, we provide a characterization of irreducibility for general state
space Markov chains and use this characterization to develop an easily checked,
necessary and sufficient condition for irreducibility of Eaton's Markov chain.
All that is required to check this condition is a simple examination of $P$ and
$\nu$. Application of the main result is illustrated using two examples.
