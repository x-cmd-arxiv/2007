probe the earliest, most embedded phases of star formation, during which disks
are rapidly accreting from their parent cores and cannot be modeled in

with high mass infall rates. Our model combines a self-consistent calculation
of disk temperatures with an approximate treatment of angular momentum
transport via two mechanisms. We use this model to survey the properties of
protostellar disks across a wide range of stellar masses and evolutionary
times, and make predictions for disks' masses, sizes, spiral structure, and
fragmentation that will be directly testable by future large-scale surveys of
deeply embedded disks. We define a dimensionless accretion-rotation parameter
which, in conjunction with the disk's temperature, controls the disk evolution.
We track the dominant mode of angular momentum transport, and demonstrate that
for stars with final masses greater than roughly one solar mass, gravitational
instabilities are the most important mechanism as most of the mass accumulates.
We predict that binary formation through disk fission, fragmentation of the
disk into small objects, and spiral arm strength all increase in importance to
higher stellar masses.

this beam station, called PERC, the 'active decay volume' lies inside the

towards the end of the neutron guide. Hence, the guide delivers at its exit a
beam of decay electrons and protons, under well-defined and precisely variable
conditions, which can be well separated from the cold neutron beam. In this way
a general-purpose source of neutron decay products is obtained which can be
used for various different experiments in neutron decay correlation
spectroscopy. A gain in phase space density of several orders of magnitude can
be achieved with PERC, as compared to existing neutron decay spectrometers.
Neutron beam related background is separately measurable in PERC, and magnetic
mirror effects on the charged neutron decay products and edge effects in the
active neutron beam volume are both strongly suppressed. Therefore the spectra

distortion-free on the level of 10^-4, more than 10 times better than achieved

obscured AGNs at z=1.3-3 discovered in the largest Spitzer surveys (SWIRE,
NDWFS, & FLS) by means of their extremely red IR to optical colors. All sources
show the 9.7micron silicate feature in absorption and have extreme mid-IR
luminosities (L(6micron)~10^46 erg/s). The IR SEDs and spectra of 12 sources
are well reproduced with a simple torus model, while the remaining 9 sources
require foreground extinction from a cold dust component to reproduce both the
depth of the silicate feature and the near-IR emission from hot dust. The
best-fit torus models show a broad range of inclinations, with no preference
for the edge-on torus expected in obscured AGNs. Based on the unobscured QSO
mid-IR luminosity function, and on a color-selected sample of obscured and
unobscured IR sources, we estimate the surface densities of obscured and
unobscured QSOs at L(6micron)>10^12 Lsun, and z=1.3-3.0 to be about 17-22

QSOs are unobscured, 37-40% are obscured by the torus, and 23-25% are obscured
by a cold absorber detached from the torus. These fractions constrain the torus
half opening angle to be ~67 deg. This value is significantly larger than found
for FIR selected samples of AGN at lower luminosity (~46 deg), supporting the
receding torus scenario. A far-IR component is observed in 8 objects. The
estimated far-IR luminosities associated with this component all exceed
3.3x10^12 Lsun, implying SFRs of 600-3000 Msun/yr. (Abridged)

Every investment is evaluated in the market via a stylized return on investment

complete-knowledge of the dynamics of the returns. We consider also an

fitting a trend line to previous received returns. To account for the

based on photometry, except for one object that we argue is a compact HII
region rather than a PN. We find that the chemical composition of the ISM in
NGC 3109, as sampled by its HII regions, is remarkably uniform. The oxygen
abundance is log O/H + 12 = 7.77 \pm 0.07 in this galaxy, as compared to 8.05
\pm 0.09 for the SMC. PNe show significantly higher oxygen abundances in NGC
3109: log O/H + 12 = 8.16 \pm 0.19. We argue that, similarly to what has been
suggested for some of the PNe in the Magellanic Clouds and other metal-poor
galaxies, oxygen in the PNe in NGC 3109 is affected by dredge up in their
progenitors. This could be also the case for neon. From our analysis, we
conclude that these two elements are not always a safe indicator of the
chemical composition of the ISM at low metallicities. An alternative to the O
and Ne enrichment in PNe is that the low metallicity in HII regions has been
caused by dilution of the ISM due interaction with a neighbor galaxy about a
Gyr ago.
  The excitation patterns of the PNe in NGC 3109 are very different from the
excitation patterns of PNe in other galaxies. This would imply that the
evolution of PNe depends upon the properties of their progenitor stellar
populations, which vary from galaxy to galaxy. This should affect the PN
luminosity function and its use as a distance indicator.

  Journal",,"10.1086/523960",,"astro-ph",,"  The barred galaxy NGC 7479 hosts a remarkable jet-like radio continuum
feature: bright, 12-kpc long in projection, and hosting an aligned magnetic
field. The degree of polarization is 6%-8% along the jet, and remarkably
constant, which is consistent with helical field models. The radio brightness
of the jet suggests strong interaction with the ISM and hence a location near
the disk plane. We observed NGC 7479 at four wavelengths with the VLA and
Effelsberg radio telescopes. The equipartition strength is 35-40 micro-G for
the total and >10 micro-G for the ordered magnetic field in the jet. The jet
acts as a bright, polarized background. Faraday rotation between 3.5 and 6 cm
and depolarization between 6 and 22 cm can be explained by magneto-ionic gas in
front of the jet, with thermal electron densities of ~0.06 cm**(-3) in the bar
and ~0.03 cm**(-3) outside the bar. The regular magnetic field along the bar
points toward the nucleus on both sides. The regular field in the disk reveals
multiple reversals, probably consisting of field loops stretched by a shearing
gas flow in the bar. The projection of the jet bending in the sky plane is in
the sense opposite to that of the underlying stellar and gaseous spiral
structure. The bending in 3-D is most easily explained as a precessing jet,
with an age less than 10**6 years. Our observations are consistent with very
recent triggering, possibly by a minor merger. NGC 7479 provides a unique
opportunity to study interaction-triggered 15-kpc scale radio jets within a
spiral galaxy.

fields. In the multi-temperature regions, we find a correlation between the
amount of gas cooler than the surrounding X-ray plasma and the metallicity, and
conclude that the cool gas is more metal-rich than the ambient halo. We
estimate the average Fe abundance of the cool gas to ~2.2 solar. Our results
thus point toward the key role of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in
transporting heavy elements into the intracluster medium. The abundance ratios
of O/Si/S/Fe in and outside the X-ray arms are similar, indicating that the
dominant fraction of metals in the gas halo was uplifted by AGN outbursts
relatively recently compared to the age of M87. Our estimate for the mass of
the cool gas is 5e8 M_sun, which probably stems from a mixture of ICM, stellar
mass loss, and Type Ia supernova products. ~30-110 Myr are required to produce
the observed metals in the cool gas. Finally, we put upper limits on possible
non-thermal X-ray emission from M87 and, combining it with the 90 cm radio
maps, we put lower limits of around ~0.5-1.0 muG on the magnetic field
strength.

how the widely used benefit function known as modularity can be generalized in
a principled fashion to incorporate the information contained in edge

modularity over possible divisions of a network, which we do using an algorithm
based on the eigenvectors of the corresponding modularity matrix. This method

observatory. We acquired spectra of more than 500 objects. Approximately 150 of
these spectra were of galaxies that are members of six different clusters,
which differ in intrinsic X-ray luminosity. The wavelength range allows us to
quantify the star formation activity by using the OII and the Halpha lines.
This activity is examined in terms of the large-scale environment expressed by
the clustercentric distance of the galaxies as well as on local scales given by
the spatial galaxy densities. A global suppression of star-formation is
detected in the outskirts of clusters, at about 3Rvir. Galaxies with ongoing
star-formation have similar activity, regardless of the environment. Therefore,
the decline of the star-formation activity inside the investigated clusters is
driven mainly by the significant change in the fraction of active versus
passive populations. This suggests that the suppression of the star-formation
activity occurs on short timescales. We detect a significant population of red
star-forming galaxies whose colors are consistent with the red-sequence of
passive galaxies. They appear to be in an intermediate evolutionary stage
between active and passive types. Since a suppression of star-formation
activity is measured at large clustercentric distances and low projected
densities, purely cluster-specific phenomena cannot fully explain the observed
trends. Therefore, as suggested by other studies, group preprocessing may play
an important role in transforming galaxies before they enter into the cluster
environment. Since models predict that a significant fraction of galaxies
observed in the outskirts may have already transversed through the cluster
center, the effects of ram-pressure stripping cannot be neglected. (ABRIDGED)

evolved analog of Stephan's Quintet (HCG92: SQ). We postulate that SS formed by
sequential acquisition of 4-5 primarily late-type field galaxies. Four of the
five galaxies show an early-type morphology which is likely the result of
secular evolution driven by gas stripping. Stellar stripping has produced a
massive/luminous halo and embedded galaxies that are overluminous for their
size. These are interpreted as remnant bulges of the accreted spirals. H79d
could be interpreted as the most recent intruder being the only galaxy with an
intact ISM and uncertain evidence for tidal perturbation. In addition to
stripping activity we find evidence for past accretion events. H79b (NGC6027)
shows a strong counter-rotating emission line component interpreted as an
accreted dwarf spiral. H79a shows evidence for an infalling component of gas
representing feedback or possible cross fueling by H79d. The biggest challenge
to this scenario involves the low gas fraction in the group. If SS formed from
normal field spirals then much of the gas is missing. Finally, despite its
advanced stage of evolution, we find no evidence for major mergers and infer
that SS (and SQ) are telling us that such groups coalesce via slow dissolution.

dominated plasma with a broad range of temperatures. All the lines are
blue-shifted, with the velocity shift increasing with lower ionization state
and longer wavelength. Two weeks later, the spectrum was still dominated by
emission lines, although the line ratios present indicate cooling. During this
observation, a soft X-ray flare occurred in which a new system of higher
velocity emission lines appeared in the soft end of the spectrum. The dominant
component during the third month was the supersoft continuum with the broad
absorption features of a hot white dwarf atmosphere. A preliminary model fit
indicates a white dwarf temperature slightly exceeding 800,000 K. The X-ray
luminosity reached at least 9 x 10^37 erg s^-1 in the 0.2-1 keV range, while
the intrinsic nebular absorption decreased by a factor of five since the first
observation. The spectral fits indicate a massive white dwarf, with a mass of

progenitor. We show that the data are consistent with mass loss ending before
day 54 after the outburst, and nuclear burning ending around day 69. A rapid
decay in X-ray luminosity followed after week 10. The X-ray luminosity 5, 7 and
8 months after optical maximum dropped by more than two orders of magnitude.

chemical evolution modeling and radiative transfer calculations are a powerful
tool to study the earliest stages of star formation. However, conclusions drawn
from such a modeling may noticeably depend on the assumed thermal structure of
the cores. The assumption of isothermality, which may work well in
chemo-dynamical studies, becomes a critical factor in molecular line formation
simulations. We argue that even small temperature variations, which are likely
to exist in starless cores, can have a non-negligible effect on the
interpretation of molecular line data and derived core properties. In
particular, ``chemically pristine'' isothermal cores (low depletion) can have
centrally peaked C$^{18}$O and C$^{34}$S radial intensity profiles, while
having ring-like intensity distributions in models with a colder center and/or
warmer envelope assuming the same underlying chemical structure. Therefore,
derived molecular abundances based on oversimplified thermal models may lead to
a mis-interpretation of the line data.

  tables; Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12525.x",,"astro-ph",,"  We report the detection of extended low radio frequency continuum emission
beyond the optical disk of the spiral galaxy NGC 4254 using the Giant Metrewave
Radio Telescope. NGC 4254, which has an almost face-on orientation, is located
in the outskirts of the Virgo cluster. Since such extended emission is uncommon
in low inclination galaxies, we believe it is a signature of magnetised plasma
pushed out of the disk by ram pressure of the intracluster medium as NGC 4254
falls into the Virgo cluster. The detailed spectral index distribution across
NGC 4254 shows that the steepest spectrum alpha < -1 (S propto nu^{alpha})
arises in the gas beyond the optical disk. This lends support to the ram
pressure scenario by indicating that the extended emission is not from the disk
gas but from matter which has been stripped by ram pressure. The steeper
spectrum of the extended emission is reminiscent of haloes in edge-on galaxies.
The sharp fall in intensity and enhanced polarization in the south of the
galaxy, in addition to enhanced star formation reported by others provide
evidence towards the efficacy of ram pressure on this galaxy. HI 21cm
observations show that the gas in the north lags in rotation and hence is
likely the atomic gas which is carried along with the wind. NGC 4254 is a
particularly strong radio emitter with a power of 7x10^{22} Watts/Hz at 240
MHz. We find that the integrated spectrum of the galaxy flattens at lower
frequencies and is well explained by an injection spectrum with
alpha_0=-0.45+-0.12. We end by comparing published simulation results with our
data and conclude that ram pressure stripping is likely to be a significant
contributor to evolution of galaxies residing in X-ray poor groups and cluster
outskirts.

These interactions are proportional to the fermion mass and grow with energy,

off top quarks, so that the event topology to be searched for is a pair of

was achieved allowing to set limits for the top-paraphoton coupling. Arguments

dominated by communication over the entire range of N, which was limited due to

studied its dynamical state with a detailed 2D temperature and surface
brightness analysis of the inner part of the cluster. Using the assumption of
both spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) we can determine the
main cluster parameters: total mass, temperature profile, surface brightness
profile and $\beta$-parameter. We also build a temperature map which clearly
exhibits departure from spherical symmetry in the centre. To estimate the
influence of these perturbations onto our total mass estimate, we also compute
the total mass in the framework of the HE approach, but this time with various
temperature profiles obtained in different directions. These various total mass
estimates are consistent with each other. The temperature perturbations are
clear signatures of ongoing merger activity. We also find significant residuals
after subtracting the emissivity map by a 2D $\beta$-model fit. We conclude
that, although CL0016+16 shows clear signs of merger activity and departure
from spherical symmetry in the centre, its X-ray emissivity can be detected up

is therefore a good candidate to study cosmological scaling laws as predicted

models are in the mass range 0.85 < M < 3.0 Msun. Many of the EMP and Z=0
models experience violent evolutionary episodes not seen at higher
metallicities. We refer to these events as `Dual Flashes' since they are
characterised by peaks in the hydrogen and helium burning luminosities
occurring at roughly the same time. Some of the material processed by these
events is later dredged up by the convective envelope, causing signifcant
surface pollution. These events have been reported by previous studies, so our
results reaffirm their occurrence -- at least in 1D stellar models. The novelty
of this study is that we have calculated the entire evolution of the Z=0 and
EMP models, from the ZAMS to the end of the TPAGB, including detailed
nucleosynthesis. We have also calculated the nucleosynthetic yields, which will
soon be available in electronic format. Although subject to many uncertainties
these are, as far as we are aware, the only yields available in this mass and

study the detectability of the high energy SSC emission by the AGILE and GLAST

prompt phase of GRBs improves for higher values of the fireball Lorentz factor

flare emission, and the Lorentz factor of the shells producing the flare is of
the order of 100, the flare light curves are expected to present some
substructures with temporal variability of 10-100 ms which are much smaller
than the average duration of flares, and similar to those observed during the
prompt phase of GRBs. If one assumes lower Lorentz factors, such as 10-25, then
a larger temporal variaibility of 40 s can also account for the observed flare
properties. However in this case we predict that X-ray flares do not have a

kappa-mechanism due to the Fe-group opacity bump. The current models do not
predict the presence of instability strips in the B spectral domain at very low
metallicities. As the metallicity of the SMC is lower than Z=0.005, it
constitutes a very suitable object to test these predictions.
  Aims: The main objective is to investigate the existence of B-type pulsators
at low metallicities, searching for short-term periodic variability in
absorption-line B and Be stars in the SMC. The analysis has been performed in a
sample of 313 B and Be stars with fundamental astrophysical parameters
accurately determined from high-resolution spectroscopy.
  Methods: Photometric light curves of the MACHO project have been analyzed
using standard Fourier techniques and linear and non-linear least squares
fitting methods. The position of the pulsating stars in the HR diagram has been
used to ascertain their nature and to map the instability regions in the SMC.
  Results: We have detected 9 absorption-line B stars showing short-period
variability, two among them being multiperiodic. One star is most likely a beta
Cephei variable and the remaining 8 are SPB stars. The SPB instability strip in
the SMC is shifted towards higher temperatures than the Galaxy. In the Be star
sample, 32 stars are short-period variables, 20 among them multiperiodic. 4.9%
of B stars and 25.3% of Be stars are pulsating stars.
  Conclusions: beta Cephei and SPB stars do exist at the SMC metallicity. The
fractions of SPB stars and pulsating Be stars in the SMC are lower than in the
Galaxy. The fraction of pulsating Be stars in the SMC is much higher than the
fraction of pulsating absorption-line B stars, as in the Galaxy.

9 MeV and m_s/m_ud = 27.3 +- 0.3 +- 1.2. We also obtain fK = 161.7 +- 1.2 +-
3.1 MeV and the ratio fK/fpi=1.227 +- 0.009 +- 0.024. From this ratio, by using
the experimental determination of Gamma(K-> mu nu (gamma))/Gamma(pi -> mu nu

|Vus|=0.2192(5)(45), in agreement with the determination from Kl3 decays and

  Measurement","5 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.ins-det physics.optics",,"  Measuring very small forces, particularly those of a gravitational nature,
has always been of great interest, as fundamental tests of our understanding of
the physical laws. Ultra-long period mechanical oscillators, typically used in
such measurements, will have kT/2 of thermal energy associated with each degree
of freedom, owing to the equal-partition of energy. Moreover, additional
seismic fluctuations in the low frequency band can raise this equivalent
temperature significantly to 10^5 K. Recently, various methods using
opto-mechanical forces have been reported to decrease this thermal energy for
MHz, micro-cantilever oscillators, effectively cooling them. Here we show the
direct, dynamical cooling of a gram-size, macroscopic oscillator to 300 mK in
equivalent temperature - noise reduction by a factor of 10^6. By precisely
measuring the torsional oscillator's position, we dynamically provide an
external 'viscous' damping force. Such an added, dissipative force is
essentially free of noise, resulting in rapid cooling of the oscillator.
Additionally, we observe the time-dependent cooling process, at various cooling
force parameters. This parameter dependence agrees well with a simple physical
model which we provide. We further show that the device is sensitive to forces
as small as <100 fN - a force only a few percent of that typically exerted by a
single biological molecule or that observed in a typical gravity experiment. We
also demonstrate the dynamic control of the oscillator's natural frequency,
over a span of nearly two decades. The method may find important applications
in precision measurements of very weak forces.

accompanied by the preceding component. This so called precursor is known for
its distinctive polarization, spectral, and fluctuation properties. Recent
single-pulse observations hint that the sporadic activity at the extreme
leading edge of the pulse may be prevalent in pulsars. We for the first time
propose a physical mechanism of this phenomenon. It is based on the induced
scattering of the main pulse radiation into the background. We show that the
scattered component is directed approximately along the ambient magnetic field
and, because of rotational aberration in the scattering region, appears in the
pulse profile as a precursor to the main pulse. Our model naturally explains
high linear polarization of the precursor emission, its spectral and
fluctuation peculiarities as well as suggests a specific connection between the
precursor and the main pulse at widely spaced frequencies. This is believed to
stimulate multifrequency single-pulse studies of intensity modulation in

primordial power-spectrum of scalar perturbations in this model is shown to be
the same that predicted by standard general relativity. However, the
power-spectrum of tensor perturbation is different from that in general
relativity, but has a smaller amplitude and so cannot be detected at present.
We also study the implications for late-time cosmology and find that the
evolution of photon and neutrino anisotropic stresses can source the aether
field perturbation during the radiation and matter dominated epochs, and as a
result the CMB and matter power spectra are modified. However these effects are
degenerate with respect to other cosmological parameters, such as neutrino
masses and the bias parameter in the observed galaxy spectrum.

  METHODS: Observations of 1ES 0229+200 at energies above 580 GeV were
performed with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) in 2005 and 2006.
  RESULTS: 1ES 0229+200 is discovered by HESS to be an emitter of VHE photons.
A signal is detected at the 6.6 sigma level in the HESS observations (41.8 h
live time). The integral flux above 580 GeV is (9.4 +- 1.5 {stat} +- 1.9
{syst}) x 10^{-13} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, corresponding to ~1.8% of the flux observed
from the Crab Nebula. The data show no evidence for significant variability on
any time scale. The observed spectrum is characterized by a hard power law
(Gamma = 2.50 +- 0.19 {stat} +- 0.10 {syst}) from 500 GeV to ~15 TeV.
  CONCLUSIONS: The high-energy range and hardness of the observed spectrum,
coupled with the object's relatively large redshift (z=0.1396), enable the
strongest constraints so far on the density of the Extragalactic Background
Light (EBL) in the mid-infrared band. Assuming that the emitted spectrum is not
harder than Gamma_{int} ~ 1.5, the HESS data support an EBL spectrum ~
lambda^{-1} and density close to the lower limit from source counts measured by
Spitzer, confirming the previous indications from the HEGRA data of 1ES

of 1ES 0229+200 is hard, thus locating the high-energy peak of its spectral
energy distribution above a few TeV.

  eds., Cambridge University Press",,"10.1017/S1743921308015500",,"astro-ph",,"  The majority of the inhomogeneities in the chemical composition of Globular
Cluster (GC) stars appear due to primordial enrichment by hot-CNO cycled
material processed in stars belonging to a first stellar generation. Either
massive AGB envelopes subject to hot bottom burning, or the envelopes of
massive fastly rotating stars could be the progenitors. In both cases, the
stars showing chemical anomalies must have also enhanced helium abundance, and
we have proposed that this higher helium could be at the basis of the many
different morphologies of GC horizontal branches (HB) for similar ages and
metallicities. The helium variations have been beautifully confirmed by the
splitting of the main sequence in the clusters omega Cen and NGC 2808, but this
effect can show up only for somewhat extreme helium abundances. Therefore it is
important to go on using the HB morphology to infer the number ratio of the
first to the second generation in as many clusters as possible. We exemplify
how it is possible to infer the presence of a He-rich stellar component in
different clusters thanks to different HB features (gaps, RR Lyr periods and
period distribution, ratio of blue to red stars, blue tails). In many clusters
at least 50% of the stars belong to the second stellar generation, and in some
cases we suspect that the stars might all belong to the second generation. We
shortly examine the problem of the initial mass function required to achieve
the observed number ratios and conclude that: 1) the initial cluster must have
been much more massive than today's cluster, and 2) formation of the second
stellar generation mainly in the central regions of the cluster may help in
obtaining the desired values.

Fourier techniques and non-linear least-square fitting to the time series.

projecting the corresponding complexifier coherent states, which have been

kinematical sector, to the gauge-invariant Hilbert space. This being the first
step to construct physical coherent states, we arrive at a set of
gauge-invariant states that approximate well the gauge-invariant degrees of

Hubbard model at zero temperature using clusters (chains) of up to ten sites
with full diagonalization and the Lanczos method as cluster solver. Within the
framework of the self-energy-functional theory (SFT), different cluster
reference systems with and without bath degrees of freedom, in different
topologies and with different sets of variational parameters are considered.
Static and one-particle dynamical quantities are calculated for half-filling as
a function of U as well as for fixed U as a function of the chemical potential
to study the interaction- and filling-dependent metal-insulator (Mott)
transition. The recently developed Q-matrix technique is used to compute the
SFT grand potential. For benchmarking purposes we compare the VCA results with
exact results available from the Bethe ansatz, with essentially exact dynamical
DMRG data, with (cellular) dynamical mean-field theory and full diagonalization
of isolated Hubbard chains. Several issues are discussed including convergence
of the results with cluster size, the ability of cluster approaches to access
the critical regime of the Mott transition, efficiency in the optimization of
correlated-site vs. bath-site parameters and of multi-dimensional parameter
optimization. We also study the role of bath sites for the description of
excitation properties and as charge reservoirs for the description of filling
dependencies. The VCA turns out to be a computationally cheap method which is
competitive with established cluster approaches.

proposed to be included in many upcoming space missions to fill the gap of
about 30 years from the first (and to date only) positive measurement of
polarized X-ray emission from an astrophysical source. The estimated
sensitivity of the current prototype peaks at an energy of about 3 keV, but the
lack of readily available polarized sources in this energy range has prevented
the measurement of detector polarimetric performances.
  In this paper we present the measurement of the Gas Pixel Detector
polarimetric sensitivity at energies of a few keV and the new, light, compact
and transportable polarized source that was devised and built to this aim.
Polarized photons are produced, from unpolarized radiation generated with an
X-ray tube, by means of Bragg diffraction at nearly 45 degrees.
  The employment of mosaic graphite and flat aluminum crystals allow the
production of nearly completely polarized photons at 2.6, 3.7 and 5.2 keV from
the diffraction of unpolarized continuum or line emission. The measured
modulation factor of the Gas Pixel Detector at these energies is in good
agreement with the estimates derived from a Monte Carlo software, which was up
to now employed for driving the development of the instrument and for
estimating its low energy sensitivity. In this paper we present the excellent
polarimetric performance of the Gas Pixel Detector at energies where the peak
sensitivity is expected. These measurements not only support our previous
claims of high sensitivity but confirm the feasibility of astrophysical X-ray
photoelectric polarimetry.
