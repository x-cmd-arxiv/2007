describes hadronic radiation between the jets. Near kinematic thresholds S
encodes nonperturbative information, while far from thresholds S can be
computed with an operator product expansion (OPE). We design soft functions for
jets that serve this dual purpose, reducing to the perturbative result in the
OPE region and to a consistent model in the nonperturbative region. We use the
MSbar scheme, and in both regions S displays the appropriate renormalization
group scale dependence. We point out that viable soft function models should
have a gap associated with the minimum hadronic energy deposit. This gap is
connected to the leading O(Lambda_QCD) renormalon ambiguity in jet event
shapes. By defining the gap in a suitable scheme we demonstrate that the
leading renormalon can be eliminated. This improves the convergence of
perturbative results, and also the stability by which non-perturbative
parameters encode the underlying soft physics.

correctability is defined under the assumption that states are perfectly
initialized inside a particular subspace, a factor of which (a subsystem)
contains the protected information. If the initial state of the system does not
belong entirely to the subspace in question, the restriction of the state to
the otherwise correctable subsystem may not remain invariant after the
application of noise and error correction. It is known that in the case of
decoherence-free subspaces and subsystems (DFSs) the condition for perfect
unitary evolution inside the code imposes more restrictive conditions on the
noise process if one allows imperfect initialization. It was believed that
these conditions are necessary if DFSs are to be able to protect imperfectly
encoded states from subsequent errors. By a similar argument, general OQEC
codes would also require more restrictive error-correction conditions for the
case of imperfect initialization. In this study, we examine this requirement by
looking at the errors on the encoded state. In order to quantitatively analyze
the errors in an OQEC code, we introduce a measure of the fidelity between the
encoded information in two states for the case of subsystem encoding. A major
part of the paper concerns the definition of the measure and the derivation of
its properties. In contrast to what was previously believed, we obtain that
more restrictive conditions are not necessary neither for DFSs nor for general
OQEC codes. This is because the effective noise that can arise inside the code
as a result of imperfect initialization is such that it can only increase the
fidelity of an imperfectly encoded state with a perfectly encoded one.

numerical convergence of models (independence of certain numerical parameters
such as gravitational softening). We use two-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations with adaptive mesh refinement,based on the FLASH code with improved
time-stepping scheme. We perform global disk simulations with sufficient
resolution close to the planet, which is allowed to freely move throughout the
grid. We employ a new type of equation of state in which the gas temperature
depends on both the distance to the star and planet, and a simplified
correction for self-gravity of the circumplanetary gas. We find that the
migration rate in the type III migration regime depends strongly on the gas
dynamics inside the Hill sphere (Roche lobe of the planet) which, in turn, is
sensitive to the aspect ratio of the circumplanetary disc. Furthermore,
corrections due to the gas self-gravity are necessary to reduce numerical
artifacts that act against rapid planet migration. Reliable numerical studies
of Type III migration thus require consideration of both the thermal andthe
self-gravity corrections, as well as a sufficient spatial resolution and the
calculation of disk-planet attraction both inside and outside the Hill sphere.
With this proviso, we find Type III migration to be a robust mode of migration,
astrophysically promising because of a speed much faster than in the previously
studied modes of migration.

classical gravitational and electromagnetic fields in the metric-affine
formulation of gravity. The gravitational field is represented in the
Lagrangian by the symmetric part of the Ricci tensor and the classical
electromagnetic field can be represented by the tensor of homothetic curvature.
The simplest metric-affine Lagrangian that depends on the tensor of homothetic
curvature generates the Einstein-Maxwell equations for a massless vector.
Metric-affine Lagrangians with matter fields depending on the connection are
subject to an unphysical constraint because the symmetrized Ricci tensor is
projectively invariant while matter fields are not. We show that the appearance
of the tensor of homothetic curvature, which is not projectively invariant, in
the Lagrangian replaces this constraint with the Maxwell equations and restores
projective invariance of the total action. We also examine several constraints
on the torsion tensor to show that algebraic constraints on the torsion that
break projective invariance of the connection and impose projective invariance
on the tensor of homothetic curvature replace the massless vector with a
massive vector. We conclude that the metric-affine formulation of gravity
allows for a mechanism that generates masses of vectors, as it happens for
electroweak gauge bosons via spontaneous symmetry breaking.

signal of high energy gamma rays with energies above 350 GeV is detected in
several orbital cycles of the binary system. The detected flux of gamma rays is
strongly variable with the orbital period of 26.5 days, while the maximum flux
(corresponding to about 10% of the flux of the Crab Nebula)is always found at
approximately apastron, suggesting a strong dependence of particle acceleration
and/or propagation on the relative position of the two objects in the system.

Distribution (QKD) system implementing the Gaussian-Modulated Coherent States
(GMCS) protocol. The system employs a double Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI)
configuration in which the weak quantum signal and the strong Local Oscillator
(LO) go through the same fiber between Alice and Bob, and are separated into
two paths inside Bob's terminal. To suppress the LO leakage into the signal
path, which is an important contribution to the excess noise, we implemented a
novel scheme combining polarization and frequency multiplexing, achieving an
extinction ratio of 70dB. To further minimize the system excess noise due to
phase drift of the double MZI, we propose that, instead of employing phase
feedback control, one simply let Alice remap her data by performing a rotation
operation. We further present noise analysis both theoretically and
experimentally. Our calculation shows that the combined polarization and
frequency multiplexing scheme can achieve better stability in practice than the
time-multiplexing scheme, because it allows one to use matched fiber lengths
for the signal and the LO paths on both sides of the double MZI, greatly
reducing the phase instability caused by unmatched fiber lengths. Our
experimental noise analysis quantifies the three main contributions to the
excess noise, which will be instructive to future studies of the GMCS QKD
systems. Finally, we demonstrate, under the ""realistic model"" in which Eve
cannot control the system within Bob's terminal, a secure key rate of
0.3bit/pulse over a 5km fiber link. This key rate is about two orders of
magnitude higher than that of a practical BB84 QKD system.

(ATM) and through a gauge fixing procedure we obtain the classical version of
the generalized sl(3,C) sine-Gordon model (cGSG) which completely decouples
from the Dirac spinors. The GSG models are multifield extensions of the
ordinary sine-Gordon model. In the spinor sector we are left with Dirac fields
coupled to cGSG fields. Based on the equivalence between the U(1) vector and
topological currents, which holds in the theory, it is shown the confinement of
the spinors inside the solitons and kinks of the cGSG model providing an
extended hadron model for ""quark"" confinement [JHEP0701(2007)027]. Moreover,
the solitons and kinks of the generalized sine-Gordon (GSG) model are shown to
describe the normal and exotic baryon spectrum of two-dimensional QCD. The GSG
model arises in the low-energy effective action of bosonized QCD2 with unequal
quark mass parameters [JHEP0703(2007)055]. The GSG potential for three flavors
resembles the potential of the effective chiral lagrangian proposed by Witten
to describe low-energy behavior of four dimensional QCD. Among the attractive
features of the GSG model are the variety of soliton and kink type solutions
for QCD2 unequal quark mass parameters. Exotic baryons in QCD2 [ Ellis and
Frishman, JHEP0508(2005)081] are discussed in the context of the GSG model.
Various semi-classical computations are performed improving previous results

Gordon model also arises as a reduced GSG model bearing a kink(K) type solution

gravitational lensing effect, and, indirectly, must affect the main
cosmological tests. Assuming that the dark energy is a smooth component, the
simplest way to account for the influence of clustering is to suppose that the
average evolution of the expanding Universe is governed by the total
matter-energy density whereas the focusing of light is only affected by a
fraction of the total matter density quantified by the $\alpha$ Dyer-Roeder
parameter. By using two different samples of SNe type Ia data, the $\Omega_m$
and $\alpha$ parameters are constrained by applying the
Zeldovich-Kantowski-Dyer-Roeder (ZKDR) luminosity distance redshift relation
for a flat ($\Lambda$CDM) model. A $\chi^{2}$-analysis using the 115 SNe Ia
data of Astier {\it et al.} sample (2006) constrains the density parameter to
be $\Omega_m=0.26_{-0.07}^{+0.17}$($2\sigma$) while the $\alpha$ parameter is
weakly limited (all the values $\in [0,1]$ are allowed even at 1$\sigma$).
However, a similar analysis based the 182 SNe Ia data of Riess {\it et al.}
(2007) constrains the pair of parameters to be $\Omega_m= 0.33^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$
and $\alpha\geq 0.42$ ($2\sigma$). Basically, this occurs because the Riess
{\it et al.} sample extends to appreciably higher redshifts. As a general
result, even considering the existence of inhomogeneities as described by the
smoothness $\alpha$ parameter, the Einstein-de Sitter model is ruled out by the
two samples with a high degree of statistical confidence ($11.5\sigma$ and
$9.9\sigma$, respectively). The inhomogeneous Hubble-Sandage diagram discussed
here highlight the necessity of the dark energy, and a transition
deceleration/accelerating phase at $z\sim 0.5$ is also required.

  Results: Using random shuffled surrogate analysis, we have obtained some of
the nonlinear features that was obtained by Andrzejak \textit{et al.} [Phys Rev

distribution function shows that the activity of an epileptic brain is
nongaussian in nature. Hurst exponent has been shown to be useful to
characterize a normal and an epileptic brain and it shows that the epileptic
brain is long term anticorrelated whereas, the normal brain is more or less
stochastic. Among all the techniques, used here, Hurst exponent is found very
useful for characterization different cases.
  Conclusions: In this article, differences in characteristics for normal
subjects with eyes open and closed, epileptic subjects during seizure and
seizure free intervals have been shown mainly using Hurst exponent. The H shows
that the brain activity of a normal man is uncorrelated in nature whereas,
epileptic brain activity shows long range anticorrelation.

compare pure- and pseudo-spin dynamics using as an example a system of two
quantum dots, a pair of localized conduction-band electrons in an n-doped GaAs
semiconductor. Pure-spin dynamics is obtained by tracing out the orbital
degrees of freedom, whereas pseudo-spin dynamics retains (as is conventional)
an implicit coordinate dependence. We show that magnetic field inhomogeneity
and spin-orbit interaction result in a non-unitary evolution in pure-spin
dynamics, whereas these interactions contribute to the effective pseudo-spin
Hamiltonian via terms that are asymmetric in spin permutations, in particular,
the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) spin-orbit interaction. We numerically
investigate the non-unitary effects in the dynamics of the triplet states
population, purity, and Lamb energy shift, as a function of interdot distance
and magnetic field difference. The spin-orbit interaction is found to produce
effects of roughly four orders of magnitude smaller than those due to magnetic
field difference in the pure-spin model. We estimate the spin-orbit interaction
magnitude in the DM-interaction term. Our estimate gives a smaller value than
that recently obtained by Kavokin [Phys. Rev. B 64, 075305 (2001)], who did not
include double occupancy effects. We show that a necessary and sufficient
condition for obtaining a universal set of quantum logic gates, involving only
two spins, in both pure- and pseudo-spin models is that the magnetic field
inhomogeneity and the Heisenberg interaction are both non-vanishing. We also

magnetic energy. In physical space this corresponds to a magnetic topology
where magnetic field lines are barely entangled, nevertheless current sheets
(corresponding to the original tangential discontinuities hypothesized by
Parker) are continuously formed and dissipated.
  Current sheets are the result of the nonlinear cascade that transfers energy
from the scale of convective motions ($\sim 1,000 km$) down to the dissipative
scales, where it is finally converted to heat and/or particle acceleration.
Current sheets constitute the dissipative structure of the system, and the
associated magnetic reconnection gives rise to impulsive ``bursty'' heating
events at the small scales. This picture is consistent with the slender loops
observed by state-of-the-art (E)UV and X-ray imagers which, although apparently
quiescent, shine bright in these wavelengths with little evidence of entangled
features.
  The different regimes of weak and strong MHD turbulence that develop, and
their influence on coronal heating scalings, are shown to depend on the loop
parameters, and this dependence is quantitatively characterized: weak
turbulence regimes and steeper spectra occur in {\it stronger loop fields} and
lead to {\it larger heating rates} than in weak field regions.

investigated. In particular, we study the dynamics of a scalar field in the
scalar-vector-tensor theory where the vector field is constrained to be unity
and time like. By taking a generic form of the scalar field action, a
generalized dynamical equation for the scalar-vector-tensor theory of gravity
is obtained to describe the cosmological solutions. We present a class of exact
solutions for an ordinary scalar field or phantom field corresponding to a
power law coupling vector and the Hubble parameter. As the results, we find a
constant equation of state in de Sitter space-time and power law expansion with
the quadratic of coupling vector, while a dynamic equation of state is obtained
for $n> 2$. Then, we consider the inflationary scenario based on the Lorentz
violating scalar-vector-tensor theory of gravity with general power-law
coupling vector and two typical potentials: inverse power-law and power-law
potentials. In fact, both the coupling vector and the potential models affect
the dynamics of the inflationary solutions. Finally, we use the dynamical
system formalism to study the attractor behavior of a cosmological model
containing a scalar field endowed with a quadratic coupling vector and a
chaotic potential.

devised to examine deadlocks in such modes. The model has three forms with
different complexity: sequential model, single-loop model and nested-loop

Pioneer 10/11, Galileo and Ulysses spacecrafts. The theory points out at the
limitations of the weak field approximation and proposes a drift in the proper
time of the spacecraft outside the framework of general relativity. The theory
yields a very accurate and precise value for the anomalous acceleration. In
this theory the proper time of a body is associated with the gravitational
frequency shift of the constituent fundamental particles of the body. The
frequency shift changes the energy level of the body which gets reflected in
its relativistic mass and therefore in its motion. This change in energy level
causes the time like geodesics to deviate from that of the standard theoretical
models. We introduce proper time in the line element of a metric theory
according to a fixed set of rules laid down by general relativity for
introducing deviation in the flat Minkowski metric. The frequency shift for
bodies of different composition traversing different trajectories however, is
not the same and this gets reflected in its motion as an unmodeled anomalous
effect. This association of proper time with the gravitational frequency shift
of the body requires the flat Minkowski metric to deviate in different ways for
different two body systems. The solution to Pioneer anomaly given here yields
anomalous acceleration within the limits of observational accuracy.
Gravitational redshift of light, bending of light and perihelic precession of
planets are within the permissible limits. The theory shows that Einstein's
field equations do provide some clue to the Pioneer anomaly but the solution is
not very accurate. The theory can also explain the rotation curves of the
spiral galaxies.

that standard physical dynamical models based on dynamical electron and photons

that input-current is an affine map of the flat output, its logarithm and their

J170849.0-400910 in Fall 2006 and Spring 2007 simultaneously with Swift/XRT, in
the 0.1-10 keV energy range, and with INTEGRAL/IBIS, in the 20-200 keV energy
range. Furthermore, we also reanalyzed, using the latest calibration and
software, all the publicly available INTEGRAL data since 2002, and the soft
X-ray data starting from 1999 taken using BeppoSAX, Chandra, XMM, and
Swift/XRT, in order to study the soft and hard X-ray spectral variability of
1RXS J170849.0-400910. We find a long-term variability of the hard X-ray flux,
extending the hardness-intensity correlation proposed for this source over 2
orders of magnitude in energy.

in AD 1670, the star remained visible for 2 years. A 15-arcsec nebula was
discovered in the 1980's, but the star itself has not been detected since the
eruption. We here present radio images which reveal an 0.1-arcsec radio source
with a flux of 1.5 mJy at 5 GHz. Deep Halpha images show a bipolar nebula with
a longest extension of 70 arcsec, with the previously known compact nebula at
its waist. The emission-line ratios show that the gas is shock-ionized, at
velocities >100 km/s. Dust emission yields an envelope mass of ~0.05 Msun.
Echelle spectra indicate outflow velocities up to 360 km/s. From a comparison
of images obtained in 1991 and 2004 we find evidence for expansion of the
nebula, consistent with an origin in the 1670 explosion; the measured expansion
is centred on the radio source. No optical or infrared counterpart is found at
the position of the radio source. The radio emission is interpreted as thermal
free-free emission from gas with Tel ~ 10000 K. The radio source may be due to
a remnant circumbinary disk, similar to those seen in some binary post-AGB
stars. We discuss possible classifications of this unique outburst, including
that of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass supernova, a nova eruption on a cool, low-mass
white dwarf, or a thermal pulse induced by accretion from a circumbinary disk.

centre of the Galaxy, which implies that the stars' lifetimes are less than 2
Gyr. We thus infer that the observed HVSs are massive main sequence stars,
rather than blue horizontal branch stars. The observations suggest that blue
HVSs are ejected from the Galactic Centre roughly every 15 Myr. This is
consistent with the observed population of blue stars in extremely tight orbits
round the central super-massive black hole (SMBH), the so-called S-stars, if we
assume that the HVSs are produced by the breakup of binaries. One of the stars
in such a binary is ejected at high velocities to form a HVS; the other remains
bound to the SMBH as an S-star.
  We further show that the one high-velocity system observed to be moving

that: a) Non-equilibrium computation delivers much smaller variations of the
chromospheric hydrogen ionization than for LTE. The ionization is smaller
within shocks but subsequently remains high in the cool intershock phases. As a
result, the chromospheric temperature variations are much larger than for LTE
because in non-equilibrium, hydrogen ionization is a less effective internal
energy buffer. The actual shock temperatures are therefore higher and the
intershock temperatures lower. b) The chromospheric populations of the hydrogen
n = 2 level, which governs the opacity of Halpha, are coupled to the ion
populations. They are set by the high temperature in shocks and subsequently
remain high in the cool intershock phases. c) The temperature structure and the
hydrogen level populations differ much between the chromosphere above

inspired ''brane inflation'' are investigated. Here, the inflaton field is
interpreted as the distance between two branes placed in a flux-enriched
background geometry and has a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) kinetic term. Our method
relies on an exact numerical integration of the inflationary power spectra
coupled to a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo exploration of the parameter space. This
analysis is valid for any perturbative value of the string coupling constant
and of the string length, and includes a phenomenological modelling of the
reheating era to describe the post-inflationary evolution. It is found that the
data favour a scenario where inflation stops by violation of the slow-roll
conditions well before brane annihilation, rather than by tachyonic
instability. Concerning the background geometry, it is established that log(v)
> -10 at 95% confidence level (CL), where ""v"" is the dimensionless ratio of the
five-dimensional sub-manifold at the base of the six-dimensional warped
conifold geometry to the volume of the unit five-sphere. The reheating energy
scale remains poorly constrained, Treh > 20 GeV at 95% CL, for an extreme
equation of state (wreh ~ -1/3) only. Assuming the string length is known, the
favoured values of the string coupling and of the Ramond-Ramond total
background charge appear to be correlated. Finally, the stochastic regime
(without and with volume effects) is studied using a perturbative treatment of
the Langevin equation. The validity of such an approximate scheme is discussed
and shown to be too limited for a full characterisation of the quantum effects.

We determine the complete Schr\""odinger time evolution of the subsystem of
interest for an initial pure product state of the composite system consisting
of the considered system and the bath. We find that the system relaxes into
canonical equilibrium for almost all initial pure bath states of
macroscopically well-defined energy. The temperature of the system asymptotic
thermal state is determined by the energy of the initial bath state as the
corresponding microcanonical temperature. Moreover, the time evolution of the
system is identical to the one obtained assuming that the boson bath is
initially at thermal equilibrium with this temperature. A significant part of
our approach is applicable to other baths and we identify the bath features

is on the chiral singlet Q-deformation, which is distinguished by preserving
the SO(4) Spin(4) ``Lorentz'' symmetry and the SU(2) R-symmetry. We present the
superfield and component structures of the deformed N=(1,0) supersymmetric

gravitationally unstable beyond a few hundredths of parsec and should collapse
to form stars. Indeed an accretion/star formation episode took place a few
millions years ago in the Galactic Center (GC). This raises the question of how
the disc can survive in AGN and quasars and continue to transport matter
towards the black hole. We study the accretion/star formation process, with one
aim in mind, to show that a spectrum similar to the observed AGN one can be
produced by the disc. We compute models of stationary accretion discs, both
continuous and clumpy. Continuous discs must be maintained in a state of
marginal stability for the rate of star formation to remain modest, so they
require additional heating and transport of angular momentum. Non-viscous
heating can be provided by stellar illumination, but momentum transport by
supernovae is insufficient to sustain a marginal state, except at the very
periphery of the disc. In clumpy discs it is possible to account for the
required accretion rate through interactions between clouds, but this model is
unsatisfactory as its parameters are tightly constrained without any physical
justification. Finally one must appeal to non-stationary discs with
intermittent accretion episodes like those that occurred in the GC, but such a
model is probably not applicable to luminous high redshift quasars neither to
radio-loud quasars.

cluster population has undergone at most ~30 per cent (1 sigma) infant
mortality between the age range from about (3-10) Myr, to that of approximately
(40-160) Myr. We rule out a 90 per cent cluster mortality rate per decade of
age (for the full age range up to 10^9 yr) at a > 6 sigma level. We
independently affirm this scenario based on the age distribution of the SMC

microwave flux pulses. Increasing the microwave amplitude, we study the
evolution of the Rabi frequency from the 2-level regime to the regime of
multilevel dynamics. When up to 3 levels are involved, the Rabi frequency is a
clear signature of quantum behavior. At higher excitation amplitude, classical
and quantum predictions for the Rabi frequency converge. This result is
discussed in the light of a calculation of the Wigner function. In particular,
our analysis shows that pronounced quantum interferences always appear in the

(BAT) on board Swift covers each day ~50% of the sky in the hard X-ray band
(``Survey data''). The large field of view (FOV), high sensitivity and good
angular resolution make BAT a potentially powerful all-sky hard X-ray monitor,
provided that mask--related systematics can be properly accounted for. We have
developed and tested a complete procedure entirely based on public Swift/BAT
software tools to analyse BAT Survey data, aimed at assessing the flux and
spectral variability of bright sources in the 15-150 keV energy range. Detailed
tests of the capabilities of our procedure were performed focusing, in
particular, on the reliability of spectral measurements over the entire BAT
FOV. First, we analyzed a large set of Crab observations, spread over ~7
months. Next, we studied the case of GRO J1655-40, a strongly variable source,
which experienced a 9-month long outburst, beginning on February 2005. Such an
outburst was systematically monitored with the well-calibrated PCA and HEXTE
instruments on board the RXTE mission. Thanks to the good BAT temporal coverage
of the source, we have been able to cross-check BAT light-curves with
simultaneous HEXTE ones. The Crab tests have shown that our procedure recovers
both the flux and the source spectral shape over the whole FOV of the BAT
instrument. Moreover, by cross-checking GRO J1655-40 light-curves obtained by
BAT and HEXTE, we found the spectral and flux evolution of the outburst to be
in very good agreement. Using our procedure, BAT reproduces HEXTE fluxes within
a 10-15% uncertainty with a 3sigma sensitivity of ~20 mCrab for an on-axis
source, thus establishing its capability to monitor the evolution of relatively
bright hard X-rays sources.

The local density, determined from the projected distances to the fourth and
fifth nearest neighbours, is used as an environment indicator. Considering
environments ranging from voids, i.e., log Sigma < -0.8, to the periphery of
galaxy clusters, i.e., log Sigma =~ 0.8, we find no dependence of the
relationship between galaxy stellar mass and gas-phase oxygen abundance, along
with its associated scatter, on local galaxy density. However, the star-forming
gas in galaxies shows a marginal increase in the chemical enrichment level at a
fixed stellar mass in denser environments. Compared with galaxies of similar
stellar mass in low density environments, they are enhanced by a few per cent
for massive galaxies to about 20 per cent for galaxies with stellar masses <
10^{9.5} solar masses. These results imply that the evolution of star-forming
galaxies is driven primarily by their intrinsic properties and is largely
independent of their environment over a large range of local galaxy density.

well as the squeezing and statistical properties of the emitted radiation are
investigated. It is found that the atom stays in the lower energy level more
often at steady state irrespective of the strength of the coherent radiation
and thermal fluctuations entering the cavity. Moreover, a strong external
coherent radiation results the splitting of the line of the emission spectrum,
whereas the decoherence broadens the width and significantly decreases the
height. It is also found that the emitted radiation exhibits photon
anti-bunching, super-Poissonian photon statistics and squeezing, despite the
presence of the decoherence which is expected to destroy the quantum features.
