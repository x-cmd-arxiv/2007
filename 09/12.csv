framework was outlined to treat the approximate solutions of semilinear
evolution equations; more precisely, a scheme was presented to infer from an
approximate solution the existence (local or global in time) of an exact
solution, and to estimate their distance. In the first half of the present work
the abstract framework of \cite{uno} is extended, so as to be applicable to
evolutionary PDEs whose nonlinearities contain derivatives in the space
variables. In the second half of the paper this extended framework is applied
to theincompressible Navier-Stokes equations, on a torus T^d of any dimension.
In this way a number of results are obtained in the setting of the Sobolev
spaces H^n(T^d), choosing the approximate solutions in a number of different
ways. With the simplest choices we recover local existence of the exact
solution for arbitrary data and external forces, as well as global existence
for small data and forces. With the supplementary assumption of exponential
decay in time for the forces, the same decay law is derived for the exact
solution with small (zero mean) data and forces. The interval of existence for
arbitrary data, the upper bounds on data and forces for global existence, and
all estimates on the exponential decay of the exact solution are derived in a
fully quantitative way (i.e., giving the values of all the necessary constants;
this makes a difference with most of the previous literature). Nextly, the
Galerkin approximate solutions are considered and precise, still quantitative
estimates are derived for their H^n distance from the exact solution; these are
global in time for small data and forces (with exponential time decay of the
above distance, if the forces decay similarly).

directly in four dimensions, and pointed out some subtleties with unitarity. We
attribute these subtleties to breaking time-like diffeomorphisms, and discuss
gravitational Higgs mechanism with all but time-like diffeomorphisms
spontaneously broken. The resulting background is no longer flat but exhibits
expansion, which is linear in time. For space-time dimensions D <= 10 the
background is stable and has no non-unitary propagating modes. The absence of
non-unitary modes is due to the unbroken time-like diffeomorphism invariance.
The physical states correspond to those of a massive graviton. The effective
mass squared of the graviton is positive for D < 10, and vanishes for D = 10.
For D > 10 the graviton modes become effectively tachyonic. The special value
of D=10, which coincides with the critical dimension of superstring theory,
arises in our setup completely classically.

algorithm applied to the method of Mobasher et al. This results in a reduction
of the number of variables from $(NK+1)^2$ to $(2N+K)^2$, where $N$ is the
number of antennas and $K$ is the number of constellation points in each real
dimension. Since the computational complexity of solving SDP is a polynomial
function of the number of variables, we have a significant complexity
reduction. Moreover, the proposed method offers a better performance as
compared to the best quasi-maximum likelihood decoding methods reported in the

estimates for strictly hyperbolic equations with homogeneous symbols and with
time-dependent coefficients whose derivatives are integrable. For this purpose,
the method of asymptotic integration is developed for such equations and
representation formulae for solutions are obtained. These formulae are analysed
further to obtain time decay of Lp-Lq norms of propagators for the
corresponding Cauchy problems. It turns out that the decay rates can be
expressed in terms of certain geometric indices of the limiting equation and we
carry out the thorough analysis of this relation. This provides a comprehensive
view on asymptotic properties of solutions to time-perturbations of hyperbolic
equations with constant coefficients. Moreover, we also obtain the time decay
rate of the Lp-Lq estimates for equations of these kinds, so the time
well-posedness of the corresponding nonlinear equations with additional
semilinearity can be treated by standard Strichartz estimates.

reproduce the observed X-ray emission (spectral shape, observed flux) but some
adjustment in the stellar wind parameters is required. Namely, (i) the stellar
wind velocities must be higher by a factor of 1.4 - 1.6; (ii) the mass loss
must be reduced by a factor of ~ 2. The reduction factor for the mass loss is
well within the uncertainties for this parameter in massive stars, but given
the fact that the orbital parameters (e.g., inclination angle and eccentricity)
are not well constrained for WR 147, even smaller corrections to the mass loss
might be sufficient. Only CSW models with nonequilibrium ionization and equal
(or nearly equal) electron and ion postshock temperature are successful.
Therefore, the analysis of the X-ray spectra of WR 147 provides evidence that
the CSW shocks in this object must be collisionless.

weak lensing measurements. Both the large size of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) and the existence of large spectroscopic redshift samples that are
flux-limited beyond its depth have made it the optimal data source for
developing methods to properly calibrate photometric redshifts for lensing.
Here, we focus on galaxy-galaxy lensing in a survey with spectroscopic lens
redshifts, as in the SDSS. We develop statistics that quantify the effect of
source redshift errors on the lensing calibration and on the weighting scheme,
and show how they can be used in the presence of redshift failure and sampling
variance. We then demonstrate their use with 2838 source galaxies with
spectroscopy from DEEP2 and zCOSMOS, evaluating several public photometric
redshift algorithms, in two cases including a full p(z) for each object, and
find lensing calibration biases as low as 1% (due to fortuitous cancellation of
two types of bias) or as high as 20% for methods in active use (despite the
small mean photoz bias of these algorithms). Our work demonstrates that
lensing-specific statistics must be used to reliably calibrate the lensing
signal, due to asymmetric effects of (frequently non-Gaussian) photoz errors.
We also demonstrate that large-scale structure (LSS) can strongly impact the
photoz calibration and its error estimation, due to a correlation between the
LSS and the photoz errors, and argue that at least two independent degree-scale
spectroscopic samples are needed to suppress its effects. Given the size of our
spectroscopic sample, we can reduce the galaxy-galaxy lensing calibration error
well below current SDSS statistical errors.

Transaction Logic (a generalization of the regular Horn logic programs with

implementation of Transaction Logic. The first method is based on tabling and
we modified the proof theory to table calls and answers on states (practically,
equivalent to dynamic programming). The call-answer table is indexed on the
call and a signature of the state in which the call was made. The answer
columns contain the answer unification and a signature of the state after the
call was executed. The states are signed efficiently using a technique based on
tries and counting. The second method is based on incremental evaluation and it
applies when the data oracle contains derived relations. The deletions and
insertions (executed in the transaction oracle) change the state of the
database. Using the heuristic of inertia (only a part of the state changes in
response to elementary updates), most of the time it is cheaper to compute only
the changes in the state than to recompute the entire state from scratch. The
two methods are complementary by the fact that the first method optimizes the
evaluation when a call is repeated in the same state, and the second method
optimizes the evaluation of a new state when a call-state pair is not found by
the tabling mechanism (i.e. the first method). The proof theory of Transaction
Logic with the application of tabling and incremental evaluation is sound and
complete with respect to its model theory.

(addition, multiplication, division, etc) for dealing with them are proposed
and explained. We denote them $qe$-operators, $qe$ standing for
""qualitative-enriched"" operators. These operators can be seen as a direct
extension of the classical qualitative operators ($q$-operators) proposed
recently in the Dezert-Smarandache Theory of plausible and paradoxist reasoning
(DSmT). $q$-operators are also justified in details in this paper. The
quantitative enrichment of linguistic label is a numerical supporting degree in
$[0,\infty)$, while the qualitative enrichment takes its values in a finite
ordered set of linguistic values. Quantitative enrichment is less precise than
qualitative enrichment, but it is expected more close with what human experts
can easily provide when expressing linguistic labels with supporting degrees.
Two simple examples are given to show how the fusion of qualitative-enriched

have been made to open a gap in graphene's electronic spectra, they all require
complex engineering of the graphene layer. Here we show that when graphene is
epitaxially grown on the SiC substrate, a gap of ~ 0.26 is produced. This gap
decreases as the sample thickness increases and eventually approaches zero when
the number of layers exceeds four. We propose that the origin of this gap is
the breaking of sublattice symmetry owing to the graphene-substrate

plasma in clusters of galaxies (ICM). First, we point out that Braginsky
theory, which assumes that collisions are more frequent that the system's
dynamical time scale, is inapplicable to fast, sub-viscous ICM motion. Most
importantly, the electron contribution to collisional magneto-viscosity
dominates over that of ions for short-scale Alfvenic motions. Thus, if a
turbulent cascade develops in the ICM and propagates down to scales $\leq 1$
kpc, it is damped collisionally not on ions, but on electrons. Second, in high
beta plasma of ICM, small variations of the magnetic field strength, of
relative value $\sim 1/\beta$, lead to development of anisotropic pressure
instabilities (firehose, mirror and cyclotron). Unstable wave modes may provide
additional resonant scattering of particles, effectively keeping the plasma in
a state of marginal stability. We show that in this case the dissipation rate
of a laminar, subsonic, incompressible flows scales as inverse of plasma beta
parameter. We discuss application to the problem of ICM heating.

High-quality infrared L-band (2.8-4.1 micron) spectra were also obtained for
the four LIRGs to better constrain their energy sources deeply buried in dust

examine this issue from a theoretical standpoint. We follow a large number of
galaxies over time and track each galaxy's gas and stellar mass changes to
discover what mechanism(s) dominate the evolution of the cluster galaxies. We
find that while gas is lost due to a wide variety of mechanisms, the most
common way is via a gas-only stripping event, and the amount of gas lost
correlates with the ram-pressure the galaxy is experiencing. Although this
gas-stripping occurs primarily in the central region (r < 1 Mpc), it is an
important mechanism out to the virial radius of the cluster. This is due to the
wide scatter in ram-pressure strength that a galaxy experiences at fixed
radius. We find that the timescale for complete gas removal is > 1 Gyr. In
addition, we find that galaxies in the field and in the cluster periphery (r >
2.4 Mpc) often accrete cool gas; the accretion stops between 1-2.4 Mpc,

independent sample. In this paper a method is proposed to overcome this
difficulty. The method utilizes information from rapidly equilibrating coarse
Markov chains that sample marginal distributions of the full system. This is
accomplished through exchanges between the full chain and the auxiliary coarse
chains. Results of numerical tests on the bridge sampling and
filtering/smoothing problems for a stochastic differential equation are
presented.

modified gravitation at large length scales, which provides the foundations of
a quantum gravity at very low energies. This search begins by considering a
unified model for electrodynamics and gravitation, so that the influence of the
gravitational field on the electrodynamics at very large distances leads to a
reformulation of our understanding about space-time through the elimination of
the classical idea of rest at quantum level. This leads us to a modification of
the relativistic theory by introducing the idea of a universal minimum speed
related to Planck minimum length. Such a speed, unattainable by the particles,
represents a privileged inertial reference frame associated with a universal
background field. The structure of space-time becomes extended due to such a
vacuum energy density, which leads to a cosmological anti-gravity, playing the
role of the cosmological constant. The tiny values of the vacuum energy density
and the cosmological constant are successfully obtained, being in agreement
with current observational results. We estimate the very high value of vacuum
energy density at Planck length scale. After we find the critical radius of the
universe, beyond which the accelerated expansion takes place. We show that such
a critical radius is $R_{uc}=r_g/2$, where $r_g=2GM/c^2$, being $r_g$ the
Shwarzschild radius of a sphere with a mass $M$ representing the total
attractive mass contained in our universe. And finally we obtain the radius
$R_{u0}=3r_g/4(>R_{uc})$ where we find the maximum rate of accelerated
expansion. For $R_u>R_{u0}$, the rate of acceleration decreases to zero at the

general class of vector elliptic problems that include a steady interface, to
be determined as part of the problem, that separates two subdomains. The
interface satisfies mixed Dirichlet and Neumann conditions. We consider ``2+2''
models, meaning two independent variables respectively on each subdomain. The
governing equations are taken to be vector Laplacian, to be able to make
analytic progress. The interface conditions can be classified into four large
categories, and we concentrate on the one with most physical interest. The
well-posedness criteria in this case are particularly clear. In many physical
cases, the movement of the interface in time-dependent situations can be
reduced to a normal motion proportional to the residual in one of the steady
state interface conditions (the elliptic interior problems and the other
interface conditions are satisfied at each time). If only the steady state is
of interest, one can consider using other residuals for the normal velocity.
Our analysis can be extended to give insight into choosing residual velocities
that have superior numerical properties. Hence, in the second part, we discuss
an iterative method to solve free boundary problems. The advantages of the
correctly chosen, non-physical residual velocities are demonstrated in a
numerical example, based on a simplified model of two-phase flow with phase
change in porous media.

decades old and refers to phenomena that are classically forbidden but allowed
by quantum mechanics. On the other hand the phenomenon of intramolecular
vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) has occupied a central place in the
field of chemical physics for a much longer period of time. Although the two
phenomena seem to be unrelated several studies indicate that dynamical
tunneling, in terms of its mechanism and timescales, can have important
implications for IVR. Examples include the observation of local mode doublets,
clustering of rotational energy levels, and extremely narrow vibrational
features in high resolution molecular spectra. Both the phenomena are strongly
influenced by the nature of the underlying classical phase space. This work
reviews the current state of understanding of dynamical tunneling from the

Since the incident stellar flux at any radius is sensitive to the disk
structure near that location, an unstable feedback may be present. Previous
investigations show that the disk would be stable to finite-amplitude
temperature perturbations if the vertical height of optical surface is
everywhere directly proportional to the gas scale height and if the intercepted
fraction of stellar radiation is determined from the local grazing angle. We
show that these assumptions may not be generally applicable. Instead, we
calculate the quasi-static thermal evolution of irradiated disks by directly
integrating the global optical depths to determine the optical surface and the
total emitting area-filling factor of surface dust. We show that, in disks with
modest mass accretion rates, thermal waves are spontaneously and continually
excited in the outer disk, propagate inward through the planet-forming domains,
and dissipated at small radii where viscous dissipation is dominant. This state
is quasi-periodic over several thermal timescales and its pattern does not
depend on the details of the opacity law. The viscous dissipation resulting
from higher mass accretion stabilizes this instability such that an
approximately steady state is realized throughout the disk. In passive
protostellar disks, especially transitional disks, these waves induce
significant episodic changes in SEDs, on the time scales of years to decades,
because the midplane temperatures can vary by a factor of two between the
exposed and shadowed regions. The transitory peaks and troughs in the potential
vorticity distribution may also lead to baroclinic instability and excite
turbulence in theplanet-forming regions.

a black hole of mass $M=4M_{\odot}$ and spin $a=0$--$0.9M$; such systems are
candidates for the central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) formed after the
collapse of massive rotating stellar cores and the merger of a black hole and a
neutron star. In this paper, we consider the short-term evolution of a torus
for a duration of $\approx 60$ ms, focusing on short-hard GRBs. Simulations
were performed with a plausible microphysical equation of state that takes into
account neutronization, the nuclear statistical equilibrium of a gas of free
nucleons and $\alpha$-particles, black body radiation, and a relativistic Fermi
gas (neutrinos, electrons, and positrons). Neutrino-emission processes, such as
$e^{\pm}$ capture onto free nucleons, $e^{\pm}$ pair annihilation, plasmon
decay, and nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung are taken into account as cooling
processes. Magnetic braking and the magnetorotational instability in the
accretion tori play a role in angular momentum redistribution, which causes
turbulent motion, resultant shock heating, and mass accretion onto the black
hole. The mass accretion rate is found to be $\dot M_* \sim 1$--$10
M_{\odot}$/s, and the shock heating increases the temperature to $\sim 10^{11}$
K. This results in a maximum neutrino emission rate of $L_{\nu}=$ several

We first consider isospin matter, which has served as a good testing ground for
nonperturbative QCD. We calculate the isospin chemical potential dependence of
hadronic observables such as the masses and the decay constants of the
pseudo-scalar, vector, and axial-vector mesons. We discuss a possibility of the
charged pion condensation in the matter within the bottom-up AdS/QCD model.
Then, we study the properties of the hadronic observables in strange matter. We
calculate the deconfinement temperature in strange and isospin asymmetric
matter. One of the interesting results of our study is that the critical
temperature at a fixed baryon number density increases when the strangeness
chemical potential is introduced. This suggests that if matter undergoes a
first-order transition to strange matter, the critical temperature shows a
sudden jump at the transition point.

FRI-FRII dichotomy. In this paper, we test the present theoretical and
observational models via a relativistic numerical simulation of the jets in the
radio galaxy 3C 31. We use the parameters derived from the modelling presented
by \cite{lb02a,lb02b} as input parameters for the simulation of the evolution
of the source, thus assuming that they have not varied over the lifetime of the
source. We simulate about 10 % of the total lifetime of the jets in 3C 31.
Realistic density and pressure gradients for the atmosphere are used. The
simulation includes an equation of state for a two-component relativistic gas
that allows a separate treatment of leptonic and baryonic matter. We compare
our results with the modelling of the observational data of the source. Our
results show that the bow shock evolves self-similarly at a quasi-constant
speed, with slight deceleration by the end of the simulation, in agreement with
recent X-ray observations that show the presence of bow shocks in FRI sources.
The jet expands until it becomes underpressured with respect to the ambient
medium, and then recollimates. Subsequent oscillations around pressure
equilibrium and generation of standing shocks lead to the mass loading and
disruption of the jet flow. We derive an estimate for the minimum age of the
source of $t>1. 10^8 \rm{yrs}$, which may imply continuous activity of 3C 31
since the triggering of its activity. The simulation shows that weak CSS
sources may be the young counterparts of FRIs. We conclude that the observed
properties of the jets in 3C 31 are basically recovered by the standing shock
scenario.

precisely, the next earthquake tends to have a magnitude similar but smaller

northward are assumed for the initially strong magnetic fields together with
rapid differential rotations. Aims of our study are to investigate effects of
the offset magnetic field on magnetar kicks and on supernova dynamics. Note
that we study a regime where the proto-neutron star formed after collapse has a
large magnetic field strength approaching that of a ``magnetar'', a highly
magnetized slowly rotating neutron star. As a result, equatorially-asymmetric
explosions occur with a formation of the bipolar jets. Resultant magnetar's
kick velocities are $\sim 300-1000$ km s$^{-1}$. We find that the acceleration
is mainly due to the magnetic pressure while the somewhat weaker magnetic
tension works toward the opposite direction, which is due to stronger magnetic
field in the northern hemisphere. Noted that observations of magnetar's proper
motions are very scarce, our results supply a prediction for future
observations. Namely, magnetars possibly have large kick velocities, several

of the MOdel for the Rise of GAlaxies aNd Active nuclei (MORGANA) to the
properties of K- and 850 micron-selected galaxies (such as number counts,
redshift distributions and luminosity functions) by combining MORGANA with the
spectrophotometric model GRASIL. We find that it is possible to reproduce the
K- and 850 micron-band datasets at the same time and with a standard Salpeter
IMF, and ascribe this success to our improved modeling of cooling in DM halos.
We then predict that massively star-forming discs are common at z~2 and
dominate the star-formation rate, but most of them merge with other galaxies
within ~100 Myr. Our preferred model produces an overabundance of bright
galaxies at z<1; this overabundance might be connected to the build-up of the
diffuse stellar component in galaxy clusters, as suggested by Monaco et al.
(2006), but a naive implementation of the mechanism suggested in that paper
does not produce a sufficient slow-down of the evolution of these objects.
Moreover, our model over-predicts the number of 10^{10}-10^{11} M_sun galaxies
at z~1; this is a common behavior of theoretical models as shown by Fontana et
al. (2006). These findings show that, while the overall build-up of the stellar
mass is correctly reproduced by galaxy formation models, the ``downsizing''
trend of galaxies is not fully reproduced yet. This hints to some missing
feedback mechanism in order to reproduce at the same time the formation of both
the massive and the small galaxies.

galaxy M100. This result is based on a careful 2D spectroscopic study performed
on observations made with the fibre system INTEGRAL on the WHT. The primary
evidence of the wind is the presence of blueshifted interstellar NaD absorption
lines. The velocity field of the absorbers show a clear rotation pattern but
globally blueshifted ($\sim$ -115 km/s) with respect to the systemic velocity
of the galaxy.
  The emission lines also present a blueward component arising from the ionized
gas phase of the galactic wind. The velocity field of the ionized gas wind
component shows no evidences of rotation but exhibits a pattern that can be
interpreted in terms of the projection of an outflowing cone or shell. The wind
component has [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratios of about 1.8, typical of shock ionization.
The ionized component of the wind can be identified with an expanding shell of
shocked gas, and the neutral component with disk gas entrained in the wind at
the interface of the expanding shell with the galactic ISM. The galactic wind
seems to be driven uniquely by the nuclear starburst. Our analysis indicates
that a non negligible fraction of the wind material might escape to the IGM. In
this case, if the wind detected in M100 were representative of similar
phenomena in other galaxies with low to moderate activity, the current
estimates of metal and dust content of the IGM might be drastically
underestimated.

thermal transient response of packaged and unpackaged microcoolers. A thin film
resistor on top of the device is used as the heat source and the temperature
sensor. The package and the bonding thermal resistances can be easily
identified by comparing structure functions. High-speed coplanar probes are
used to achieve a short time resolution of roughly 100ns in the transient
temperature response. This is used to separate the thermal properties of the
thin film from the substrate. The obtained thermal resistances of the buffer
layer and Silicon substrate are consistent with the theoretical calculations.
In order to estimate the superlattice thermal resistance and separate it from
the thin SiNx layer deposited underneath the thin film resistive sensor, an
order of magnitude faster thermal transient response is needed.

minimization of heating and temperature non-uniformity. Current temperature
calculation methods, such as finite element analysis and resistor networks have
considerable computation times, making them incompatible for use in routing and
placement optimization algorithms. In an effort to reduce the computation time,
we have developed a new method, deemed power blurring, for calculating
temperature distributions using a matrix convolution technique in analogy with
image blurring. For steady state analysis, power blurring was able to predict
hot spot temperatures within 1 degree C with computation times 3 orders of
magnitude faster than FEA. For transient analysis the computation times where
enhanced by a factor of 1000 for a single pulse and around 100 for multiple
frequency application, while predicting hot spot temperature within about 1
degree C. The main strength of the power blurring technique is that it exploits
the dominant heat spreading in the silicon substrate and it uses superposition
principle. With one or two finite element simulations, the temperature point
spread function for a sophisticated package can be calculated. Additional
simulations could be used to improve the accuracy of the point spread function
in different locations on the chip. In this calculation, we considered the
dominant heat transfer path through the back of the IC chip and the heat sink.
Heat transfer from the top of the chip through metallization layers and the
board is usually a small fraction of the total heat dissipation and it is
neglected in this analysis.

thick cyclotron emission. The key aspect of this model is the high temperature
of the absorbing electrons. The heat input derives from nuclei accelerated in
semi-relativistic internal shocks, like in ordinary gamma-ray bursts. Coulomb
collisions transfer part of that energy to electrons. Inverse Compton cooling
on the X-ray photons leads to electron temperatures around 100 keV. Such a high
brightness temperature for the optical-UV emission implies an emitting area
roughly equal to that of the thermal X-ray component. This suggests a model in
which the radio, optical-UV and thermal X-ray emission are closely related:
Although the optical-UV and thermal X-ray emission are two separate spectral
components, it is argued that they both come from the photosphere of a
quasi-spherical, continuous outflow, whose interaction with the circumstellar
medium gives rise to the radio emission. The properties of GRB 060218, as
measured in the co-moving frame, are similar to those of ordinary gamma-ray
burst; i.e., the main difference is the much lower value of the bulk Lorentz
factor in GRB 060218. The cyclotron absorption implies a magnetic field in
rough equipartition with the matter energy density in the outflow. Hence, the
magnetic field could have a dynamically important role, possibly with a
magnetar as the central engine.

depending on evolutionary events that take place after recombination. We
recently evaluated the effects of postrecombination events on the prediction
accuracy of recombination-detecting approaches using simulated nucleotide
sequence data. The main conclusion, supported by other studies, is that one
should not depend on a single method when searching for recombination events.
In this paper, we introduce a two-phase strategy, applying three statistical
measures to detect the occurrence of recombination events, and a Bayesian
phylogenetic approach in delineating breakpoints of such events in nucleotide
sequences. We evaluate the performance of these approaches using simulated
data, and demonstrate the applicability of this strategy to empirical data. The
two-phase strategy proves to be time-efficient when applied to large datasets,
and yields high-confidence results.

metallicity. After discussing different mass loss mechanisms and their
metallicity dependence, we present the possibility of strong mass loss at very
low metallicity. Our models at Z=1e-8 show that stars more massive than about
60 solar masses may lose a significant fraction of their initial mass in the
red supergiant phase. This mass loss is due to the surface enrichment in CNO
elements via rotational and convective mixing. Our 85 solar mass model ends its
life as a fast rotating WO type Wolf-Rayet star. Therefore the models predict
the existence of type Ic SNe and long and soft GRBs at very low metallicities.
Such strong mass loss in the red supergiant phase or the Omega-Gamma limit
could prevent the most massive stars from ending as pair-creation supernovae.
  The very low metallicity models calculated are also very interesting from the
nucleosynthesis point of view. Indeed, the wind of the massive star models can
reproduce the CNO abundances of the most metal-poor carbon-rich star known to
date, HE1327-2326. Finally, using chemical evolution models, we are able to
reproduce the evolution of CNO elements as observed in the normal extremely
metal poor stars.

is studied by direct numerical simulation of an L/H=4 aspect-ratio domain with
periodic side boundary conditions for Ra={10^5, 10^6, 10^7} and Pr=1. It is
shown that the kinetic boundary layers on the top- and bottom plate have some
features of both laminar and turbulent boundary layers. A continuous spectrum,
as well as significant forcing due to Reynolds stresses indicates undoubtedly a
turbulent character, whereas the classical integral boundary layer parameters
-- the shape factor and friction factor (the latter is shown to be dominated by
the pressure gradient) -- scale with Reynolds number more akin to laminar
boundary layers. This apparent dual behavior is caused by the large influence
of plumes impinging onto and detaching from the boundary layer. The
plume-generated Reynolds stresses have a negligible effect on the friction
factor at the Rayleigh numbers we consider, which indicates that they are
passive with respect to momentum transfer in the wall-parallel direction.
However, the effect of Reynolds stresses cannot be neglected for the thickness
of the kinetic boundary layer. Using a conceptual wind model, we find that the
friction factor C_f should scale proportional to the thermal boundary layer
thickness as C_f ~ lambda_Theta, while the kinetic boundary layer thickness
lambda_u scales inversely proportional to the thermal boundary layer thickness
and wind Reynolds number lambda_u ~ lambda_Theta^{-1} Re^{-1}. The predicted
trends for C_f and \lambda_u are in agreement with DNS results.

boosting of the base of the jet. The high energy broad-band spectrum was
obtained by combining XMM-Newton and Swift/XRT observation with INTEGRAL/IBIS

$\Gamma$=1.5, characterised by complex absorption due to two layers of material
partially covering the source and a high energy cut-off around 70-80 keV.

of $Z{\bar W}W$ can be $ 50 %$ smaller than the unitarity bounds. While the
triple gauge couplings of ${\bar Z}WW$ is 20% smaller than the unitarity
bounds, which might challenge the detection of ${\bar Z}$ via s channel at LHC
if $m_{\bar Z}> 500$ GeV.

to assess the statistical significance of the North-South asymmetry (hereafter
SSNSA) of the most usually considered time series of solar activity. First of
all, we distinguish between solar activity time series composed by integer or
non-integer and dimensionless data, or composed by non-integer and dimensional
data. For each of these cases, we discuss the most suitable statistical tests
which can be applied and highlight the difficulties to obtain valid information
about the statistical significance of solar activity time series. Our results
suggest that, apart from the need to apply the suitable statistical tests,
other effects such as the data binning, the considered units and the need, in
some tests, to consider groups of data, affect substantially the determination
of the statistical significance of the asymmetry. Our main conclusion is that
the assessment of the statistical significance of the N-S asymmetry of solar
activity is a difficult matter and that an absolute answer cannot be given,
since many different effects influence the results given by the statistical
tests. In summary, the quantitative results about the statistical significance
of the N-S asymmetry of solar activity provided by different authors, as well
as the studies about its behaviour, must be considered with care because they
depend from the chosen values of different parameters or from the considered
units.

question under the assumption that the matrices $a_n$ are an $l_1$ perturbation
of a sequence of matrices with bounded partial products. We apply our theory to
investigate the asymptotics of the approximants of continued fractions. In
particular, when a continued fraction is $l_1$ limit 1-periodic of elliptic or
loxodromic type, we show that its sequence of approximants tends to a circle in
$\hat{\mathbb{C}}$, or to a finite set of points lying on a circle. Our main
theorem on such continued fractions unifies the treatment of the loxodromic and
elliptic cases, which are convergent and divergent, respectively. When an
approximating sequence tends to a circle, we obtain statistical information
about the limiting distribution of the approximants. When the circle is the
real line, the points are shown to have a Cauchy distribution with parameters
given in terms of modifications of the original continued fraction. As an
example of the general theory, a detailed study of a $q$-continued fraction in

vortices can be attractive or repulsive. On the other hand, the mass of the
scalars in the theory is always less than that of the vector bosons; also, the
force between two vortices with the same CP^1 orientation is always attractive:
for these reasons we interpret our model as a non-Abelian generalization of
type I superconductors. We compute the effective potential in the limit of two
well separated vortices. It is a function of the distance and of the relative
colour-flavour orientation of the two vortices; in this limit we find an
effective description in terms of two interacting CP^1 sigma models. In the
limit of two coincident vortices we find two different solutions with the same
topological winding and, for generic values of the parameters, different
tensions. One of the two solutions is described by a CP^1 effective sigma
model, while the other is just an Abelian vortex without internal degrees of

metastable, while there are evidences that the other one is truly stable.

prove that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most
current models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance. In
fact, we discover that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of
neighbours (six-seven), rather than with all neighbours within a fixed metric
distance. We argue that a topological interaction is indispensable to maintain
flock's cohesion against the large density changes caused by external
perturbations, typically predation. We support this hypothesis by numerical
simulations, showing that a topological interaction grants significantly higher
cohesion of the aggregation compared to a standard metric one.
