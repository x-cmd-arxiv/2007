In this paper, we present the PD played in cells of one-dimension cellular

We show that the final state of the system is governed mainly by the number of

applies to the formation of multifluid, MHD shock waves. We model the plasma as
separate charged and neutral fluids which are coupled by ion-neutral friction.
At times much less than the ion-neutral drag time, the fluids are decoupled and
so evolve independently. At later times, the evolution is determined by the
large inertial mismatch between the charged and neutral particles. The neutral
flow continues to evolve independently; the charged flow is driven by and
slaved to the neutral flow by friction. We calculate this driven flow
analytically by considering the special but realistic case where the charged
fluid obeys linearized equations of motion. We carry out an extensive analysis
of linear, driven, MHD waves. The physics of driven MHD waves is embodied in
certain Green functions which describe wave propagation on short time scales,
ambipolar diffusion on long time scales, and transitional behavior at
intermediate times. By way of illustration, we give an approximate solution for
the formation of a multifluid shock during the collision of two identical
interstellar clouds. The collision produces forward- and reverse J shocks in
the neutral fluid and a transient in the charged fluid. The latter rapidly
evolves into a pair of magnetic precursors on the J shocks, wherein the ions
undergo force free motion and the magnetic field grows monotonically with time.
The flow appears to be self similar at the time when linear analysis ceases to
be valid.

  (http://pos.sissa.it)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  VLBI observations of relativistic outflows (jets) in galactic nuclei,
complemented with detailed studies made in other spectral domains, have become
an effective tool for investigating the physics of nuclear regions in galaxies.
High-resolution radio observations access directly the regions where the jets
are formed, and trace their evolution and interaction with the nuclear
environment. The emission properties, dynamics, and evolution of jets in AGN
are intimately connected to the characteristics of the central supermassive
black hole, accretion disk, and broad-line region (BLR) in active galaxies.
Large VLBI surveys (15GHz VLBA survey, MOJAVE) and dedicated monitoring
programmes follow systematically the evolution of several hundreds of
relativistic jets. These observations, combined with optical and X-ray studies,
yield arguably the most detailed picture of the galactic nuclei. Recent results
from studies of the nuclear regions in several active galaxies with prominent
outflows are reviewed in this contribution.

bright AGN to identify intergalactic Lya absorbers in nearby (z < 0.1) voids.
  From a parent sample of 651 Lya absorbers, we identified 61 void absorbers
located more than 1.4/h_70 Mpc from the nearest L* or brighter galaxy.
Searching for metal absorption in high-quality (S/N > 10) spectra at the
location of three diagnostic metal lines (O VI 1032, C IV 1548, Si III 1206),
we detected no metal lines in any individual absorber, or in any group of
absorbers using pixel co-addition techniques. The best limits on metal-line
absorption in voids were set using four strong Lya absorbers with N(H I) >
10^{14} cm^-2, with 3-sigma equivalent-width limits ranging from 8 mA (O VI),
7-15 mA (C IV), and 4-10 mA (Si III). Photoionization modeling yields
metallicity limits Z < 10^{-1.8+/-0.4} Z_sun, from non-detections of C IV and O
VI, some 6 times lower than those seen in Lya and OVI absorbers at z < 0.1.
Although the void Lya absorbers could be pristine material, considerably deeper
spectra are required to rule out a universal metallicity floor produced by
bursts of early star formation, with no subsequent star formation in the voids.
The most consistent conclusion derived from these low-z results, and similar
searches at z = 3-5, is that galaxy filaments have increased their mean IGM
metallicity by factors of 30-100 since z = 3.

suggested modifications to the usual picture of false vacuum decay that lead to
efficient and rapid tunneling in the landscape when certain conditions are met.
This can be due to stringy effects (e.g. tunneling via the DBI action), or by
effects arising due to the presence of multiple vacua (e.g. resonance
tunneling). In this paper we discuss both DBI tunneling and resonance
tunneling. We provide a QFT treatment of resonance tunneling using the
Schr\""odinger functional approach. We also show how DBI tunneling for
supercritical barriers can naturally lead to conditions suitable for resonance
tunneling. We argue using basic ideas from percolation theory that tunneling
can be rapid in a landscape where a typical vacuum has multiple decay channels
and discuss various cosmological implications. This rapidity vacuum decay can
happen even if there are no resonance/DBI tunneling enhancements, solely due to
the presence of a large number of decay channels. Finally, we consider various
ways of circumventing a recent no-go theorem for resonance tunneling in quantum
field theory.

separate tbH+ signal events from the Standard Model ttbar background using an
Iterative Discriminant Analysis (IDA) method. While kinematic differences exist
between the two processes whenever m(H+).ne.m(W+), the exploration of the spin
difference between the charged Higgs and the W+ gauge boson becomes crucial in
the particularly challenging case of near degeneracy of the charged Higgs boson
mass with the W+ mass. The TAUOLA package is used to decay the tau leptons
emerging from the charged Higgs and W+ boson decays taking the spin difference
properly into account. We demonstrate that, even if the individual selection
variables have limited discriminant power, the IDA method achieves a
significant separation between the expected signal and background. For both
Tevatron and LHC energies, the impact of the spin effects and H+ mass on the
separation of signal and background has been studied quantitatively. The effect
of a hard transverse momentum cut to remove QCD background has been studied and
it is found that the spin effects remain important. The separation is expressed
in purity versus efficiency curves. The study is performed for charged Higgs
boson masses between the W+ mass and near the top mass.

transport within a nanopore for rapid DNA sequencing. Specifically, we examine
the effects of the environment and detection probes on the distinguishability

electrodes helps the detection of single bases by averaging over the current
distributions of each base. We also find that although the overall magnitude of
the current may change dramatically with different detection conditions, the
intrinsic distinguishability of the bases is not significantly affected by pore
size and transverse field strength. The latter is the result of very effective
stabilization of the DNA by the transverse field induced by the probes, so long
as that field is much larger than the field that drives DNA through the pore.
In addition, the ions and water together effectively screen the charge on the
nucleotides, so that the electron states participating in the transport
properties of the latter ones resemble those of the uncharged species. Finally,
water in the environment has negligible direct influence on the transverse
electrical current.

the jet axis and axis of symmetry with the line of sight in these cases. We
performed spectropolarimetry with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) FORS1
instrument of the Type Ic SN 2006aj, associated with the XRF 060218, at V-band
maximum at 9.6 rest frame days after the detection of the XRF. Due to
observations at only 3 retarder plate angles, the data were reduced assuming
that the instrumental signature correction for the $U$ Stokes parameter was
identical to the correction measured for $Q$. We find SN 2006aj to be highly
polarized at wavelengths corresponding to the absorption minima of certain
spectral lines, particularly strong for O I 7774\AA and Fe II, observed at
4200\AA with a polarization 3%. The value of the Interstellar Polarization is
not well constrained by these observations and, considering the low
polarization observed between 6000-6500\AA, the global asymmetry of the SN is
$\lesssim 15%$. O I and Fe II lines share a polarization angle that differs
from Ca II. SN 2006aj exhibits a higher degree of line polarization than other
SNe associated with GRBs and XRFs. The polarization associated with spectral
lines implies significant asymmetries of these elements with respect to each
other and to the line of sight. This is contrary to the standard picture of SNe
associated with GRBs/XRFs, where the axis of symmetry of the SN is aligned with
the GRB jet axis and the line of sight.

  publication in Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy",,"10.1007/s10569-007-9097-2",,"astro-ph",,"  Investigations of two resonant planets orbiting a star or two resonant
satellites orbiting a planet often rely on a few resonant and secular terms in
order to obtain a representative quantitative description of the system's
dynamical evolution. We present a semianalytic model which traces the orbital
evolution of any two resonant bodies in a first- through fourth-order
eccentricity or inclination-based resonance dominated by the resonant and
secular arguments of the user's choosing. By considering the variation of
libration width with different orbital parameters, we identify regions of phase
space which give rise to different resonant ''depths,'' and propose methods to
model libration profiles. We apply the model to the GJ 876 extrasolar planetary
system, quantify the relative importance of the relevant resonant and secular
contributions, and thereby assess the goodness of the common approximation of
representing the system by just the presumably dominant terms. We highlight the
danger in using ''order'' as the metric for accuracy in the orbital solution by
revealing the unnatural libration centers produced by the second-order, but not
first-order, solution, and by demonstrating that the true orbital solution lies
somewhere ''in-between'' the third- and fourth-order solutions. We also present
formulas used to incorporate perturbations from central-body oblateness and
precession, and a protoplanetary or protosatellite thin disk with gaps, into a
resonant system. We quantify these contributions to the GJ 876 system, and
thereby highlight the conditions which must exist for multi-planet exosystems
to be significantly influenced by such factors. We find that massive enough
disks may convert resonant libration into circulation; such disk-induced
signatures may provide constraints for future studies of exoplanet systems.

Such a framework addresses both the Planck-weak and flavor hierarchy problems
of the SM. Unlike the often studied Z' cases, in this framework, there are
three neutral gauge bosons due to the underlying SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_X
gauge group in the bulk. Furthermore, couplings of these KK states to light
quarks and leptons are suppressed, whereas those to top and bottom quarks are
enhanced compared to the SM gauge couplings. Therefore, the production of light
quark and lepton states is suppressed relative to other beyond the SM
constructions, and the fermionic decays of these states are dominated by the
top and bottom quarks, which are, though, overwhelmed by KK gluons dominantly
decaying into them. However, as we emphasize in this paper, decays of these
states to longitudinal W, Z and Higgs are also enhanced similarly to the case
of top and bottom quarks. We show that the W, Z and Higgs final states can give
significant sensitivity at the LHC to 2 (3) TeV KK scale with an integrated

by trace heavy elements expelled from early supernovae. Because different modes
of nucleosynthesis (alpha-process, Fe-group) produce abundance ratios far from
solar values, these early stellar populations are likely to be influenced by O,
Si, and Fe cooling. Our models also include radiative coupling of the fine
structure lines and H2 to the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which sets a
temperature floor (70-80K at z = 25-30) that may increase the Jeans mass. The
H2 forms from catalytic effects of electrons left over from the recombination
epoch or produced during virialization. These electrons form the H^- ion (H + e
-> H- + gamma), which in turn forms H2 through associative detachment (H- + H
-> H2 + e). In virialized halos at z = 10-30, the gas densities (n = 1-100
cm^{-3}) are well below the critical densities, n_cr = 10^{5-6} cm^{-3}, at
which (O, Si, Fe) fine-structure lines reach LTE populations and produce their
most efficient cooling. Thus, Z_crit may initially exceed 0.01 Z_sun at n =
1-100 cm^{-3}, and then drop to 10^{-3.5} Z_sun at n = 10^6 cm^{-3}, where the
Jeans mass may be imprinted on the stellar mass function. Primordial clouds of

ratios. The most metal poor star in this sample, HE1424-0241, has [Fe/H] ~ -4
dex and is thus among the most metal poor stars known in the Galaxy. It has
highly anomalous abundance ratios unlike those of any other known EMP giant,
with very low Si, Ca and Ti relative to Fe, and enhanced Mn and Co, again
relative to Fe. Only (low) upper limits for C and N can be derived from the
non-detection of the CH and NH molecular bands. HE0132$-$2429, another sample
star, has excesses of N and Sc with respect to Fe. The strong outliers in
abundance ratios among the Fe-peak elements in these C-normal stars, not found
at somewhat higher metallicities, are definitely real. They suggest that at
such low metallicities we are beginning to see the anticipated and long sought
stochastic effects of individual supernova events contributing to the Fe-peak
material within a single star. A detailed comparison of the results of the
analysis procedures adopted by our 0Z project compared to those of the First
Stars VLT Large Project finds a systematic difference for [Fe/H] of ~0.3 dex,
our values always being higher.

the perfect lattice space-time codes which have the non-vanishing determinant

that in the case of naive lattice decoding, when we fix the underlying lattice,
all the codes based on full-rate lattices have the same rate-diversity
trade-off as V-BLAST. Also, we drive a lower bound on the symbol error

curve and analyse its statistical properties (structure functions). The
structure function of the intrinsic luminosity is fitted to predictions of
simple models of two physical scenarios: accretion disc instabilities and
nuclear starbursts. Although no simple model is able to accurately reproduce

temperature dependence of the coefficient of combined PEO effect is obtained.
Its anomalous behaviour at the phase transition appears due to the dielectric
permitivity anomaly. It is also demonstrated that the change in the piezooptic
coefficients at the phase transition in Rochelle salt crystals may be
satisfactorily explained as a result of linear and quadratic PEO effect induced
by spontaneous polarization.

most likely an accreting neutron star in a binary system and not a gamma-ray
burst. Our analysis shows that the BAT burst spectrum is consistent with a
thermonuclear flash (type-I X-ray burst) from the surface of an accreting
neutron star in a binary system. The X-ray binary nature is further confirmed
by the report of a detection of a faint point source at the position of the XRT
counterpart of the burst in archival XMM-Newton data approximately 6 years
before the burst and in more recent XMM-Newton data obtained at the end of
September 2006 (nearly 4 months after the burst). Since the source is very
likely not a gamma-ray burst, we rename the source Swift J1749.4-2807, based on
the Swift/BAT discovery coordinates. Using the BAT data of the type-I X-ray
burst we determined that the source is at most at a distance of 6.7+-1.3 kpc.
For a transiently accreting X-ray binary its soft X-ray behaviour is atypical:
its 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity (as measured using the Swift/XRT data) decreased
by nearly 3 orders of magnitude in about 1 day, much faster than what is
usually seen for X-ray transients. If the earlier phases of the outburst also
evolved this rapidly, then many similar systems might remain undiscovered
because the X-rays are difficult to detect and the type-I X-ray bursts might be
missed by all sky surveying instruments. This source might be part of a class
of very-fast transient low-mass X-ray binary systems of which there may be a
significant population in our Galaxy.

expected to generate masses. A natural set of expansion parameters of the
physical quantities is introduced: the coupling itself and to masses $m_q$ and
$m_g$ associated to quarks and gluons respectively. This procedure allows to
implement a dimensional transmutation effect through these new mass scales. A
general expression for the new generating functional in terms of the mass
parameters $m_q$ and $m_g$ is obtained in terms of integrals over arbitrary but
constant gluon or quark fields in each case. Further, the one loop potential,
is evaluated in more detail in the case when only the quark condensate is
