quasi-homogeneous elliptic singularity of type E_r,r=6,7,8, has a natural
Poisson structure. We show that the family of del Pezzo surfaces of the
corresponding type E_r provides a semiuniversal Poisson deformation of that
Poisson structure.
  We also construct a deformation-quantization of the coordinate ring of such a
del Pezzo surface. To this end, we first deform the polynomial algebra C[x,y,z]
to a noncommutative algebra with generators x,y,z and the following 3 relations
(where [u,v]_t = uv- t.vu):
  [x,y]_t=F_1(z),
  [y,z]_t=F_2(x),
  [z,x]_t=F_3(y).
  This gives a family of Calabi-Yau algebras A(F) parametrized by a complex
number t and a triple F=(F_1,F_2,F_3), of polynomials in one variable of
specifically chosen degrees.
  Our quantization of the coordinate ring of a del Pezzo surface is provided by
noncommutative algebras of the form A(F)/(g) where (g) stands for the ideal of
A(F) generated by a central element g, which generates the center of the
algebra A(F) if F is generic enough.

  2007",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  Previous work on relay networks has concentrated primarily on the diversity
benefits of such techniques. This paper explores the possibility of also
obtaining multiplexing gain in a relay network, while retaining diversity gain.
Specifically, consider a network in which a single source node is equipped with
one antenna and a destination is equipped with two antennas. It is shown that,
in certain scenarios, by adding a relay with two antennas and using a
successive relaying protocol, the diversity multiplexing tradeoff performance
of the network can be lower bounded by that of a 2 by 2 MIMO channel, when the
decode-and-forward protocol is applied at the relay. A distributed D-BLAST
architecture is developed, in which parallel channel coding is applied to
achieve this tradeoff. A space-time coding strategy, which can bring a maximal
multiplexing gain of more than one, is also derived for this scenario. As will
be shown, while this space-time coding strategy exploits maximal diversity for
a small multiplexing gain, the proposed successive relaying scheme offers a
significant performance advantage for higher data rate transmission. In
addition to the specific results shown here, these ideas open a new direction
for exploiting the benefits of wireless relay networks.

is a composite of a conventional crosslinked polymer gel (rubber) and a liquid
crystal. These {\em solid} liquid crystal amalgams, quite similarly to their
(conventional, fluid) liquid crystal counterparts, can spontaneously partially
break translational and/or orientational symmetries, accompanied by novel soft
Goldstone modes. As a consequence, these materials can exhibit unconventional
elasticity characterized by symmetry-enforced vanishing of some elastic moduli.
Thus, a proper description of such solids requires an essential modification of
the classical elasticity theory. In this work, we develop a {\em rotationally
invariant}, {\em nonlinear} theory of elasticity for the nematic phase of ideal
liquid crystal elastomers. We show that it is characterized by soft modes,
corresponding to a combination of long wavelength shear deformations of the
solid network and rotations of the nematic director field. We study thermal
fluctuations of these soft modes in the presence of network heterogeneities and
show that they lead to a large variety of anomalous elastic properties, such as
singular length-scale dependent shear elastic moduli, a divergent elastic
constant for splay distortion of the nematic director, long-scale
incompressibility, universal Poisson ratios and a nonlinear stress-strain
relation fo arbitrary small strains. These long-scale elastic properties are
{\em universal}, controlled by a nontrivial zero-temperature fixed point and
constitute a qualitative breakdown of the classical elasticity theory in
nematic elastomers. Thus, nematic elastomers realize a stable ``critical
phase'', characterized by universal power-law correlations, akin to a critical
point of a continuous phase transition, but extending over an entire phase.

notion of the normal trace of any divergence-measure field $\FF$ over the
boundary of an arbitrary set of finite perimeter, which ensures the validity of
the Gauss-Green theorem. To achieve this, we establish a fundamental
approximation theorem which states that, given a Radon measure $\mu$ that is
absolutely continuous with respect to $\mathcal{H}^{N-1}$ on $\rn$, any set of
finite perimeter can be approximated by a family of sets with smooth boundary
essentially from the measure-theoretic interior of the set with respect to the
measure $\|\mu\|$. With this approximation theorem, we derive the normal trace
of $\FF$ on the boundary of any set of finite perimeter, (E), as the limit of
the normal traces of $\FF$ on the boundaries of the approximate sets with
smooth boundary, so that the Gauss-Green theorem for $\FF$ holds on (E). With
these results, we analyze the Cauchy fluxes that are bounded by a Radon measure
over any oriented surface (i.e. an $(N-1)$-dimensional surface that is a part
of the boundary of a set of finite perimeter) and thereby develop a general
mathematical formulation of the physical principle of balance law through the
Cauchy flux. Finally, we apply this framework to the derivation of systems of
balance laws with measure-valued source terms from the formulation of balance
law. This framework also allows the recovery of Cauchy entropy fluxes through
the Lax entropy inequality for entropy solutions of hyperbolic conservation
laws.

following non-specific binding to the surface of a microtubule, depolymerizers
are transported to the microtubule tip(s) by diffusion or directed walk and,
then, depolymerize the microtubule from the tip(s) after accumulating there. We
develop a quantitative model to study the depolymerizing action of such a
generic motor protein, and its possible effects on the length distribution of
microtubules. We show that, when the motor protein concentration in solution
exceeds a critical value, a steady state is reached where the length
distribution is, in general, non-monotonic with a single peak. However, for
highly processive motors and large motor densities, this distribution
effectively becomes an exponential decay. Our findings suggest that such motor
proteins may be selectively used by the cell to ensure precise control of MT
lengths. The model is also used to analyze experimental observations of
motor-induced depolymerization.

barycenter through space. We apply the methods to the line-of-sight velocities
of 17 M31 satellites, to the proper motions of the 2 satellites M33 and IC 10,
and to the line-of-sight velocities of 5 galaxies near the Local Group turn
around radius, respectively. This yields 4 independent but mutually consistent
determinations of the heliocentric M31 transverse velocities in the West and
North directions, with weighted averages <v_W> = -78+/-41 km/s and <v_N> =
-38+/-34 km/s. The Galactocentric tangential velocity of M31 is 42 km/s, with
1-sigma confidence interval V_tan <= 56 km/s. The implied M31-Milky Way orbit
is bound if the total Local Group mass M exceeds 1.72^{+0.26}_{-0.25}x10^{12}
solar masses. If indeed bound, then the timing argument combined with the known
age of the Universe implies that M = 5.58^{+0.85}_{-0.72}x10^{12} solar masses.
This is on the high end of the allowed mass range suggested by cosmologically
motivated models for the individual structure and dynamics of M31 and the Milky
Way, respectively. It is therefore possible that the timing mass is an
overestimate of the true mass, especially if one takes into account recent
results from the Millennium Simulation that show that there is also a
theoretical uncertainty of 41 percent (Gaussian dispersion) in timing mass
estimates. The M31 transverse velocity implies that M33 is in a tightly bound
orbit around M31. This may have led to some tidal deformation of M33. It will
be worthwhile to search for observational evidence of this.

the case of inward migration, and study in detail its evolution and physics,
concentrating on the structure of the corotation and circumplanetary regions,
and processes for stopping migration. We also consider the dependence of the
migration behaviour on several key parameters. We perform this study using the
results of global, two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with adaptive
mesh refinement. The initial conditions are chosen to satisfy the condition for
rapid inward migration. We find that type III migration can be divided into two
regimes, fast and slow. The structure of the coorbital region, mass
accumulation rate, and migration behaviour differ between these two regimes.
All our simulations show a transition from the fast to the slow regime, ending
type III migration well before reaching the star. The stopping radius is found
to be larger for more massive planets and less massive discs. A sharp density

particle identification by the measurement of the difference in the
time-of-flight of different particles. In previous papers an apparent
discrepancy was shown between the response of the RPCs to minimum ionizing
pions and heavily ionizing protons. Using the kinematics of elastic scattering
off a hydrogen target a controlled beam of low momentum recoil protons was
directed onto the chambers. With this method the trajectory and momentum, and
hence the time-of-flight of the protons can be precisely predicted without need

metallicities that differ from the mean by more than a few tenths of a dex make
only a modest contribution to the stellar content in the outer regions of both

both galaxies. Roughly 1 - 10% of the stellar mass of NGC 5253 may have formed

extended warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) filament passing through our
local overdensity. Since AGNs reside within host galaxies that are also
expected to sit within cosmically overdense regions, similar absorption
resulting from these three components should appear at the AGN redshifts as
well. However, no such absorption is seen. The lack of strong absorption lines
is likely a result of the gas in these host galaxies and surrounding galaxy
clusters being much hotter, and hence more highly ionized, than the gas in the
Local Group+Galaxy system. We conclude that WHIM filaments produce no
measurable absorption lines at the AGN redshifts, and therefore contribute at

displays an extended radial distribution. Assuming that SO2 is the parent of
SO, the photodissociation rate of SO is measured to be 1.5 E-4 s-1 at 1 AU from

that SO is not solely produced by SO2 photolysis. From the observations of

interaction between the notion of separability and Serre's concept of
G-complete reducibility for subgroups of G. The separability hypothesis appears
in many general theorems concerning G-complete reducibility. We demonstrate
that many of these results fail without this hypothesis. On the other hand, we
prove that if G is a connected reductive group and p is very good for G, then
any subgroup of G is separable; we deduce that under these hypotheses on G, a
subgroup H of G is G-completely reducible provided the Lie algebra of G is
semisimple as an H-module.

of H-conjugacy classes. For generic p -- when certain extra hypotheses hold,
including separability -- this follows from a well-known tangent space argument

systematic errors up to 0.1 dex. In the case of silicon, carbon and oxygen
their role is very marginal (errors smaller than 0.02 dex). We also find that
the effect of the magnetic field strongly depends on its inclination with

lead to an underestimation of the real abundance, whereas more inclined ones
overestimate it. In the case of a mixture of fields with different inclinations
these effects are likely to partly cancel each other out, making the role of

term. In a key contribution to the 1925 Dreimaennerarbeit with Born and
Heisenberg, Jordan showed that one recovers both terms in a simple model of
quantized waves. So the two terms do not require separate mechanisms but arise
from a single consistent dynamical framework. Several authors have argued that
various infinities invalidate Jordan's conclusions. In this paper, we defend
Jordan's argument against such criticism. In particular, we note that the
fluctuation in a narrow frequency range, which is what Jordan calculated, is
perfectly finite. We also note, however, that Jordan's argument is incomplete.
In modern terms, Jordan calculated the quantum uncertainty in the energy of a
subsystem in an energy eigenstate of the whole system, whereas the thermal
fluctuation is the average of this quantity over an ensemble of such states.
Still, our overall conclusion is that Jordan's argument is basically sound and
that he deserves credit for resolving a major conundrum in the development of
quantum physics.

mostly used for early-type barred galaxies. Most of them host a classical
bulge. On the other hand, a variety of indirect methods, which are based on the
analysis of the distribution and dynamics of the gaseous component, has been
used to measure the bar pattern speed in late-type barred galaxies. Nearly all
the measured bars are as rapidly rotating as they can be. By comparing this

with the laser cooling of one of the radial motions of ions in these traps,
namely the magnetron motion. The application of a small radio-frequency
quadrupolar electric potential resonant with the sum of the two radial motional
frequencies has been shown to couple these motions and to lead to more
efficient laser cooling. We present an analytical model that enables us to
determine laser cooling rates in the presence of such an 'axializing' field. It
is found that this field leads to an averaging of the laser cooling rates for
the two motions and hence improves the overall laser cooling efficiency. The
model also predicts shifts in the motional frequencies due to the axializing
field that are in qualitative agreement with those measured in recent
experiments. It is possible to determine laser cooling rates experimentally by
studying the phase response of the cooled ions to a near resonant excitation
field. Using the model developed in this paper, we study the expected phase
response when an axializing field is present.

explore its application to ISI channels. In particular, we investigate the rate
tuples achievable for diversity embedded codes for scalar ISI channels through
particular coding strategies. The main result of this paper is that the
diversity multiplexing tradeoff for fading ISI channels is indeed successively
refinable. This implies that for fading single input single output (SISO) ISI
channels one can embed a high diversity code within a high rate code without
any performance loss (asymptotically). This is related to a deterministic
structural observation about the asymptotic behavior of frequency response of
channel with respect to fading strength of time domain taps.

not of the correlations that are present in the input state. This is shown by
establishing an appealing relation between the set of copy-correlated

turns out to be the convex hull of the latter. As an example of the usefulness

of particles is accelerated to high velocity near the black hole horizon. This
also seems to be the case of Sagittarius A* in the Galactic Center, where the
broad-band radiation is produced, likely via the synchrotron self-Compton
mechanism. It has been proposed that strong-field gravitational lensing
magnifies the flares. The effect of lensing is generally weak and requires a
fine-tuned geometrical arrangement, which occurs with only a low probability.
However, there are several aspects that make Sagittarius A* a promising target
to reveal strong gravity effects. Unlike type II (obscured) active galaxies,
chances are that a flare is detected at high inclination, which would be
favourable for lensing. Time delays can then significantly influence the
observed flare duration and the form of light-curve profiles. Here we discuss
an idea that the impact of lensing amplification should be considerably
enhanced when the shape of the flaring clump is appropriately elongated in the
form of a spiral wave or a narrow filament, rather than a simple (circular)
spot which we employed previously within the phenomenological `orbiting spot
model'. By parameterizing the emission region in terms of the spiral shape and
contrast, we are able to extend the spot model to more complicated sources. In
the case of spirals, we notice a possibility that more photons reach a distant
observer at the same moment because of interplay between lensing and
light-travel time. The effect is not symmetrical with respect to leading versus
trailing spirals, so in principle the source geometry can be constrained. In
spite of this, the spot model seems to provide entirely adequate framework to
study the currently available data.

a fast inner jet and a slower outer jet. As it is likely that the launching
mechanism for each component is different, their interface will develop
differential rotation, while the outer jet radius represents a second interface
where disruptions may occur. Aims: We explore the stability of stratified,
rotating, relativistic two-component jets, in turn embedded in static
interstellar medium. Methods: In a grid-adaptive relativistic hydrodynamic
simulation with the AMRVAC code, the non-linear azimuthal stability of
two-component relativistic jets is investigated. We simulate until multiple
inner jet rotations have been completed. Results: We find evidence for the
development of an extended shear flow layer between the two jet components,
resulting from the growth of a body mode in the inner jet, Kelvin-Helmholtz
surface modes at their original interface, and their nonlinear interaction.
Both wave modes are excited by acoustic waves which are reflected between the
symmetry axis and the interface of the two jet components. Their interaction
induces the growth of near stationary, counterrotating vortices at the outer
edge of the shear flow layer. The presence of a heavy external jet allows to
slow down their further development, and maintain a collimated flow. At the
outer jet boundary, small-scale Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities develop, without
disrupting the jet configuration. Conclusion: We demonstrate that the
cross-section of two-component relativistic jets, with a heavy, cold outer jet,
is non-linearly stable.

to be the sum of the individual spins plus the orbital angular momentum of a
test particle orbiting at the last stable orbit around a Kerr black hole with a
spin parameter of the final black hole. The formula we obtain is able to
reproduce with reasonable accuracy the results from available numerical
simulations, but, more importantly, it can be used to investigate what
configurations might give rise to interesting dynamics. In particular, we
discuss scenarios which might give rise to a ``flip'' in the direction of the
total angular momentum of the system. By studying the dependence of the final
spin upon the mass ratio and initial spins we find that our simple approach
suggests that it is not possible to spin-up a black hole to extremal values
through merger scenarios irrespective of the mass ratio of the objects
involved.

observations reveal a biconical outflow cavity with size $\sim$ 0.3 and 0.05 pc
for the semimajor and semiminor axis and $\sim$ 45$\arcdeg$ position angle.
These transitions trace the dense gas, which is likely the swept-up gas of the
outflow cavity, rather than the remaining natal gas or the outflow gas. The gas
is clumpy; thirty-two clumps are identified. The identified clumps are
approximately gravitationally bound and consistent with a standard isothermal
sphere density, which suggests that they are likely collapsing protostellar
cores. The gas kinematics suggests that there exists velocity gradients
implying effects from the inclination of the cavity and MWC 1080. The
kinematics of dense gas has also been affected by either outflows or stellar
winds from MWC 1080, and lower-mass clumps are possibly under stronger effects
from MWC 1080 than higher-mass clumps. In addition, low-mass cluster members
tend to be formed in the denser and more turbulent cores, compared to isolated
low-mass star-forming cores. This results from contributions of nearby forming
massive stars, such as outflows or stellar winds. Therefore, we conclude that
in clusters like the MWC 1080 system, effects from massive stars dominate the
star-forming environment in both the kinematics and dynamics of the natal cloud
and the formation of low-mass cluster members. This study provides insights
into the effects of MWC 1080 on its natal cloud, and suggests a different

keV can be accounted for by the sum of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), current
models of AGN spectra cannot explain the background spectrum beyond ~1 MeV,
because of the thermal exponential cutoff of electron energy distribution
assumed in the models. Here we construct a new spectral model by calculating
the Comptonization process including nonthermal electrons, which are expected
to exist in an AGN hot corona if it is heated by magnetic reconnections. We
show that the MeV background spectrum can nicely be explained by our model,
when coronal electrons have a nonthermal power-law component whose total energy
is a few percent of the thermal component and whose spectral index is d(ln
N_e)/d(ln E_e) ~ -4. Although the MeV gamma-ray flux from such a component in
nearby AGN spectra is below the detection limit of past observations, it could
be detected by planned future MeV detectors. We point out that the amount of
the nonthermal component and its electron index are similar to those found for
electrons accelerated by magnetic reconnections in solar flares and the Earth
magnetosphere, giving a support to the reconnection hypothesis for the origin
of hot AGN coronae.

Stackelberg equilibrium is introduced, and the existence of this equilibrium
for the investigated non-cooperative game is shown. We analyze this interaction
in more detail using a simple two-user example, where the foresighted user
determines its transmission strategy by solving as a bi-level program which
allows him to account for the myopic user's response. It is analytically shown
that a foresighted user can improve its performance, if it has the necessary
information about its competitors. Since the optimal solution of Stackelberg
equilibrium is computationally prohibitive, we propose a practical
low-complexity approach based on Lagrangian duality theory. Numerical

application is statistical arbitrage, an investment strategy that exploits

for the dark matter in the Universe. If these particles make up the dark
matter, then they can be captured by the Sun or the Earth, sink to the
respective cores, annihilate, and produce neutrinos. Thus, these neutrinos can
be a striking dark matter signature at neutrino telescopes looking towards the
Sun and/or the Earth. Here, we improve previous analyses on computing the
neutrino yields from WIMP annihilations in several respects. We include
neutrino oscillations in a full three-flavor framework as well as all effects
from neutrino interactions on the way through the Sun (absorption, energy loss,
and regeneration from tau decays). In addition, we study the effects of
non-zero values of the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ as well as the normal and
inverted neutrino mass hierarchies. Our study is performed in an event-based
setting which makes these results very useful both for theoretical analyses and
for building a neutrino telescope Monte Carlo code. All our results for the
neutrino yields, as well as our Monte Carlo code, are publicly available. We
find that the yield of muon-type neutrinos from WIMP annihilations in the Sun
is enhanced or suppressed, depending on the dominant WIMP annihilation channel.
This effect is due to an effective flavor mixing caused by neutrino
oscillations. For WIMP annihilations inside the Earth, the distance from source
to detector is too small to allow for any significant amount of oscillations at
the neutrino energies relevant for neutrino telescopes.

developed, we derive several few-mode models, analyzing both essentially
nonlinear and quasi-linear regimes of tunneling. By direct numerical
simulations, we show that two-mode models provide accurate description of the
tunneling when either initially two states are populated or tunneling occurs
between two stable states. Otherwise a two-mode model may give only useful
qualitative hints for understanding tunneling but does not reproduce many
features of the phenomenon. This reflects crucial role of the instabilities
developed due to two-body interactions resulting in non-negligible population
of the higher bands. This effect becomes even more pronounced in the case of

changing the atomic rates at different symmetric states and by changing the

consist of a bounded parameter set minimax estimator, whose parameter set is
itself estimated from measurements. Thus, one does not require any prior

linear regression problem. We demonstrate analytically that the BMEs strictly
dominate the least-squares estimator, i.e., they achieve lower mean-squared
error for any value of the parameter vector. Both Stein's estimator and its
positive-part correction can be derived within the blind minimax framework.
Furthermore, our approach can be readily extended to a wider class of

simplicity, distributed nature, and robustness in noisy and uncertain

significant waste in energy by repeatedly recirculating redundant information.
For realistic sensor network model topologies like grids and random geometric
graphs, the inefficiency of gossip schemes is related to the slow mixing times
of random walks on the communication graph. We propose and analyze an
alternative gossiping scheme that exploits geographic information. By utilizing
geographic routing combined with a simple resampling method, we demonstrate
substantial gains over previously proposed gossip protocols. For regular graphs
such as the ring or grid, our algorithm improves standard gossip by factors of
$n$ and $\sqrt{n}$ respectively. For the more challenging case of random
geometric graphs, our algorithm computes the true average to accuracy
$\epsilon$ using $O(\frac{n^{1.5}}{\sqrt{\log n}} \log \epsilon^{-1})$ radio
transmissions, which yields a $\sqrt{\frac{n}{\log n}}$ factor improvement over
standard gossip algorithms. We illustrate these theoretical results with

first uses individual astrophysical objects which have some property that
allows their intrinsic luminosity or size to be determined, or allows the
determination of their distance by geometric means. The second category
comprises the use of all-sky cosmic microwave background, or correlations
between large samples of galaxies, to determine information about the geometry
of the Universe and hence the Hubble constant, typically in a combination with
other cosmological parameters. Many, but not all, object-based measurements
give $H_0$ values of around 72-74km/s/Mpc , with typical errors of 2-3km/s/Mpc.
This is in mild discrepancy with CMB-based measurements, in particular those
from the Planck satellite, which give values of 67-68km/s/Mpc and typical
errors of 1-2km/s/Mpc. The size of the remaining systematics indicate that
accuracy rather than precision is the remaining problem in a good determination
of the Hubble constant. Whether a discrepancy exists, and whether new physics
is needed to resolve it, depends on details of the systematics of the
object-based methods, and also on the assumptions about other cosmological
parameters and which datasets are combined in the case of the all-sky methods.

birefringence and dichroism of electromagnetic waves travelling in a constant
and homogeneous magnetic field. There have been theoretical predictions in
favour of such phenomena when appropriate axion-electromagnetic coupling is
assumed. Origin of such a coupling can be traced in a low energy string action
from the requirement of quantum consistency. The resulting couplings in such
models are an artifact of the compactification of the extra dimensions present
inevitably in a string scenario. The moduli parameters which encode the compact
manifold therefore play a crucial role in determining the axion-photon
coupling. In this work we examine the possible bounds on the value of compact
modulus that emerge from the experimental limits on the coupling obtained from
the PVLAS data. In particular we focus into the Randall-Sundrum (RS) type of
warped geometry model whose modulus parameter is already restricted from the
requirement of the resolution of gauge hierarchy problem in connection with the
mass of the Higgs. We explore the bound on the modulus for a wide range of the
axion mass for both the birefringence and the dichroism data in PVLAS. We show
that the proposed value of the modulus in the RS scenario can only be
accommodated for axion mass $\gsim$ 0.3 eV.

probability in the limit of sufficiently fast noise, for arbitrary exponent
$\nu$. The longitudinal coherence after transition depends strongly on $\nu$,
and there exists a critical $\nu_c$ with qualitative difference between $\nu<
\nu_c$ and $\nu > \nu_c$. When $\nu<\nu_c$ the end state is always fully
incoherent with equal population of both quantum levels, even for arbitrarily
weak noise. For $\nu>\nu_c$ the system keeps some coherence depending on the
strength of the noise, and in the limit of weak noise no transition takes
place. For fast noise $\nu_c=1/2$, while for slow noise $\nu_c<1/2$ and it
depends on $\gamma$. We also discuss transverse coherence, which is relevant
when the qubit has a nonzero minimum energy gap. The qualitative dependency on
$\nu$ is the same for transverse as for longitudinal coherence. The state after
transition does in general depend on $\gamma$. For fixed $v$, increasing
$\gamma$ decreases the final state coherence when $\nu<1$ and increase the
final state coherence when $\nu>1$. Only the conventional linear driving is

nonequilibrium stationary state. The resistance and defect-fraction are
calculated as a function of time by Monte Carlo simulations using a resistor

charge relaxation resistance of a mesoscopic capacitor in the linear low
frequency regime. The capacitor consists of a cavity which is via a quantum
point contact connected to an electron reservoir and Coulomb coupled to a gate.
The capacitor is in a perpendicular high magnetic field such that only one
(spin polarized) edge state is (partially) transmitted through the contact. In
the coherent limit the charge relaxation resistance for a single channel
contact is independent of the transmission probability of the contact and given
by half a resistance quantum. The loss of coherence in the conductor is modeled
by attaching to it a fictitious probe, which draws no net current. In the
incoherent limit one could expect a charge relaxation resistance that is
inversely proportional to the transmission probability of the quantum point
contact. However, such a two terminal result requires that scattering is
between two electron reservoirs which provide full inelastic relaxation. We
find that dephasing of a single edge state in the cavity is not sufficient to
generate an interface resistance. As a consequence the charge relaxation
resistance is given by the sum of one constant interface resistance and the
(original) Landauer resistance. The same result is obtained in the high
temperature regime due to energy averaging over many occupied states in the
cavity. Only for a large number of open dephasing channels, describing
spatially homogenous dephasing in the cavity, do we recover the two terminal
resistance, which is inversely proportional to the transmission probability of
the QPC. We compare different dephasing models and discuss the relation of our
results to a recent experiment.

continuum emission at 1.3 mm also extends beyond the starburst ring, and is
dominated by thermal emission from dust. If it traces the same dust emitting in

characteristics of early-type galaxies, such as: the presence of dynamically
decoupled cores, orbital structure and anisotropy, stellar populations and dark
matter content. I here report on the observed link between this baryonic

to volume ratio becomes large. In such setups the surface roughness is not any
longer small compared to the length scale of the system and the wetting
properties of the wall have an important influence on the flow. However, the
knowledge about the interplay of surface roughness and hydrophobic
fluid-surface interaction is still very limited because these properties cannot
be decoupled easily in experiments.
  We investigate the problem by means of lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulations of
rough microchannels with a tunable fluid-wall interaction. We introduce an
``effective no-slip plane'' at an intermediate position between peaks and
valleys of the surface and observe how the position of the wall may change due
to surface roughness and hydrophobic interactions.
  We find that the position of the effective wall, in the case of a Gaussian
distributed roughness depends linearly on the width of the distribution.
Further we are able to show that roughness creates a non-linear effect on the
slip length for hydrophobic boundaries.

repeatedly, the state switches from a superconductive to a resistive one, doing
so at random current values below the equilibrium critical current. Can a
single phase-slip event somewhere along the wire--during which the
order-parameter fluctuates to zero--induce such switching, via the local
heating it causes? We address this and related issues by constructing a
stochastic model for the time-evolution of the temperature in a nanowire whose
ends are maintained at a fixed temperature. The model indicates that although,
in general, several phase-slip events are necessary to induce switching, there
is indeed a temperature- and current-range for which a single event is
sufficient. It also indicates that the statistical distribution of switching
currents initially broadens, as the temperature is reduced. Only at lower
temperatures does this distribution show the narrowing with cooling naively
expected for resistive fluctuations consisting of phase slips that are
thermally activated.

landscape as such, and thus it is ideally independent from the actual
heuristics used to search the space. However, a second goal is to understand
the features a good search technique for this particular problem space should
possess. We statistically quantify in various ways the degree of difficulty of
searching this landscape. Due to neutrality, investigations based on sampling
techniques on the whole landscape are difficult to conduct. So, we go exploring
the landscape from the top. Although it has been proved that no CA can perform
the task perfectly, several efficient CAs for this task have been found.
Exploiting similarities between these CAs and symmetries in the landscape, we
define the Olympus landscape which is regarded as the ''heavenly home'' of the
best local optima known (blok). Then we measure several properties of this
subspace. Although it is easier to find relevant CAs in this subspace than in
the overall landscape, there are structural reasons that prevent a searcher
from finding overfitted CAs in the Olympus. Finally, we study dynamics and
performance of genetic algorithms on the Olympus in order to confirm our
analysis and to find efficient CAs for the Majority problem with low
computational cost.
