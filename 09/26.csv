  study","2 figures",,,,"stat.ME",,"  We describe here a new method to estimate copula measure. From N observations
of two variables X and Y, we draw a huge number m of subsamples (size n<N), and
we compute the joint ranks in these subsamples. Then, for each bivariate rank
(p,q) (0<p,q<n+1), we count the number of subsamples such that there exist an
observation of the subsample with bivariate rank (p,q). This counting gives an
estimate of the density of the copula. The simulation study shows that this
method seems to gives a better than the usual kernel method. The main advantage
of this new method is then we do not need to choose and justify the kernel. In
exchange, we have to choose a subsample size: this is in fact a problem very
similar to the bandwidth choice. We have then reduced the overall difficulty.

of equations in theoretical physics. Such equations are ubiquitous in string
field theory and have recently attracted considerable interest also from
cosmologists. Though these equations have been studied in the classical
mathematical literature, it appears that the physics community is largely
unaware of the relevant formalism. Of particular importance is the fate of the
initial value problem. Under what circumstances do infinite order differential
equations possess a well-defined initial value problem and how many initial
data are required? In this paper we study the initial value problem for
infinite order differential equations in the mathematical framework of the
formal operator calculus, with analytic initial data. This formalism allows us
to handle simultaneously a wide array of different nonlocal equations within a
single framework and also admits a transparent physical interpretation. We show
that differential equations of infinite order do not generically admit
infinitely many initial data. Rather, each pole of the propagator contributes
two initial data to the final solution. Though it is possible to find
differential equations of infinite order which admit well-defined initial value
problem with only two initial data, neither the dynamical equations of p-adic
string theory nor string field theory seem to belong to this class. However,
both theories can be rendered ghost-free by suitable definition of the action
of the formal pseudo-differential operator. This prescription restricts the
theory to frequencies within some contour in the complex plane and hence may be
thought of as a sort of ultra-violet cut-off.

the flipping of water absorption features into emission features from the near-
to the mid-infrared and we see evidence of such a water emission feature in the
recent HD 209458b IRAC data of Knutson et al. In addition, an upper-atmosphere
optical absorber may help explain both the weaker-than-expected Na D feature
seen in transit and the fact that the transit radius at 24 $\mu$m is smaller
than the corresponding radius in the optical. Moreover, it may be a factor in

loci, we compute the cut loci (globally) and we give the expression of the

prove that the metric given on $SU(2)$ projects on the so called lens spaces
$L(p,q)$. Also for lens spaces, we compute the cut loci (globally).
  For $SU(2)$ the cut locus is a maximal circle without one point. In all other
cases the cut locus is a stratified set. To our knowledge, this is the first
explicit computation of the whole cut locus in sub-Riemannian geometry, except

Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) circuits. It consists of three nanoscale
metal ""dots"" connected in series by tunnel junctions; charging of the dots is
controlled by three electrostatic gates. One very important feature of a
single-electron latch is its ability to store (""latch"") information represented
by the location of a single electron within the three dots. To obtain latching,
the undesired leakage of charge during the retention time must be suppressed.
Previously, to achieve this goal, multiple tunnel junctions were used to
connect the three dots. However, this method of charge leakage suppression
requires an additional compensation of the background charges affecting each
parasitic dot in the array of junctions. We report a single-electron latch
where a granular metal film is used to fabricate the middle dot in the latch
which concurrently acts as a charge leakage suppressor. This latch has no
parasitic dots, therefore the background charge compensation procedure is
greatly simplified. We discuss the origins of charge leakage suppression and
possible applications of granular metal dots for various single-electron

that a more precise matching of the shape of the Cu+Cu and Au+Au pseudorapidity

parameters (resonance frequencies, modal shapes and damping), which are
estimated using ambient vibrations surveys. Sixty buildings of various types
were recorded. The building integrity is then calculated considering an
accelerogram scenario provided by seismologists as input and considering an
integrity threshold based on the FEMA inter-storey drift limits. Even if the
level of damage remains unknown, we conclude that masonry buildings undergo
more damage (70% of buildings damaged) than RC buildings. Finally, extracting
modal parameters from ambient vibration recordings allows us to define, for

nonnegative curvature at smooth points and on nondegenerate corners. This
amounts to the strict versus nonstrict quasi-concavity of defining polynomials

contain the signature of the first supernovae, and thus allows us to probe the
first stars that formed in the universe. We construct a theoretical model for
the early chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way, aiming in particular at
the contribution from pair-instability supernovae (PISNe). These are a natural
consequence of current theoretical models for primordial star formation at the
highest masses. However, no metal-poor star displaying the distinct PISN
signature has yet been observed. We here argue that this apparent absence of
any PISN signature is due to an observational selection effect. Whereas most
surveys traditionally focus on the most metal-poor stars, we predict that early
PISN enrichment tends to `overshoot', reaching enrichment levels of [Ca/H] ~=
-2.5 that would be missed by current searches. We utilize existing
observational data to place constraints on the primordial initial mass function
(IMF). The number fraction of PISNe in the primordial stellar population is
estimated to be <0.07, or ~< 40% by mass, assuming that metal-free stars have
masses in excess of 10 M_sun. We further predict, based on theoretical
estimates for the relative number of PISNe, that the expected fraction of
second generation stars below [Ca/H]=-2 with a dominant (i.e., >90%)
contribution from PISNe is merely ~1e-4 - 5e-4. The corresponding fraction of
stars formed from gas exclusively enriched by PISNe is a factor of ~4 smaller.
With the advent of next generation telescopes and new, deeper surveys, we
should be able to test these predictions.

designed to explore the formation and properties of dark matter halos with
masses close to the damping scale of the primordial power spectrum of density
fluctuations. We further investigate the effect that the addition of a random
component, v_rms, into the particle velocity field has on the structure of
halos. We adopted as a fiducial model the Lambda Warm Dark Matter cosmology
with a non-thermal sterile neutrino mass of 0.5 keV. The filtering mass
corresponds then to M_f = 2.6x10^12 M_sun/h. Halos of masses close to M_f were
simulated with several million of particles. The results show that, on one
hand, the inner density slope of these halos (at radii <~0.02 the virial radius
Rvir) is systematically steeper than the one corresponding to the NFW fit or to
the CDM counterpart. On the other hand, the overall density profile (radii
larger than 0.02Rvir) is less curved and less concentrated than the NFW fit,
with an outer slope shallower than -3. For simulations with v_rms, the inner
halo density profiles flatten significantly at radii smaller than 2-3 kpc/h
(<~0.010-0.015Rvir). A constant density core is not detected in our
simulations, with the exception of one halo for which the flat core radius is
~1 kpc/h. Nevertheless, if ``cored'' density profiles are used to fit the halo
profiles, the inferred core radii are ~0.1-0.8 kpc/h, in rough agreement with
theoretical predictions based on phase-space constrains, and on dynamical
models of warm gravitational collapse. A reduction of v_rms by a factor of 3
produces a modest decrease in core radii, less than a factor of 1.5. We discuss
the extension of our results into several contexts, for example, to the
structure of the cold DM micro-halos at the damping scale of this model.

Correspondingly, we show that baryonic effects can significantly bias dark
energy parameter measurements. Eliminating such biases by neglecting
information in multipoles beyond several hundred leads to weaker parameter
constraints by a factor of approximately 2 to 3 compared with using information
out to multipoles of several thousand. Fortunately, the same numerical studies
that explore the influence of baryons indicate that they primarily affect power
spectra by altering halo structure through the relation between halo mass and
mean effective halo concentration. We explore the ability of future weak
lensing surveys to constrain both the internal structures of halos and the
properties of the dark energy simultaneously as a first step toward self
calibrating for the physics of baryons. This greatly reduces parameter biases
and no parameter constraint is degraded by more than 40% in the case of LSST or
30% in the cases of SNAP or DES. Modest prior knowledge of the halo
concentration relation greatly improves even these forecasts. Additionally, we
find that these surveys can constrain effective halo concentrations near
m~10^14 Msun/h and z~0.2 to better than 10% with shear power spectra alone.
These results suggest that inferring dark energy parameters with measurements
of shear power spectra can be made robust to baryonic effects and may
simultaneously be competitive with other methods to inform models of galaxy
formation. (Abridged)

similarly steep power-law indices dN/dz N^-beta with beta_OVI beta_NV 2 while

beta_HI<beta_CIV<beta_OVI. The ions CIII, SiIII, and SiIV are well correlated
with HI and show patterns typical of photoionization. Adjacent ion stages of
the same element (CIII/IV and SiIII/IV) provide useful constraints on the
photoionization parameter, logU=-1.5+-0.5. Comparison of SiIV and CIV with

increasing IGM metallicity at recent epochs.

  Rao","Energy Efficient Estimation of Gaussian Sources Over Inhomogeneous
  Gaussian MAC Channels",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  It has been shown lately the optimality of uncoded transmission in estimating
Gaussian sources over homogeneous/symmetric Gaussian multiple access channels
(MAC) using multiple sensors. It remains, however, unclear whether it still
holds for any arbitrary networks and/or with high channel signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and high signal-to-measurement-noise ratio (SMNR). In this paper, we
first provide a joint source and channel coding approach in estimating Gaussian
sources over Gaussian MAC channels, as well as its sufficient and necessary
condition in restoring Gaussian sources with a prescribed distortion value. An
interesting relationship between our proposed joint approach with a more
straightforward separate source and channel coding scheme is then established.
We then formulate constrained power minimization problems and transform them to
relaxed convex geometric programming problems, whose numerical results exhibit
that either separate or uncoded scheme becomes dominant over a linear topology
network. In addition, we prove that the optimal decoding order to minimize the
total transmission powers for both source and channel coding parts is solely
subject to the ranking of MAC channel qualities, and has nothing to do with the
ranking of measurement qualities. Finally, asymptotic results for homogeneous
networks are obtained which not only confirm the existing optimality of the
uncoded approach, but also show that the asymptotic SNR exponents of these
three approaches are all the same. Moreover, the proposed joint approach share
the same asymptotic ratio with respect to high SNR and high SMNR as the uncoded
scheme.

granular media reveal simple power law scalings along with complex dynamics
which bear the signatures of both fluid and solid behavior. The penetration
depth scales linearly with impact velocity while the collision duration is
constant for sufficiently large impact velocity. Both quantities exhibit power
law dependence on sphere diameter and density, and gravitational acceleration.
The acceleration during impact is characterized by two jumps: a rapid, velocity
dependent increase upon initial contact and a similarly sharp, depth dependent
decrease as the impacting object comes to rest. Examining the measured forces
on the sphere in the vicinity of these features leads to a new experimentally
based granular force model for collision. We discuss our findings in the
context of recently proposed phenomenological models that capture qualitative
dynamical features of impact but fail both quantitatively and in their
inability to capture significant acceleration fluctuations that occur during
penetration and which depend on the impacted material.

rise to two outflow axes with slightly different orientations. We find that the

detection of [OI] 6300/63 in HH119 B and Hbeta in HH119 A and B and find their

faster than expected from linear expansion with distance from the outflow
source. Using planar shock models we find shock velocities of ~60 km/s (A) and
~35 km/s (B and C). This agrees with A being of higher excitation than B and C.

arise from the [OII] 3728 line and the blue continuum. New SPITZER observations

enough, a split link or unknot cannot be obtained by boring a split link.
Particular attention is paid to rational tangle replacement. If a knot is

appealing. In this paper we review and extend methods for optimal image
formation of colloidal samples, which is vital for particle coordinates of the
highest accuracy, and for extracting the most reliable coordinates from these
images. We discuss in depth the accuracy of the coordinates, which is sensitive
to the details of the colloidal system and the imaging system. Moreover, this
accuracy can vary between particles, particularly in dense systems. We
introduce a previously unreported error estimate and use it to develop an
iterative method for finding particle coordinates. This individual-particle
accuracy assessment also allows comparison between particle locations obtained
from different experiments. Though aimed primarily at confocal microscopy
studies of colloidal systems, the methods outlined here should transfer readily
to many other feature extraction problems, especially where features may

principles of electroweak quark-lepton symmetry and weak topological-charge

accidental, are indicative of charge structures. A mixing in quarks and leptons
of underlying integer local charges with integer weak topological charges
associated with an additive group Z_3, fixed by the anomaly cancellation
requirement, is discussed. It is found that the electroweak difference between
topological quarks and leptons is the nonequivalence between the topological
vacua of their weak field configurations, produced by a four-instanton which
carries the topological charge, induces the universal fractional piece of
charge distinguishing quarks from leptons, and breaks the underlying symmetry.
The constituent quarks of the standard model appear as coming from topological
quarks, via the weak four-instanton event. Dual transitions occur for leptons.
It is shown that several other fundamental problems left open in the standard
electroweak model with Dirac neutrinos are solved: the one-to-one
correspondence between quark and lepton flavors, the existence of three
generations, the conservation and ungauging of B-L, the electric charge
quantization, and the confinement of fractional electric charges.

critical size of flakes, approximately 35 micrometer, above which the
self-retracting motion does not occur under the operation. This helps to
explain the fact that the self-retracting motion of graphite has not been
reported, because samples of natural graphite are typical larger than this
critical size. In fact, reports of this phenomenon have not been found in the
literature for single crystals of any kinds. A model that includes the static
and dynamic shear strengths, the van der Waals interaction force, and the edge
dangling bond interaction effect, was used to explain the observed phenomenon.
These findings may conduce to create nano-electromechanical systems with a wide
range of mechanical operating frequency from mega to giga hertzs.

isolated under all admissible iterations. Finally, we apply these results to
show that for a quasi-arithmetic sequence of admissible iterations of a

June 2007). These include HD 209458b, HD 189733b, TrES-1, HD 149026b, HD
179949b, and $\upsilon$ And b. By comparing models with data, we find that a
number of EGP atmospheres experience thermal inversions and have stratospheres.
This is particularly true for HD 209458b, HD 149026b, and $\upsilon$ And b.
This finding translates into qualitative changes in the planet/star contrast
ratios at secondary eclipse and in close-in EGP orbital light curves. Moreover,
the presence of atmospheric water in abundance is fully consistent with all the
{\it Spitzer} data for the measured planets. For planets with stratospheres,
water absorption features invert into emission features and mid-infrared fluxes
can be enhanced by a factor of two. In addition, the character of near-infrared
planetary spectra can be radically altered. We derive a correlation between the
importance of such stratospheres and the stellar flux on the planet, suggesting
that close-in EGPs bifurcate into two groups: those with and without
stratospheres. From the finding that TrES-1 shows no signs of a stratosphere,
while HD 209458b does, we estimate the magnitude of this stellar flux
breakpoint. We find that the heat redistribution parameter, P$_n$, for the
family of close-in EGPs assumes values from $\sim$0.1 to $\sim$0.4. This paper
provides a broad theoretical context for the future direct characterization of
EGPs in tight orbits around their illuminating stars.

the largest value for maximum mass for the non-rotating neutron star is
$2.1M_\odot$. The radius for the neutron star with canonical mass is $12.8 -

disorder, q (probability that a given site of the lattice is not available to

delocalized states that depends on energy and amount of disorder present in the
system. For energies away from the band center (E = 0), delocalized states
appear only at low disorder (q < 15%). The transmission near the band center is
generally very small for any amount of disorder and therefore makes it
difficult to locate the transition to delocalized states if any, but our study
does indicate a behavior that is weaker than power-law localization. Apart from
this localization-delocalization transition, we also find the existence of two
different kinds of localization regimes depending on energy and amount of

sufficiently high disorder. As the disorder decreases, states first show
power-law localization before showing a delocalized behavior.

experimental data. In this study, we recorded ambient vibrations in 3 buildings
in Grenoble selected because of their vertical structural homogeneity. First, a
set of recordings was done using a 18 channels digital acquisition system
(CityShark) connected to six 3C Lennartz 5s sensors. We used the Frequency
Domain Decomposition (FDD) technique to extract the modal parameters of these
buildings. Second, it is shown in the following that the experimental
quasi-elastic behaviour of such structure can be reduced to the behaviour of a
vertical continuous Timoshenko beam. A parametric study of this beam shows that
a bijective relation exists between the beam parameters and its
eigenfrequencies distribution. Consequently, the Timoshenko beam parameters can
be estimated from the experimental sequence of eigenfrequencies. Having the
beam parameters calibrated by the in situ data, the reliability of the
modelling is checked by complementary comparisons. For this purpose, the mode
shapes and eigenfrequencies of higher modes are calculated and compared to the
experimental data. A good agreement is also obtained. In addition, the beam
model integrates in a very synthetic way the essential parameters of the
dynamic behaviour.

  the ONC","9 pages, 7 figures. accepted by A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20078458",,"astro-ph",,"  Observations indicate that in young stellar clusters the binary fraction for
massive stars is higher than for solar mass stars. For the Orion Nebula Cluster
(ONC) there is a binary frequency of ~ 50% for solar-mass stars compared to
70-100% for the massive O- and B-stars. We explore the reasons for this
discrepancy and come up with two possible answers: a) a primordially higher
binarity of massive stars could be inherent to the star formation process or b)
the primordial binary rate might be the same for solar-mass and massive stars,
but the higher capture cross section of the massive stars possibly leads to the
formation of additional massive binaries in the early cluster development. Here
we investigate the likelihood of the latter using the ONC as an example. N-body
simulations are performed to track the capture events in an ONC-like cluster.
We find that whereas low-mass stars rarely form bound systems through capture,
the dynamics of the massive stars - especially in the first 0.5 Myrs - is
dominated by a rapid succession of ``transient binary or multiple systems''. In
observations the transient nature of these systems would not be apparent, so
that they would be rated as binaries. At 1-2 Myrs, the supposed age of the ONC,
the ``transient'' massive systems become increasingly stable, lasting on
average several 10^6 yrs. Despite the ONC being so young, the observed binary
frequency for massive stars -- unlike that of solar-mass stars -- is not
identical to the primordial binary frequency but is increased by at least
10-15% through dynamical interaction processes. This value might be increased
to at least 20-25% by taking disc effects into account. The primordial binary
frequency could well be the same for massive and solar mass stars because the
observed difference can be explained by capture processes alone.

dwarfs seem promising for reproducing Type Ia supernovae, the transition of the
flame propagation mode from subsonic deflagration to supersonic detonation
remains hypothetical. A potential instant for this transition to occur is the
onset of the distributed burning regime, i.e. the moment when turbulence first
affects the internal flame structure. Some studies of the burning microphysics
indicate that a deflagration-to-detonation transition may be possible here,
provided the turbulent intensities are strong enough. Consequently, the
magnitude of turbulent velocity fluctuations generated by the deflagration
flame is analyzed at the onset of the distributed burning regime in several
three-dimensional simulations of deflagrations in thermonuclear supernovae. It
is shown that the corresponding probability density functions fall off towards
high turbulent velocity fluctuations much more slowly than a Gaussian
distribution. Thus, values claimed to be necessary for triggering a detonation
are likely to be found in sufficiently large patches of the flame. Although the
microphysical evolution of the burning is not followed and a successful
deflagration-to-detonation transition cannot be guaranteed from simulations
presented here, the results still indicate that such events may be possible in
Type Ia supernova explosions.

quantization itself are a manifestation of macroscopic quantum phenomena with
far reaching implications. They provide the key to the understanding of many
fundamental properties of superconductors and are the basis for most bulk and
device applications of these materials. In superconducting rings the electrical
current has been known to periodically respond to a magnetic flux with a
periodicity of $\bm{h/2e}$. Here, the ratio of Planck's constant and the
elementary charge defines the magnetic flux quantum $\bm{h/e}$. The well-known
$\bm{h/2e}$ periodicity is viewed to be a hallmark for electronic pairing in
superconductors and is considered evidence for the existence of Cooper pairs.
Here we show that in contrast to this long-term belief, rings of many
superconductor bear an $\bm{h/e}$ periodicity. These superconductors include
the high-$\bm{T_c}$ cuprates, Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, the heavy-fermion superconductors,
as well as all other unconventional superconductors with nodes in the energy
gap functions, and s-wave superconductors with small gaps or states in the gap.
As we show, the 50-year-old Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer theory of
superconductivity implies that for multiply connected paths of such
superconductors the ground-state energies and consequently also the
supercurrents are generically $\bm{h/e}$ periodic. The origin of this
periodicity is a magnetic-field driven reconstruction of the condensate and a
concomitant Doppler-shifted energy spectrum. The robust, flux induced
reconstruction of the condensate will be an important aspect to understand the
magnetic properties of mesoscopic unconventional superconductors.

splitting at 5K amounts to $\sim$ 2.3 meV, about an order of magnitude less
than found previously, but in good agreement with the splitting extrapolated
from the related ErGa$_3$ system.
  Our analysis yields a $\Gamma_{2}$ singlet as the crystal field ground state
followed closely by a (nonmagnetic) $\Gamma_{1}$ singlet at 0.009 meV. The next
excited states are a $\Gamma_{5}^{(2)}$ triplet at $\sim$0.5 meV, which is
almost degenerate to a $\Gamma_{4}$ doublet. This level scheme is adverse to
previous findings. Subsequent analysis of the magnetisation along several
crystallographic directions and the temperature dependant susceptibility as
well as of the magnetic contribution to the specific heat are consistent with
our new crystal field parameters. Implications for the antiferroquadrupolar and
the antiferromagnetic transition are discussed.

microscopically derive the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equations for

Cooper pairing is assumed to occur between electrons only in the same spin
split band and pair scattering is allowed to occur between two spin split
bands. The GL theory of such a system predicts two transition temperatures, the
higher of which is the conventional critical temperature $T_c$ while the lower
one $T^*$ corresponds to the cross-over from a mixed singlet-triplet phase at
lower temperatures to only spin-singlet or spin-triplet (depending on the sign
of the interband scattering potential) phase at higher temperatures. As a
consequence, $n_s (T)$ shows a kink at this cross-over temperature. We
attribute the temperature at which sudden change of slope occurs in the
observed $n_s (T)$ to the temperature $T^*$. This may also be associated with
the observed kink in the penetration depth data of CePt$_3$Si. We have also

s^{-1} (0.3-2.0 keV), placing this object among the most luminous such ``hot
bubble'' X-ray sources yet detected within PNe. With the X-ray detection of NGC
5315, objects with WR-type central stars now constitute a clear majority of
known examples of diffuse X-ray sources among PNe; all such ``hot bubble'' PN
X-ray sources display well-defined, quasi-continuous optical rims. We therefore
assert that X-ray-luminous hot bubbles are characteristic of young PNe with
large central star wind kinetic energies and closed bubble morphologies.
However, the evidence at hand also suggests that processes such as wind and
bubble temporal evolution, as well as heat conduction and/or mixing of hot
bubble and nebular gas, ultimately govern the luminosity and temperature of
superheated plasma within PNe.

stars on the dynamical and chemical properties of globular clusters. Methods.
We use stellar models of fast rotating massive stars, losing mass through a
slow mechanical equatorial winds to produce material rich in H-burning
products. We propose that stars with high Na and low O abundances (hereafter
anomalous stars) are formed from matter made of slow winds of individual
massive stars and of interstellar matter. The proportion of slow wind and of
interstellar material is fixed in order to reproduce the observed Li-Na
anticorrelation in NGC 6752. Results. In the case that globular clusters,
during their lifetime, did not lose any stars, we found that to reproduce the
observed ratio of normal to anomalous stars, a flat initial mass function (IMF)
is needed, with typically a slope x=0.55 (a Salpeter's IMF has x=1.35). In the
case that globular clusters suffer from an evaporation of normal stars, the IMF
slope can be steeper: to have x=1.35, about 96% of the normal stars would be
lost. We make predictions for the distribution of stars as a function of their
[O/Na] and obtain quite reasonable agreement with that one observed for NGC
6752. Predictions for the number fraction of stars with different values of
helium, of the 12C/13C and 16O/17O ratios are discussed, as well as the
expected relations between values of [O/Na] and those of helium, of [C/N], of
12C/13C and of 16O/17O. Future observations might test these predictions. We
also provide predictions for the present day mass of the clusters expressed in
units of mass of the gas used to form stars, and for the way the present day
mass is distributed between the first and second generation of stars and the
stellar remnants.

  resolution",,"10.1086/523932",,"astro-ph",,"  We have used a model of magnetic accretion to investigate the accretion flows
of magnetic cataclysmic variables. Numerical simulations demonstrate that four
types of flow are possible: discs, streams, rings and propellers. The
fundamental observable determining the accretion flow, for a given mass ratio,
is the spin-to-orbital period ratio of the system. If IPs are accreting at
their equilibrium spin rates, then for a mass ratio of 0.5, those with
Pspin/Porb < 0.1 will be disc-like, those with 0.1 < Pspin/Porb < 0.6 will be
stream-like, and those with Pspin/Porb ~ 0.6 will be ring-like. The spin to
orbital period ratio at which the systems transition between these flow types
increases as the mass ratio of the stellar components decreases.
  For the first time we present evolutionary tracks of mCVs which allow
investigation of how their accretion flow changes with time. As systems evolve
to shorter orbital periods and smaller mass ratios, in order to maintain spin
equilibrium, their spin-to-orbital period ratio will generally increase. As a
result, the relative occurrence of ring-like flows will increase, and the
occurrence of disc-like flows will decrease, at short orbital periods. The
growing number of systems observed at high spin-to-orbital period ratios with
orbital periods below 2h, and the observational evidence for ring-like
accretion in EX Hya, are fully consistent with this picture.

field and excites coherent transverse beam motion in a synchrotron. By
observing this coherent motion, the optical parameters can be directly measured
at the beam position monitor locations. The driven oscillation induced by an AC
dipole will generate a phase space ellipse which differs from that of the free
oscillation. If not properly accounted for, this difference can lead to a
misinterpretation of the actual optical parameters, for instance, of 6% or more
in the cases of the Tevatron, RHIC, or LHC. The effect of an AC dipole on the
linear optics parameters is identical to that of a thin lens quadrupole. By
introducing a new amplitude function to describe this new phase space ellipse,
the motion produced by an AC dipole becomes easier to interpret. Beam position
data taken under the influence of an AC dipole, with this new interpretation in
mind, can lead to more precise measurements of the normal Courant-Snyder
parameters. This new parameterization of the driven motion is presented and is
used to interpret data taken in the FNAL Tevatron using an AC dipole.

this regime. Moreover the microscopic origin of universality is seen to rely on
perfect screening sum rules that hold in great generality for conducting media.

Duplications (SDs) are long (>1kb) stretches of duplicated DNA with high

SDs are significantly co-localized with each other, resulting in a power-law
distribution, which suggests a preferential attachment mechanism, i.e. existing
SDs are likely to be involved in creating new ones nearby. Second, we look at
the relationship of CNVs/SDs with various types of repeats. We we find that the
previously recognized association of SDs with Alu elements is significantly
stronger for older SDs and is sharply decreasing for younger ones. While it
might be expected that the patterns should be similar for SDs and CNVs, we
find, surprisingly, no association of CNVs with Alu elements. This trend is
consistent with the decreasing correlation between Alu elements and younger
SDs, the activity of Alu elements has been decreasing and by now it they seem
no longer active. Furthermore, we find a striking association of SDs with
processed pseudogenes suggesting that they may also have mediated SD formation.
