coupling of optical and mechanical degree of freedom and are actively pursued
for their ability to explore quantum mechanical phenomena of macroscopic
objects. Many of these investigations require preparation of the mechanical
system in or close to its quantum ground state. Remarkable progress in ground
state cooling has been achieved for trapped ions and atoms confined in optical
lattices. Imperative to this progress has been the technique of resolved
sideband cooling, which allows overcoming the inherent temperature limit of
Doppler cooling and necessitates a harmonic trapping frequency which exceeds
the atomic species' transition rate. The recent advent of cavity back-action
cooling of mechanical oscillators by radiation pressure has followed a similar
path with Doppler-type cooling being demonstrated, but lacking inherently the
ability to attain ground state cooling as recently predicted. Here we
demonstrate for the first time resolved sideband cooling of a mechanical
oscillator. By pumping the first lower sideband of an optical microcavity,
whose decay rate is more than twenty times smaller than the eigen-frequency of
the associated mechanical oscillator, cooling rates above 1.5 MHz are attained.
Direct spectroscopy of the motional sidebands reveals 40-fold suppression of
motional increasing processes, which could enable reaching phonon occupancies
well below unity (<0.03). Elemental demonstration of resolved sideband cooling
as reported here should find widespread use in opto-mechanical cooling
experiments. Apart from ground state cooling, this regime allows realization of
motion measurement with an accuracy exceeding the standard quantum limit.

  In this paper, we examine the quantization of compact symplectic manifolds

obtain a theorem similar to Sniatycki's, which gives the quantization in terms

would be of great value. We present here a novel computational approach, called
NTPGE (Network Topology-based Prediction of Gene Essentiality), that relies on
network topology features of a gene to estimate its essentiality. The first
step of NTPGE is to construct the integrated molecular network for a given
organism comprising protein physical, metabolic and transcriptional regulation
interactions. The second step consists in training a decision tree-based
machine learning algorithm on known essential and non-essential genes of the
organism of interest, considering as learning attributes the network topology
information for each of these genes. Finally, the decision tree classifier
generated is applied to the set of genes of this organism to estimate
essentiality for each gene. We applied the NTPGE approach for discovering
essential genes in Escherichia coli and then assessed its performance.

consequence of the intrinsic noise in the system, and such noise must
fundamentally limit the reliability of any genetic computation. Here we use
information theory to formalize the notion of information transmission in

reproduced through a universal scenario based on two mechanisms: (i) a
magnetization dependent spin polaron hopping influenced by a Zeeman splitting
effect, and (ii) properly defined thermally excited polaron states which have
to be taken into account in order to correctly describe the behavior of the

consequently incorporating certain aspects of confinement. The influence of
these modifications on the resulting phase diagram is discussed.

disc in the CORAVEL and RAVE surveys. The CORAVEL survey consists of local
dwarf stars (Nordstrom et al. Geneva-Copenhagen survey) and local Famaey et al.
giant stars. We select RAVE stars with radial velocities that are sensitive to
the Galactic vertical space velocity (Galactic latitude b < -45 deg). Kuiper
statistics have been employed to test the symmetry of the Galactic vertical
velocity distribution functions in these samples for evidence of a net vertical
flow that could be associated with a (tidal?) stream of stars with vertically
coherent kinematics. In contrast to the `Field of Streams' found in the outer
halo, we find that the local volumes of the solar neighbourhood sampled by the
CORAVEL dwarfs (complete within ~3 x 10^-4 kpc^3), CORAVEL giants (complete
within ~5 x 10^-2 kpc^3) and RAVE (5-15% complete within ~8 kpc^3) are devoid
of any vertically coherent streams containing hundreds of stars. This is
sufficiently sensitive to allow our RAVE sample to rule out the passing of the
tidal stream of the disrupting Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy through the solar
neighbourhood. This agrees with the most recent determination of its orbit and
dissociates it from the Helmi et al. halo stream. Our constraints on the
absence of the Sgr stream near the Sun could prove a useful tool for
discriminating between Galactic potential models. The lack of a net vertical
flow through the solar neighbourhood in the CORAVEL giants and RAVE samples
argues against the Virgo overdensity crossing the disc near the Sun. There are
no vertical streams in the CORAVEL giants and RAVE samples with stellar
densities >1.6 x 10^4 and 1.5 x 10^3 stars kpc^-3 respectively and therefore no
evidence for locally enhanced dark matter.

from massive stars shows that many spectral domains are concerned, from the
radio to the very high energies.
  First, the theoretical aspects of the non-thermal emission from early-type
stars will be addressed. The main topics that will be discussed are
respectively the physics of individual stellar winds and their interaction in
binary systems, the acceleration of relativistic electrons, the magnetic field
of massive stars, and finally the non-thermal emission processes relevant to
the case of massive stars. Second, this general qualitative discussion will be
followed by a more quantitative one, devoted to the most probable scenario
where non-thermal radio emitters are massive binaries. I will show how several
stellar, wind and orbital parameters can be combined in order to make some
semi-quantitative predictions on the high-energy counterpart to the non-thermal

sub-stellar secondaries could have been detected at separations in the range of

star for any of the targets. Combining our results with those from Gizis &

subdwarf binaries reported in the literature suggests a higher fraction than
the one obtained here, probably comparable to that found for the more massive
solar-type stars in the halo (13-15%). Comparison with the disk M dwarf
fraction (25%) however suggests multiplicity to be rare among the lowest mass
halo stars, implying the two populations formed under different initial
conditions. The low binary fraction in our survey could be explained by
selection biases. A decrease in multiplicity has been observed in the disk for
masses below 0.1Msun, the peak in the disk mass function (MF). The globular
cluster MF is found to peak at about 0.33Msun, with a decrease in the number of
stars per unit mass below the peak mass. Our sample being composed of stars
with masses between ~0.2 and 0.085 Msun suggests that a decrease in
multiplicity similar to the disk may also be true for the halo stars, but

(CEMP) stars on the mixing mechanisms that operate in red giants. CEMP stars
are created when the surface layers of a metal-poor dwarf are enriched with
He-burning products via mass transfer from an evolved donor. The difference
between main sequence (MS) and red giant CEMP abundances can be used as a
diagnostic of the timescale for the mixing of the processed material into
stellar interiors on the MS. Abundance trends with luminosity among red giant
CEMP stars test theories of canonical extra mixing for low mass giants with a
high bulk metallicity. We find a significant dilution in CN enrichment in giant
CEMP stars relative to their MS precursors, and take this as evidence that
thermohaline mixing induced by mean molecular weight inversions is ineffective
in CEMP stars. This contradicts models that rely on efficient thermohaline
mixing induced by small mu gradients in red giants, because such models would
predict that MS CEMP stars with large mu inversions would be homogenized on a
very short timescale. The data do not rule out slower MS thermohaline mixing
comparable to previously published estimates. We also find that canonical extra
mixing is strongly suppressed in CEMP giants relative to stars with the same
iron abundance. A likely cause is the shift in the location of non-equilibrium
CN processing relative to the steep mu gradient in the hydrogen burning shell,
which also occurs in solar metallicity RGB stars. Implications for the mass
accreted by CEMP stars and the mechanism for canonical extra mixing are
discussed.

heterogeneous agent models that allow for the inclusion of different types of
agent motivations and behaviours in a unified way. The agents operate within a
highly simplified environment where they are only able to be long or short one
unit of the asset. The price of the asset is influenced by both an external
information stream and the demand of the agents. The current strategy of each
agent is defined by a pair of moving thresholds straddling the current price.
When the price crosses either of the thresholds for a particular agent, that
agent switches position and a new pair of thresholds is generated.
  Different kinds of threshold motion correspond to different sources of
motivation, running the gamut from purely rational information-processing,
through rational (but often undesirable) behaviour induced by perverse
incentives and moral hazards, to purely psychological effects. As with the
previous class of models, the fact that the simplest model of this kind
precisely conforms to the Efficient Market Hypothesis allows causal
relationships to be established between properties at the agent level and
violations of EMH price statistics at the global level.

from previous infrared observations. Although the bow shock morphology was only
detected in the 24 micron observations, its excess was also resolved at 70
micron. We show that the stellar heating of an ambient interstellar medium
(ISM) cloud can produce the measured flux. Since delta Velorum was classified
as a debris disk star previously, our discovery may call into question the same
classification of other stars. We model the interaction of the star and ISM,
producing images that show the same geometry and surface brightness as is
observed. The modeled ISM is 15 times overdense relative to the average Local
Bubble value, which is surprising considering the close proximity (24 pc) of
delta Velorum.
  The abundance anomalies of lambda Bootis stars have been previously explained

SINFONI to test whether starbursts are found around z~1 MgII absorbers. For 67%

evidence of localized massive star formation, IC2233 has a low surface
brightness disk with a low global star formation rate (~0.05 M_sun/yr), and no
significant 21-cm radio continuum emission. The HI and ionized gas disks of
IC2233 are clumpy and vertically distended, with scale heights comparable to
the young stars. Both the stellar and HI disks of IC2233 appear flared, and we
also find a vertically extended, rotationally anomalous HI component extending
to z~2.4 kpc. The HI disk exhibits a mild lopsidedness as well as a global
corrugation pattern with a period of ~7 kpc and an amplitude of ~150 pc. To our
knowledge, this is the first time corrugations of the gas disk have been
reported in an external galaxy; these undulations may be linked to bending
instabilities or to underlying spiral structure and suggest that the disk is
largely self-gravitating.
  Lying at a projected distance of 16.7' from IC2233, NGC2537 has an HI disk
with a bright, tilted inner ring and a flocculent, dynamically cold outer
region that extends to ~3.5D_25. Although NGC2537 is rotationally-dominated, it
shows significant turbulence near its center. The inner rotation curve rises
steeply, implying a strong central mass concentration. Our data indicate that
IC2233 and NGC2537 do not constitute a bound pair and most likely lie at
different distances. We also find no compelling evidence of a recent minor

galaxies evolving in relative isolation. (Abridged)

teaches us something about the quantum mechanical universe, regardless of the

that these kinds of studies are fruitful for questions relating to quantum

formalism for realistic theories to describe a set of theories emphasizing the
role of measurement and preparation devices by introducing `hidden variables'
to describe them. We illustrate both the ontological model formalism and our
generalization of it through a series of example models taken from the

the meaning contextuality (a constraint on successful realistic theories),
finding that - taken at face-value - it can be realized as a natural
interaction between the configurations of a system and measurement device.
However, we also describe a property that we call deficiency, which follows
from contextuality, but does not admit such a natural interpretation. Loosely
speaking, deficiency breaks a symmetry between preparations and measurements in
quantum mechanics. It is the property that the set of ontic states which a
system prepared in quantum state psi may actually be in, is strictly smaller
than the set of ontic states which would reveal the measurement outcome psi
with certainty.

hexadecapole polarization corresponding to the $\Delta M=4$ Zeeman coherence,

dwarfs themselves have a mass of ~0.5 solar masses. We thus expect young white
dwarfs to have a concentrated radial distribution (like that of their

that of ~0.5 solar mass main-sequence stars. However, we observe young white

here the magnetic field strength for jet formation. Methods: By using the
Alfven Radius, R_A, we study what we call {\it the basic condition}, R_A/R_*=1
or R_A/R_{LSO}=1 (LSO, last stable orbit), in its dependency on the magnetic
field strength and the mass accretion rate, and we analyse these results in 3-D
and 2-D plots in the case of neutron star and black hole accretor systems,
respectively. For this purpose, we did a systematic search of all available
observational data for magnetic field strength and the mass accretion rate.
Results: The association of a classical X-ray pulsar (i.e. B ~10^{12} G) with
jets is excluded even if accreting at the Eddington critical rate. Z-sources
may develop jets for B \simlt 10^{8.2} G, whereas Atoll-sources are potential
sources of jets if B \simlt 10^{7.7} G. It is not ruled out that a millisecond
X-ray pulsar could develop jets, at least for those sources where B \simlt
10^{7.5} G. In this case the millisecond X-ray pulsar could switch to a
microquasar phase during its maximum accretion rate. For stellar-mass black
hole X-ray binaries, the condition is that B \simlt 1.35 x 10^8 G and B \simlt
5 x 10^8 G at the last stable orbit for a Schwarzschild and a Kerr black hole,
respectively. For active galactic nuclei (AGNs), it reaches B \simlt 10^{5.9} G
for each kind of black hole. These theoretical results are in complete

was designed to provide a platform for seven instruments that will collect and

missions developed at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory
(APL) and other missions such as Ulysses. The trajectory design imposed
constraints on mass and structural strength to meet the high launch
acceleration needed to reach the Pluto system prior to the year 2020. The
spacecraft subsystems were designed to meet tight mass and power allocations,
yet provide the necessary control and data handling finesse to support data
collection and return when the one-way light time during the Pluto flyby is 4.5
hours. Missions to the outer solar system require a radioisotope thermoelectric
generator (RTG) to supply electrical power, and a single RTG is used by New
Horizons. To accommodate this constraint, the spacecraft electronics were
designed to operate on less than 200 W. The spacecraft system architecture
provides sufficient redundancy to provide a probability of mission success of
greater than 0.85, even with a mission duration of over 10 years. The
spacecraft is now on its way to Pluto, with an arrival date of 14 July 2015.
Initial inflight tests have verified that the spacecraft will meet the design
requirements.

socioeconomic, biological and technological areas. In many of the observations,
e.g., city populations and sizes of living organisms, the objects of interest
evolve due to the replication of their many independent components, e.g.,
births-deaths of individuals and replications of cells. Furthermore, the rates
of the replication are often controlled by exogenous parameters causing periods
of expansion and contraction, e.g., baby booms and busts, economic booms and
recessions, etc. In addition, the sizes of these objects often have reflective
lower boundaries, e.g., cities do not fall bellow a certain size, low income
individuals are subsidized by the government, companies are protected by
bankruptcy laws, etc.
  Hence, it is natural to propose reflected modulated branching processes as
generic models for many of the preceding observations. Indeed, our main results
show that the proposed mathematical models result in power law distributions
under quite general polynomial Gartner-Ellis conditions, the generality of
which could explain the ubiquitous nature of power law distributions. In
addition, on a logarithmic scale, we establish an asymptotic equivalence
between the reflected branching processes and the corresponding multiplicative
ones. The latter, as recognized by Goldie (1991), is known to be dual to
queueing/additive processes. We emphasize this duality further in the
generality of stationary and ergodic processes.

functions of dipole primary gamma-transitions correlate with a change in the
number of excitable quasi-particles. Accordingly, model presentations about the
radiation strength functions of larger, than for those existing, accuracy must
consider as a quantity of excited quasi-particles, so the presence of the
vibration type excitations of all possible types. Moreover, the reliable
picture of the studied process can be obtained only from the approximation of
the distributions of the intensities of cascades in the function of energies of
their primary gamma-transitions.

self-organization with attractive and repulsive interactions between the

around oscillating particles. Here we examine the steady streaming flow
surrounding a vertically oscillating sphere using three dimensional particle
tracking velocimetry. We present measurements of the flow with the sphere far
from boundaries, close to the bottom wall of the tank, and near another
oscillating sphere. The steady velocity field is found to disagree with
available analytic calculations. When the sphere is oscillated near the bottom
wall the entire topology of the flow changes, resulting in a larger repulsive
region than expected. Previous experiments saw attraction between particles in
the region where the flow around a single particle is repulsive. We conclude
that advection in the streaming flow due to a single particle cannot explain
the observed attractive and repulsive interactions, rather non-linear
interactions between the flows around two or more spheres must be responsible.

larger than those for the blue GCs. Comparison of observed stellar and GC
velocity dispersion profiles with those calculated from the stellar mass

galactocentric distance increases, indicating the existence of an extended dark
matter halo. The entire sample of GCs in M60 is found to have a tangentially
biased velocity ellipsoid unlike the GC systems in other gEs. Two subsamples
appear to have different velocity ellipsoids. The blue GC system has a modest
tangentially biased velocity ellipsoid, while the red GC system has a modest
radially biased or an isotropic velocity ellipsoid. From the comparison of the
kinematic properties of the M60 GC system to those of other gEs (M87, M49, NGC

of each GC system shows an isotropic velocity ellipsoid except for M60, while
the subsamples show diverse velocity ellipsoids. We discuss the implication of

the well known Poisson kernel, here we show that for non-unitary scattering
matrices the invariant measures are related by the Poisson kernel squared. Our
results are relevant to situations where flux conservation is not satisfied.

Our work is a generalization of the work of Smilga \cite{sm} who initiated the
study of these Crypto-gauge invariant models that can be related to
$PT$-symmetric models. We show that rotational symmetry in higher spatial
dimensions naturally introduces more constraints, (in contrast to \cite{sm}
where one deals with a single constraint), with a much richer constraint
structure. Some common as well as distinct features in the study of the same
Crypto-oscillator in different dimensions are revealed. We also quantize the
two dimensional Crypto-oscillator.

Fields. 14, 445--464 (2008)",,,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  How is it that entropy derivatives almost in their own are characterizing the
state of a system close to equilibrium, and what happens further away from it?
We explain within the framework of Markov jump processes why fluctuation theory
can be based on considerations involving entropy production alone when
perturbing around the detailed balance condition. Variational principles such
as that of minimum entropy production are understood in that way. Yet, further
away from equilibrium, dynamical fluctuations reveal a structure where the
time-symmetric sector crucially enters. The fluctuations of densities and
currents get coupled and a time-symmetric notion of dynamical activity becomes
the counterpart and equal player to the entropy production. The results are
summarized in an extended Onsager-Machlup Lagrangian, which in its quadratic
approximation is expected to be quite general in governing the small
fluctuations of nonequilibrium systems whose macroscopic behavior can be
written in terms of a Master equation autonomously describing the
time-dependence of densities and currents.

have, generally, softer spectra than extragalactic objects and that Seyfert 2
galaxies are harder than Seyfert 1s. The averaged spectrum of all Seyfert
galaxies is consistent with a power-law with photon index of 2.00 (+/-0.07).
The cumulative flux-number relation for the extragalactic sources in the 14-170

a normalization of 9.6$\pm1.9 \times 10^{-3}$ AGN deg$^{-2}$ (or 396(+/-80) AGN

resolves 1-2% of the X-ray background emission in the 14-170 keV band. A

that the mixed moments of the corresponding creation and annihilation processes

(700-800 degrees C), residence time, addition of reaction initiator (H2O2) or

regard to the nature and amounts of pyrolysis products. Results led to the
conclusion that the best operating conditions of pyrolysis are 800 degrees C
with water as diluent, leading to the production of dihydrogen (40%) and
hydrocarbons from methane to propylene, essentially. CO and CO2 are also
produced but with low molar fractions. Furthermore, a ratio H2/CO favourable
for low temperature FT is obtained.

Language development in children offers the opportunity of exploring the
emergence of such complex communication system and provides a window to
understanding the transition from protolanguage to language. Here we present
the first analysis of the emergence of syntax in terms of complex networks. A
previously unreported, sharp transition is shown to occur around two years of
age from a (pre-syntactic) tree-like structure to a scale-free, small world
syntax network. The nature of such transition supports the presence of an
innate component pervading the emergence of full syntax. This observation is
difficult to interpret in terms of any simple model of network growth, thus
suggesting that some internal, perhaps innate component was at work. We explore
this problem by using a minimal model that is able to capture several
statistical traits. Our results provide evidence for adaptive traits, but it
also indicates that some key features of syntax might actually correspond to
non-adaptive phenomena.

using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques. We have performed variational
quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations
of the electronic ground state of the water monomer and dimer using
all-electron and pseudopotential approaches. We have used Slater-Jastrow trial
wave functions with B3LYP-like single-particle orbitals, into which we have
incorporated backflow correlations. When backflow correlations are introduced,
the total energy of the water monomer decreases by about 4-5 mHa, yielding a
DMC energy of -76.42830(5) Ha, which is only 10 mHa above the experimental
value. In our pseudopotential DMC calculations, we have compared the total
energies of the water monomer and dimer obtained using the locality
approximation with those from the variational scheme recently proposed by
Casula [Phys. Rev. B 74, 161102(R) (2006)]. The time step errors in the Casula
scheme are larger and the extrapolation of the energy to zero time step always
lies above the result obtained with the locality approximation. However, the
errors cancel when energy differences are taken, yielding electronic
dissociation energies within error bars of each other. The dissociation
energies obtained in our various all-electron and pseudopotential calculations
range between 5.03(7) and 5.47(9) kcal/mol and are in good agreement with

room temperature with test masses made from fused silica. Fused silica shows
very low absorption at the laser wavelength of 1064 nm. It is also well suited
to realize low thermal noise floors in the detector signal band since it offers
low mechanical loss, i. e. high quality factors (Q factors) at room
temperature. However, for a further reduction of thermal noise, cooling the
test masses to cryogenic temperatures may prove an interesting technique. Here
we compare the results of Q factor measurements at cryogenic temperatures of
acoustic eigenmodes of test masses from fused silica and its crystalline
counterpart. Our results show that the mechanical loss of fused silica
increases with lower temperature and reaches a maximum at 30 K for frequencies
of slightly above 10 kHz. The losses of crystalline quartz generally show lower
values and even fall below the room temperature values of fused silica below 10
K. Our results show that in comparison to fused silica, crystalline quartz has
a considerably narrower and lower dissipation peak on cooling and thus has more
promise as a test mass material for IGDWs operated at cryogenic temperatures.
The origin of the different Q factor versus temperature behavior of the two
materials is discussed.

immersed into a Lorentzian product space of the form $M^2\times\mathbb{R}_1$,
where $M^2$ is a connected Riemannian surface and $M^2\times\mathbb{R}_1$ is
endowed with the Lorentzian metric $<,>=<,>_{M}-dt^2$. In particular, when $M$
is a Riemannian surface with non-negative Gaussian curvature $K_M$, we prove
that any complete maximal surface in $M^2\times\mathbb{R}_1$ must be totally
geodesic. Besides, if $M$ is non-flat we conclude that it must be a slice
$M\times\{t_0\}$, $t_0\in\mathbb{R}$ (here by ""complete"" it is meant, as usual,
that the induced Riemannian metric on the maximal surface from the ambient
Lorentzian metric is complete). We prove that the same happens if the maximal
surface is complete with respect to the metric induced from the Riemannian
product $M^2\times\mathbb{R}$. This allows us to give also a non-parametric
version of the Calabi-Bernstein theorem for entire maximal graphs in
$M^2\times\mathbb{R}_1$, under the same assumptions on $K_M$. Moreover, we also
construct counterexamples which show that our Calabi-Bernstein results are no
longer true without the hypothesis $K_M\geq 0$. These examples are constructed
via a duality result between minimal and maximal graphs.

theory, so as to construct new foundations for quantum logic and quantum
spaces. Motivated by Bohr's idea that the empirical content of quantum physics
is accessible only through classical physics, we show how a C*-algebra of
observables A induces a topos T(A) in which the amalgamation of all of its
commutative subalgebras comprises a single commutative C*-algebra. According to
the constructive Gelfand duality theorem of Banaschewski and Mulvey, the latter
has an internal spectrum S(A) in T(A), which in our approach plays the role of
a quantum phase space of the system. Thus we associate a locale (which is the
topos-theoretical notion of a space and which intrinsically carries the
intuitionistic logical structure of a Heyting algebra) to a C*-algebra (which
is the noncommutative notion of a space). In this setting, states on A become
probability measures (more precisely, valuations) on S(A), and self-adjoint
elements of A define continuous functions (more precisely, locale maps) from
S(A) to Scott's interval domain. Noting that open subsets of S(A) correspond to
propositions about the system, the pairing map that assigns a (generalized)
truth value to a state and a proposition assumes an extremely simple
categorical form. Formulated in this way, the quantum theory defined by A is
essentially turned into a classical theory, internal to the topos T(A).

the spike time is only known within some \textit{finite} precision, we propose
a model where spikes are effective at times multiple of a characteristic time
scale $\delta$, where $\delta$ can be \textit{arbitrary} small (in particular,
well beyond the numerical precision). We make a complete mathematical
characterization of the model-dynamics and obtain the following results. The
asymptotic dynamics is composed by finitely many stable periodic orbits, whose
number and period can be arbitrary large and can diverge in a region of the
synaptic weights space, traditionally called the ""edge of chaos"", a notion
mathematically well defined in the present paper. Furthermore, except at the
edge of chaos, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the membrane
potential trajectories and the raster plot. This shows that the neural code is
entirely ""in the spikes"" in this case. As a key tool, we introduce an order
parameter, easy to compute numerically, and closely related to a natural notion
of entropy, providing a relevant characterization of the computational
capabilities of the network. This allows us to compare the computational
capabilities of leaky and Integrate-and-Fire models and conductance based
models. The present study considers networks with constant input, and without

$2-d$ communication network of regular nodes and randomly distributed hubs.
Each hub on the network is assigned some randomly chosen capacity and hubs with
lower capacities are connected to the hubs with maximum capacity. The average
travel time of single messages traveling on this lattice, plotted as a function
of hub density, shows q-exponential behavior. At high hub densities, this
distribution can be fitted well by a power law. We also study the relaxation
behavior of the network when a large number of messages are created
simultaneously at random locations, and travel on the network towards their
designated destinations. For this situation, in the absence of the gradient
mechanism, the network can show congestion effects due to the formation of
transport traps. We show that if hubs of high betweenness centrality are
connected by the gradient mechanism, efficient decongestion can be achieved.
The gradient mechanism is less prone to the formation of traps than other
decongestion schemes. We also study the spatial configurations of transport
traps, and propose minimal strategies for their elimination.

lubricant film - modelled as a one-dimensional chain of interacting particles
confined between two ideally incommensurate substrates, one of which is driven
relative to the other through an attached spring moving at constant velocity.
This model system is characterized by three inherent length scales; depending
on the precise choice of incommensurability among them it displays a strikingly
different tribological behavior. Contrary to two length-scale systems such as
the standard Frenkel-Kontorova (FK) model, for large chain stiffness one finds
that here the most favorable (lowest friction) sliding regime is achieved by
chain-substrate incommensurabilities belonging to the class of non-quadratic
irrational numbers (e.g., the spiral mean). The well-known golden mean
(quadratic) incommensurability which slides best in the standard FK model shows
instead higher kinetic-friction values. The underlying reason lies in the
pinning properties of the lattice of solitons formed by the chain with the
substrate having the closest periodicity, with the other slider.

E., 11 pages, 11 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.77.031507",,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  We address the relaxation dynamics in hydrogen-bonded super-cooled liquids
near the glass transition, measured via Broad-Band Dielectric Spectroscopy
(BDS). We propose a theory based on decomposing the relaxation of the
macroscopic dipole moment into contributions from hydrogen bonded clusters of
$s$ molecules, with $s_{min}\le s \le s_{max}$. The existence of $s_{max}$ is
due to dynamical arrest and its value may depend on the cooling protocol and on
the aging time. The existence of $s_{max}$ is translated into a sum-rule on the
concentrations of clusters of size $s$. We construct the statistical mechanics
of the super-cooled liquid subject to this sum-rule as a constraint, to
estimate the temperature-dependent density of clusters of size $s$. With a
theoretical estimate of the relaxation time of each cluster we provide
predictions for the real and imaginary part of the frequency dependent
dielectric response. The predicted spectra and their temperature dependence are
in accord with measurements, explaining a host of phenomenological fits like
the Vogel-Fulcher fit and the stretched exponential fit. Using glycerol as a
particular example we demonstrate quantitative correspondence between theory
and experiments. The theory also demonstrates that the $\alpha$ peak and the
""excess wing"" stem from the same physics in this material. The theory also
shows that in other hydrogen -bonded glass formers the ""excess wing"" can
develop into a $\beta$ peak, depending on the molecular material parameters
(predominantly the surface energy of the clusters). We thus argue that $\alpha$
and $\beta$ peaks can stem from the same physics. Finally we address the BDS in
constrained geometries (pores) and explain why recent experiments on glycerol
did not show a deviation from bul k spectra.

of the LHC discovery reach in the b\bar b H/A, H/A \to \tau^+\tau^- channel on

results for the prospective CMS experimental sensitivities for an integrated
luminosity of 30 or 60 fb^-1 with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions of
MSSM Higgs-boson properties. The results are interpreted in terms of the
parameters governing the MSSM Higgs sector at lowest order, M_A and tan_beta.
While the higgsino mass parameter \mu has a significant impact on the
prospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region), it
is found that the discovery reach is rather stable with respect to variations
of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the discovery region a determination
of the masses of the heavy neutral Higgs bosons with an accuracy of 1-4% seems
feasible. It is furthermore shown that Higgs-boson production in central
exclusive diffractive channels can provide important information on the
properties of the neutral MSSM Higgs bosons.

$Asso_c(W)$ is obtained from $Perm(W)$ by removing some halfspaces according to
a rule prescribed by $c$. In this work, we classify the isometry classes of
these realizations. More precisely, for $(W,S)$ an irreducible finite Coxeter

errors are remarkably robust against the uncertainty of 1 mK in the FIRAS
instrument's CMB temperature monopole measurement. The maximum degradation in
sensitivity is 20%, for the baryon density estimate, relative to the case in
which the monopole is known infinitely well. While this degradation is
acceptable, we note that reducing the uncertainty in the current temperature
measurement by a factor of five will bring it down to the per cent level. We
also estimate the effect of the uncertainty in the dipole temperature
measurement. Assuming the overall calibration of the data to be dominated by
the dipole error of 0.2% from FIRAS, the sensitivity degradation is
insignificant and does not exceed 10% in any parameter direction.

mixture can be described by a weakly interacting Bose-Fermi mixture, where the
bosons correspond to Feshbach molecules and the fermions correspond to excess
atoms. First, we discuss the three and four fermion scattering processes, and
use the exact boson-fermion and boson-boson scattering lengths to generate the
phase diagrams in terms of the underlying fermion-fermion scattering length. In
three dimensions, in addition to the normal and uniform superfluid phases, we
find two stable non-uniform states corresponding to (1) phase separation
between pure unpaired (excess) and pure paired fermions (molecular bosons); and
(2) phase separation between pure excess fermions and a mixture of excess
fermions and molecular bosons. Lastly, we also discuss the effects of the
trapping potential in the density profiles of condensed and non-condensed
molecular bosons, and excess fermions at zero and finite temperatures, and
discuss possible implications of our findings to experiments involving mixtures
of ultracold fermions.

  classifications",,"BMC Bioinformatics 6 (2005) 302","10.1186/1471-2105-6-302",,"q-bio.QM",,"  BACKGROUND: One of the most evident achievements of bioinformatics is the
development of methods that transfer biological knowledge from characterised
proteins to uncharacterised sequences. This mode of protein function assignment
is mostly based on the detection of sequence similarity and the premise that
functional properties are conserved during evolution. Most automatic approaches
developed to date rely on the identification of clusters of homologous proteins
and the mapping of new proteins onto these clusters, which are expected to
share functional characteristics. RESULTS: Here, we inverse the logic of this
process, by considering the mapping of sequences directly to a functional
classification instead of mapping functions to a sequence clustering. In this
mode, the starting point is a database of labelled proteins according to a
functional classification scheme, and the subsequent use of sequence similarity
allows defining the membership of new proteins to these functional classes. In
this framework, we define the Correspondence Indicators as measures of
relationship between sequence and function and further formulate two Bayesian
approaches to estimate the probability for a sequence of unknown function to
belong to a functional class. This approach allows the parametrisation of
different sequence search strategies and provides a direct measure of
annotation error rates. We validate this approach with a database of enzymes
labelled by their corresponding four-digit EC numbers and analyse specific
cases. CONCLUSION: The performance of this method is significantly higher than
the simple strategy consisting in transferring the annotation from the highest
scoring BLAST match and is expected to find applications in automated
functional annotation pipelines.

measurements will characterize the neutral atmosphere of Pluto while providing
a consistency check on the atmospheric escape rate at the encounter epoch with

characterize any extended ionosphere and solar wind interaction while also
characterizing the energetic particle environment of Pluto, Charon, and their
associated system. First proposed for development for the Pluto Express mission
in September 1993, what became the PEPSSI instrument went through a number of
development stages to meet the requirements of such an instrument for a mission
to Pluto while minimizing the required spacecraft resources. The PEPSSI
