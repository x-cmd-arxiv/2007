carried out sensitive ESPaDOnS spectropolarimetric observations to search for
direct evidence of such fields in all massive B- and O-type stars in the Orion
Nebula Cluster star-forming region. We have detected unambiguous Stokes V
Zeeman signatures in spectra of three out of the eight stars observed (38%).
Using a new state-of-the-art Bayesian analysis, we infer the presence of strong
(kG), organised magnetic fields in their photospheres. For the remaining five
stars, we constrain any dipolar fields in the photosphere to be weaker than
about 200G. Statistically, the chance of finding three ~kG fields in a sample
of eight OB stars is quite low (less than 1%) if the predictions of Ferrario &
Wickramasinghe are correct. This implies that either the magnetic fields of
neutron stars are not of fossil origin, that the flux-evolution model of
Ferrario & Wickramasinghe is incomplete, or that the ONC has unusual magnetic
properties. We are undertaking a study of other young star clusters, in order

importance for the distance ladder and the distances to all galaxies, and as
such many groups have provided measurements of its distance modulus (\mu) with
many methods and various means of calibrating each method. Before the year
2001, the many measures spanned a wide range (roughly 18.1 < \mu < 18.8) with
the quoted error bars being substantially smaller than the spread, and hence
the consensus conclusion being that many of the measures had their
uncertainties being dominated by unrecognized systematic problems. In 2001, the
Hubble Space Telescope Key Project (HSTKP) on the distance scale made an
extensive analysis of earlier results and adopted the reasonable conclusion
that the distance modulus is 18.50+-0.10 mag, and the community has generally
accepted this widely popularized value. After 2002, 31 independent papers have
reported new distance measures to the LMC, and these cluster tightly around
\mu=18.50 mag. Indeed, these measures cluster too tightly around the HSTKP
value, with 68% of the measures being within 0.5-sigma of 18.50 mag. A
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test proves that this concentration deviates from the
expected Gaussian distribution at a >3-sigma probability level. This
concentration is a symptom of a worrisome problem. Interpretations considered
include correlations between papers, widespread over-estimation of error bars,
and band-wagon effects. This note is to alert workers in the field that this is
a serious problem that should be addressed.

white dwarf/main sequence binaries (WDMS). The population of WDMS systems
consists of wide systems whose stellar components evolve like single stars and
- more interesting in the context of close binary evolution - PCEBs. We pursue
a large-scale follow-up survey to identify and characterise the PCEBs among the
WDMS binaries that have been found with SDSS. We use a two-step strategy with
the identification of PCEBs among WDMS in the first and orbital period
determinations in the second phase. Here we present first results of our
VLT/FORS2 pilot-study that has the target of identifying the PCEBs among the
fainter (g>~18.5) SDSS-WDMS. From published SDSS catalogues we selected 26 WDMS
targets to be observed with VLT/FORS2. Using a spectral decomposition/fitting
technique we determined the white dwarf effective temperatures and surface
gravities, masses, and secondary star spectral types for all WDMS in our
sample. We used the NaI 8183.27,8194.81 doublet to measure radial velocity
variations of our targets and performed additional follow-up spectroscopy using
Magellan-Clay/LDSS3 of two systems showing significant radial velocity
variations. Among the 26 WDMS systems we find 9 strong PCEB candidates showing
clear (>=3sigma) radial velocity variations and we estimate the fraction of
PCEBs among SDSS WDMS to be ~35%. We find indications for a dependence of the
relative number of PCEBs among SDSS-WDMS on the spectral type of the secondary
star. These results are subject to small number statistics and need to be
confirmed by additional observations. For two of the identified PCEB
candidates, SDSSJ1047+0523 and SDSSJ1414-0132, we measured the orbital periods
to be 9.17hrs and 17.48hrs respectively.

the primary features that differentiates and defines galaxies. The origin of
bulges can be directly probed in part by examining distant galaxies to search
for high redshift bulges, and to study the properties of bulges in formation.
We review the evidence for bulges at high redshift in this article, and how by
studying bulges through a variety of approaches, including morphological,
colour, and stellar mass selection, we can determine when and how these systems
assembled. We argue that the majority of the most massive 'classical' bulges
are in place by z ~ 1.5 - 2, and likely formed very early through major
mergers. Other, likely lower mass, bulges form through a secular process along
with their disks. Direct observations suggest that these two formation
processes are occurring, as spheroids are commonly seen at z > 1, as are disks
and spiral galaxies in the form of luminous diffuse objects, clump-clusters,
and chain galaxies. However, bulge+disk systems are relatively rare until z ~
1, suggesting that this structural assembly occurred relatively late.

possible, and the ground state is a particularly symmetric state, the
color-flavor locked (CFL) phase. The CFL phase is a superfluid, an
electromagnetic insulator, and breaks chiral symmetry. The effective theory of
the low-energy excitations in the CFL phase is known and can be used, even at
more moderate densities, to describe its physical properties. At lower
densities the CFL phase may be disfavored by stresses that seek to separate the
Fermi surfaces of the different flavors, and comparison with the competing
alternative phases, which may break translation and/or rotation invariance, is
done using phenomenological models. We review the calculations that underlie
these results, and then discuss transport properties of several
color-superconducting phases and their consequences for signatures of color

provide conditions to guarantee, for the parameter perturbation e>0

perturbed system which converge to the trajectory x_1 of the limit cycle as
e->0. Moreover, we state conditions under which T=klT_0 is the least period of

that these conditions are verified. Finally, in the case when T_0/T_1 is an

most luminous (M_B < -20.5), blue (B-V < 0.4) and high surface brightness (MU_B
< 19.0 mag arcsec^-2) of this population. The observational data used were
obtained with the HST/STIS spectrograph, the HST/WF/PC-2 camera and the
HST/NICMOS first camera. We find evidence for multiple stellar populations. One
of them is identified as the ionizing population, and the other one corresponds
to the underlying stellar generation.
  The estimated masses of the inferred populations are compatible with the
dynamical masses, which are typically 2--10x 10^9 M_sun. Our models also
indicate that the first episodes of star formation the presented LCBGs
underwent happened between 5 and 7 Gyr ago.
  We compare the stellar populations found in LCBGs with the stellar
populations present in bright, local HII galaxies, nearby spheroidal systems
and Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxies. It turns out that the underlying stellar
populations of LCBGs are similar yet bluer to those of local HII galaxies. It
is also the case that the passive color evolution of the LCBGs could convert
them into local Spheroidal galaxies if no further episode of star formation
takes place. Our results help to impose constraints on evolutionary scenarios
for the population of LCBGs found commonly at intermediate redshifts.

evidence for ""supersolidity"", its analogue in quantum solids, came from recent
torsional oscillator (TO) measurements involving 4-He. At temperatures below
200 mK, TO frequencies increased, suggesting that some of the solid decoupled
from the oscillator. This behavior has been replicated by several groups but
solid 4-He does not respond to pressure differences and persistent currents and
other signatures of superflow have not been seen. Both experiments and theory
indicate that defects are involved. These should also affect the solid's
mechanical behavior and so we have measured the shear modulus of solid 4-He at
low frequencies and strains. We observe large increases below 200 mK, with the
same dependence on measurement amplitude, 3-He impurity concentration and
annealing as the decoupling seen in TO experiments. This unusual elastic
behavior is explained in terms of a dislocation network which is pinned by 3-He
at the lowest temperatures but becomes mobile above 100 mK. The frequency
changes in TO experiments appear to be related to the motion of these
dislocations, perhaps by disrupting a possible supersolid state.

considers the problem of secret communication over the Gaussian broadcast

messages to two users with information-theoretic secrecy. That is, each user
would like to obtain its own confidential message in a reliable and safe

communication scenario, a secret dirty-paper coding scheme and the
corresponding achievable secrecy rate region are first developed based on
Gaussian codebooks. Next, a computable Sato-type outer bound on the secrecy
capacity region is provided for the MGBC-CM. Furthermore, the Sato-type outer
bound prove to be consistent with the boundary of the secret dirty-paper coding
achievable rate region, and hence, the secrecy capacity region of the MGBC-CM
is established. Finally, two numerical examples demonstrate that both users can
achieve positive rates simultaneously under the information-theoretic secrecy

were analyzed in the near-UV and visual spectral regions (3050-9460 A) with the
aim to extend to other spectral ranges the study made previously in the UV
using IUE spectra. Stellar parameters Teff=12850K, logg=4.10, and xi=0km/s, as
determined from H_beta, H_gamma, H_delta Balmer profiles and from the Fe I, Fe
II ionization equilibrium, were used to compute an individual abundances
ATLAS12 model. We identified spectral peculiarities and obtained final stellar
abundances by comparing observed and computed equivalent widths and line
profiles. The adopted model fails to reproduce the (b-y) and c color indices.
The spectral analysis has revealed: the presence of emission lines for Mn II,
Cr II, and Fe II; isotopic anomalies for Hg, Ca; the presence of interstellar
lines of Na I at lambda lambda 3302.3, 3302.9, 5890, 5896 A, and of K I at
7665, 7699 A; the presence of a huge quantity of unidentified lines, which we
presume to be mostly due to Fe II transitions owing to the large Fe
overabundance amounting to [+0.7]. The main chemical peculiarities are an
extreme overabundance of Xe, followed by those of Hg, P, Y, Mn, Fe, Be, and Ti.
The most underabundant element is Si, followed by C, N, Al, S, Mg, V, Sr, Co,
Cl, Sc, and Ni. The silicon underabundance [-2.9] is the lowest value for Si
ever observed in any HgMn star. The observed lines of He I can not be
reproduced by a single value of the He abundance, but they require values
ranging from [-0.8] to [-1.6]. Furthermore, when the observed and computed
wings of He I lines are fitted, the observed line cores are much weaker than
the computed ones. From the present analysis we infer the presence of vertical
abundance stratification for He, Mn, and possibly also P.

graphical models using Lagrangian relaxation techniques. The key idea is to
reformulate an intractable estimation problem as one defined on a more
tractable graph, but subject to additional constraints. Relaxing these
constraints gives a tractable dual problem, one defined by a thin graph, which
is then optimized by an iterative procedure. When this iterative optimization
leads to a consistent estimate, one which also satisfies the constraints, then
it corresponds to an optimal MAP estimate of the original model. Otherwise
there is a ``duality gap'', and we obtain a bound on the optimal solution.
Thus, our approach combines convex optimization with dynamic programming
techniques applicable for thin graphs. The popular tree-reweighted max-product
(TRMP) method may be seen as solving a particular class of such relaxations,
where the intractable graph is relaxed to a set of spanning trees. We also
consider relaxations to a set of small induced subgraphs, thin subgraphs (e.g.
loops), and a connected tree obtained by ``unwinding'' cycles. In addition, we
propose a new class of multiscale relaxations that introduce ``summary''
variables. The potential benefits of such generalizations include: reducing or
eliminating the ``duality gap'' in hard problems, reducing the number or
Lagrange multipliers in the dual problem, and accelerating convergence of the
iterative optimization procedure.

induced by the corrections to the Newtonian potential of such models, we
compare them to the estimated corrections to the rates of perihelia by taking
their ratio for different pairs of planets instead of using one perihelion at a
time for each planet separately, as done so far in literature. As a result, the
curvature invariants-based models are ruled out, even by re-scaling by a factor
10 the errors in the planetary orbital parameters estimated by Pitjeva. Less
neat is the situation for the DGP model. Only the general relativistic
Lense-Thirring effect, not included, as the other exotic models considered
here, by Pitjeva in the dynamical force models used in the estimation process,
passes such a test. It would be important to repeat the present analysis by
using corrections to the precessions of perihelia independently estimated by
other teams of astronomers as well, but, at present, such rates are not yet
available.

outflow axis, although the contribution of rotation to gravitational
equilibrium of the HMCs appears to be negligible. Our analysis indicates that
the 3 HMCs are close to virial equilibrium due to turbulent pressure support.
Comparison with other similar objects where rotating toroids have been

(TQFT) as a weak 2-functor Z: nCob_2 -> 2Vect, by analogy with the description
of a TQFT as a functor Z: nCob -> Vect. We also show how to obtain such a
theory from any finite group G. This theory is related to a topological gauge
theory, the Dijkgraaf-Witten model. To give this definition rigorously, we
first define a bicategory of cobordisms between cobordisms. We also give some
explicit description of a higher-categorical version of Vect, denoted 2Vect, a
bicategory of ""2-vector spaces"". Along the way, we prove several results
showing how to construct 2-vector spaces of ""Vect-valued presheaves"" on certain
kinds of groupoids. In particular, we use the case when these are groupoids
whose objects are connections, and whose morphisms are gauge transformations,
on the manifolds on which the extended TQFT is to be defined. On cobordisms
between these manifolds, we show how a construction of ``pullback and
pushforward'' of presheaves gives both the morphisms and 2-morphisms in 2Vect
for the extended TQFT, and that these satisfy the axioms for a weak 2-functor.
Finally, we discuss the motivation for this research in terms of Quantum
Gravity. If the results can be extended from a finite group G to a Lie group,
then for some choices of G this theory will recover an existing theory of
Euclidean quantum gravity in 3 dimensions. We suggest extensions of these ideas
which may be useful to further this connection and apply it in higher
dimensions.

time method for performing near-isometric point pattern matching by means of
exact probabilistic inference in a chordal graphical model. Their fundamental
result is that the chordal graph in question is shown to be globally rigid,
implying that exact inference provides the same matching solution as exact
inference in a complete graphical model. This implies that the algorithm is
optimal when there is no noise in the point patterns. In this paper, we present
a new graph which is also globally rigid but has an advantage over the graph
proposed in \cite{CaeCaeSchBar06}: its maximal clique size is smaller,
rendering inference significantly more efficient. However, our graph is not
chordal and thus standard Junction Tree algorithms cannot be directly applied.
Nevertheless, we show that loopy belief propagation in such a graph converges
to the optimal solution. This allows us to retain the optimality guarantee in
the noiseless case, while substantially reducing both memory requirements and
processing time. Our experimental results show that the accuracy of the
proposed solution is indistinguishable from that of \cite{CaeCaeSchBar06} when

two-baryon data. The new binding energies are slightly smaller than the
previous values. In particular the triton binding energy turns out to be 8.14
MeV with a charge-dependence correction of the two-nucleon force, 190 keV,
being included. This indicates that about 350 keV is left for the energy which
is to be accounted for by three-body forces.
