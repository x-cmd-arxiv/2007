its variants that does. We show that the nonsynchronous MG models in the

the intermediate-axis correlation is weakest; (ii) the signal is significant at
distances out to 10 Mpc/h; (iii) the signal decreases as z decreases; (iv) and
its behavior depends strongly on the halo mass scale, with larger masses
showing stronger correlations at large distances. For the ED correlations, we
find that (i) the correlations are much stronger than the EE correlations, and
are significant even out to distances of 50 Mpc/h; (ii) the signal also
decreases as z decreases; (iii) and it increases with halo mass at all

correlations. The EE correlations are found to scale linearly with the linear
density correlation function, xi(r). While the ED cross-correlation is found to
scale as xi^{1/2}(r) at large distances beyond 10 Mpc/h. The best-fit values of
the fitting parameters for the EE and the ED correlations are all determined
through chi^{2}-statistics. Our results may be useful for quantifying the

accurately measure Mercury's rotation and its obliquity in order to obtain
constraints on internal structure of the planet. Which is the obliquity's
dynamical behavior deriving from a complete spin-orbit motion of Mercury
simultaneously integrated with planetary interactions? We have used our SONYR
model integrating the spin-orbit N-body problem applied to the solar System
(Sun and planets). For lack of current accurate observations or ephemerides of
Mercury's rotation, and therefore for lack of valid initial conditions for a
numerical integration, we have built an original method for finding the
libration center of the spin-orbit system and, as a consequence, for avoiding
arbitrary amplitudes in librations of the spin-orbit motion as well as in
Mercury's obliquity. The method has been carried out in two cases: (1) the
spin-orbit motion of Mercury in the 2-body problem case (Sun-Mercury) where an
uniform precession of the Keplerian orbital plane is kinematically added at a
fixed inclination (S2K case), (2) the spin-orbit motion of Mercury in the
N-body problem case (Sun and planets) (Sn case). We find that the remaining
amplitude of the oscillations in the Sn case is one order of magnitude larger
than in the S2K case, namely 4 versus 0.4 arcseconds (peak-to-peak). The mean
obliquity is also larger, namely 1.98 versus 1.80 arcminutes, for a difference
of 10.8 arcseconds. These theoretical results are in a good agreement with
recent radar observations but it is not excluded that it should be possible to
push farther the convergence process by drawing nearer still more precisely to
the libration center.

sightlines for H3+ absorption. H3+ is detected in eight diffuse cloud
sightlines with column densities varying from 0.6x10^14 cm^-2 to 3.9x10^14
cm^-2. This brings to fourteen the total number of diffuse cloud sightlines
where H3+ has been detected. These detections are mostly along sightlines
concentrated in the Galactic plane, but well dispersed in Galactic longitude.
The results imply that abundant H3+ is common in the diffuse interstellar
medium. Because of the simple chemistry associated with H3+ production and
destruction, these column density measurements can be used in concert with
various other data to infer the primary cosmic-ray ionization rate, zeta_p.
Values range from 0.5x10^-16 s^-1 to 3x10^-16 s^-1 with an average of 2x10^-16
s^-1. Where H3+ is not detected the upper limits on the ionization rate are
consistent with this range. The average value of zeta_p is about an order of
magnitude larger than both the canonical rate and rates previously reported by
other groups using measurements of OH and HD. The discrepancy is most likely
due to inaccurate measurements of rate constants and the omission of effects
which were unknown when those studies were performed. We believe that the
observed column density of H3+ is the most direct tracer for the cosmic-ray
ionization rate due to its simple chemistry. Recent models of diffuse cloud
chemistry require cosmic-ray ionization rates on the order of 10^-16 s^-1 to
reproduce observed abundances of various atomic and molecular species, in rough
accord with our observational findings.

($T_C \simeq 11$ K). In all these monoclinic systems the electric polarization
can be strongly modified by magnetic fields. Measurements of magnetic
susceptibility, pyroelectric current and dielectric constants (and their
dependence on magnetic field) are performed using a natural crystal of aegirine
(NaFeSi$_2$O$_6$) and synthetic crystals of LiFeSi$_2$O$_6$ and LiCrSi$_2$O$_6$
grown from melt solution. For NaFeSi$_2$O$_6$ a temperature versus magnetic
field phase diagram for NaFeSi$_2$O$_6$ is proposed. Exchange constants are
computed on the basis of {\it ab initio} band structure calculations. The
possibility of a spiral magnetic structure caused by frustration as origin of
the multiferroic behaviour is discussed. We propose that other pyroxenes may
also be multiferroic, and that the versatility of this family offers an
exceptional opportunity to study general conditions for and mechanisms of
magnetically driven ferroelectricity.

the most detailed set of measurements ever established for any SN outside of
the Local Group in any wavelength range. Only SN 1987A in the LMC has been the
subject of such an intensive observational program. The radio emission evolves
regularly in both time and frequency, and the usual interpretation in terms of
shock interaction with a circumstellar medium (CSM) formed by a pre-SN stellar
wind describes the observations rather well considering the complexity of the
phenomenon. However: 1) The 85 - 110 GHz measurements at early times are not
well fitted by the parameterization, unlike the cm wavelength measurements. 2)
At mid-cm wavelengths there is some deviation from the fitted radio light
curves. 3) At a time ~3100 days after shock breakout, the decline rate of the
radio emission steepens without change in the spectral index. This decline is
best described as an exponential decay starting at day 3100 with an e-folding
time of ~1100 days. 4) The best overall fit to all of the data is a model
including both non-thermal synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) and a thermal
free-free absorbing (FFA) components at early times, evolving to a constant
spectral index, optically thin decline rate, until the break in that decline
rate. Moreover, neither a purely SSA nor a purely FFA absorbing models can
provide a fit that simultaneously reproduces the light curves, the spectral
index evolution, and the brightness temperature evolution. 5) The radio and
X-ray light curves exhibit similar behavior and suggest a sudden drop in the SN
progenitor mass-loss rate at ~8000 years prior to shock breakout.

to detect and to characterize some of the fundamental string and string network

at Lick observatory. For each star we have a high signal to noise ratio
template spectrum, which we use to determine spectroscopic stellar parameters.
Aim: The aim of this paper is to present spectroscopic stellar parameters, i.e.
effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and rotational velocity for
our sample of G and K giant stars. Methods: Effective temperatures, surface
gravities and metallicities are determined from the equivalent width of iron
lines. Rotational velocities are determined from the full width at half maximum
(FWHM) of moderate spectral lines. A calibration between the FWHM and total
broadening (rotational velocity and macro turbulence) is obtained from stars in
common between our sample and the sample from Gray (1989). Results: The
metallicity we derive is essentially equal to the literature values, while the
effective temperature and surface gravity are slightly higher by 56 K and 0.15
dex, respectively. Our rotational velocities are comparable with the ones
obtained by Gray (1989), but somewhat higher than the ones obtained by de
Medeiros & Mayor (1999), consistent with the different diagnostics used.
Conclusions: We are able to determine spectroscopic stellar parameters for
about 380 G and K giant stars in a uniform way (112 stars are being analysed
spectroscopically for the first time). For stars available in the literature,
we find reasonable agreement between literature values and values determined in
the present work. In addition, we show that the metallicity enhancement of
companion hosting stars might also be valid for giant stars, with the

determined. The swimmer is propelled against the direction of its outer surface
motion, the inner surface having very little affect. The simplest swimming mode

contrast to produce mean radial profiles. The mean profiles are detected over a
range of scales, from the inner halo (25 kpc/h) well into the surrounding large

consider three different HVS production mechanisms: (i) the disruption of
stellar binaries by the galactocentric MBH; (ii) the ejection of stars by an
in-spiraling intermediate mass black hole; and (iii) the scattering of stars
off a cluster of stellar-mass black holes orbiting around the MBH. While the
first two mechanisms would produce large numbers of HVSs in M31, we show that
the third mechanism would not be effective in M31. We numerically calculate
1.2*10^6 trajectories of HVSs from M31 within a simple model of the Local Group
and hence infer the current distribution of these stars. Gravitational focusing
of the HVSs by the MW and the diffuse Local Group medium leads to high
densities of low mass (~ solar mass) M31 HVSs near the MW. Within the
virialized MW halo, we expect there to be of order 1000 HVSs for the first
mechanism and a few hundred HVSs for the second mechanism; many of these stars
should have distinctively large approach velocities (< -500 km/s). In addition,
we predict ~5 hypervelocity RGB stars within the M31 halo which could be
identified observationally. Future MW astrometric surveys or searches for

measure \sigma_\ln{L}=0.86+/-0.03 at fixed N_200. This scatter is large enough

excess mass density profile above the universal mean \Delta \rho(r) = \rho(r) -
\bar{\rho} for clusters in bins of richness and optical luminosity. We also
measure the excess luminosity density \Delta l(r) = l(r) - \bar{l} measured in
the z=0.25 i-band. For both mass and light, we de-project the profiles to
produce 3D mass and light profiles over scales from 25 kpc/ to 22 Mpc/h. From
these profiles we calculate the cumulative excess mass M(r) and excess light
L(r) as a function of separation from the BCG. On small scales, where \rho(r)
>> \bar{\rho}, the integrated mass-to-light profile may be interpreted as the
cluster mass-to-light ratio. We find the M/L_{200}, the mass-to-light ratio
within r_{200}, scales with cluster mass as a power law with index 0.33+/-0.02.
On large scales, where \rho(r) ~ \bar{\rho}, the M/L approaches an asymptotic
value independent of cluster richness. For small groups, the mean M/L_{200} is
much smaller than the asymptotic value, while for large clusters it is
consistent with the asymptotic value. This asymptotic value should be
proportional to the mean mass-to-light ratio of the universe <M/L>. We find
<M/L>/b^2_{ml} = 362+/-54 h (statistical). There is additional uncertainty in
the overall calibration at the ~10% level. The parameter b_{ml} is primarily a
function of the bias of the L <~ L_* galaxies used as light tracers, and should
be of order unity. Multiplying by the luminosity density in the same bandpass

  Cores Under Pressure","To appear in the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/523837",,"astro-ph",,"  In this paper we present the results of a systematic investigation of an
entire population of starless dust cores within a single molecular cloud.
Analysis of extinction data shows the cores to be dense objects characterized
by a narrow range of density. Analysis of C18O and NH3 molecular-line
observations reveals very narrow lines. The non-thermal velocity dispersions
measured in both these tracers are found to be subsonic for the large majority
of the cores and show no correlation with core mass (or size). Thermal pressure
is thus the dominate source of internal gas pressure and support for most of
the core population. The total internal gas pressures of the cores are found to
be roughly independent of core mass over the entire range of the core mass
function (CMF) indicating that the cores are in pressure equilibrium with an
external source of pressure. This external pressure is most likely provided by
the weight of the surrounding Pipe cloud within which the cores are embedded.
Most of the cores appear to be pressure confined, gravitationally unbound
entities whose nature, structure and future evolution are determined by only a
few physical factors which include self-gravity, the fundamental processes of
thermal physics and the simple requirement of pressure equilibrium with the
surrounding environment. The observed core properties likely constitute the
initial conditions for star formation in dense gas. The entire core population
is found to be characterized by a single critical Bonnor-Ebert mass. This mass
coincides with the characteristic mass of the Pipe CMF indicating that most
cores formed in the cloud are near critical stability. This suggests that the
mass function of cores (and the IMF) has its origin in the physical process of
thermal fragmentation in a pressurized medium.

algorithmic presentations for certain classes of infinite dynamical systems
studied by symbolic dynamics; it is customary to use the term `cellular
automaton' or `lattice gas' for the dynamic system itself as well as for its
presentation. The two kinds of presentation share many traits but also display
profound differences on issues ranging from decidability to modeling
convenience and physical implementability.
  Following a conjecture by Toffoli and Margolus, it had been proved by Kari
(and by Durand--Lose for more than two dimensions) that any invertible CA can
be rewritten as an LG (with a possibly much more complex ``unit cell''). But
until now it was not known whether this is possible in general for
noninvertible CA--which comprise ``almost all'' CA and represent the bulk of
examples in theory and applications. Even circumstantial evidence--whether in
favor or against--was lacking.
  Here, for noninvertible CA, (a) we prove that an LG presentation is out of
the question for the vanishingly small class of surjective ones. We then turn
our attention to all the rest--noninvertible and nonsurjective--which comprise
all the typical ones, including Conway's `Game of Life'. For these (b) we prove
by explicit construction that all the one-dimensional ones are representable as
LG, and (c) we present and motivate the conjecture that this result extends to
any number of dimensions.
  The tradeoff between dissipation rate and structural complexity implied by
the above results have compelling implications for the thermodynamics of
computation at a microscopic scale.

applying a flux to the ring so that the induced supercurrent approaches the

enters or leaves at a time, leading to a final state above the ground state.
Upon lowering the temperature, several fluxoids enter or leave at once, and the
final state approaches the ground state, which can be reached below
approximately 0.5 $T_c$. A model based on the widely used time dependent
Ginzburg-Landau theory for gapless superconductors can only explain the data if

important for a quantitative understanding of this experiment, which could

  figures included in Phys. Rev. E submission)",,,,"q-bio.PE q-bio.CB",,"  This paper develops a simplified set of models describing asexual and sexual
replication in unicel- lular diploid organisms. The models assume organisms
whose genomes consist of two chromosomes, where each chromosome is assumed to
be functional if it is equal to some master sequence $ \sigma_0 $, and
non-functional otherwise. The first-order growth rate constant, or fitness, of
an organism, is determined by whether it has zero, one, or two functional
chromosomes in its genome. For a population replicating asexually, a given cell
replicates both of its chromosomes, and splits its genetic material evenly
between the two cells. For a population replicating sexually, a given cell
first divides into two haploids, which enter a haploid pool, fuse into
diploids, and then divide via the normal mitotic process. Haploid fusion is
modeled as a second-order rate process. When the cost for sex is small, as
measured by the ratio of the characteristic haploid fusion time to the
characteristic growth time, we find that sexual replication with random haploid
fusion leads to a greater mean fitness for the population than a purely asexual
strategy. However, independently of the cost for sex, we find that sexual
replication with a selective mating strategy leads to a higher mean fitness
than the random mating strategy. This result is based on the assumption that a
selective mating strategy does not have any additional time or energy costs
over the random mating strategy, an assumption that is discussed in the paper.
The results of this paper are consistent with previous studies suggesting that
sex is favored at intermediate mutation rates, for slowly replicating
organisms, and at high population densities.

relatively rare. To the Cerny sequence were added in all examples of Cerny,
Piricka and Rosenauerova (1971), of Kari (2001) and of Roman (2004).

synchronizing word is quadratic for overwhelming majority of known to date

spacetime having symmetries corresponding to the isomertries of an
$(n-2)$-dimensional maximally symmetric space in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity

coupling constant is non-negative. The quasi-local mass was recently defined by
one of the authors as a counterpart of the Misner-Sharp quasi-local mass in
general relativity. The quasi-local mass is found to be a quasi-local conserved
charge associated with a locally conserved current constructed from the
generalized Kodama vector and exhibits the unified first law corresponding to
the energy-balance law. In the asymptotically flat case, it converges to the
Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass at spacelike infinity, while it does to the
Deser-Tekin and Padilla mass at infinity in the case of asymptotically AdS.
Under the dominant energy condition, we show the monotonicity of the
quasi-local mass for any $k$, while the positivity on an untrapped hypersurface
with a regular center is shown for $k=1$ and for $k=0$ with an additional
condition, where $k=\pm1,0$ is the constant sectional curvature of each spatial
section of equipotential surfaces. Under a special relation between coupling
constants, positivity of the quasi-local mass is shown for any $k$ without
assumptions above. We also classify all the vacuum solutions by utilizing the
generalized Kodama vector. Lastly, several conjectures on further
generalization of the quasi-local mass in Lovelock gravity are proposed.

3, the origins of Muslim astronomy will be briefly examined. Section 4 will be
concerned with Khwarizmi, the Persian astronomer/mathematician who wrote the
first major astronomical work in the Muslim world. His influence on later

flourished in the 11th century, as will be studied in Section 6. Among its
major achievements were the Toledan Tables and the Alfonsine Tables, which will
be presented in Section 7. The Tables had a major position in European
astronomy until the advent of Copernicus in the 16th century. Since Ptolemy's
models were not satisfactory, Muslim astronomers tried to improve them, as we
will see in Section 8. This Section also shows how Andalusian astronomers took
part in this effort, which was necessary in the path to the Scientific
Revolution. Finally, Section 9 presents the Spanish influence on the eve of the

transition layer sandwiched between connected media is described using a model
of a two-dimensional gas of quantum dots. Explicit analytical expressions for a
surface optical soliton in the presence of single and biexciton transitions,
depending on the magnetic permeability of the left-handed medium, are obtained
with realistic parameters which can be reached in current experiments. It is
shown that the sign of the total energy flow the surface mode depends on the
material parameters of the quantum dots and the connected media.
