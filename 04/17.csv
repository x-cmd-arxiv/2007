disproportion and the traditional Mn$^{3+}$/Mn$^{4+}$ picture of the
charge-orbital orders in half-doped manganites is resolved by a novel Wannier
states analysis of the LDA$+U$ electronic structure. Strong electron itinerancy
in this charge-transfer system significantly delocalizes the occupied
low-energy ""Mn$^{3+}$"" Wannier states such that charge leaks into the
""Mn$^{4+}$""-sites. Furthermore, the leading mechanisms of the charge order are
quantified via our first-principles derivation of the low-energy effective
Hamiltonian. The electron-electron interaction is found to play a role as
important as the electron-lattice interaction. \ignore{A general picture of
doped holes in strongly correlated charge-transfer systems is presented and
applied to the study of charge order in half-doped manganites, using a novel
Wannier states analysis of the LDA$+U$ electronic structure. While residing
primarily in the oxygen atoms, the doped holes form additional effective $e_g$
orbitals at the low-energy scale, leading to an effective Mn$^{3+}$/Mn$^{4+}$
valence picture that enables weak charge disproportion, resolving the current
serious contradictions between the recent experimental observations of charge
distribution and traditional models. Furthermore, the leading mechanisms of the

multilayers and one-dimensional stepwise potential barriers in the
non-tunneling regime are analytically investigated. The optical paths of every
constituent layer in a multilayer structure, as well as the parameters of every
step of the stepwise potential barrier, are constrained by a generalized
quarter-wave condition. No other restrictions on the structure geometry is
imposed, i.e., the layers are arranged arbitrarily. We show that the density of
states (DOS) spectra of the multilayer or barrier in question are subject to
integral conservation rules similar to the Barnett-Loudon sum rule but ocurring
within a finite frequency or energy interval. In the optical case, these
frequency intervals are regular. For the potential barriers, only non-periodic
energy intervals can be present in the spectrum of any given structure, and
only if the parameters of constituent potential steps are properly chosen.
  Abstract The integral conservation relations derived analytically have also
been verified numerically. The relations can be used in dispersion-engineered
multilayer-based devices, e.g., ultrashort pulse compressors or ultracompact
optical delay lines, as well as to design multiple-quantum-well electronic
heterostructures with engineered DOS.

also admit natural Hopf algebra structures that are isomorphic to that of \CGL,

specification of standard bases for \CO and \CSp analogous to those used for
\Sym. A major structural change arising from the adoption of these bases is the
introduction of new orthogonal and symplectic Schur-Hall scalar products.
Significantly, the adjoint with respect to multiplication no longer coincides,
as it does in the \CGL case, with a Foulkes derivative or skew operation. The
adjoint and Foulkes derivative now require separate definitions, and their
properties are explored here in the orthogonal and symplectic cases. Moreover,
the Hopf algebras \CO and \CSp are not self-dual. The dual Hopf algebras \CO^*

configurations maintain a spin-polarized ground state with antiferromagnetic
ordering localized at the edges, similar to the fully hydrogenated
counterparts. More important, edge oxidation is found to lower the onset
electric field required to induce half-metallic behavior and extend the overall
field range at which the systems remain half-metallic. Once the half-metallic
state is reached, further increase of the external electric field intensity
produces a rapid decrease in the spin magnetization up to a point where the

  George W. Mackey, 99--127, Contemp. Math., 449, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence,
  RI, 2008.",,,"math.OA math.FA",,"  We give an operator theoretic approach to the constructions of
multiresolutions as they are used in a number of basis constructions with
wavelets, and in Hilbert spaces on fractals. Our approach starts with the
following version of the classical Baumslag-Solitar relations $u t = t^2 u$
where $t$ is a unitary operator in a Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ and $u$ is an
isometry in $\mathcal H$. There are isometric dilations of this system into a
bigger Hilbert space, relevant for wavelets. For a variety of carefully
selected dilations, the ``bigger'' Hilbert space may be $L^2(\br)$, and the
dilated operators may be the unitary operators which define a dyadic wavelet
multiresolutions of $L^2(\br)$ with the subspace $\mathcal H$ serving as the
corresponding resolution subspace. That is, the initialized resolution which is
generated by the wavelet scaling function(s). In the dilated Hilbert space, the
Baumslag-Solitar relations then take the more familiar form $u t u^{-1} = t^2$.
  We offer an operator theoretic framework including the standard construction;
and we show how the representations of certain discrete semidirect group
products serve to classify the possibilities. For this we analyze and compare
several types of unitary representations of these semidirect products: the
induced representations in Mackey's theory, the wavelet representations on
$L^2(\br)$, the irreducible representation on the dual, the finite dimensional
representations, and the the regular representation.

acquisition of limited spectral information over an entire image plane
simultaneously. Light from a telescope is dispersed into multiple spectral
orders, which are imaged separately, and two or more of the dispersed images
are combined using an analogy between the (x,y,\lambda) spectral data space and
conventional (x,y,z) three-space. Because no photons are deliberately destroyed
during image acquisition, the technique is much more photon-efficient in some
observing regimes than existing techniques such as scanned-filtergraph or
scanned-slit spectral imaging. Hybrid differential stereoscopy, which uses a
combination of conventional cross-correlation stereoscopy and linear
approximation theory to extract the central wavelength of a spectral line, has
been used to produce solar Stokes-V (line-of-sight) magnetograms in the 617.34
nm Fe I line, and more sophisticated inversion techniques are currently being
used to derive Doppler and line separation data from EUV images of the solar
corona collected in the neighboring lines of He-II and Si-XI at 30.4 nm. In
this paper we develop an analytic a priori treatment of noise in the line shift
signal derived from hybrid differential stereoscopy. We use the analysis to
estimate the noise level and measurement precision in a high resolution solar
magnetograph based on stereoscopic spectral imaging, compare those estimates to
a test observation made in 2003, and discuss implications for future

highly varied spectral energy distributions. Consistent with previous

existence of bright star forming regions. However, the far-infrared emission
may be relatively weak compared with normal star-forming galaxies.

rate was obtained from the difference between the measured $\mu^-$

rate. The target's low gas density of 1% compared to liquid hydrogen is key to
avoiding uncertainties that arise from the formation of muonic molecules. The
capture rate from the hyperfine singlet ground state of the $\mu p$ atom is
measured to be $\Lambda_S=725.0 \pm 17.4 s^{-1}$, from which the induced
pseudoscalar coupling of the nucleon, $g_P(q^2=-0.88 m_\mu^2)=7.3 \pm 1.1$, is

Type Ib/c supernova and gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra may reveal the
progenitor evolution of the exploding Wolf-Rayet star. While the quoted paper
deals with Wolf-Rayet stars which evolved through a red supergiant stage, we
investigate here the initially more massive Wolf-Rayet stars which are thought
to evolve through a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stage. We perform hydrodynamic
simulations of the evolution of the circumstellar medium around a 60 Msol star,
from the main sequence through the LBV and Wolf-Rayet stages, up to core
collapse. We then compute the column density of the circumstellar matter as a
function of radial velocity, time and angle. This allows a comparison with the
number and blue-shifts, of absorption components in the spectra of LBVs,
Wolf-Rayet stars, Type Ib/c supernovae and gamma-ray burst afterglows. Our
simulation for the post-LBV stage shows the formation of various absorption
components, which are, however, rather short lived; they dissipate on time
scales shorter than 50,000yr. As the LBV stage is thought to occur at the
beginning of core helium burning, the remaining Wolf-Rayet life time is
expected to be one order of magnitude larger. When interpreting the absorption
components in the afterglow spectrum of GRB-021004 as circumstellar, it can be
concluded that the progenitor of this source did most likely not evolve through
an LBV stage. However, a close binary with late common-envelope phase (Case C)
may produce a circumstellar medium that closely resembles the LBV to Wolf-Rayet
evolution, but with a much shorter Wolf-Rayet period.

Galactic Nuclei (AGN) selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Their
radio properties are inferred by co-adding large ensembles of radio image
cut-outs from the FIRST survey, as almost all of the sources are individually
undetected. We correlate the median radio flux densities against a range of
other sample properties, including median values for redshift, [OIII]
luminosity, emission line ratios, and the strength of the 4000A break. We
detect a strong trend for sources that are actively undergoing star-formation
to have excess radio emission beyond the ~10^28 ergs/s/Hz level found for
sources without any discernible star-formation. Furthermore, this additional
radio emission correlates well with the strength of the 4000A break in the
optical spectrum, and may be used to assess the age of the star-forming
component. We examine two subsamples, one containing the systems with emission
line ratios most like star-forming systems, and one with the sources that have
characteristic AGN ratios. This division also separates the mechanism
responsible for the radio emission (star-formation vs. AGN). For both cases we
find a strong, almost identical, correlation between [OIII] and radio
luminosity, with the AGN sample extending toward lower, and the star-formation
sample toward higher luminosities. A clearer separation between the two
subsamples is seen as function of the central velocity dispersion of the host
galaxy. For systems with similar redshifts and velocity dispersions, the
star-formation subsample is brighter than the AGN in the radio by an order of
magnitude. This underlines the notion that the radio emission in star-forming
systems can dominate the emission associated with the AGN.

distance of 500 pc and hydrogen column density N_H=3*10^{20} cm^{-2}.
Alternatively, the spectrum can be fitted by a blackbody model with kT ~ 0.22
keV and projected emitting area ~2000 m^2. If the thermal X-rays are emitted
from two symmetric polar caps, the bolometric luminosity of the two caps is 2

efficiency of PSR B1257+12, L_X/Edot ~ 3*10^{-5} for d=500 pc, is lower than
those of most of millisecond pulsars. This might be explained by an unfavorable
orientation of the X-ray pulsar beam if the radiation is magnetospheric, or by
strong asymmetry of polar caps if the radiation is thermal (e.g., one of the
polar caps is much brighter than the other and remains invisible for most part
of the pulsar period). Alternatively, it could be attributed to absorption of
X-rays in circumpulsar matter, such as a flaring debris disk left over after
formation of the planetary system around the pulsar.

perturbations, the relativistic equations of the zero-pressure, irrotational,
multi-component fluids in a spatially near flat background effectively coincide
with the Newtonian equations. As the Newtonian equations only have quadratic
order nonlinearity, it is practically interesting to derive the potential
third-order perturbation terms in general relativistic treatment which
correspond to pure general relativistic corrections. Here, we present pure
general relativistic correction terms appearing in the third-order
perturbations of the multi-component zero-pressure fluids. We show that, as in
a single component situation, the third-order correction terms are quite small

as follows: Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ where each edge is labeled either ""+""
(similar) or ""-"" (dissimilar), correlation clustering seeks to partition the
vertices into clusters so that the number of pairs correctly (resp.
incorrectly) classified with respect to the labels is maximized (resp.
minimized). The two complementary problems are called MaxAgree and MinDisagree,
respectively, and have been studied on complete graphs, where every edge is
labeled, and general graphs, where some edge might not have been labeled.
Natural edge-weighted versions of both problems have been studied as well. Let
S-MaxAgree denote the weighted problem where all weights are taken from set S,
we show that S-MaxAgree with weights bounded by $O(|V|^{1/2-\delta})$
essentially belongs to the same hardness class in the following sense: if there
is a polynomial time algorithm that approximates S-MaxAgree within a factor of
$\lambda = O(\log{|V|})$ with high probability, then for any choice of S',
S'-MaxAgree can be approximated in polynomial time within a factor of $(\lambda
+ \epsilon)$, where $\epsilon > 0$ can be arbitrarily small, with high
probability. A similar statement also holds for $S-MinDisagree. This result
implies it is hard (assuming $NP \neq RP$) to approximate unweighted MaxAgree
within a factor of $80/79-\epsilon$, improving upon a previous known factor of
$116/115-\epsilon$ by Charikar et. al. \cite{Chari05}.

finite neutrino mass have been used to study this decay. In the present paper,
this parameterization is extended to a more general form, and a method for data
analysis (least squares) is discussed for the propose of determining the rate
of contribution from the $(V+A)$ current. We find that there is a simple form
in which the set of parameters is related primitively to the physical
quantities. It is shown that the Michel parameters are one of the other sets
that are obtained from this simple form by rearranging one term. We derive the
condition to obtain the same information regarding unknown physical quantities
in the case that the data are analyzed using these simple and rearranged forms
separately. We find that there is some possibility to get different results
from these analyses, because the equivalent condition is very delicate and the
QED radiative corrections should be treated carefully. We propose a consistent
formula for data analysis. It is useful to compare the value obtained in the
least squares fit using the simple form with that obtained using the prediction
of the standard model, because a large difference is not expected, especially
in the case of the Majorana neutrino. Finally, we point out that the method we
proposed to determine the type of neutrino in the previous paper is incorrect.

Usually, if a finite element solution to a Poisson equation based on a

discard the original finite element solution. We propose a prewavelet method to
save the original solution by adding a prewavelet subsolution to obtain the
refined level finite element solution. To increase the accuracy of numerical

  Our prewavelets are orthogonal in the $H^1$ norm and they are compactly
supported except for one globally supported basis function in a rectangular

brightness profiles of nearby early-type galaxies and the properties of the AGN
they host. The radio loudness of the AGN appears to be univocally related to
the host's brightness profile: radio-loud nuclei are only hosted by ``core''
galaxies while radio-quiet AGN are only found in ``power-law'' galaxies. We
extend our analysis here to a sample of 42 nearby (V < 7000 km/s) Seyfert
galaxies hosted by early-type galaxies. We used the available HST images to
study their brightness profiles. Having excluded complex and highly nucleated
galaxies, in the remaining 16 objects the brightness profiles can be
successfully modeled with a Nuker law with a steep nuclear cusp characteristic
of ``power-law'' galaxies (with logarithmic slope 0.51 - 1.07). This result is
what is expected for these radio-quiet AGN based on our previous findings, thus
extending the validity of the connection between brightness profile and radio
loudness to AGN of a far higher luminosity. We explored the robustness of this
result against a different choice of the analytic form for the brightness
profiles, using a Sersic law. In no object could we find evidence of a central
light deficit with respect to a pure Sersic model, the defining feature of
``core'' galaxies in this modeling framework. We conclude that, regardless of
the modeling strategy, the dichotomy of AGN radio loudness can be univocally
related to the host's brightness profile. Our general results can be re-phrased
as ``radio-loud nuclei are hosted by core galaxies, while radio-quiet AGN are
found in non-core galaxies''.

The eigenvalue distribution of the cross-correlation matrix, $\mathbf{C}$, of
NSE is found to be similar to that of developed markets, such as the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE): the majority of eigenvalues fall within the bounds
expected for a random matrix constructed from mutually uncorrelated time
series. Of the few largest eigenvalues that deviate from the bulk, the largest
is identified with market-wide movements. The intermediate eigenvalues that
occur between the largest and the bulk have been associated in NYSE with
specific business sectors with strong intra-group interactions. However, in the
Indian market, these deviating eigenvalues are comparatively very few and lie
much closer to the bulk. We propose that this is because of the relative lack
of distinct sector identity in the market, with the movement of stocks
dominantly influenced by the overall market trend. This is shown by explicit
construction of the interaction network in the market, first by generating the
minimum spanning tree from the unfiltered correlation matrix, and later, using
an improved method of generating the graph after filtering out the market mode
and random effects from the data. Both methods show, compared to developed
markets, the relative absence of clusters of co-moving stocks that belong to
the same business sector. This is consistent with the general belief that
emerging markets tend to be more correlated than developed markets.

high energy interaction in QCD based on the colour dipole approach, for which
the BFKL Pomeron Calculus gives a low energy limit. The key problem, that we
try to solve in this paper is the probabilistic interpretation of the BFKL
Pomeron Calculus in terms of the colourless dipoles and their interactions. We
demonstrate that the BFKL Pomeron Calculus has two equivalent descriptions :
(i) one is the generating functional which gives a clear probabilistic
interpretation of the processes of high energy scattering and also provides a
Hamiltonian-like description of the system of interacting dipoles; (ii) the
second is the Langevin equation with a specific noise term which is rather
complicated. We found that at high energies this Langevin equation can be
reduced to the Langevin equation for directed percolation in the momentum space
if the impact parameter is large, namely, $b>> 1/k$, where $k$ is the
transverse momentum of a dipole. Unfortunately, this simplified form of
Langevin equation is not applicable for summation of Pomeron loops, where one
integrates over all possible values of impact parameter. We show that the BFKL
Pomeron calculus with two vertices (splitting $P\to P+P$ and merging $P+P\to P$
of Pomerons) can be interpreted as a system of colourless dipoles with two
processes: the decay of one dipole into two and the merging of two dipoles into
one dipole. However, a number of assumptions we have to make on the way to
simplify the noise term in the Langevin equation and/or to apply the
probabilistic interpretation, therefore, we can consider both of these
approaches in the present form only as the QCD motivated models.

microplate spectrophotometry to measure the growth kinetics of hundreds of

population has been estimated by fitting experimental data with the logistic
equation. Results: The growth rates were observed to vary among different
clones. Up to six clones with a growth rate above or below the mean growth rate
of the parent population were further cloned and the growth rates of their
offsprings were measured. The distribution of the growth rates of the subclones
did not significantly differ from that of the parent population thus suggesting
that growth variability has an epigenetic origin. To explain the observed
distributions of clonal growth rates we have developed a probabilistic model
assuming that the fluctuations in the number of mitochondria through successive
cell cycles are the leading cause of growth variability. For fitting purposes,
we have estimated experimentally by flow cytometry the maximum average number
of mitochondria in Molt3 cells. The model fits nicely the observed
distributions of growth rates, however, cells in which the mitochondria were
rendered non functional (rho-0 cells) showed only a 30% reduction in the clonal
growth variability with respect to normal cells. Conclusions: A tumor cell
population is a dynamic ensemble of clones with highly variable growth rate. At
least part of this variability is due to fluctuations in the number of
mitochondria.

analytical expressions for physical parameters of differentially rotating

under the requirement that the potential drop in the polar cap is less than the

deviate significantly from the ``classical'' Michel distribution and could be
made almost constant over the polar cap even when the potential drop in the

Distributions for several observable species (HI, CIII, CIV, SiII, SiIII, SiIV,

both line profile and Pixel Optical Depth analysis of the synthetic spectra
show that the intergalactic filament in which the wind-blowing galaxy is

modified by some correlator (e.g., after Jastrow or Villars). It is shown how

single-particle orbitals which differ from harmonic oscillator ones at small
distances. Such orbitals simulate somewhat short-range repulsion between
nucleons. Special attention is paid to a simultaneous shrinking of the

parameterizations in terms of suitable measured geodesic laminations on open

parameterize complex projective structures on the surfaces. The coincidence of
such parameter space is explained by means of geometric correlations between
spacetimes of different curvatures and projective surfaces realized via
canonical WR-rescaling along the cosmological times. We also specialize on AdS
case mostly referring to recent results achieved by other authors. In

segments are parallel and superposed, the total string tension is larger and
agrees with the Casimir Scaling measured by Bali. This can be interpreted with
a type-II superconductor analogy for the confinement in QCD, with repulsion of
the fundamental strings and with the string tension of the first topological
excitation of the string (the adjoint string) larger than the double of the
fundamental string tension.

to smaller radii (approaching $r/M \to 1$ as $a/M \to 1$) and thus allow the
illumination of regions of much higher rotational velocity and redshift. We
also compute the illumination profiles for anisotropic emission associated with
the motion of the source relative to the accretion disk and present the
fractions of photons absorbed by the black hole, intercepted by the disk or
escaping to infinity for both isotropic and anisotropic emission for $a/M=0$

the illumination profile reduces (approximately) to a single power-law, whose
index, $q$, because of absorption of the beamed photons by the black hole,
saturates to a value no higher than $q \gtrsim 3$. Finally, we compute the
fluorescence Fe line profiles associated with the specific illumination and

to the greater sensitivity of the array to celestial point source calibrators

theory for the computational complexity of Bayesian and quasi-Bayesian
estimation carried out using Metropolis random walks. Our analysis is motivated
by the Laplace-Bernstein-Von Mises central limit theorem, which states that in
large samples the posterior or quasi-posterior approaches a normal density.
Using the conditions required for the central limit theorem to hold, we
establish polynomial bounds on the computational complexity of general
Metropolis random walks methods in large samples. Our analysis covers cases
where the underlying log-likelihood or extremum criterion function is possibly
non-concave, discontinuous, and with increasing parameter dimension. However,
the central limit theorem restricts the deviations from continuity and
log-concavity of the log-likelihood or extremum criterion function in a very
specific manner.
  Under minimal assumptions required for the central limit theorem to hold
under the increasing parameter dimension, we show that the Metropolis algorithm
is theoretically efficient even for the canonical Gaussian walk which is
studied in detail. Specifically, we show that the running time of the algorithm
in large samples is bounded in probability by a polynomial in the parameter
dimension $d$, and, in particular, is of stochastic order $d^2$ in the leading
cases after the burn-in period. We then give applications to exponential
families, curved exponential families, and Z-estimation of increasing
dimension.

the ion relaxation is a crucial part of the positron trapping process enabling
the localization of the positron state. However, positron trapping does not

the ionization levels change only moderately. Also in the case of metal

a useful way to estimate the contamination of diffuse interstellar emission in
the cases where it is considered a nuisance. The main goals of this analysis of
the power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of 100 micron dust emission are
1) to estimate the power spectrum of interstellar matter density in three
dimensions, 2) to review and extend previous estimates of the cirrus noise due
to dust emission and 3) to produce simulated dust emission maps that reproduce
the observed statistical properties. The main results are the following. 1) The
cirrus noise level as a function of brightness has been previously
overestimated. It is found to be proportional to <I> instead of <I>^1.5, where
<I> is the local average brightness at 100 micron. This scaling is in
accordance with the fact that the brightness fluctuation level observed at a
given angular scale on the sky is the sum of fluctuations of increasing
amplitude with distance on the line of sight. 2) The spectral index of dust
emission at scales between 5 arcmin and 12.5 degrees is <gamma>=-2.9 on average
but shows significant variations over the sky. Bright regions have
systematically steeper power spectra than diffuse regions. 3) The skewness and
kurtosis of brightness fluctuations is high, indicative of strong
non-Gaussianity. 4) Based on our characterization of the 100 micron power
spectrum we provide a prescription of the cirrus confusion noise as a function
of wavelength and scale. 5) Finally we present a method based on a modification
of Gaussian random fields to produce simulations of dust maps which reproduce
the power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of interstellar dust emission.

EW_{0}(OII) >15\AA) constitute one of the most rapidly evolving galaxy
populations over the last ~8 Gyr history of the universe. Due to their
inherently compact sizes, any detailed quantitative analysis of their
morphologies has proved to be difficult in the past. In this work we use the
high angular resolution imaging data, from the HST/ACS GOODS survey, to study
the quantitative morphology of a complete sample of LCGs in the redshift range
0.5 < z < 1.2. We have derived structural parameters for a representative
sample of 39 LCGs selected from the GOODS-S field, using full 2-dimensional
surface brightness profile fitting of the galaxy images in each of the four
filters available. B-z color maps are used as an aid in the morphological
classification. We then use the rest frame B band bulge flux fraction (B/T) to
determine the morphological class of the galaxies. Mergers were essentially
identified visually by the presence of multiple maxima of comparable intensity
in the rest frame B band images, aided by the color maps to distinguish them
from HII regions. We derive the following morphological mix for our sample of
intermediate redshift LCGs: Mergers: ~36%, Disk dominated: ~22%, S0: ~20%,
Early types: ~7%, Irr/tadpole: ~15%. We establish that our sample LCGs are
intermediate mass objects with a median stellar mass of Log(M/M_{\odot})=10.32.
We also derive dust enshrouded SFR values ranging from a few to ~65
$M_{\odot}$/year using Spitzer 24$\mu m$ data. We estimate a factor ~11 fall in
the comoving number density of blue LCGs from redshifts 0.5 < z < 1.2 to the
current epoch. We finally discuss the evolutionary scenario of these LCGs which
might give us some clues regarding their descendants in the local universe.

20 MeV to 30 MeV. In November 2006 the high-energy calibration of the GBM-BGO
spare detector was performed at the small Van-de-Graaff accelerator at SLAC.
High-energy gamma-rays from excited 8Be* (14.6 MeV and 17.5 MeV) and 16O* (6.1
MeV) were generated through (p,gamma)-reactions by irradiating a LiF-target.
For the calibration at lower energies radioactive sources were used. The
results, including spectra, the energy/channel-relation and the dependence of
energy resolution are presented.

the cells are identified with the integers from 1 to $N$. The behaviour of the
automaton is mainly determined by the support of the random variable that
selects one of the sixteen possible Boolean rules, independently for each cell.
A cell is said to stabilize if it will not change its state anymore after some
time. We classify the random boolean automata according to the positivity of
their probability of stabilization. Here is an example of a consequence of our
results: if the support contains at least 5 rules, then asymptotically as $N$
tends to infinity the probability of stabilization is positive, whereas there
exist random boolean cellular automata with 4 rules in their support for which
this probability tends to 0.

with the help of Monte Carlo simulations, which are supported and verified by
on-ground calibration measurements, performed extensively with the individual
detectors at the MPE in 2005. All flight and spare detectors were irradiated
with calibrated radioactive sources in the laboratory (from 14 keV to 4.43
MeV). The energy/channel-relations, the dependences of energy resolution and
effective areas on the energy and the angular responses were measured. Due to
the low number of emission lines of radioactive sources below 100 keV,
calibration measurements in the energy range from 10 keV to 60 keV were
performed with the X-ray radiometry working group of the
Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) at the BESSY synchrotron radiation
facility, Berlin.
