higher-dimensional analogue: does the absolute Galois group act faithfully on
the deformation equivalence classes of smooth surfaces? (These equivalence
classes are of course by definition the strongest deformation invariants.) We

binary system WR 147 obtained with XMM-Newton. Previous studies have shown that
this system consists of a nitrogen-type WN8 star plus an OB companion whose
winds are interacting to produce a colliding wind shock. X-ray spectra from the
pn and MOS detectors confirm the high extinction reported from IR studies and
reveal hot plasma including the first detection of the Fe K-alpha line complex
at 6.67 keV. Spectral fits with a constant-temperature plane-parallel shock
model give a shock temperature kT(shock) = 2.7 keV [T(shock) ~ 31 MK], close to
but slightly hotter than the maximum temperature predicted for a colliding wind
shock. Optically thin plasma models suggest even higher temperatures, which are
not yet ruled out. The X-ray spectra are harder than can be accounted for using
2D numerical colliding wind shock models based on nominal mass-loss parameters.
Possible explanations include: (i) underestimates of the terminal wind speeds
or wind abundances, (ii) overly simplistic colliding wind models, or (iii) the
presence of other X-ray emission mechanisms besides colliding wind shocks.
Further improvement of the numerical models to include potentially important
physics such as non-equilibrium ionization will be needed to rigorously test
the colliding wind interpretation.

IJHKs and L' filters, K-band low-resolution spectroscopy, together with
millimetre line observations of CO and CS. IRAS06468-0325 has a very unusual
and enigmatic morphology with two components: a bright, close to point-like
source (the diamond) and a sharp-edge ring-like structure (the ring). The
source is not detected in the optical, at wavelengths shorter than the I-band.
The diamond is seen in all the imaging bands observed. The ring-like structure
in IRAS06468-0325 is clearly seen in the I, J, H, and Ks. It is not detected in
the L'-band image. Infrared colours of the diamond are compatible with excess
circumstellar emission and a young stellar nature. A strongly non-gaussian and
moderately bright CO(1-0) and {13}CO(2-1) lines are seen towards
IRAS06468-0325, at v_{LSR} of 30.5 km s{-1} (corresponding to a kinematic
distance of 3 kpc). Very weak C{18}O(2-1) and CS(2-1) lines were detected.
K-band spectra of the diamond and of the ring are similar both in the slope of
the continuum and in the presence of lines supporting the idea that the ring is
reflected light from the diamond. With the current data, a few different
scenarios are possible to explain the morphology of this object. However, the
available data seem to favour that the morphology of IRAS06468-0325 correspond
to a young stellar multiple system in a transient stage where a binary
co-exists with a circumbinary disc, similar to the case of GG Tau. In this
case, the sharpness of the well-defined ring may be due to tidal truncation
from dynamic interactions between components in a binary or multiple stellar
system. IRAS06468-0325 may be an important rare case that illustrates a
short-lived stage of the process of binary or multiple star formation.

better understand the optical line emission in BCGs with respect to properties
of the galaxy and the host cluster. Throughout the analysis we compare the line
emission of the BCGs to that of a control sample made of the other bright
galaxies near the cluster centre. Overall, both the NFPS and SDSS show a modest
fraction of BCGs with emission lines (~15%). No trend in the fraction of
emitting BCGs as a function of galaxy mass or cluster velocity dispersion is
found. However we find that, for those BCGs found in cooling flow clusters,
71^{+9}_{-14}% have optical emission. Furthermore, if we consider only BCGs
within 50kpc of the X-ray centre of a cooling flow cluster, the emission-line
fraction rises further to 100^{+0}_{-15}%. Excluding the cooling flow clusters,
only ~10% of BCGs are line emitting, comparable to the control sample of
galaxies. We show that the physical origin of the emission line activity
varies: in some cases it has LINER-like line ratios, whereas in others it is a
composite of star-formation and LINER-like activity. We conclude that the
presence of emission lines in BCGs is directly related to the cooling of X-ray

external galaxies, but at low metallicity the gas mass deduced could be largely
underestimated. At present, the kinematic information of CO data cubes are used
to estimate virial masses and trace the total mass of the molecular clouds.
Millimeter dust emission can also be used as a dense gas tracer and could
unveil H2 envelopes lacking CO. These different tracers must be compared in
different environments. This study compares virial masses to masses deduced
from millimeter emission, in two GMC samples: the local molecular clouds in our
Galaxy and their equivalents in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), one of the
nearest low metallicity dwarf galaxy. In our Galaxy, mass estimates deduced
from millimeter emission are consistent with masses deduced from gamma ray
analysis and trace the total mass of the clouds. Virial masses are
systematically larger (twice on average) than mass estimates from millimeter
dust emission. This difference decreases toward high masses and has already
been reported in previous studies. In the SMC however, molecular cloud masses
deduced from SIMBA millimeter observations are systematically higher (twice on
average for conservative values of the dust to gas ratio and dust emissivity)
than the virial masses from SEST CO observations. The observed excess can not
be accounted for by any plausible change of dust properties. Taking a general
form for the virial theorem, we show that a magnetic field strength of ~15
micro Gauss in SMC clouds could provide additional support to the clouds and
explain the difference observed. Masses of SMC molecular clouds have therefore

from 6 to 30 Myr. While the Halpha EW for most F and G stars are consistent
with pure photospheric absorption, most K and M stars show chromospheric
emission. By comparing Halpha EW in our sample to results in the literature, we
see a clear evolutionary sequence: Chromospheric activity declines steadily
from the T Tauri phase to the main sequence. Using activity as an age
indicator, we find a plausible age range for the Tuc-Hor association of 10-40
Myr. Between 5 and 30 Myr, we do not see evidence for rotational braking in the
total sample, thus angular momentum is conserved, in contrast to younger stars.
This difference indicates a change in the rotational regulation at 5-10 Myr,
possibly because disk braking cannot operate longer than typical disk
lifetimes, allowing the objects to spin up. The rotation-activity relation is
flat in our sample; in contrast to main-sequence stars, there is no linear
correlation for slow rotators. We argue that this is because young stars
generate their magnetic fields in a fundamentally different way from
main-sequence stars, and not just the result of a saturated solar-type dynamo.
By comparing our rotational velocities with published rotation periods for a
subset of stars, we determine ages of 13 (7-20) Myr and 9 (7-17} Myr for the
Eta Cha and TWA associations, respectively, consistent with previous estimates.

an invalid modeling approximation: that small deviations from a power-law

using both perturbation theory and numerical computation from a

method does not assume quasi hydrostatic equilibrium and it approximates
radiation transfer from optically thin to thick regions with flux-limited
diffusion. In the first paper of this series, we consider
synchronously-spinning gas giants. We show that a full three-dimensional
treatment, coupled with rotationally modified flows and an accurate treatment
of radiation, yields a clear temperature transition at the terminator. Based on
a series of numerical simulations with varying opacities, we show that the
night-side temperature is a strong indicator of the opacity of the planetary
atmosphere. Planetary atmospheres that maintain large, interstellar opacities
will exhibit large day-night temperature differences, while planets with
reduced atmospheric opacities due to extensive grain growth and sedimentation
will exhibit much more uniform temperatures throughout their photosphere's. In

with increasing values of \nu (z), increases slightly with increasing Q^2, and
is almost independent of p_t^2, except at large values of p_t^2. For pions
two-dimensional distributions also are presented. These indicate that the
dependences of R_A^{\pi} on \nu and z can largely be described as a dependence
on a single variable L_c, which is a combination of \nu and z. The dependence

broad-band nonthermal emission, the recently reported fast variability of TeV
gamma rays from M 87 on a timescale of days strongly constrains the range of
speculations concerning the possible sites and scenarios of particle
acceleration responsible for the observed TeV emission. A natural production
site of this radiation is the immediate vicinity of the central supermassive
mass black hole (BH). Because of the low bolometric luminosity, the nucleus of
M 87 is effectively transparent for gamma rays up to energy of 10 TeV, which
makes this source an ideal laboratory for study of particle acceleration
processes close to the BH event horizon. We critically analyse different
possible radiation mechanisms in this region, and argue that the observed very
high-energy gamma ray emission can be explained by the inverse Compton emission
of ultrarelativistic electron-positron pairs produced through the development
of an electromagnetic cascade in the BH magnetosphere. We demonstrate, through
detailed numerical calculations of acceleration and radiation of electrons in
the magnetospheric vacuum gap, that this ``pulsar magnetosphere like'' scenario
can satisfactorily explain the main properties of TeV gamma-ray emission of M
87.

them. This problem is sometimes known as the curse of the boundary nodes. To
overcome this problem, an approach based on coalition games is proposed, in
which the boundary nodes can use cooperative transmission to help the backbone
nodes in the middle of the network. In return, the backbone nodes are willing
to forward the boundary nodes' packets. The stability of the coalitions is
studied using the concept of a core. Then two types of fairness, namely, the
min-max fairness using nucleolus and the average fairness using the Shapley

an analogue of the c-map for the heterotic string via a dual flux

determine the identities of the remaining members of a set after it has had a
large number of insertion and deletion operations performed on it, and now has
relatively few remaining members. The goal is to do this in o(n) space, where n
is the total number of identities. The straggler identification problem has
applications, for example, in determining the set of unacknowledged packets in
a high-bandwidth multicast data stream. We provide a deterministic solution to
the straggler identification problem that uses only O(d log n) bits and is
based on a novel application of Newton's identities for symmetric polynomials.
This solution can identify any subset of d stragglers from a set of n O(log
n)-bit identifiers, assuming that there are no false deletions of identities
not already in the set. Indeed, we give a lower bound argument that shows that
any small-space deterministic solution to the straggler identification problem
cannot be guaranteed to handle false deletions. Nevertheless, we show that
there is a simple randomized solution using O(d log n log(1/epsilon)) bits that
can maintain a multiset and solve the straggler identification problem,
tolerating false deletions, where epsilon>0 is a user-defined parameter
bounding the probability of an incorrect response. This randomized solution is
based on a new type of Bloom filter, which we call the invertible Bloom filter.

despite there exists a limited number of signal transduction machineries? We
show that for any growing cells whose gene expression is under stochastic
fluctuations, adaptive cellular state is inevitably selected by noise, even
without specific signal transduction network for it. In general, changes in
protein concentration in a cell are given by its synthesis minus dilution and
degradation, both of which are proportional to the rate of cell growth. In an
adaptive state with a higher growth speed, both terms are large and balanced.
Under the presence of noise in gene expression, the adaptive state is less
affected by stochasticity since both the synthesis and dilution terms are
large, while for a non-adaptive state both the terms are smaller so that cells
are easily kicked out of the original state by noise. Hence, escape time from a
cellular state and the cellular growth rate are negatively correlated. This
leads to a selection of adaptive states with higher growth rates, and model
simulations confirm this selection to take place in general. The results
suggest a general form of adaptation that has never been brought to light - a
process that requires no specific machineries for sensory adaptation. The
present scheme may help explain a wide range of cellular adaptive responses
including the metabolic flux optimization for maximal cell growth.

nu}. The resulting correlations are rather strong in the case of K_L decays,
but less pronounced in the case of K^+ -> pi^+ nu {bar nu}. Unfortunately, they
are subject to large hadronic uncertainties present in epsilon'/epsilon, whose
theoretical prediction in the Standard Model (SM) is reviewed and updated here.
With the matrix elements of Q_6 (gluon penguin) and Q_8 (electroweak penguin)
evaluated in the large-N limit and m_s^MS(2 GeV) = 100 MeV from lattice QCD,
(epsilon'/epsilon)_SM turns out to be close to the data so that significant
departures of Br(K_L -> pi^0 nu {bar nu}) and Br(K_L -> pi^0 l^+ l^-) from the
SM expectations are unlikely, while Br(K^+ -> pi^+ nu {bar nu}) can be enhanced
even by a factor 5. On the other hand, modest departures of the relevant
hadronic matrix elements from their large-N values allow for a consistent
description of epsilon'/epsilon within the LHT model accompanied by large
enhancements of Br(K_L -> pi^0 nu {bar nu}) and Br(K_L -> pi^0 l^+ l^-), but
only modest enhancements of Br(K^+ -> pi^+ nu {bar nu}).

of light nuclei in Galactic globular clusters (GC). In the present work we
constrain the physical conditions that gave rise to the observed abundance
patterns of Li, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, as well as Mg isotopes in the typical case
of NGC6752. We perform nucleosynthesis calculations at constant temperature,
adopting realistic initial abundances for the proto-cluster gas. We use a
detailed nuclear reaction network and state-of-the-art nuclear reaction rates.
Although simplistic, our analysis provides original results and new constraints
on the self-enrichment scenario for GCs. Our parametrized calculations allow us
to determine a narrow range of temperature where the observed extreme
abundances of all light elements and isotopes in NGC6752 are nicely reproduced
simultaneously. This agreement is obtained after mixing of the H-processed
material with 30 % of unprocessed gas. The observed C-N, O-Na, Mg-Al, Li-Na and
F-Na anticorrelations, as well as the behaviour of the Mg isotopes can be
recovered by assuming mixing with even larger dilution factors. Li production
by the stars that build up the other abundance anomalies is not mandatory in
the case of NGC 6752. Observations of O, Na, Mg and Al constrain the
temperature range for H-burning; such temperatures are encountered in the two
main candidate ``polluters'' proposed for GCs, namely massive AGBs and the most
massive main-sequence stars. (Abridged).

discusses about the possibility of explaining the observed anisotropy below the

observations available extended enough to study the long-term courses of its
pulsation and modulation properties in detail.
  Aims. We investigate the pulsation and modulation properties and the
relations between them in RR Gem using photometric observations from the past
70 years in order to gain further insight into the nature of the Blazhko
modulation.
  Methods. We studied the photographic, photoelectric, and CCD light curves
obtained at the Konkoly Observatory and other authors' published maxima
observations. Detailed analysis of the light curves, maximum brightness, and
O-C data are carried out.
  Results. RR Gem showed modulation most of the time it was observed. The
modulation amplitude showed strong variations from the undetectable level (less
than 0.04 mag in maximum brightness) to about 0.20 mag. The amplitudes of the
amplitude and phase modulations showed parallel changes, thus the total 'power'
of the modulation have changed during the past 70 years. Parallel changes in
the pulsation and modulation periods occur with a d P_mod / d P_puls = 1.6 +/-
0.8 * 10^3 ratio. We also detected 0.05-0.1 mag changes in the mean maximum
brightness and mean pulsation amplitude.

a D=5 theory which supports 1/2-supersymmetric Z_2-symmetric domain-wall

supersymmetry is broken by 5-sphere Kaluza-Klein effects. This happens owing to
the action on the Killing spinor of the Z_2 \subset SO(1,9) symmetry, which
requires an orientation-reversing transformation in the 5-sphere directions
together with the flip of the orbifold coordinate. We study the consequences of
this supersymmetry breaking for the masses of fermion fluctuation modes about
the brane background and find a natural two-scale hierarchy: some bulk modes
have characteristic masses of order 1/L_5 but other modes more closely
associated to the branes have an additional factor exp(-\rho/L_5), where L_5 is

Shorter version submitted for publication",,,,"math.FA math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The purpose of the present work is to treat a new notion related to linear
dynamics, which can be viewed as a ""localization"" of the notion of
hypercyclicity. In particular, let $T$ be a bounded linear operator acting on a
Banach space $X$ and let $x$ be a non-zero vector in $X$ such that for every
open neighborhood $U\subset X$ of $x$ and every non-empty open set $V\subset X$
there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $T^{n}U\cap V\neq\emptyset$. In
this case $T$ will be called a $J$-class operator. We investigate the class of
operators satisfying the above property and provide various examples. It is
worthwhile to mention that many results from the theory of hypercyclic
operators have their analogues in this setting. For example we establish
results related to the Bourdon-Feldman theorem and we characterize the
$J$-class weighted shifts. We would also like to stress that even non-separable
Banach spaces which do not support topologically transitive operators, as for
example $l^{\infty}(\mathbb{N})$, do admit $J$-class operators.

double main sequence turn-off in this object. Despite this, the main sequence,
sub-giant branch, and red giant branch are all narrow and well-defined, and the
red clump is compact. We examine the spatial distribution of turn-off stars and
demonstrate that all belong to NGC 1846 rather than to any field star
population. In addition, the spatial distributions of the two sets of turn-off
stars may exhibit different central concentrations and some asymmetries. By
fitting isochrones, we show that the properties of the colour-magnitude diagram
can be explained if there are two stellar populations of equivalent metal
abundance in NGC 1846, differing in age by approximately 300 Myr. The absolute
ages of the two populations are ~1.9 and ~2.2 Gyr, although there may be a
systematic error of up to +/-0.4 Gyr in these values. The metal abundance
inferred from isochrone fitting is [M/H] ~ -0.40, consistent with spectroscopic
measurements of [Fe/H]. We propose that the observed properties of NGC 1846 can
be explained if this object originated via the tidal capture of two star
clusters formed separately in a star cluster group in a single giant molecular
cloud. This scenario accounts naturally for the age difference and uniform
metallicity of the two member populations, as well as the differences in their
spatial distributions.

conformations on rugged potential surfaces such as protein. However, it is
notoriously difficult to estimate the multicanonical temperature effectively.
Wang and Landau developed a convenient method for estimating the density of
states based on a multicanonical Monte Carlo method. In their method, the
density of states is calculated autonomously during a simulation. In this paper
we develop a set of techniques to effectively apply the Wang-Landau method to
MD simulations. In the multicanonical MD, the estimation of the derivative of
the density of states is critical. In order to estimate it accurately, we
devise two original improvements. First, the correction for the density of
states is made smooth by using the Gaussian distribution obtained by a short
canonical simulation. Second, an approximation is applied to the derivative,
which is based on the Gaussian distribution and the multiple weighted histogram
technique. A test of this method was performed with small polypeptides,
Met-enkephalin and Trp-cage, and it is demonstrated that Wang-Landau MD is
consistent with replica exchange MD but can sample much larger conformational
space.

out that when colour charges are completely screened, the holonomies of the

with the topology of the Poincar\'e dodecahedral spherical space fits
remarkably well the data and is a good candidate for explaining both the local

by axial parametrization. After deriving the general expressions for the cross
section of a binary process, the matrix element is written in terms of three
complex amplitudes. The method to derive polarization observables is detailed
and all expressions are given in terms of generalized form factors. The
strategy for determining physical form factors in annihilation reactions in
presence of two photon exchange is suggested, on the basis of model independent
properties of the relevant observables.

occupation distribution N(M) of the galaxies. Our results are successfully fit
by a ""central"" galaxy contribution with a ""soft"" transition from zero to one
galaxies, combined with a power-law ""satellite"" galaxy component, the slope of
which is a strong function of galaxy luminosity. The large majority of galaxies
are classified as central objects of their host dark matter haloes rather than
satellites in more massive systems. The effective halo mass of MegaZ-LRG
galaxies lies in the range log_10 (M_eff / h^-1 M_sol) = 13.61 - 13.8

distributed in the same way as luminous matter, or peculiar velocities are not
due to fluctuations in mass. To test that statement a set of constrained N-body
cosmological simulations, designed to reproduce the main observed large scale
structure, have been analyzed. The simulations were performed within the
flat-Lambda, open and flat matter only CDM cosmogonies. Two unconstrained
simulations of the flat-Lambda and open CDM models were performed for
comparison. LG-like objects have been selected so as to mimic the real LG
environment. The local gravitational field due to all halos found within each
LV is compared with the exact gravitational field induced by all matter in the
simulation. We conclude that there is no correlation between the exact and the
local gravitational field obtained by pairwise newtonian forces between halos.
Moreover, the local gravitational field is uncorrelated with the peculiar
velocities of halos. The exact gravitational field has a linear correlation
with peculiar velocities but the proportionality constant relating the velocity
with gravitational field falls below the prediction of the linear theory. Upon
considering all matter inside the LVs, the exact and local gravitational
accelerations show a much better correlation, but with a considerable scatter
independent on the cosmological models. The main conclusion is that the lack of
correlation between the local gravitation and the peculiar velocity fields
around LG-like objects is naturally expected in the CDM cosmologies.

find that in the exponential model, the coalescence times along these trees
grow like the logarithm of the population size. A phenomenological picture of

recently emerged as communication techniques that can make effective use of
collaborative/cooperative nodes to create a virtual
multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) system. Extending the lifetime of
networks composed of battery-operated nodes is a key issue in the design and
operation of wireless sensor networks. This paper considers the effects on
network lifetime of allowing closely located nodes to use CB/CT to reduce the

battery life. First, the effectiveness of CB/CT in improving the signal
strength at a faraway destination using energy in nearby nodes is studied.

routing is dynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and
the effectiveness of CB/CT. From the analysis and the simulation results, it is
seen that the proposed method can reduce the payloads of energy-depleting nodes

of accretion flow and spectral formation. Firstly, a standard cold accretion
disc with an active X-ray emitting corona is assumed to oscillate. Secondly,
only a hot X-ray emitting accretion flow oscillates, while the cold disc is
absent at the QPO radius. We find that the QPO spectra are generally similar to
the spectrum of radiation emitted at the QPO radius, and they are broadened by
the relativistic effects. In particular, the QPO spectrum contains the disc
component in the oscillating disc with a corona scenario. We also review the
available data on energy dependencies of high frequency QPO, and we point out
that they appear to lack the disc component in their energy spectra. This would

multiuser detection (MUD) and network coding, cooperative transmission
protocols with high spectral efficiency, diversity order, and coding gain are
developed. Compared with the traditional cooperative transmission protocols
with single-user detection, in which the diversity gain is only for one source
user, the proposed MUD cooperative transmission protocols have the merits that
the improvement of one user's link can also benefit the other users. In
addition, using MUD at the relay provides an environment in which network
coding can be employed. The coding gain and high diversity order can be
obtained by fully utilizing the link between the relay and the destination.
  From the analysis and simulation results, it is seen that the proposed
protocols achieve higher diversity gain, better asymptotic efficiency, and
lower bit error rate, compared to traditional MUD and to existing cooperative
transmission protocols.
