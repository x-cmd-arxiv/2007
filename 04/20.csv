w(\theta) in the COSMOS field. Independent determinations of w(\theta) as a
function of magnitude limit are presented for both the HST ACS catalog and also
for the ground-based data from Subaru and the CFHT. Despite having
significantly different masks, these three determinations agree well. At bright
magnitudes (IAB<22), our data generally match very well with existing
measurements and with mock catalogs based on semi-analytic galaxy formation
calculations of Kitzbichler and White from the Millennium Simulation. The
exception is that our result is at the upper end of the expected cosmic
variance scatter for \theta > 10 arcmin, which we attribute to a particularly
rich structure known to exist at z~0.8. For fainter samples, however, the level
of clustering is somewhat higher than reported by some previous studies: in all
three catalogues we find w(\theta=1')~0.014 at a median IAB magnitude of 24. At
these very faintest magnitudes, our measurements agree well with the latest
determinations from the Canada-France Legacy Survey. This level of clustering
is approximately double what is predicted by the semi-analytic catalogs (at all
angles). The semi-analytic results allow an estimate of cosmic variance, which
is too small to account for the discrepancy. We therefore conclude that the
mean amplitude of clustering at this level is higher than previously estimated.

contrary, when taking into account the gravitational interactions neglected in
the semi-classical treatment, a UV scale stopping the blue-shift could be
dynamically engendered. To show that this is the case, we use a
non-perturbative treatment based on the large-N limit, where $N$ is the number
of matter fields. In this limit, the semi-classical treatment is the leading
contribution. Non-linear gravitational effects appear in the next orders and in
the first of these, the effects are governed by the two-point correlation
function of the energy-momentum tensor evaluated in the vacuum. Taking this
correlator into account, backward propagated modes are dissipated at a distance
from the horizon $\propto G\kappa$ when measured in a freely falling frame.
($G$ is Newton's constant and $\kappa$ the surface gravity.) This result can be
also obtained by considering light propagation in a stochastic ensemble of

distance-dependent random links. The study of diffusion on such networks is
motivated by transport on randomly folded polymer chains, synchronization
problems in task-completion networks, and gradient driven transport on
networks. Changing the parameters of the distance-dependence, we found a rich
phase diagram, with different transient and recurrent phases in the context of
random walks on networks. We performed the calculations in two limiting cases:
in the annealed case, where the rearrangement of the random links is fast, and
in the quenched case, where the link rearrangement is slow compared to the
motion of the random walker or the surface. It has been well-established that
in a large class of interacting systems, adding an arbitrarily small density
of, possibly long-range, quenched random links to a regular lattice interaction
topology, will give rise to mean-field (or annealed) like behavior. In some
cases, however, mean-field scaling breaks down, such as in diffusion or in the
Edwards-Wilkinson process in ""low-dimensional"" small-world networks. This
break-down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively, where
the mean-field (or annealed) prediction appears as the lowest-order term of a
naive perturbation expansion. The asymptotic analytic results are also
confirmed numerically by employing exact numerical diagonalization of the
network Laplacian. Further, we construct a finite-size scaling framework for
the relevant observables, capturing the cross-over behaviors in finite
networks. This work provides a detailed account of the
self-consistent-perturbative and renormalization approaches briefly introduced

have addressed the mechanical foundations of equilibrium thermodynamics on the

entropy provides a good mechanical analogue of thermodynamic entropy because it
satisfies the heat theorem and it is an adiabatic invariant. This property
explains the ``equal'' sign in Clausius principle ($S_f \geq S_i$) in a purely
mechanical way and suggests that the volume entropy might explain the ``larger
than'' sign (i.e. the Law of Entropy Increase) if non adiabatic transformations
were considered. Based on the principles of microscopic (quantum or classical)
mechanics here we prove that, provided the initial equilibrium satisfy the
natural condition of decreasing ordering of probabilities, the expectation
value of the volume entropy cannot decrease for arbitrary transformations
performed by some external sources of work on a insulated system. This can be
regarded as a rigorous quantum mechanical proof of the Second Law. We discuss
how this result relates to the Minimal Work Principle and improves over
previous attempts. The natural evolution of entropy is towards larger values
because the natural state of matter is at positive temperature. Actually the
Law of Entropy Decrease holds in artificially prepared negative temperature
systems.

interferometry might then reveal non-standard decoherence effects, in addition
to standard ones (due to, e.g., finite source size and detector resolution.) In
this work we discuss the phenomenology of such non-standard effects in the
propagation of electron neutrinos in the Sun and in the long-baseline reactor
experiment KamLAND, which jointly provide us with the best available probes of
decoherence at neutrino energies E ~ few MeV. In the solar neutrino case, by
means of a perturbative approach, decoherence is shown to modify the standard
(adiabatic) propagation in matter through a calculable damping factor. By
assuming a power-law dependence of decoherence effects in the energy domain
(E^n with n = 0,+/-1,+/-2), theoretical predictions for two-family neutrino
mixing are compared with the data and discussed. We find that neither solar nor
KamLAND data show evidence in favor of non-standard decoherence effects, whose
characteristic parameter gamma_0 can thus be significantly constrained. In the
""Lorentz-invariant"" case n=-1, we obtain the upper limit gamma_0<0.78 x 10^-26

interpreted as bounds on possible matter density fluctuations in the Sun, which

mass-loss rates, and which in turn may have a large impact on our understanding
of massive star evolution. Here, we investigate wind-clumping through the
linear polarization induced by light scattering off the clumps. Through the use
of an analytic wind clumping model, we predict the time evolution of the linear
polarimetry over a large parameter space. We concentrate on the Luminous Blue
Variables, which display the greatest amount of polarimetric variability and
for which we recently conducted a spectropolarimetric survey. Our model results
indicate that the observed level of polarimetric variability can be reproduced
for two regimes of parameter space: one of a small number of massive,
optically-thick clumps; and one of a very large number of low-mass clumps.
Although a systematic time-resolved monitoring campaign is required to
distinguish between the two scenarios, we currently favour the latter, given
the short timescale of the observed polarization variability. As the
polarization is predicted to scale linearly with mass-loss rate, we anticipate
that all hot stars with very large mass-loss rates should display polarimetric
variability. This is consistent with recent findings that intrinsic
polarization is more common in stars with strong H$\alpha$ emission.

dictinct from all existing methods that extract freshwater from air. All other
industrial methods extract water from a saline water source (in most cases from
seawater). This new method may be used at any point in the Earth except Polar
Zones. It does not require long-distance freshwater transportation. If seawater
is not utilized for increasing its productivity, this inexpensive new method is
very environment-friendly. The author method has two working versions: (1) the
first variant the warm (hot) atmospheric air is lifted by the inflatable tube
in a high altitude and atmospheric steam is condenced into freswater: (2) in
the second version, the warm air is pumped 20-30 meters under the sea-surface.
In the first version, wind and solar heating of air are used for causing air
flow. In version (2) wind and propeller are used for causing air movment.
  The first method does not need energy, the second needs a small amount.
Moreover, in variant (1) the freshwater has a high pressure (>30 or more atm.)
and can be used for production of energy such as electricity and in that way
the freshwater cost is lower. For increasing the productivity the seawater is
injected into air and solar air heater may be used. The solar air heater
produces a huge amount of electricity as a very powerful electricity generation
plant. The offered electricity installation in 100 - 200 times cheaper than any

early- and late-type galaxy samples) to determine the dependence of
$\bar{\omega}_{N}$($\theta$) on luminosity, redshift, and galaxy-type. We
measure $\bar{\omega}_{N}$($\theta$) using oversampling techniques and use them
to calculate the projected, $s_{N}$. Using models derived from theoretical
power-spectra and perturbation theory, we measure the bias parameters $b_1$ and
$c_2$, finding that the large differences in both bias parameters ($b_1$ and
$c_2$) between early- and late-type galaxies are robust against changes in
redshift, luminosity, and $\sigma_8$, and that both terms are consistently
smaller for late-type galaxies. By directly comparing their higher-order
correlation measurements, we find large differences in the clustering of
late-type galaxies at redshifts lower than 0.3 and those at redshifts higher
than 0.3, both at large scales ($c_2$ is larger by $\sim0.5$ at $z > 0.3$) and
small scales (large amplitudes are measured at small scales only for $z > 0.3$,
suggesting much more merger driven star formation at $z > 0.3$). Finally, our
measurements of $c_2$ suggest both that $\sigma_8 < 0.8$ and $c_2$ is negative.

the same rotation curve as the gas and hence were presumably formed in the
molecular-gas disk. However, a western subsample of five clusters has
velocities that deviate significantly from the gas rotation curve. These
clusters may either belong to the second spiral galaxy of the merger or may

Ultra-luminous Infrared Galaxy as the merger progresses and the star-formation
rate increases.
  Some of the clusters which appeared as isolated in our ground-based images
are clearly resolved into multiple sub-components in the HST-ACS images. The
same effect has been observed in the Antennae galaxies, showing that clusters

halo shape and formation time at all investigated redshifts for haloes with
masses M<M*; and (iii) There is a significant alignment of both spin and shape
of haloes with filaments and sheets. In detail, at all redshifts up to z=1: a)
Haloes with M<M* tend to be more oblate when located in clusters than in the
other environments; this trend is reversed at higher masses: above about M*,
halos in clusters are typically more prolate than similar massive haloes in
sheets, filaments and voids. b) Haloes with M>M* in filaments spin more rapidly
than similar mass haloes in clusters; haloes in voids have the lowest median
spin parameters; c) Haloes with M<M* tend to be younger in voids and older in
clusters; d) In sheets, halo spin vectors tend to lie within the sheet plane
independent of mass; in filaments, instead, haloes with M<M* tend to spin
parallel to the filament and haloes with M>M* perpendicular to it. For masses
M>M*, the major axis of haloes in filaments and sheets is strongly aligned with
the filament or the sheet. Such halo-LSS alignments may be of importance in
weak lensing analyses of cosmic shear. A question that is opened by our study
is why, in the 0 < z < 1 redshift regime that we have investigated, the mass
scale M* sets roughly the threshold below which the LSS-environment either
begins to affect, or reverses, the properties of dark matter haloes.

elements in Artin's braid groups, in order to reduce their length. It is a key
ingredient of the usual solutions to the conjugacy problem in braid groups. In
their seminal paper on braid-cryptography, Ko, Lee et al. proposed the {\it
cycling problem} as a hard problem in braid groups that could be interesting
for cryptography. In this paper we give a polynomial solution to that problem,
mainly by showing that cycling is surjective, and using a result by Maffre
which shows that pre-images under cycling can be computed fast. This result
also holds in every Artin-Tits group of spherical type.
  On the other hand, the conjugacy search problem in braid groups is usually
solved by computing some finite sets called (left) ultra summit sets
(left-USS), using left normal forms of braids. But one can equally use right
normal forms and compute right-USS's. Hard instances of the conjugacy search
problem correspond to elements having big (left and right) USS's. One may think
that even if some element has a big left-USS, it could possibly have a small
right-USS. We show that this is not the case in the important particular case
of rigid braids. More precisely, we show that the left-USS and the right-USS of
a given rigid braid determine isomorphic graphs, with the arrows reversed, the
isomorphism being defined using iterated cycling. We conjecture that the same
is true for every element, not necessarily rigid, in braid groups and
Artin-Tits groups of spherical type.

that fitting accuracy depends sensitively on galaxy profile shape. Exponential
disks are well fit with Sersic models and have small measurement errors,
whereas fits to de Vaucouleurs profiles show larger uncertainties owing to the
large amount of light at large radii. We find that both codes provide reliable
fits and little systematic error, when the effective surface brightness is
above that of the sky. Moreover, both codes return errors that significantly
underestimate the true fitting uncertainties, which are best estimated with
simulations. We find that GIM2D suffers significant systematic errors for
spheroids with close companions owing to the difficulty of effectively masking
out neighboring galaxy light; there appears to be no work around to this
important systematic in GIM2D's current implementation. While this crowding
error affects only a small fraction of galaxies in GEMS, it must be accounted
for in the analysis of deeper cosmological images or of more crowded fields
with GIM2D. In contrast, GALFIT results are robust to the presence of neighbors
because it can simultaneously fit the profiles of multiple companions thereby
deblending their effect on the fit to the galaxy of interest. We find GALFIT's
robustness to nearby companions and factor of >~20 faster runtime speed are
important advantages over GIM2D for analyzing large HST/ACS datasets. Finally

range. We have generated simulated light cones to match the resolution and
sensitivity of current and future SZE instruments. Unlike many previous studies
of this type, our simulation includes unbound gas, where an appreciable
fraction of the baryons in the universe reside.
  We have found that cluster line-of-sight overlap may be a significant issue
in upcoming single-dish SZE surveys. Smaller beam surveys (~1 arcmin) have more
than one massive cluster within a beam diameter 5-10% of the time, and a larger
beam experiment like Planck has multiple clusters per beam 60% of the time. We
explore the contribution of unresolved halos and unbound gas to the SZE
signature at the maximum decrement. We find that there is a contribution from
gas outside clusters of ~16% per object on average for upcoming surveys. This
adds both bias and scatter to the deduced value of the integrated SZE, adding
difficulty in accurately calibrating a cluster Y-M relationship.
  Finally, we find that in images where objects with M > 5x10^{13} M_{\odot}
have had their SZE signatures removed, roughly a third of the total SZE flux
still remains. This gas exists at least partially in the Warm Hot Intergalactic

field-by-field decomposition by adaptively reducing down to 2-point stencils
near discontinuities for a more accurate treatment of shocks, and (2) excessive
reduction to low order stencils, as in the standard WENO formalism, by
maintaining high order accuracy in smooth monotonic flows. Our scheme performs
the proper surface integral of the fluxes, converts cell averaged conserved
quantities to point conserved quantities before performing the reconstruction
step, and correctly averages all source terms. We demonstrate that the scheme
is robust in strong shocks, very accurate in smooth flows, and maintains
accuracy even when the energy scales in the flow are highly disparate.

future space-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). These events are characterized by
long-period, nearly-radial orbits of compact objects around a central massive
black hole. The gravitational radiation emitted during such events consists of
a short burst, corresponding to periapse passage, followed by a longer, silent
interval. In this paper we investigate the impact of including relativistic
corrections to the description of the compact object's trajectory via a
geodesic treatment, as well as including higher-order multipole corrections in
the waveform calculation. The degree to which the relativistic corrections are
important depends on the EMRB's orbital parameters. We find that relativistic
EMRBs (v_{max}}/c > 0.25) are not rare and actually account for approximately
half of the events in our astrophysical model. The relativistic corrections
tend to significantly change the waveform amplitude and phase relative to a
Newtonian description, although some of this dephasing could be mimicked by
parameter errors. The dephasing over several bursts could be of particular
importance not only to gravitational wave detection, but also to parameter
estimation, since it is highly correlated to the spin of the massive black
hole. Consequently, we postulate that if a relativistic EMRB is detected, such
dephasing might be used to probe the relativistic character of the massive
black hole and obtain information about its spin.

Seiberg-Witten map, this formalism yields a new class of cohomotopy
Seiberg-Witten invariants which have clear functorial properties with respect
to diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds. Our invariants and the Bauer-Furuta classes
are directly comparable for 4-manifolds with $b_1=0$; they are equivalent when
$b_1=0$ and $b_+>1$, but are finer in the case $b_1=0$, $b_+=1$ (they detect
the wall-crossing phenomena).
  We study fundamental properties of the new invariants in a very general
framework. In particular we prove a universal cohomotopy invariant jump formula
and a multiplicative property. The formalism applies to other gauge theoretical
problems, e.g. to the theory of gauge theoretical (Hamiltonian) Gromov-Witten
invariants.

harmonic section in a sphere bundle with respect to an Euclidean connection.
  Second, we concentrate on moduli spaces of instantons on definite 4-manifolds
with arbitrary first Betti number. We prove strong generic regularity results
which imply (for bundles with ""odd"" first Chern class) the existence of a
connected, dense open set of ""good"" metrics for which all the reductions in the
Uhlenbeck compactification of the moduli space are simultaneously regular.
These results can be used to define new Donaldson type invariants for definite
4-manifolds. The idea behind this construction is to notice that, for a good
metric $g$, the geometry of the instanton moduli spaces around the reduction
loci is always the same, independently of the choice of $g$. The connectedness
of the space of good metrics is important, in order to prove that no
wall-crossing phenomena (jumps of invariants) occur. Moreover, we notice that,
for low instanton numbers, the corresponding moduli spaces are a priori compact
and contain no reductions at all so, in these cases, the existence of
well-defined Donaldson type invariants is obvious. The natural question is to
decide whether these new Donaldson type invariants yield essentially new
differential topological information on the base manifold have, or have a
purely topological nature.

the ""Global Spherical Shell conjecture"" in the case $b_2=1$: Any minimal class

isomorphic to one of the surfaces in the known list. The main idea of the proof
is to show that a certain moduli space of PU(2)-instantons on a surface $X$
with no curves (if such a surface existed) would contain a closed Riemann
surface $Y$ whose general points correspond to non-filtrable holomorphic

$Y$ to a family of bundles on $Y$ parameterized by $X$, and we use the
algebraicity of $Y$ to obtain a contradiction. The proof uses essentially
techniques from Donaldson theory: compactness theorems for moduli spaces of
PU(2)-instantons and the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence on surfaces.

incident continuum at UV wavelengths. The $G$-ratio, which is
temperature-sensitive in a collisional plasma, is also discussed, and shown to
be strongly affected by continuum pumping and optical depth as well. These

black hole taking into account the atmospheric effects of the companion star.
In the cases of no atmospheric effects, the light curves contain the
information of the black hole spin because most of the X-ray photons around 1
keV usually come from the blueshifted part of the accretion flow near the black
hole shadow, and the size and the position of the black hole shadow depend on
the spin. In these cases, when most of the emission comes from the vicinity of
the event horizon, the light curves become asymmetric at ingress and egress. We
next investigate the atmospheric absorption and scattering effects of the
companion stars. By using the solar-type atmospheric model, we have taken into
account the atmospheric effects of the companion star, such as the
photoionization by HI and HeI. We found that the eclipsing light curves
observed at 1 keV possibly contain the information of the black hole spin.
However, in our atmospheric model, the effects of the atmosphere are much
larger than the effects of the black hole spin. Therefore, even in the case
that the light curves contain the information of the black hole spin, it may be
difficult to extract the information of the black hole spin if we do not have
the realistic atmospheric profiles, such as the temperature, and the number
densities for several elements. Even in such cases, the light-curve asymmetries
due to the rotation of the accretion disc exist. Only when we have the reliable
atmospheric model, in principle, the information of the strong-gravity regions,
such as the black hole spin, can be obtained from the eclipsing light curves.

distributed two perfect fluid system has been carried out. It is assumed that
the collapsing speeds of the two fluids are very large. We explore this
condition by using the high-speed approximation scheme. There arise two cases,
i.e., bounded and vanishing of the ratios of the pressures with densities of
two fluids given by $c_s, d_s$. It is shown that the high-speed approximation
scheme breaks down by non-zero pressures $p_1, p_2$ when $c_s, d_s$ are bounded
below by some positive constants. The failure of the high-speed approximation
scheme at some particular time of the gravitational collapse suggests the
uncertainity on the evolution at and after this time. In the bounded case, the
naked singularity formation seems to be impossible for the cylindrical two
perfect fluids. For the vanishing case, if a linear equation of state is used,
the high-speed collapse does not break down by the effects of the pressures and
consequently a naked singularity forms. This work provides the generalisation
of the results already given by Nakao and Morisawa [1] for the perfect fluid.

within the framework of the topology optimization. The mathematical formulation
of the optimization problem is based on the postulated principle of equal
dissipation rate during inelastic deformation. This principle leads to the
enforcement of stress constraints in domains where inelastic deformation would
occur. During the transition from the continuous structure to the truss-like
one (strut-and-tie model) the dissipation rate is kept constant using the
projected gradient method. The equal dissipation rate in the resulting truss
and in the original continuous structure can be regarded as an equivalence
statement and suggests an alternative understanding of physical motivation
behind the strut-and-tie modeling. The performance of the proposed formulation
is demonstrated with the help of two examples.

still be formulated in the principal directions. The evolution of the inelastic

to be stress dependent. The paper also discusses an effective numerical

eigenvectors are known it is not more nec-essary to use invariants of the

loading surface is represented in the polynomial form. This has two advantages:
(i) it automatically fulfils C1 continuity and (ii) plane stress formulation is
achieved by simply setting the third stress to zero. The perform-ance of the

luminosity L>10^45 erg/s. We perform a spatially resolved spectral analysis and
recover the density, temperature and pressure profiles of the ICM, just relying
on the spherical symmetry of the cluster and the hydrostatic equilibrium
hypothesis. We observe that the correlations among X-ray quantities only are in
agreement with previous results obtained for samples of high-z X-ray luminous
galaxy clusters. On the relations involving SZ quantities, we obtain that they
correlate with the gas temperature with a logarithmic slope significantly
larger than the predicted value from the self-similar model. The measured
scatter indicates, however, that the central Compton parameter y_0 is a proxy
of the gas temperature at the same level of other X-ray quantities like
luminosity. Our results on the X-ray and SZ scaling relations show a tension
between the quantities more related to the global energy of the system (e.g.
gas temperature, gravitating mass) and the indicators of the structure of the
ICM (e.g. gas density profile, central Compton parameter y_0), showing the most
significant deviations from the values of the slope predicted from the
self-similar model in the L-T, L-M_{tot}, M_{gas}-T, y_0-T relations. When the
slope is fixed to the self-similar value, these relations consistently show a
negative evolution suggesting a scenario in which the ICM at higher redshift

configuration of the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI), revealing a highly
collimated SiO jet closely associated with the H2 jet component. We study at
unprecedented resolution (0.34"" across the jet axis) the properties of the
innermost SiO ``microjet'' within 1000 AU of this young Class 0 source, to
compare it with atomic microjets from more evolved sources and to constrain its
origin. The SiO channel maps are used to investigate the microjet collimation
and velocity structure. A large velocity gradient analysis is applied to SiO
(2-1), (5-4) and (8-7) data from the PdBI and the Submillimeter Array to
constrain the SiO opacity and abundance. The HH212 Class 0 microjet shows
striking similarities in collimation and energetic budget with atomic microjets
from T Tauri sources. Furthermore, the SiO lines appear optically thick, unlike
what is generally assumed. We infer T(kin) ~ 50-500 K and an SiO/H2 abundance
greater than 4 10(-8)-6 10(-5) for n(H2) = 10(7)-10(5) cm(-3), i.e. 0.05-90% of
the elemental silicon. This similar jet width, regardless of the presence of a
dense envelope, definitely rules out jet collimation by external pressure, and
favors a common MHD self-collimation (and possibly acceleration) process at all
stages of star formation. We propose that the more abundant SiO in Class 0 jets
could mainly result from rapid (less than 25 yrs) molecular synthesis at high
jet densities.

have a huge impact on their environment. Despite their importance, a
comprehensive knowledge of which massive stars produce which SN/GRB is hitherto
lacking. We present a brief overview about our knowledge of mass loss in the
Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) covering evolutionary phases of the OB main
sequence, the unstable Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stage, and the Wolf-Rayet
(WR) phase. Despite the fact that metals produced by ``self-enrichment'' in WR
atmospheres exceed the initial -- host galaxy -- metallicity, by orders of
magnitude, a particularly strong dependence of the mass-loss rate on the
initial metallicity is found for WR stars at sub-solar metallicities (1/10 --
1/100 solar). This provides a significant boost to the collapsar model for
GRBs, as it may present a viable mechanism to prevent the loss of angular
momentum by stellar winds at low metallicity, whilst strong Galactic WR winds
may inhibit GRBs occurring at solar metallicities. Furthermore, we discuss
recently reported quasi-sinusoidal modulations in the radio lightcurves of SNe
2001ig and 2003bg. We show that both the sinusoidal behaviour and the
recurrence timescale of these modulations are consistent with the predicted
mass-loss behaviour of LBVs, and we suggest LBVs may be the progenitors of some
core-collapse SNe.

rotating Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. However, most Galactic WR stars are slow
rotators, as stellar winds are thought to remove angular momentum. This poses a
challenge to the collapsar model. Recent observations indicate that GRBs occur
predominately in low metallicity (Z) environments, which may resolve the
problem: lower Z leads to less mass loss, which may inhibit angular momentum
removal, allowing WR stars to remain rotating rapidly until collapse. We wish
to determine whether low Z WR stars rotate on average more rapidly than
Galactic WR stars, and perform a Very Large Telescope (VLT) linear
spectropolarimetry survey of WR stars in the low Z environment of the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and compare our results with the Galactic sample. We
find that only 2 out of 13 (i.e. 15%) of LMC WR stars show line polarization
effects, compared to a similarly low fraction of ~15-20% for Galactic WR stars.
The low incidence of line polarization effects in LMC WR stars suggests that
the threshold metallicity where significant differences in WR rotational
properties occur is below that of the LMC (Z ~ 0.5 Zsun), possibly constraining
GRB progenitor channels to this upper metallicity.

zwitterionic structure of L-alanine (+NH3-C2H4-COO-) was systematically
compared to the structure of its zwitterionic crystalline analogue acquired
from both computer simulations and experiments. It turns out that the
structural properties of an alanine molecule in aqueous solution can differ
significantly from those in crystalline phase, these differences being mainly
attributed to hydrogen bonding interactions. In particular, we found that the
largest difference between the two alanine forms can be seen for the
orientation and bond lengths of the carboxylate (COO-) group: in aqueous
solution the C-O bond lengths appear to strongly correlate with the number of
water molecules which form hydrogen bonds with the COO- group. Furthermore, the
hydrogen bond lengths are shorter and the hydrogen bond angles are larger for
L-alanine in water as compared to crystal. Overall, our findings strongly
suggest that the generally accepted approach of extending the structural
information acquired from crystallographic data to a L-alanine molecule in
aqueous solution should be used with caution.

method is designed to eliminate the problems inherent in the rate-equation
formalism to surface chemistry. Here we report the first use of this method in
a chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phase
and surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small number
of diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbon
dioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulation
is started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but no
surface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flat
or rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, O
and CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under the
conditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to a
significant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species,
the evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which in
turn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surface
chemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermal
desorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assorted
molecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr. Our method also allows
determination of the abundance of each molecule in specific monolayers. The
mantle results can be compared with observations of water, carbon dioxide,
carbon monoxide, and methanol ices in the sources W33A and Elias 16. Other than
a slight underproduction of mantle CO, our results are in very good agreement

representation of the super Wilson loop is obtained starting from an effective

invariant under a worldline supersymmetry and has a boundary term which
contains the spin-string interaction. For rectangular loops the spin-string
interaction vanishes and there is no spin-spin term in the resulting heavy

ellipses. Such orbits exert long term torques on each other, which lead to an
enhanced angular momentum relaxation known as resonant relaxation. Under
certain conditions, this process can modify the angular momentum distribution
and affect the interaction rates of the stars with the massive black hole more
efficiently than non-resonant relaxation. The torque on an orbit exerted by the
cluster depends on the eccentricity of the orbit. In this paper, we calculate
this dependence and determine the resonant relaxation timescale as a function
of eccentricity. In particular, we show that the component of the torque that
changes the magnitude of the angular momentum is linearly proportional to
eccentricity, so resonant relaxation is much more efficient on eccentric orbits
than on circular orbits.

properties of superlattices, such as transmission coefficients and valence band
structure. We consider both linear and parabolic modulation of the band edge.
Based on the theory of finite periodic systems (TFPS), analytic expressions and
high precision calculations of the relevant physical quantities for n-cell
systems are obtained. New and also well-known features of these systems are
identified. Besides the well-known energy bandstructure, we also have the field
bandstructure, with interesting characteristics.Wider field gaps at stronger
internal electric fields and higher density of field bands for larger layer
widths are some of these characteristics. Well denned level density asymmetries
identify the minibands induced by charge polarization or the so-called Quantum
Confining Stark Effect. We present the n-cell transmission amplitudes,
transmission coefficients and miniband structures for different values of the
relevant parameters.

INTEGRAL on June 2005, during observations of the Crux spiral arm. To date,
this is the only detection of the source to be reported by any X/gamma-ray
mission. Aims: To characterize the behaviour and hence the nature of the source
through temporal and spectral IBIS analysis. Methods: Detailed spectral and
temporal analysis has been performed using standard INTEGRAL software OSA
v.5.1. Results: To date, IGR J11321-5311 has been detected only once. It was
active for about 3.5 hours, a short and bright flare lasting about 1.5 hours is
evident in the IBIS light curve. It reached a peak flux of about 80 mCrab or
2.2x10E-9 erg cmE-2 sE-1 (20--300 keV),corresponding to a peak luminosity of
1.1x10E37 erg sE-1 (assuming a distance of 6.5 kpc). During the outburst, the
source was detected with a significance of 18 sigma (20--300 keV) and 8 sigma
(100--300 keV). The spectrum of the total outburst activity (17--300 keV) is
best fitted by the sum of a power law (Gamma=0.55+/-0.18) plus a black body
(kT=1.0{+0.2}_{-0.3} keV), with no evidence for a break up to 300 keV. A
spectral analysis at Science Window level revealed an evident hardening of the
spectrum through the outburst. The IBIS data were searched for pulsations with
no positive result. Conclusions: The X-ray spectral shape and the flaring
behaviour favour the hypothesis that IGR J11321-5311 is an Anomalous X-ray
Pulsar, though a different nature can not be firmly rejected at the present
stage.

  GLAST main instrument, with a wide field of view (> 2 sr), a large effective
area (> 8000 cm^2 at 1 GeV) and 20 MeV - 300 GeV energy range, will provide
excellent high energy gamma-ray observations for Dark Matter searches. In this
paper we examine the potential of the LAT to detect gamma-rays coming from
WIMPS annihilation in the context of supersymmetry. As an example, two search
regions are investigated: the galactic center and the galactic satellites.

of regular singularities and an irregular singularity of rank 1 on the Riemann
sphere is equivalent -- up to considering integrable connections as holonomic
$\D$-modules -- to minimal Laplace transform. We assume semi-simplicity and
resonance-freeness conditions, and we work in the framework of objects with a
parabolic structure. In particular, we describe the definition of the parabolic
version of Laplace transform due to C. Sabbah. The proof of the main result
relies on the study of a twisted de Rham complex.
