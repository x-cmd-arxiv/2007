the observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value
for the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due
to the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the

of a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role
in the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to
the central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and
gamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton

higher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless

The results showed good agreement with the observed flat rotation curves of
galaxies and the Pioneer Anomaly. This analysis did not require the
modification of Newtonian dynamics, but rather only their restatement in a five
dimensional framework. The same analysis derived a acceleration parameter ar,
which plays an important role in the restated equations of orbital dynamics,
and suggested a value for ar. In this companion paper, the principle of
conservation of energy is restated within the same five-dimensional framework.
The resulting analysis provides an alternative route to estimating the value of
ar, without reference to the equations of orbital dynamics, and based solely on
key cosmological constants and parameters, including the gravitational
constant, G. The same analysis suggests that: (i) the inverse square law of
gravity may itself be due to the conservation of energy at the boundary between
a four-dimensional universe and a fifth large-scale space-time dimension; and
(ii) there is a limiting case for the Tulley-Fisher relationship linking the
speed of light to the mass of the Universe.

central source mass of $M_* \approx 0.8 M_\sun$ (for a mass accretion rate of
${\dot M}=10^{-6} M_\sun yr^{-1}$). CB54 harbors another near-infrared source
(CB54YC1-I), which was not detected by our observations. The non-detection is
consistent with CB54YC1-I being a highly extinguished embedded young A or B
star or a background G or F giant. An alternative explanation for CB54YC1-I is
that the source is an embedded protostar viewed at an extremely high
inclination angle, and the near-infrared detections are not of the central
protostar, but of light scattered by the accretion disk into our line of sight.
In addition, we have discovered three new mid-infrared sources, which are
spatially coincident with the previously known dense core in CB54. The source
temperatures ($\sim100$K) and association of the mid-infrared sources with the
dense core suggests that these mid-infrared objects may be embedded class 0

warped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to

simplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,
possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that
the spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''
type D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are
geodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5,
however, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit
non-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in
any n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D
Weyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \Phi_{ij}. In the case with
``twistfree'' (A_{ij}=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic''

100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored
since December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within
this period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a
period of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of
this variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3
days. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teff
variation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlation
between the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude the
rotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the
long-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-mass
companion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radial
velocity variation. Assuming a primary mass m1=1.0 +/- 0.1 Msun for the host
star, we calculated a minimum mass of the companion m2sini of 6.1 Mjup, which
lies in the planetary mass regime, and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU.
The orbit of the planet has an eccentricity of e=0.4. The planet discovery
around the young star HD 70573 gives an important input for the study of debris
disks around young stars and their relation to the presence of planets.

only a few parameters which deform the geometry of the unified model. And
because the relative positions of singularities are necessary to compute the
superpotential, for example, this is a framework in which the arbitrariness of
geometrically engineered models can be greatly reduced.

deforming the representations of an SU(5) model into their Standard Model

present a systematic study of giant planet migration in power law discs. We
find that the planetary migration rate is proportional to the disc surface
density. This is inconsistent with the assumption that the migration rate is
simply the viscous drift speed of the disc. However, this result can be
obtained by balancing the angular momentum of the planet with the viscous
torque in the disc. We have verified that this result is not affected by
adjusting the resolution of the grid, the smoothing length used, or the time at

To quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies, we consider
all available extragalactic and pulsar RMs in the region we have surveyed, and
jointly fit these data to simple models in which the large-scale field follows
the spiral arms. In the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourth
Galactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm
(as viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise in
the Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone,

the TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk
reported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk
detected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly
younger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the
disk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which the
dust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures
according to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a
model in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperatures
according to distance. We discuss this disk in the context of known disks in
the TW Hydrae Association and around low-mass stars; a comparison of masses of
disks in the TWA reveals no trend in mass or evolutionary state (gas-rich vs.

high-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably
modeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the
determination of the so-called ""color correction factor"", which is often
empirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum
from a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be
pre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion
rate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier
suggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the
disk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can
be fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color
correction factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra

rates of the nucleating phases. The results show that the Ostwald rule, which
predicts which phase will nucleate, must be modified probabilistically when the
new phases are almost equally stable. Finally, we show that the nucleation rate

azimuthal variations. Although the soft excess emission can be fitted equally
well with both thermal and non-thermal models, its spatial distribution is
neither consistent with the models of intercluster warm-hot filaments, nor with

led to a transition from the high-mass star formation mode of Pop III stars, to
the low-mass mode that dominates today. We ran hydrodynamic simulations with
cosmological initial conditions in the standard LambdaCDM model, with
metallicities, from zero to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginnning at redshift, z = 99. The
simulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 x 10^5
Msolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18. Analysis of the central 1 Msolar core
reveals that the two simulations with the lowest metallicities, Z = 0 and 10^-4
Zsolar, contain one clump with 99% of the mass, while the two with
metallicities, Z = 10^-3 and 10^-2 Zsolar, each contain two clumps that share
most of the mass. The Z = 10^-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two low-mass
proto-stellar objects with masses between 10^-2 and 10^-1 Msolar. Gas with Z >=
10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the temperature of the CMB, which sets a lower
limit to the minimum fragmentation mass. This suggests that the second
generation stars produced a spectrum of lower mass stars, but were still more
massive on average than stars formed in the local universe.

color distribution of stars in the horizontal-branch (HB) phase. This
phenomenon is now best understood as due to the presence of helium enhanced
second generation subpopulations, which has raised a possibility that these
peculiar GCs might have a unique origin. Here we show that these GCs with
extended HB are clearly distinct from other normal GCs in kinematics and mass.
The GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated by
random motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity.
Surprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the inner
halo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to the
formation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematic
properties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretion
origin. Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and we
anticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed investigations of
Milky Way formation, including early mergers, collapse, and later accretion.

model is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model
by using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations.
The mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no
two-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are
composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a
compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of
triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an
inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside
the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.
However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;
there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases
mentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending
rigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the
fluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases.

percolative superconductor is considered. The superconductor contains
percolative superconducting cluster carrying a transport current and clusters
of a normal phase, acting as pinning centers. A prototype of such a structure
is YBCO film, containing clusters of columnar defects, as well as the BSCCO/Ag
sheathed tape, which is of practical interest for wire fabrication. Transition
of the superconductor into a resistive state corresponds to the percolation
transition from a pinned vortex state to a resistive state when the vortices
are free to move. The dependencies of the free vortex density on the fractal
dimension of the cluster boundary as well as the resistance on the transport
current are obtained. It is revealed that a mixed state of the vortex glass
type is realized in the superconducting system involved. The current-voltage
characteristics of superconductors containing fractal clusters are obtained and
their features are studied.

Hartree-Fock theory. The pre-equilibrium Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) is used
to probe the fusion path. It is shown that such isovector collective state is
excited in N/Z asymmetric fusion and to a less extent in mass asymmetric
systems. The characteristics of this GDR are governed by the structure of the
fused system in its preequilibrium phase, like its deformation, rotation and
vibration. In particular, we show that a lowering of the pre-equilibrium GDR
energy is expected as compared to the statistical one. Revisiting experimental
data, we extract an evidence of this lowering for the first time. We also
quantify the fusion-evaporation enhancement due to gamma-ray emission from the
pre-equilibrium GDR. This cooling mechanism along the fusion path may be
suitable to synthesize in the future super heavy elements using radioactive
beams with strong N/Z asymmetries in the entrance channel.

myriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routing
problem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the
source to the destination. We find that for a given route, the
decode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative
coding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by
the usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative
coding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms
of rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithm
runs in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that
runs in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when
the nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategies
using practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance of
the strategies on different routes.

coexistence of a predator-prey system. The individuals of each species are
localized over the sites of a lattice and the local stochastic updating rules
are inspired on the processes of the Lotka-Volterra model. Two levels of
mean-field approximations are set up. The simple approximation is equivalent to
an extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonized
by prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximation
is capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. The
pair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence of
prey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time and
another displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the population
densities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise through
a Hopf bifurcation. They are stable against changes in the initial conditions
and, in this sense, they differ from the Lotka-Volterra cycles which depend on
initial conditions. In this respect, the present model is biologically more
realistic than the Lotka-Volterra model.

Evolutionary theory predicts that IPs with long orbital periods evolve through

resulting objects are. Whilst a relatively large number of long-period IPs are
known, very few of these have short orbital periods. We present phase-resolved
spectroscopy and photometry of SDSS J233325.92+152222.1 and classify it as the
IP with the shortest known orbital period (83.12 +/- 0.09 min), which contains
a white dwarf with a relatively long spin period (41.66 +/- 0.13 min). We
estimate the white dwarf's magnetic moment to be mu(WD) \approx 2 x 10^33 G
cm^3, which is not only similar to three of the other four confirmed
short-period IPs but also to those of many of the long-period IPs. We suggest
that long-period IPs conserve their magnetic moment as they evolve towards
shorter orbital periods. Therefore the dominant population of long-period IPs,
which have white dwarf spin periods roughly ten times shorter than their

temperatures are of the order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatial
differentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhanced
at the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperature
sensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. The
SiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from this
hot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hot
core and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons for
that are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the main
submm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to the
large-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of the
central protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk. While the data are
consistent with a gas core that may rotate and/or collapse, we cannot exclude
the outflow(s) and/or nearby expanding UCHII region as possible alternative
causes of this velocity pattern.

one-to-many throughput capacity) of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop networks. It has
generally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput
capacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not
achievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of ""canonical
networks"", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities
can be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the
throughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper
bound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;
and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many
hops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general
networks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper
bound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with
random topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far
below the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the
gateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to
fashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be
improved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is
worthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.

Temperature dependences of their intensities and the relation between the

ferroelectricity. Resonant x-ray scattering results demonstrate the presence of
multiple magnetic orders by exhibiting their different temperature dependences.
The commensurate-to-incommensurate phase transition around 24 K is attributed
to discommensuration through phase slipping of the magnetic orders in spin
frustrated geometries. We proposed that the low temperature incommensurate
phase consists of the commensurate magnetic domains separated by anti-phase
domain walls which reduce spontaneous polarizations abruptly at the transition.

Experimentally, the self-diffusion coefficient of Ni is measured by the

method yields also the interdiffusion coefficient. Whereas the experiments were
done in the normal liquid state, the simulations provided the determination of
both self-diffusion and interdiffusion constants in the undercooled regime as
well. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental data. In
the temperature range 3000 K >= T >= 715 K, the interdiffusion coefficient is
larger than the self-diffusion constants. Furthermore the simulation shows that
this difference becomes larger in the undercooled regime. This result can be
refered to a relatively strong temperature dependence of the thermodynamic
factor \Phi, which describes the thermodynamic driving force for
interdiffusion. The simulations also indicate that the Darken equation is a
good approximation, even in the undercooled regime. This implies that dynamic
cross correlations play a minor role for the temperature range under

with INTEGRAL and a confirmed member of the new class of High Mass X-ray
Binaries, the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). Archival INTEGRAL data
and RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of
~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic
outbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of
Opportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source
behaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The
source field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th
February, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,
during a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure
of ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a
SFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed
power law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak
luminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of
the optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an
outburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,
and they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost
quiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously
thought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the
brightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly
increasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit
with many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous
accretion.

vector bosons caused by spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation (SLIV). To
this end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the
nonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \boldsymbol{A}_{\mu
}\boldsymbol{A}^{\mu})=\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is
considered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators
not only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry
$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken
as well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one
genuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons
related to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement
of the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain
strictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory
involved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and
$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn
out to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.
However, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge
invariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.
For the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could
become directly observable at low energies.

cross sections on particle production is investigated in heavy ion collisions
($HIC$) at intermediate energies. In particular, using a fully covariant
relativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\it
inelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and
their rapidity distributions. However, the $(\pi^{-}/\pi^{+})$- and
$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the
inelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,
since kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon
potentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative
approach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results
showing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As a
consequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We conclude
that particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclear
equation of state ($EoS$) at high baryon density and, particularly, its
isovector sector.

expressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlators, notably the Laughlin
wave function at filling factor $\nu=1/m$ ($m$ odd) and its quasiholes, and the
Pfaffian wave function at $\nu=1/2$ and its quasiholes. We develop a general
scheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal
field theory. Quasiparticles at $\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic
vertex operators, $P_{\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron
operators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical
to the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function
has correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost
identical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly
represent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT
correlators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,
constructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT
representation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\rm
th}$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- and
quasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge and
statistics. For filling fractions 2/5 and 3/7 we show that the chiral CFTs that
describe the bulk wave functions are identical to those given by Wen's general
classification of quantum Hall states in terms of $K$-matrices and $l$- and
$t$-vectors, and we propose that to be generally true. Our results suggest a
general procedure for constructing quasiparticle wave functions for other
fractional Hall states, as well as for constructing ground states at filling

New expressions are derived for the different contributions to the noise budget

Correlated noise that is constant with apparent stellar magnitude implies a

considered jointly with the radial velocity requirements, can severely limit
the potential of otherwise promising surveys in star clusters. However, we find

measure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force

  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify

beat an arbitrarily strong delta-pinning in 2 dimensions and will cause
delocalization. The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap
between local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. In 2
dimensions it implies growth faster than the volume which is a contradiction to
localization. We also derive a simple complementary inequality which shows that

observations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation
efficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this
tension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust
formation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first
time, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to
their survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.
We find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun
stellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between
2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on
time-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by
the hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller
grains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that
derived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of
small grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports
the idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present
in SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.

  of NiS$_{2}$ pyrite","4 pages",,,,"cond-mat.str-el",,"  A quantum critical point (QCP) between the antiferromagnetic and the
paramagnetic phases was realized by applying a hydrostatic pressure of ~ 7 GPa
on single crystals of NiS_{2} pyrite with a low residual resistivity, rho_{0},
of 0.5 mu-Omega-cm. We found that the critical behavior of the resistivity,
rho, in this clean system contrasts sharply with those observed in its
disordered analogue, NiS_{2-x}Se_{x} solid-solution, demonstrating the
unexpectedly drastic effect of disorder on the quantum criticality. Over a
whole paramagnetic region investigated up to P = 9 GPa, a crossover
temperature, defined as the onset of T^{2} dependence of rho, an indication of
Fermi liquid, was suppressed to a substantially low temperature T sim 2 K and,
instead, a non Fermi liquid behavior of rho, T^{3/2}-dependence, robustly
showed up.

broadened atomic oscillators. To this end the diagram series of electromagnetic
propagators is calculated exactly for an infinite bi-cubic lattice of
dielectric and magnetic dipoles for a lattice constant small compared to the
resonance wavelength $\lambda$. Modifications of transition frequencies and
linewidth of the elementary oscillators are taken into account in a
selfconsistent way by a proper incorporation of the singular self-interaction
terms. We show that in radiatively broadened media sufficiently close to the
free-space resonance the real part of the index of refraction approaches the
value -2 in the limit of $\rho \lambda^3 \gg 1$, where $\rho$ is the number
density of scatterers. Since at the same time the imaginary part vanishes as
$1/\rho$ local field effects can have important consequences for realizing
low-loss negative index materials.

coexist in space and time, cross-talk between the two evolving hadronic systems
may be possible during fragmentation through soft gluon exchange. This effect
is known as Colour Reconnection. In this article the results of the
investigation of Colour Reconnection effects in fully hadronic decays of W

have strict topological constraints and consequently they cannot take into
account a wide range of external stimuli. Furthermore their evolution is
conditioned by deterministic laws which often are not correlated with the
structural parameters and the global status of the network, as it should happen
in a real biological system. In nature the environmental inputs are noise
affected and fuzzy. Which thing sets the problem to investigate the possibility
of emergent behaviour in a not strictly constrained net and subjected to
different inputs. It is here presented a new model of Evolutionary Neural Gas
(ENG) with any topological constraints, trained by probabilistic laws depending
on the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network is
considered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing local
and global resources. Those particular features allow the network to quickly
adapt to the environment, according to its dimensions. The ENG model analysis
shows that the net evolves as a scale-free graph, and justifies in a deeply
physical sense- the term gas here used.
