  fluid model","23 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field
fluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004,
American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees
with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the
Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil
evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5
billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests
that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the
Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from
Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts
that the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate
about -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).

observed in experiments with various levels of electromagnetic pumping. At the
pumping level growth, the clearly depined increasing of the number of
coexisting SE states has been observed both in real physical experiments and in

density in the phase space. The nature of the refractority of SE pulses is

  Aims. To provide the community with an online repository of X-ray light
curves obtained with Swift. The light curves should be of the quality expected
of published data, but automatically created and updated so as to be
self-consistent and rapidly available. Methods. We have produced a suite of
programs which automatically generates Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs. Effects
of the damage to the CCD, automatic readout-mode switching and pile-up are
appropriately handled, and the data are binned with variable bin durations, as
necessary for a fading source.
  Results. The light curve repository website

nearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin
a=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits
whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect
to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.
This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite
to the ""normal"" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted
previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to
the black hole, they were named ""nearly horizon-skimming orbits"". Our analysis
generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)
family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits
reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming
orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial
configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing
orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial
configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the
earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly
horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes
based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to
equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for
eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination
change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are
not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms
expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.

circulation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum
is constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantized
vortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids.

dephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,

(non-frustrated). The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is
invoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the
transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore
the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation
functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for
the three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks
at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero
magnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization
plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and
$4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the
zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear
superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is
observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of
the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the
susceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the
peak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the
couplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings
leads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition,
the experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization
for the compound Cu$_{3}$(CO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(OH)$_{2}$ are fairly compared with

the conditional average is proposed. The analysis of its properties is based
upon a new definition of prediction quality. The joint experimental information
and the redundancy of joint measurements are expressed by the relative entropy.
With the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the
experimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference
between this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of
data represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the
true properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and the
redundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable number
of data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutual
information is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of the

used to indicate which variable is the independent one. The properties of the

the mass in medium are based on an incorrect treatment of the model Lagrangian;
more consistent calculations lead to a significant broadening, but hardly any
mass shift. We stress that the experimental reconstruction of hadron spectral
functions from measured decay products always requires knowledge of the decay
branching ratios which may also be strongly mass-dependent. It also requires a
quantitatively reliable treatment of final state interactions which has to be
part of any reliable theory.

foliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and
classification of pairs $(M,\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In
this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \cite{Reeb} states that a manifold
admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.
In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these
lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a
real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In
the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To
do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities
and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an
elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle
configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if
other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,
proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At
this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\F)$ of the foliation $\F$, we
consider {\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components
admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\F)$ admits
only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic
to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of
a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type
result.

single weak phase $\alpha$ just in the $\Delta I=3/2$ amplitudes, the isospin
relations and experimental data. Beside those analyses, we extract $\alpha$
through the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is no

wide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmission
peaks on the both sides of the Fermi level. The electronic transport properties
of the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are
mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by
the perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated
on-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about
two orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the

the two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By
analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse
proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:
QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,
$\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$
arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably
created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the
corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of
the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the
UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three
foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background
models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal
line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints
on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars
show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of
the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.
Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in
overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.
Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative
transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed
spectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of
QSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.

ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most
complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that
its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the

sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only
appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of
similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the
enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a

Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit,
as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found
that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are
directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency,

holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating

longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either

poset, where the poset rank of $\pi_i$ equals $r_i$, and where the ""block

all known enumerative results on ordinary and generalised non-crossing
partitions via appropriate summations. Surprisingly, this result on multi-chain
enumeration is new even for the original non-crossing partitions of Kreweras.
Moreover, the result allows one to solve the problem of rank-selected chain
enumeration in the type $D_n$ generalised non-crossing partitions poset, which,
in turn, leads to a proof of Armstrong's $F=M$ Conjecture in type $D_n$.

class II T-Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/I
protostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after
accounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census
of IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially
with the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around
a B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery
about 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find
that the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that
rate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,
starless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population
indicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show that
the IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its
smooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While
it seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of
dynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings
support a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller
sub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that the
supposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud should
not preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.

from the hot gas heated by interaction of the blast wave with the ring-like
dense circumstellar medium (CSM) that was produced by the massive progenitor's
equatorial stellar winds before the SN explosion. The blast wave is now
sweeping through dense CSM all around the inner ring, and thus SN 1987A is
rapidly brightening in soft X-rays. At the age of 20 yr (as of 2007 January),
X-ray luminosity of SN 1987A is $L_{\rm X}$ $\sim$ 2.4 $\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergs

plane shock model with electron temperatures of $kT$ $\sim$ 0.3 and 2 keV. As
the shock front interacts with dense CSM all around the inner ring, the X-ray
remnant is now expanding at a much slower rate of $v$ $\sim$ 1400 km s$^{-1}$

receiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively
activates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of
Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected
from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed
entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,
which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the
transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of
beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system
refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go
to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,
i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The
performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar
quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random
subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and
approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers
(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show
that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size
systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples
show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only
slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched
filter can require significantly more feedback.

of combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this subtraction
and the flow harmonics v2 and v4 are investigated in detail. The implications
of the results for the presence or absence of conical flow from Mach-cones are
discussed.

forward in time, all evidence of the Hubble expansion will disappear, so that
observers in our ""island universe"" will be fundamentally incapable of
determining the true nature of the universe, including the existence of the
highly dominant vacuum energy, the existence of the CMB, and the primordial
origin of light elements. With these pillars of the modern Big Bang gone, this
epoch will mark the end of cosmology and the return of a static universe. In
this sense, the coordinate system appropriate for future observers will perhaps
fittingly resemble the static coordinate system in which the de Sitter universe
was first presented.

into account the important effect of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the

`quasi-static' asymptotic solutions around the central degenerate core to
explore an MHD model for the evolution of random magnetic field in supernova
explosions. This provides a theoretical basis for further studying synchrotron
diagnostics, MHD shock acceleration of cosmic rays, and the nature of intense
magnetic field in compact objects. The magnetic field strength in space
approaches a limiting ratio, that is comparable to the ratio of the ejecta mass
driven out versus the progenitor mass, during this self-similar rebound MHD
shock evolution. The intense magnetic field of the remnant compact star as
compared to that of the progenitor star is mainly attributed to both the
gravitational core collapse and the radial distribution of magnetic field.

Results are shown for pp, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV$. We observe a 3-particle correlation in central Au+Au
collisions which may indicate the presence of conical emission. In addition,
the dependence of the observed signal angular position on the $p_T$ of the
associated particles can be used to distinguish conical flow from simple
QCD-\v{C}erenkov radiation. An important aspect of the analysis is the
subtraction of combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this
subtraction and the flow harmonics $v_2$ and $v_4$ are investigated in detail.
