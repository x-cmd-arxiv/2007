mass is distributed in such a way that numerous clumps are embedded on top of a
low density background. At the larger scales from 73 to 194 pc, it shows a
generic hole topology. These holes might have been formed mainly by stellar
winds from hot stars. At the scales from 240 to 340 pc, slightly above the disk
scale-height of the gaseous disk, major clumps in the HI map change the

cloud associations in the spiral arms and the thick filaments surrounding
superholes. At the largest scales studied (390-485 pc), the hole topology is
present again. Responsible to the hole topology at this scale are a few
superholes which seem mainly associated with supernova explosions in the outer

parabolization of the Arnowitt, Deser, Misner (ADM) formulation and is derived
by addition of combinations of the constraints and their derivatives to the

modification is that it turns the surface of constraints into a local attractor
because the constraint propagation equations become second-order parabolic
independently of the gauge conditions employed. This system may be classified
as mixed hyperbolic - second-order parabolic. The second formulation is a
parabolization of the Kidder, Scheel, Teukolsky formulation and is a manifestly
mixed strongly hyperbolic - second-order parabolic set of equations, bearing
thus resemblance to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. As a first test,
a stability analysis of flat space is carried out and it is shown that the
first modification exponentially damps and smoothes all constraint violating
modes. These systems provide a new basis for constructing schemes for long-term
and stable numerical integration of the Einstein field equations.

the transition point both numerically and using the renormalization group

integrate exactly over all spatial degrees of freedoms in the model and to
reduce the initial problem to the analysis of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of
some special non-Hermitian random matrix with disorder--dependent diagonal and
constant off-diagonal coefficients. We show that even for strong disorder the

quantum verifier and two entangled provers or (ii) classical verifier and three
entangled provers. Previously it was not even known if computing the value
exactly is NP-hard. We also describe a mathematical conjecture, which, if true,
would imply hardness of approximation to within a constant.
  We start our proof by describing two ways to modify classical multi-prover
games to make them resistant to entangled provers. We then show that a strategy
for the modified game that uses entanglement can be ``rounded'' to one that
does not. The results then follow from classical inapproximability bounds. Our
work implies that, unless P=NP, the values of entangled-prover games cannot be
computed by semidefinite programs that are polynomial in the size of the
verifier's system, a method that has been successful for more restricted
quantum games.

trapped plasma can be supplied and replenished by either direct injection of
relativistic pairs from acceleration of externally-supplied particles in a
dormant outer gap or in situ ionization of the accreted neutral material in the
trapping region. The radiation belts can be disrupted by waves that are excited
in the region as the result of plasma instabilities or emitted from the surface
due to starquakes or stellar oscillations. The disruption can cause an
intermittent particle precipitation toward the star producing radio bursts. It

applications have emerged for which the quantum properties of dopant atoms act
as the functional part of the device, underscoring the necessity to probe the
quantum structure of small numbers of dopant atoms in semiconductors[1-3].
Although dopant properties are well-understood with respect to bulk
semiconductors, new questions arise in nanosystems. For example, the quantum
energy levels of dopants will be affected by the proximity of nanometer-scale
electrodes. Moreover, because shallow donors and acceptors are analogous to
hydrogen atoms, experiments on small numbers of dopants have the potential to
be a testing ground for fundamental questions of atomic and molecular physics,
such as the maximum negative ionization of a molecule with a given number of
positive ions[4,5]. Electron tunneling spectroscopy through isolated dopants
has been observed in transport studies[6,7]. In addition, Geim and coworkers
identified resonances due to two closely spaced donors, effectively forming
donor molecules[8]. Here we present capacitance spectroscopy measurements of
silicon donors in a gallium-arsenide heterostructure using a scanning probe
technique[9,10]. In contrast to the work of Geim et al., our data show
discernible peaks attributed to successive electrons entering the molecules.
Hence this work represents the first addition spectrum measurement of dopant
molecules. More generally, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the
first example of single-electron capacitance spectroscopy performed directly
with a scanning probe tip[9].

affine with an exponent zeta=0.46 +- 0.05 over a range of length scales ranging
from the grain size d up to an upper cut-off length \xi = 0.15 W. This low zeta
value is in agreement with measurements on other sandstones and on sintered
materials. The probability distributions P(delta z,delta h) of the variations
of height over different distances delta z > d can be collapsed onto a single
Gaussian distribution with a suitable normalisation and do not display
multifractal features. The roughness amplitude, as characterized by the
height-height correlation over fixed distances delta z, does not depend on the
sample width, implying that no anomalous scaling of the type reported for other
materials is present. It is suggested, in agreement with recent theoretical
work, to explain these results by the occurence of brittle fracture (instead of
damage failure in materials displaying a higher value of zeta = 0.8).

vigorously over the organisation of the theory of bilinear forms. That theory
promised a ""general"" and ""homogeneous"" treatment of numerous questions arising
in various 19th-century theoretical contexts, and it hinged on two theorems,
stated independently by Jordan and Weierstrass, that would today be considered
equivalent. It was, however, the perceived difference between those two
theorems that sparked the 1874 controversy. Focusing on this quarrel allows us
to explore the algebraic identity of the polynomial practices of the
manipulations of forms in use before the advent of structural approaches to
linear algebra. The latter approaches identified these practices with methods
for the classification of similar matrices. We show that the prac- tices --
Jordan's canonical reduction and Kronecker's invariant computation -- reflect
identities inseparable from the social context of the time. Moreover, these
practices reveal not only tacit knowledge, local ways of thinking, but also --
in light of a long history tracing back to the work of Lagrange, Laplace, Cau-
chy, and Hermite -- two internal philosophies regarding the significance of
generality which are inseparable from two disciplinary ideals opposing algebra
and arithmetic. By interrogating the cultural identities of such practices,
this study aims at a deeper understanding of the history of linear algebra
without focusing on issues related to the origins of theories or structures.

more prevalent, and more prominent than in any other previously used infall
tracers such as CS J = 2-1, DCO+ J = 2-1, and N2H+ J = 1-0. We found close
relation between the intensities of the HCN and N2H+ lines. This implies that
the HCN is not much depleted in the central regions of the cores. In some
cores, the HCN spectra show different sign of asymmetry from other molecular
lines. A few cores show various signs of asymmetry in individual HCN hyperfine
lines. The distribution of the velocity shift dV of the HCN profiles with
respect to the systemic velocity of the optically thin tracer is found to be
more shifted toward bluer side than those of other infall tracers, indicating
that the HCN traces inward motions more frequently. The dV distribution of each
HCN hyperfine line for all sources is similar. Moreover the dV values obtained
from different HCN hyperfine lines for each source are nearly similar. These
may mean that most of starless cores are in similar kinematic states across the
layers of the cores. We identify 17 infall candidates using all available
indicators such as the velocity shift dV and the blue to red peak intensity
ratio of double peaked profiles for HCN J = 1-0, CS J = 2-1, J = 3-2, DCO+ J =

$\log g = 4.4\pm 0.1$, and [Fe/H] $= -0.15\pm 0.10$. Several independent checks
(e.g., additional spectroscopy, line-depth ratios) confirm the reliability of
our spectroscopic $T_\mathrm{eff}$ estimate. The mass and radius of the star,
needed to determine the properties of the planet, are traditionally inferred by
comparison with stellar evolution models using $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and some
measure of the stellar luminosity, such as the spectroscopic surface gravity
(when a trigonometric parallax is unavailable, as in this case). We apply here
a new method in which we use instead of $\log g$ the normalized separation
$a/R_\star$ (related to the stellar density), which can be determined directly
from the light curves of transiting planets with much greater precision. With
the $a/R_\star$ value from the light curve analysis of Holman et al.
\citeyearpar{holman07b} and our $T_\mathrm{eff}$ estimate we obtain $M_\star =
0.980\pm0.062 M_\odot$ and $R_\star = 1.000_{-0.033}^{+0.036} R_\odot$, and an
evolutionary age of $5.1^{+2.7}_{-2.3}$ Gyr, in good agreement with other
constraints based on the strength of the emission in the \ion{Ca}{2} H & K line
cores, the Lithium abundance, and rotation. The new stellar parameters yield
improved values for the planetary mass and radius of $M_p = 1.198 \pm 0.053

centered on the association NGC 346 and contains almost 100,000 stars down to V
~28 mag. In this study we focus on the northern part of the region, which
covers almost the whole stellar content of BS 90. We construct its stellar
surface density profile and derive structural parameters. Isochrone fits on the
CMD of the cluster results in an age of about 4.5 Gyr. The luminosity function
is constructed and the present-day mass function of BS 90 has been obtained
using the mass-luminosity relation, derived from the isochrone models. We found
a slope between -1.30 and -0.95, comparable or somewhat shallower than a
typical Salpeter IMF. Examination of the radial dependence of the mass function
shows a steeper slope at larger radial distances, indicating mass segregation
in the cluster. The derived half-mass relaxation time of 0.95 Gyr suggests that
the cluster is mass segregated due to its dynamical evolution. From the
isochrone model fits we derive a metallicity for BS 90 of [Fe/H]=-0.72, which
adds an important point to the age-metallicity relation of the SMC. We discuss
our findings on this relation in comparison to other SMC clusters.

a significant dependence of the global transport on the magnetic Prandtl

$200<Re<6400$ ($\delta$ being in the range 0.25 to 0.5). We show that the

$\gamma \approx 0.55$, while the DGP model $\gamma \approx 0.68$. To determine
if future imaging surveys can constrain $\gamma$ within 20 percent (or

dynamic approach. The transmission shows weak dependence on frequency for the
lattice wave with a fixed angle of incidence. The dependence on azimuth angle
is found to be related to the symmetry of the boundary interface. The
transmission varies smoothly with the change of the incident angle. A critical
angle of incidence exists when the phonon is incident from the side with large
group velocities to the side with low ones. No significant mode conversion is
observed among different acoustic wave branches at the interface, except when
the incident angle is near the critical value. Our theoretical result of the
Kapitza conductance $G_{K}$ across the Si-Ge (100) interface at temperature
$T=200 $K is $4.6\times10^{8} {\rm WK}^{-1}{\rmm}^{-2}$. A scaling law $G_K
\propto T^{2.87}$ at low temperature is also reported. Based on the features of

extrapolated from surface magnetograms obtained from Zeeman-Doppler imaging.
Such fields consist of compact magnetic regions close to the stellar surface,
with extended field lines interacting with the disc. We study the propagation
of coronal X-rays through the magnetosphere and demonstrate that they are
strongly absorbed by the dense gas in accretion columns. The reduction in the
observed X-ray emission depends on the field geometry, which may explain why
accreting T Tauri stars show a larger scatter in their observed X-ray
luminosity compared to non-accreting stars.

Hermitian but are symmetric under space-time reflection, that is, Hamiltonians
that exhibit PT symmetry. Investigations of the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue
problem associated with such Hamiltonians have shown that in many cases the
entire energy spectrum is real and positive and that the eigenfunctions form an
orthogonal and complete basis. Furthermore, the quantum theories determined by
such Hamiltonians have been shown to be consistent in the sense that the
probabilities are positive and the dynamical trajectories are unitary. However,
the geometrical structures that underlie quantum theories formulated in terms
of such Hamiltonians have hitherto not been fully understood. This paper
studies in detail the geometric properties of a Hilbert space endowed with a
parity structure and analyses the characteristics of a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian
and its eigenstates. A canonical relationship between a PT-symmetric operator
and a Hermitian operator is established. It is shown that the quadratic form
corresponding to the parity operator, in particular, gives rise to a natural
partition of the Hilbert space into two halves corresponding to states having
positive and negative PT norm. The indefiniteness of the norm can be
circumvented by introducing a symmetry operator C that defines a positive
definite inner product by means of a CPT conjugation operation.

accretion rate AGN can be well modelled by reflection from a partially ionised
accretion disc. However, the derived parameters are often extreme, both in
terms of the underlying spacetime and the reflection geometry, and these models
require that the disc is far from hydrostatic equilibrium. An alternative model
uses similarly partially ionised, velocity smeared material but seen in
absorption, though again the derived velocities are extreme, requiring magnetic
driving (in the jet?) rather than a simple line driven disc wind. We find that
while both models give comparably good fits to XMM--Newton data, we favour the
absorption model as, unlike reflection, all the derived spectral indices are
soft. This is as expected by analogy with the correspondingly high mass
accretion rate stellar mass black holes. Furthermore, these X-ray spectra are
consistent with a one--to--one mapping between AGN type and spectral state,
with NLS1's having softer spectra corresponding to the very high state, while
the broad line AGN have Gamma~2 as expected for the high/soft state. We also
use the simultaneous OM data to derive the ratio of disc to total accretion
power which is another tracer of spectral state in X-ray binaries. This does
not always show that the disc in NLS1's contributes less than 80 per cent of
the total power, as expected for a very high state. We suggest that this is an
artifact of the standard disc models used to determine the disc luminosity in
our fits. The disc seen in the very high state of black hole binaries is often
observed to be distorted from the standard shape, and a similar effect in
NLS1's could recover the correspondance between black hole binary spectral
state and AGN type.

flux >= 10^-14 cgs, and in this paper we examine a subsample of 42 optically
bright (r < 21) sources; this subsample is 100 per cent spectroscopically
identified. All but one of the optical counterparts are extragalactic, and we
argue that the single exception, a Galactic M star, is probably a coincidental
association. The X-ray spectra are consistent with heavily absorbed power laws
(21.8 < log NH < 23.4), and all of them appear to be absorbed AGN. The majority
of the sources show only narrow emission lines in their optical spectra,
implying that they are type-2 AGN. Only a small fraction of the sources (7/42)
show broad optical emission lines, and all of these have NH < 10^23 cm^-2. This
implies that ratios of X-ray absorption to optical/UV extinction equivalent to
> 100 times the Galactic gas-to-dust ratio are rare in AGN absorbers (at most a
few percent of the population), and may be restricted to broad absorption-line
QSOs. Seven objects appear to have an additional soft X-ray component in
addition to the heavily absorbed power law. We consider the implications of our
results in the light of the AGN unified scheme. We find that the soft
components in narrow-line objects are consistent with the unified scheme
provided that > 4 per cent of broad-line AGN have ionised absorbers that
attenuate their soft X-ray flux by >50 per cent. In at least one of the X-ray
absorbed, broad-line AGN in our sample the X-ray spectrum requires an ionised
absorber, consistent with this picture.

lacking planets. In the present work we study the possibility of an earlier
metal enrichment of the photospheres by means of impacting planetesimals during
the first 20-30Myr. Here we explore this contamination process by simulating
the interactions of an inward migrating planet with a disc of planetesimal
interior to its orbit. The results show the percentage of planetesimals that
fall on the star. We identified the dependence of the planet's eccentricity
($e_p$) and time scale of migration ($\tau$) on the rate of infalling
planetesimals. For very fast migrations ($\tau=10^2$yr and $\tau=10^3$yr) there
is no capture in mean motion resonances, independently of the value of $e_p$.
Then, due to the planet's migration the planetesimals suffer close approaches
with the planet and more than 80% of them are ejected from the system. For slow
migrations ($\tau=10^5$yr and $\tau=10^6$yr) the percentage of collisions with
the planet decrease with the increase of the planet's eccentricity. For $e_p=0$
and $e_p=0.1$ most of the planetesimals were captured in the 2:1 resonance and
more than 65% of them collided with the star. Whereas migration of a Jupiter
mass planet to very short pericentric distances requires unrealistic high disc
masses, these requirements are much smaller for smaller migrating planets. Our
simulations for a slowly migrating 0.1 $M_{\rm Jupiter}$ planet, even demanding
a possible primitive disc three times more massive than a primitive solar
nebula, produces maximum [Fe/H] enrichments of the order of 0.18 dex. These
calculations open possibilities to explain hot Jupiters exoplanets
metallicities.

a sequence of three earlier papers under the title, A Dust Universe Solution to

mismatch of numerical values between dark energy from cosmology and zero point
energy from quantum theory. It is shown that, if the zero point energies for
the cosmic microwave background and for all the rest of the universe that is
not cosmic microwave background are introduced into this model as two entities,
their separate values appear within this theory in the form of a numerical
difference. It is this difference that gives the numerical value for the zero
point value of Einstein's dark energy density. Consequently, although the two
zero point energies may be large, their difference can give the known small
dark energy value from cosmology for dark energy density. Issues relating to
interpretation, calculation and measurement associated with this result and an
interpretation of dark energy as a measure of polarisation of the vacuum are
discussed. In the first appendix to this paper, problems associated with the
standard model of cosmology are solved by redefining temperature in the dust

jets, which is free of final-state logarithms to all orders and such that all
initial-state collinear logarithms can be resummed into the heavy-quark parton
distributions. Heavy-jet spectra can then be calculated in the massless
approximation, which is simpler than a massive calculation and reduces the
theoretical uncertainties by a factor of three. This provides the first ever
accurate predictions for inclusive b- and c-jets, and the latter have
significant discriminatory power for the intrinsic charm content of the proton.
The techniques introduced here could be used to obtain heavy-flavour jet
results from existing massless next-to-leading order calculations for a wide

is more difficult to separate the two Chooz reactors that are viewed at a

the ability to store information at intermediate timescales, like 10s of
seconds -- is implemented in realistic neuronal networks. The most likely
candidate mechanism is the attractor network, and a great deal of effort has
gone toward investigating it theoretically. Yet, despite almost a quarter
century of intense work, attractor networks are not fully understood. In
particular, there are still two unanswered questions. First, how is it that
attractor networks exhibit irregular firing, as is observed experimentally
during working memory tasks? And second, how many memories can be stored under
biologically realistic conditions? Here we answer both questions by studying an
attractor neural network in which inhibition and excitation balance each other.
Using mean field analysis, we derive a three-variable description of attractor
networks. From this description it follows that irregular firing can exist only
if the number of neurons involved in a memory is large. The same mean field

scales with the number of excitatory connections, a result that has been

distribution are not evident in thermodynamic systems of large $N$ (the number

validity of this perception by investigating whether such fluctuations can in
reality depend on temperature.
  Firstly, we describe fluctuations in the occupation numbers of the energy
levels for an isolated system, using previously unknown identities that we have
derived for the purpose, which allow us to calculate the moments of the
occupation numbers. Then we compute analytically the probability distribution
of these fluctuations. We show that, for every system of fixed and finite $N$,
fluctuations about the equilibrium distribution do, in fact, depend on the
temperature. Indeed, at higher temperatures the fluctuations can be so large
that the system does not fully converge on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
but actually fluctuates around it. We term this state, where not one macrostate
but a region of macrostates closely fit the underlying distribution, a ``{\it
fluctuating equilibrium}''. Finally, we speculate on how this finding is
applicable to networks, financial markets, and other thermodynamic-like
systems.

reveal the presence of a hot core internally heated by an intermediate mass

600AUx100AU and mass of 1M_sun. Keplerian rotation for the disk velocity
gradient of 5 kms-1 requires a 9 M_sun central star, which cannot explain the
total luminosity observed in the region. This may indicate that the disk does
not rotate with a Keplerian law due to the extreme youth of this object. Our
high sensitivity radiocontinuum image at 7 mm shows in addition to the ionized
jet, an extended emission to the west (and marginally to the south) of the HW2
jet, filling the south-west cavity of the HW2 disk. From the morphology and
location of this free-free continuum emission at centimeter and millimeter
wavelengths (spectral index of 0.4-1.5), we propose that the disk is
photoevaporating due to the UV radiation from the central star. All this

electron are commonly modeled by the nonequilibrium Kondo model, describing the
exchange interaction of a spin-1/2 local moment with two leads of
noninteracting electrons. Remarkably, the model possesses an exact solution
when tuned to a special manifold in its parameter space known as the Toulouse
limit. We use the Toulouse limit to exactly calculate the adiabatically pumped
spin current in the Kondo regime. In the absence of both potential scattering
and a voltage bias, the instantaneous charge current is strictly zero for a
generic Kondo model. However, a nonzero spin current can be pumped through the
system in the presence of a finite magnetic field, provided the spin couples
asymmetrically to the two leads. Tunneling through a Kondo impurity thus offers
a natural mechanism for generating a pure spin current. We show, in particular,
that one can devise pumping cycles along which the average spin pumped per
cycle is closely equal to $\hbar$. By analogy with Brouwer's formula for
noninteracting systems with two driven parameters, the pumped spin current is
expressed as a geometrical property of a scattering matrix. However, the
relevant %Alex: I replaced topological with geometrical in the sentence above
scattering matrix that enters the formulation pertains to the Majorana fermions
that appear at the Toulouse limit rather than the physical electrons that carry
the current. These results are obtained by combining the nonequilibrium Keldysh
Green function technique with a systematic gradient expansion, explicitly
exposing the small parameter controlling the adiabatic limit.

of linewidths whose numerical values (34, 13 & 6 km/s) appear to be related to
the critical ionization velocities (CIVs) of the most abundant interstellar

km/s wide component, probably corresponding to the CIV for helium, is
pervasive. The 34 km/s wide linewidth family is found in low-velocity (local)
neutral hydrogen (HI) profiles as well as in the so-called high-velocity

densities where rapidly moving neutral gas masses interact with surrounding

centered more or less at -50 degrees declination. The majority of the stars
fall in the magnitude range 10.4 < V < 15.5 and in the color index range -0.33
< (B - V) < +1.66. These new broadband photometric standard stars average 16.4
measurements each from data taken on 116 different nights over a period of 4
yr. Similar data are tabulated for 19 stars of interest that were not observed
often enough to make them well-defined standard stars.

distance is studied. We investigate the effects of the discrete-particle
character of the model on properties like reaction rate, quenching phenomenon
and front propagation, focusing on differences with respect to the continuous
case. We introduce a renormalized reaction rate depending both on the
interaction radius and the particle density, and we relate it to macroscopic
observables (e.g., front speed and front thickness) of the system.
