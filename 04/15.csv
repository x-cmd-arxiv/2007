extracted by considering two-particle and triple unitarity cuts of the
corresponding bubble and triangle integral functions. After choosing a specific
parameterisation of the cut loop momentum we can uniquely identify the
coefficients of the desired integral functions simply by examining the
behaviour of the cut integrand as the unconstrained parameters of the cut loop
momentum approach infinity. In this way we can produce compact forms for scalar
integral coefficients. Applications of this method are presented for both QCD
and electroweak processes, including an alternative form for the recently
computed three-mass triangle coefficient in the six-photon amplitude
$A_6(1^-,2^+,3^-,4^+,5^-,6^+)$. The direct nature of this extraction procedure
allows for a very straightforward automation of the procedure.

  Local Pseudopotentials","To be published in Phys. Rev. B",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.75.205122",,"cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  In the density functional (DF) theory of Kohn and Sham, the kinetic energy of
the ground state of a system of noninteracting electrons in a general external
field is calculated using a set of orbitals. Orbital free methods attempt to
calculate this directly from the electron density by approximating the
universal but unknown kinetic energy density functional. However simple local
approximations are inaccurate and it has proved very difficult to devise
generally accurate nonlocal approximations. We focus instead on the kinetic
potential, the functional derivative of the kinetic energy DF, which appears in
the Euler equation for the electron density. We argue that the kinetic
potential is more local and more amenable to simple physically motivated
approximations in many relevant cases, and describe two pathways by which the
value of the kinetic energy can be efficiently calculated. We propose two
nonlocal orbital free kinetic potentials that reduce to known exact forms for
both slowly varying and rapidly varying perturbations and also reproduce exact
results for the linear response of the density of the homogeneous system to
small perturbations. A simple and systematic approach for generating accurate
and weak ab-initio local pseudopotentials which produce a smooth slowly varying
valence component of the electron density is proposed for use in orbital free
DF calculations of molecules and solids. The use of these local
pseudopotentials further minimizes the possible errors from the kinetic
potentials. Our theory yields results for the total energies and ionization
energies of atoms, and for the shell structure in the atomic radial density
profiles that are in very good agreement with calculations using the full
Kohn-Sham theory.

number of randomized algorithms. Here we explore the effects of choice on
models of tree and network growth. In our models each new node has k randomly
chosen contacts, where k > 1 is a constant. It then attaches to whichever one
of these contacts is most desirable in some sense, such as its distance from
the root or its degree. Even when the new node has just two choices, i.e., when
k=2, the resulting network can be very different from a random graph or tree.
For instance, if the new node attaches to the contact which is closest to the
root of the tree, the distribution of depths changes from Poisson to a
traveling wave solution. If the new node attaches to the contact with the
smallest degree, the degree distribution is closer to uniform than in a random
graph, so that with high probability there are no nodes in the network with
degree greater than O(log log N). Finally, if the new node attaches to the
contact with the largest degree, we find that the degree distribution is a
power law with exponent -1 up to degrees roughly equal to k, with an
exponential cutoff beyond that; thus, in this case, we need k >> 1 to see a
power law over a wide range of degrees.

as mutational robustness or evolvability that do not directly benefit any
individual, but can influence the course of future evolution. Functionally
similar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and
capacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any of
these differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties.
  RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution
favors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently
large. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection
pressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show that
proteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards
higher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolve
greater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance both
mutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness and
stability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can be
quantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral
network.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general
tendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in
highly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute
to the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that
exist in large populations.

propagating in disordered media where coherent corrections to transport are
given by two-wave interference. For scatterers with internal degrees of
freedom, these corrections are observed to be much smaller than would be
expected for structureless scatterers. By examining the basic example of the
scattering of one photon by two spin-1/2 atoms--a case-study for coherent
backscattering--we demonstrate that the loss of interference strength is
associated with which-path information stored by the scattering atoms.

for the electromagnetic field are investigated for the geometry of a wedge with
a coaxal cylindrical boundary. All boundaries are assumed to be perfectly
conducting and both regions inside and outside the shell are considered. By
using the generalized Abel-Plana formula, the vacuum expectation values are
presented in the form of the sum of two terms. The first one corresponds to the
geometry of the wedge without the cylindrical shell and the second term is
induced by the presence of the shell. The vacuum energy density induced by the
shell is negative for the interior region and is positive for the exterior
region. The asymptotic behavior of the vacuum expectation values are
investigated in various limiting cases. It is shown that the vacuum forces
acting on the wedge sides due to the presence of the cylindrical boundary are
always attractive.

  proceedings 906, Editors M. Axelsson and F Ryde","AIP Conf.Proc.906:69-78,2007","10.1063/1.2737408",,"astro-ph",,"  Pinpointing the progenitors of long duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) remains
an extremely important question, although it is now clear that at least a
fraction of LGRBs originate in the core collapse of massive stars in type Ic
supernovae, the pathways to the production of these stars, and their initial
masses, remain uncertain. Rotation is thought to be vital in the creation of
LGRBs, and it is likely that black hole creation is also necessary. We suggest
that these two constraints can be met if the GRB progenitors are very massive
stars (>20 solar masses) and are formed in tight binary systems. Using simple
models we compare the predictions of this scenario with observations and find
that the location of GRBs on their host galaxies are suggestive of
main-sequence masses in excess of 20 solar masses, while 50% of the known
compact binary systems may have been sufficiently close to have had the
necessary rotation rates for GRB creation. Thus, massive stars in compact
binaries are a likely channel for at least some fraction of LGRBs.

Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. Doping affects both anisotropy and
disorder. Anisotropy scaling is shown to collapse the melting lines only where
thermal fluctuations are dominant. Yet, in the region where disorder breaks
that scaling, the glass lines are still collapsed. A quantitative fit to
melting and replica symmetry breaking lines of a 2D Ginzburg-Landau model
further reveals that disorder amplitude weakens with doping, but to a lesser
degree than thermal fluctuations, enhancing the relative role of disorder.

""super growth"", of millimeter-thick single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)
forests by using C2H4/ H2/ H2O/ Ar reactant gas and Fe/ Al2O3 catalyst. In this
current work, a parametric study was carried out on both reaction and catalyst
conditions. Results revealed that a thin Fe catalyst layer (about 0.5 nm)
yielded rapid growth of SWNTs only when supported on Al2O3, and that Al2O3
support enhanced the activity of Fe, Co, and Ni catalysts. The growth window
for the rapid SWNT growth was narrow, however. Optimum amount of added H2O
increased the SWNT growth rate but further addition of H2O degraded both the
SWNT growth rate and quality. Addition of H2 was also essential for rapid SWNT
growth, but again, further addition decreased both the SWNT growth rate and
quality. Because Al2O3 catalyzes hydrocarbon reforming, Al2O3 support possibly
enhances the SWNT growth rate by supplying the carbon source to the catalyst
nanoparticles. The origin of the narrow window for rapid SWNT growth will also
be discussed.
