that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious

additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified
from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of
results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with
those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling
of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects
exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with
actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly
debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends
down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.
The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from
extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.
A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are
more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background
extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function
as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches
between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO

approach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and
representation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the
flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the
lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to
the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):
specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the
fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic
geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed
forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this
article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that
these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of
the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical
positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive
formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural
constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These
turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the
canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum
groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,
in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.
NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.

observations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537)
1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have
been previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been
obtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in
November and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep
slope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of
0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence
of a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some
questions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has
never been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected
it. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused
by the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that,
together with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16
may be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main

this paper we explore the capability of the LHC to determine the $W'$ coupling
helicity at low integrated luminosities in the $\ell +E_T^{miss}$ discovery

reconstructed from this final state in the $W-W'$ interference region, provides
the best determination of this quantity. To make such measurements requires
integrated luminosities of $\sim 10(60) fb^{-1}$ assuming $M_{W'}=1.5(2.5)$ TeV

helicity determination can be further strengthened by the use of various
discovery channel leptonic asymmetries, also measured in the same interference
regime, but with higher integrated luminosities.

  A White Paper Submitted to the NSF ExoPlanet Task Force",,,,,"astro-ph",,"  The extraordinary astrometric accuracy of radio interferometry creates an
important and unique opportunity for the discovery and characterization of

better than 100 microarcsecond accuracy, and can approach 10 microarcsecond
with careful calibration. We describe here RIPL, the Radio Interferometric
PLanet search, a new program with the VLBA and the Green Bank 100 m telescope
that will survey 29 low-mass, active stars over 3 years with sub-Jovian planet
mass sensitivity at 1 AU. An upgrade of the VLBA bandwidth will increase
astrometric accuracy by an order of magnitude. Ultimately, the colossal
collecting area of the Square Kilometer Array could push astrometric accuracy
to 1 microarcsecond, making detection and characterizaiton of Earth mass
planets possible.
  RIPL and other future radio astrometric planet searches occupy a unique
volume in planet discovery and characterization parameter space. The parameter
space of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large
radii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the
targets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active
stars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method,
coronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity
will extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric
methods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.
  The complementarity of radio astrometric techniques with other methods
demonstrates that radio astrometry can play an important role in the roadmap
for exoplanet discovery and characterization.

possibility of cloaking objects from the observation by electromagnetic waves.
The basic idea of these invisibility devices \cite{glu1, glu2, le},\cite{pss1}
is to use anisotropic {\it transformation media} whose permittivity and
permeability $\var^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}$, are obtained from the ones,
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$, of isotropic media, by singular
transformations of coordinates. In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking
in the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory.
This formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical
problems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the
permeability of the {\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked
objects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\""odinger form with the
electromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that
the electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially
self-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily
equivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the
coordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the
scattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the
construction of \cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and
active devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we prove
cloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove
that it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.

dust-enshrouded carbon star AFGL 5440. The observations were made over a
continuous range of wavelengths from 1 - 4um with a high-speed
spectrophotometer designed expressly for this purpose. We find that the
occultation fringes cannot be fit by any single-size model. We use the DUSTY
radiative transfer code to model a circumstellar shell and fit both the
observed occultation light curves and the spectral energy distribution
described in the literature. We find a strong constraint on the inner radius of
the dust shell, Tmax = 950 K +/- 50K, and optical depth at 5um of 0.5 +/- 0.1.
The observations are best fit by models with a density gradient of r^-2 or the
gradient derived by Ivezic & Elitzur for a radiatively driven hydrodynamic
outflow. Our models cannot fit the observed IRAS 60um flux without assuming a
substantial abundance of graphite or by assuming a substantially higher
mass-loss rate in the past.

predictions of a baseline self-stirring model and show how dynamical
perturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant planet modify the
evolution. Although robust comparisons between observations and theory require
better KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly
consistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial
collisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important
problems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations.
Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids
suggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification
of more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide
additional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and
dynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate
calculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified'
calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and

lensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging
galaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster
with a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of
the total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless
galaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,
based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the
self-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using
simplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,
higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of
1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and
comparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for
a new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation
of an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This
new method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If
we make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal
mass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent
constraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the
subcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the
universal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark
matter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight
improvement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out
most of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the
standard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.

dereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H
for all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor
star, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In
addition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak with
respect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restricting
the spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V. Comparison
of the A0620-00 spectrum to scaled K star spectra indicates that the CO
absorption features are significantly weaker in A0620-00 than in field dwarf

planetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This motivates planet searches around
stars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in
particular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.
Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5
dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal
errors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion
is due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.
Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each
planet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)
magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period
coincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in
a spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the
other hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection
adds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and
reinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated
than the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf
with and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn
from the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find tentative evidence that
the host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetary
system.

differences exist at small scales. Most notably, while the CO peak is nearly
coincident with the S140 H${\alpha}$ arc, the maximum H$_2$CO absorption is
clearly separated from it by a full 10$'$ beam ($\sim$ 3 pc). We argue that
these differences result from differing abundances and excitation requirements.
The CO(1-0) line is more optically thick and more biased towards warm gas than

binaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct
the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more
problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either
during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the
first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common
envelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive
white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents
interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope
evolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual
formulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most
plausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the
common envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget
explicitly including recombination resolves this issue.

the tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a
cluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late
times when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the
central regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time
-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core
binary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase
(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in
the core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of
mass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces
the observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled
into and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in
stars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius
up to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the

less). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordial

the massless case, turns out to be a fundamental property underlying the

(CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white
dwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an
elaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,
unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than
earlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central
region of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,
be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a
slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a
centrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that
mimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic
stellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar
evolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by
neutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and
that carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective
accretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion
of cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double
CO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that
at least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good
candidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the
characteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual
explosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).

search for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic
binary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that
the brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16
+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13
days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The
brightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall
periodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than
half the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as
clearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component
is not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with
predictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to
those of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from
circumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the
timescale over which they might form planets.

has uncovered their complex multi-mechanism-governed evolution processes.
Therefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of these
networked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a more
detailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type of
network growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose
an evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network
structure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network
structure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of
the network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the
intensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial
disassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of
network evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting
introduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network
so long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,
it is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world
effect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering
coefficient in a network.

to the lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods, basic aspects of the theory still remain
unchallenged. An unsolved theoretical issue is related to the construction of a
discrete kinetic theory which yields \textit{exactly} the fluid equations,
i.e., is non-asymptotic (here denoted as \textit{LB inverse kinetic theory}).
The purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse
kinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to this
problem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet important
requirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that
it yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but
suitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the
boundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem
can be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial
distribution functions. Possible realizations of the theory and asymptotic
approximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations
\textit{with prescribed accuracy.} As a result, asymptotic accuracy estimates
of customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial
compressibility method are discussed.

performed for a deep silica-induced potential allowing for a large number of

is shown to be determined mainly by the bound-to-bound transitions for deep
bound levels and by bound-to-free transitions for shallow bound levels.
Moreover, the phonon emission and absorption processes can be orders of
magnitude larger for deep bound levels as compared to the shallow bound ones.
We also study various types of transitions from free states. We show that, for
thermal atomic cesium with temperature in the range from 100 $\mu$K to 400

adsorption (free-to-bound decay) rate is about two times larger than the

as compared to the literature's data and allows us to investigate the
properties of objects with estimated diameter smaller than 40--50 km. The
analysis of the spectral slopes and colors versus the estimated diameters shows
that the blue and red objects have indistinguishable size distribution. We
perform a statistical investigation of the Trojans's spectra property
distributions as a function of their orbital and physical parameters, and in
comparison with other classes of minor bodies in the outer Solar System.
Trojans at lower inclination appear significantly bluer than those at higher

objects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo
dark matter residing in such objects.
  We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white
dwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed the
stars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August
2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determined
yielding relative errors on distances of $\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\sim12$% for
3 objects, and $\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too
distant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our
observations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were
derived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo
membership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be
thick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based
solely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric
parallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance as
derived from photometric techniques. This new data set can be used to revise
the halo white dwarf space density, and that analysis will be presented in a
subsequent publication.

for gravitational wave astronomy in high-frequency sources such as core
collapse supernovae. In this paper we present high-resolution simulations,
performed with an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code, of such low
T/|W| bar-mode instability. The complex morphological features involved in the
nonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, which
show that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside the
corotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-mode
deformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation are
confirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays an
important role during the long-term, nonlinear behaviour of the instability,
which has implications on the dynamics of rotating stars and on the attainable

networks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have
a fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These
effects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying
topology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is
described by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this
model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on
the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of
a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes
through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population
structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the
effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local
dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a
continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations
with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio
becomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial
structure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and
counterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains
cooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's
dilemma and also of the ""rock-paper-scissor"" game we find indications of rich
structure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models
with explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and
the emergence of global oscillations.

Dispersion relations for torsional oscillations are derived analytically in

verified by numerical solutions, which are valid for a wide range of
inhomogeneity strength. It is shown that the inhomogeneous mass density field
leads to the reduction of a wave frequency of torsional oscillations, in
comparison to that of estimated from mass density at the loop apex. This
frequency reduction results from the decrease of an average Alfven speed as far
as the inhomogeneous loop is denser at its footpoints. The derived dispersion
relations and wave profiles are important for potential observations of
torsional oscillations which result in periodic variations of spectral line
widths. Torsional oscillations offer an additional powerful tool for a

analogous effect for the strongly-decaying $\Delta$(1232) resonance. The result
for the muon is Im$ \mu = e G_F^2 m^3/768 \pi^3$, with $e$ the charge and $m$
the mass of the muon, $G_F$ the Fermi constant, which in an external magnetic
field of $B$ Tesla give rise to the relative change in the muon lifetime of

$\mathcal{O}(\eVq)$ mass-squared difference, $\Dmq_\Sbl$. We perform our
analysis using the OPERA detector as a reference (our analysis can be upgraded
including a detailed simulation of the ICARUS detector). We point out that the
channel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter
space at the CNGS beam is $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$. The reason for that is
twofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation
is the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for
which both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an
extremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\nu_\mu
\to \nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterile
neutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is
significantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux.
Data from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the
four-neutrino model parameter space. Our results hold for any value of
$\Dmq_\Sbl \gtrsim 0.1 \eVq$, \textit{i.e.} when oscillations driven by this
mass-squared difference are averaged. We have also checked that the bound on
$\theta_{13}$ that can be put at the CNGS is not affected by the possible
existence of sterile neutrinos.

around a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order in
Q, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio.
This system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation
reaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the
Carter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of
these three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has
computed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is
linear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in
the spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction
field), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the
quadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric
orbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry
axis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a
single mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,
to linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we
show that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a
system (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole). With mild additional
assumptions, this result falsifies the conjecture that all vacuum, axisymmetric
spacetimes posess a third constant of geodesic motion.

domains with piecewise smooth boundaries are of interest in applied probability
because of their role as heavy traffic approximations for some stochastic
networks. In this paper, assuming certain conditions on the domains and
directions of reflection, a perturbation result, or invariance principle, for
SRBMs is proved. This provides sufficient conditions for a process that
satisfies the definition of an SRBM, except for small random perturbations in
the defining conditions, to be close in distribution to an SRBM. A crucial
ingredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality for
solutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem. We use the invariance principle to
show weak existence of SRBMs under mild conditions. We also use the invariance
principle, in conjunction with known uniqueness results for SRBMs, to give some
sufficient conditions for validating approximations involving (i) SRBMs in
convex polyhedrons with a constant reflection vector field on each face of the
polyhedron, and (ii) SRBMs in bounded domains with piecewise smooth boundaries
and possibly nonconstant reflection vector fields on the boundary surfaces.

use of the simplifying fact that, under certain assumptions, the

oligophenylene molecules between gold electrodes, whose electronic structure is
calculated based on density-functional theory. It is shown that the exponential
