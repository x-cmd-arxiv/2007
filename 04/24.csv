the dark matter power spectrum and correlation function using renormalized
perturbation theory (RPT). In a previous paper we showed that RPT successfully
predicts the damping of acoustic oscillations; here we extend our calculation
to the enhancement of power due to mode-coupling. We show that mode-coupling
generates additional oscillations that are out of phase with those in the
linear spectrum, leading to shifts in the scales of oscillation nodes defined
with respect to a smooth spectrum. When Fourier transformed, these out of phase
oscillations induce percent-level shifts in the acoustic peak of the two-point
correlation function. We present predictions for these shifts as a function of
redshift; these should be considered as a robust lower limit to the more
realistic case that includes in addition redshift distortions and galaxy bias.
We show that these nonlinear effects occur at very large scales, leading to a
breakdown of linear theory at scales much larger than commonly thought. We
discuss why virialized halo profiles are not responsible for these effects,
which can be understood from basic physics of gravitational instability. Our
results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, and can be used
as a starting point for modeling BAO in future observations. To meet this end,
we suggest a simple physically motivated model to correct for the shifts caused
by mode-coupling.

the galactic halo directly through WIMP-nucleon interactions. Once such a
detection is established a confirmation of the galactic origin of the signal is

Cosmological N-body simulations predict the dark matter anisotropy to be
nonzero, beta~0.2. Baryonic matter has beta=0 and therefore a detection of a
nonzero beta would be strong proof of the fundamental difference between dark
and baryonic matter. We estimate the sensitivity for various detector
configurations using Monte Carlo methods and we show that the strongest signal

nuclear recoil energies greater than 100 keV for a WIMP mass of 100 GeV and a
32S target. This number corresponds to ~10^6 events at all energies. We discuss

driven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by time
variations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the development
of typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in the
postshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth of
such a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shocked
flow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growth
of the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shock
instability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can trigger
convective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of the
average shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamic
instabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through the
neutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition in
support of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting and
more compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because the
accretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of the
SASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and a
variety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for the
advective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by the
accretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close an
amplifying global feedback loop. (abridged)

studied in the last two decades. We have applied the method of moments to study
some statistical properties of the chain's spectrum, showing in particular that
the density of eigenvalues follows a Wigner-like law. Finally, we emphasize
that, unlike the original freezing trick, the extension thereof developed in
this paper can be applied to spin chains whose associated dynamical spin model

elastic stresses, they mostly appear in close pairs of opposite signs. The
relaxation mechanisms associated with a disclination in its creation, motion,
change of shape, involve an interplay with continuous or quantized dislocations
and/or continuous disclinations. These are attached to the disclinations or are
akin to Nye's dislocation densities, well suited here. The notion of 'extended

different situations where this interplay takes place. These concepts are
illustrated by applications in amorphous solids, mesomorphic phases and

propose to use a new astrometric method that employs a future, highly accurate
SIM Quick-Look survey and HIPPARCOS data taken twenty years prior. Using
position errors for SIM of 4 muas, this method enables the detection and
characterization of Solar-system analogs (SOSAs) with periods up to 240 (500)
years for 1 (10) M_J companions. Because many tens of thousands nearby stars
can be surveyed this way for a modest expenditure of SIM time and SOSAs may be
quite abundant, we expect to find many hundreds of extra-solar planets with
long-period orbits. Such a data set would nicely complement the short-period
systems found by the radial-velocity method. Brown dwarfs and low-mass stellar
companions can be found and characterized if their periods are shorter than
about 500 years. This data set will provide invaluable constraints on models of
planet formation, as well as a database for systems where the location of the
giant planets allow for the formation of low-mass planets in the habitable
zone. [Abridged]

using the Sun, and demonstrate that it keeps time well. This technique, called
gyrochronology, permits the derivation of ages for solar- and late-type main
sequence stars using only their rotation periods and colors. The technique is
clarified and developed here, and used to derive ages for illustrative groups
of nearby, late-type field stars with measured rotation periods. We first
demonstrate the reality of the interface sequence, the unifying feature of the
rotational observations of cluster and field stars that makes the technique
possible, and extends it beyond the proposal of Skumanich by specifying the
mass dependence of rotation for these stars. We delineate which stars it cannot
currently be used on. We then calibrate the age dependence using the Sun. The
errors are propagated to understand their dependence on color and period.
Representative age errors associated with the technique are estimated at ~15%
(plus possible systematic errors) for late-F, G, K, & early-M stars. Ages
derived via gyrochronology for the Mt. Wilson stars are shown to be in good
agreement with chromospheric ages for all but the bluest stars, and probably
superior. Gyro ages are then calculated for each of the active main sequence
field stars studied by Strassmeier and collaborators where other ages are not
available. These are shown to be mostly younger than 1Gyr, with a median age of
365Myr. The sample of single, late-type main sequence field stars assembled by
Pizzolato and collaborators is then assessed, and shown to have gyro ages
ranging from under 100Myr to several Gyr, and a median age of 1.2Gyr. Finally,
we demonstrate that the individual components of the three wide binaries

identified as due to the delays involved in the synthesis of mRNA and
translation into protein molecules [J. Lewis, Current Biol. {\bf 13}, 1398

couples these oscillators and a longitudinal positional information signal in

coupled temporal oscillations into the observed spatial periodicity of somites.

gravitational potential time dependence associated with the growth of the
baryonic mass, shifts the frequencies of the orbits, making them extremely
chaotic. This randomization makes the orbits explore a large phase space. When

manifested in the density distribution as an approach to a rounder
configuration. As a consequence, the influence of the central mass on the shape

hardware, the calibration and imaging strategies, comparing them to those at
higher frequencies, including aspects of interference excision and wide-field
imaging. Ionospheric phase fluctuations pose the major difficulty in
calibrating the array. Over restricted fields of view or at times of extremely
quiescent ionospheric ``weather'', an angle-invariant calibration strategy can
be used. In this approach a single phase correction is devised for each
antenna, typically via self-calibration. Over larger fields of view or at times
of more normal ionospheric ``weather'' when the ionospheric isoplanatic patch
size is smaller than the field of view, we adopt a field-based strategy in
which the phase correction depends upon location within the field of view. This
second calibration strategy was implemented by modeling the ionosphere above
the array using Zernike polynomials. Images of 3C sources of moderate strength
are provided as examples of routine, angle-invariant calibration and imaging.

  International Statistical Institute, Lisbon, Portugal, August 22- 29, 2007",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  This work examines the problem of sequential detection of a change in the
drift of a Brownian motion in the case of two-sided alternatives. Applications
to real life situations in which two-sided changes can occur are discussed.
Traditionally, 2-CUSUM stopping rules have been used for this problem due to
their asymptotically optimal character as the mean time between false alarms
tends to $\infty$. In particular, attention has focused on 2-CUSUM harmonic
mean rules due to the simplicity in calculating their first moments. In this
paper, we derive closed-form expressions for the first moment of a general
2-CUSUM stopping rule. We use these expressions to obtain explicit upper and
lower bounds for it. Moreover, we derive an expression for the rate of change
of this first moment as one of the threshold parameters changes. Based on these
expressions we obtain explicit upper and lower bounds to this rate of change.
Using these expressions we are able to find the best 2-CUSUM stopping rule with
respect to the extended Lorden criterion. In fact, we demonstrate not only the
existence but also the uniqueness of the best 2-CUSUM stopping both in the case
of a symmetric change and in the case of a non-symmetric case. Furthermore, we
discuss the existence of a modification of the 2-CUSUM stopping rule that has a
strictly better performance than its classical 2-CUSUM counterpart for small
values of the mean time between false alarms. We conclude with a discussion on
the open problem of strict optimality in the case of two-sided alternatives.

that the BGGs and BCGs have very uniform masses, central ages and central
metallicities. Examining the radial dependence of their stellar populations, we
find no significant velocity dispersion, age, or alpha-enhancement gradients.
However, we find a wide range of metallicity gradients, suggesting a variety of
formation mechanisms. The range of metallicity gradients observed is surprising
given the homogeneous environment these galaxies probe and their uniform
central stellar populations. However, our results are inconsistent with any
single model of galaxy formation and emphasize the need for more theoretical
understanding of both the origins of metallicity gradients and galaxy formation
itself. We postulate two possible physical causes for the different formation
mechanisms.

constant rate during a lifetime with general distribution, to i.i.d. copies of
themselves. The width process of a splitting tree is then a binary, homogeneous
Crump--Mode--Jagers (CMJ) process, and is not Markovian unless the lifetime
distribution is exponential. Here, we allow the birth rate to be infinite, that
is, pairs of birth times and lifespans of newborns form a Poisson point process
along the lifetime of their mother, with possibly infinite intensity measure. A
splitting tree is a random (so-called) chronological tree. Each element of a
chronological tree is a (so-called) existence point $(v,\tau)$ of some
individual $v$ (vertex) in a discrete tree, where $\tau$ is a nonnegative real
number called chronological level (time). We introduce a total order on
existence points, called linear order, and a mapping $\varphi$ from the tree
into the real line which preserves this order. The inverse of $\varphi$ is
called the exploration process, and the projection of this inverse on
chronological levels the contour process. For splitting trees truncated up to
level $\tau$, we prove that thus defined contour process is a L\'evy process
reflected below $\tau$ and killed upon hitting 0. This allows to derive
properties of (i) splitting trees: conceptual proof of Le Gall--Le Jan's
theorem in the finite variation case, exceptional points, coalescent point
process, age distribution; (ii) CMJ processes: one-dimensional marginals,
conditionings, limit theorems, asymptotic numbers of individuals with infinite

analytic modeling, we show that the galaxy stellar mass-metallicity relation
(MZR) provides strong constraints on galactic outflows across cosmic time. We
compare three outflow models: No outflows, a ""constant wind"" (cw) model that
emulates the popular Dekel & Silk (1986) scenario, and a ``momentum-driven
wind"" (vzw) model. We find that only the vzw scaling reproduces the observed
z~2 MZR's slope, amplitude, and scatter. Comparing our fully three-dimensional
simulations with a simple one-zone chemical evolution model, we find that the
MZR can be understood in terms of three parameters: (1) The equilibrium
metallicity Z_eq=y*SFR/ACC (where y=true yield), reflecting the enrichment
balance between star formation rate SFR and gas accretion rate ACC; (2) the
dilution time t_d=M_g/ACC, representing the timescale for a galaxy to return to
Z_eq after a metallicity-perturbing interaction; and (3) the blowout mass
M_blowout, which is the galaxy stellar mass above which winds can escape its
halo. When outflows with mass loading factor MLF are present, galaxies below
M_blowout obey Z_eq = y/(1+MLF), while above M_blowout, Z_eq->y. Our cw model
has M_blowout ~ 10^10 M_sun, which yields a sharp upturn in the MZR above this
scale and a flat MZR with large scatter below it, in strong disagreement with
observations. Our vzw model reproduces the observed Z_g \propto M_*^0.3 because
Z_eq \propto MLF^-1 \propto M_*^1/3 when MLF >> 1 (i.e. at low masses). The
flattening of the MZR at M_* > 10^10.5 M_sun observed by Tremonti et al. (2004)
reflects the mass scale where MLF~1, rather than a characteristic wind speed.
The tight observed MZR scatter is ensured when t_d<1 dynamical time, which is
only satisified at all masses and epochs in our momentum-driven wind model.

the first detection of actinides in an extra Galactic object. A detailed
abundance pattern is determined for 12 other neutron-capture elements from the
atomic number 39 to 68. These elements are significantly over-abundant with
respect to other metals like Fe (> 1 dex) and their abundance pattern agrees
well with those of the r-process-enhanced, very metal-poor stars known in the
Galactic halo, while the metallicity of this object ([Fe/H] ~ -1.5) is much
higher than these field stars ([Fe/H] ~ -3.0). The results indicate that the
mechanism and the astrophysical site that are responsible for neutron-capture
elements in COS82 is similar to that for field r-process-enhanced stars, while
the condition of low mass star formation is quite different. An estimate of the
age of this object based on the Th abundance ratio is discussed.

dwarf in this system is hotter than its higher-mass companion represents a
challenge to brown-dwarf evolutionary models, none of which predict this
behavior. Here we present updated determinations of the basic physical
properties of 2M0535-05, bolstering the surprising reversal of temperatures
with mass in this system. We compare these measurements with widely used
brown-dwarf evolutionary tracks, and find that the temperature reversal can be
explained by some models if the components of 2M0535-05 are mildly non-coeval,
possibly consistent with dynamical simulations of brown-dwarf formation.
Alternatively, a strong magnetic field on the higher-mass brown dwarf might
explain its anomalously low surface temperature, consistent with emerging
evidence that convection is suppressed in magnetically active, low-mass stars.
Finally, we discuss future observational and theoretical work needed to further
characterize and understand this benchmark system.

important influence on the results. In this Letter, we divide the 48

relation $\log E_\iso = a + b \log E_\p$, and check if the parameters $a$ and

the variation is caused by the selection effect arising from the fluence limit.

was originally proposed as a tool for calculating systematic corrections to the
Bethe approximation, a mean-field approximation which is important in
statistical mechanics, glasses, coding theory, and combinatorial optimization.
Detailed analysis shows that the trivial saddle point generates a sum over
geometries reminiscent of dynamically triangulated quantum gravity, which
suggests new possibilities to design sums over geometries for the specific
purpose of obtaining improved mean field approximations to $D$-dimensional
theories. In the case of the Efetov theory, the dominant geometries are locally
tree-like, and the sum over geometries diverges in a way that is similar to
quantum gravity's divergence when all topologies are included. Expertise from
the field of dynamically triangulated quantum gravity about sums over
geometries may be able to remedy these defects and fulfill the Efetov theory's
original promise. The other saddle points of the Efetov Lagrangian are also

strong phase difference and consequently a large CP violating asymmetry when
the masses of the $\pi^+\pi^-$ pairs are in the vicinity of the $\omega$
resonance. Since there are two $\rho (\omega)$ mesons in the intermediate state
$\rho-\omega$ mixing contributes twice to the first order of isospin violation,
leading to an even larger CP violating asymmetry (could be 30% -- 50% larger)
than in the case where only one $\rho (\omega)$ meson is involved. The CP
violating asymmetry depends on the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix
elements and the hadronic matrix elements. The factorization approach is
applied in the calculation of the hadronic matrix elements with the
nonfactorizable effects being included effectively in an effective parameter,
$N_c$. We give the constraint on the range of $N_c$ from the latest
experimental data for the branching ratios for $\bar{B}^0 \to\rho^0\rho^0$ and

very large (even more than 90% for some values of $N_c$). It is shown that the
sensitivity of the CP violating asymmetry to $N_c$ is large compared with its
smaller sensitivity to the CKM matrix elements. We also discuss the possibility
to remove the mod $(\pi)$ ambiguity in the determination of the CP violating

interface between a cold neutral medium (CNM) cloudlet and the warm neutral
medium (WNM). Methods. We perform moving grid, multifluid, 1D, hydrodynamical
simulations with chemistry including thermal and chemical diffusion. The
diffusion coefficients are enhanced to account for turbulent diffusion. We
post-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model of
radiative transfer to compute line profiles. Results. Turbulent diffusion
spreads out the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. We find that the
CNM slightly expands and heats up: its CH and H$_2$ content decreases due to
the lower density. The change of physical conditions and diffusive transport
increase the H$^+$ content in the CNM which results in increased OH and H$_2$O.
Diffusion transports some CO out of the CNM. It also brings H$_2$ into contact
with the warm gas with enhanced production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O at
the interface. O lines are sensitive to the spread of the thermal profile in
the intermediate region between the CNM and the WNM. Enhanced molecular content
at the interface of the cloud broadens the molecular line profiles and helps
exciting transitions of intermediate energy. The relative molecular yield are
found higher for bigger clouds. Conclusions. Turbulent diffusion can be the
source of additional molecular production and should be included in chemical
models of the interstellar medium (ISM). It also is a good candidate for the
interpretation of observational problems such as warm H$_2$, CH$^+$ formation
and presence of H$_3^+$.

account Casimir vacuum energy density, assuming that the underlying theory
allows a maximum momentum, that turns out to be the leading contribution term
to Einstein equations in a large expanding FRW universe. As stated in numerous
quantum gravity studies, we postulate that maximum momentum is related to the
existence of the Planck length as a fundamental length. This insight, together
with the assumption of a Planck scale correction to the energy/momentum
dispersion-relation on a FRW background, is used here to calculate Casimir
vacuum energy. We show that, under these hypothesis, an accelerated universe
expansion is obtained. As last step we analyze the compatibility of the
resulting model with experimental data, writing down the equation of state for
Casimir energy and pressure and observing that this equation of state belongs

by \Delta_L and the CP-violating asymmetry of N decays is attributed to the

regular or chaotic nature of the motion, the number of deviation vectors, their
linear (in)dependence and the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. The different
time evolution of these volumes can be used to identify rapidly and efficiently
the nature of the dynamics, leading to the introduction of quantities that
clearly distinguish between chaotic behavior and quasiperiodic motion on
$N$-dimensional tori. More specifically we introduce the Generalized Alignment
Index of order $k$ (GALI$_k$) as the volume of a generalized parallelepiped,
whose edges are $k$ initially linearly independent unit deviation vectors from
the studied orbit whose magnitude is normalized to unity at every time step.
The GALI$_k$ is a generalization of the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI)
(GALI$_2$ $\propto$ SALI). However, GALI$_k$ provides significantly more
detailed information on the local dynamics, allows for a faster and clearer
distinction between order and chaos than SALI and works even in cases where the

papers presented at this workshop, is described. About ten years ago the
mechanisms of the winds were reasonably well understood, the mass loss rates
were known, and the predictions of stellar evolution theory with mass loss
agreed with observations. However, recent studies especially those based on
FUSE observations, have resulted in a significant reduction of the mass loss
rates, that disagrees with predictions from radiation driven wind models. The
situation is discussed and future studies that can clarify the situation are
suggested.

age distributions of cluster samples. The resulting dissolution times of
clusters in the solar neighborhood (SN) and in interacting galaxies are shorter
than predicted by two-body relaxation of clusters in a tidal field. Encounters
with giant molecular clouds can explain the fate of clusters in the SN and are
the most likely cause of the short lifetime of clusters in interacting

such models, which is common knowledge among field researchers in dengue, we
find a deterministically chaotic attractor in the more realistic parameter
region of reduced infectivity on secondary infection (''inverse ADE'' parameter

are more likely to be hospitalized, hence do not contribute to the force of
infection as much as people with first infection.

modular polynomials. We show that an algorithm relying on floating point
evaluation of modular functions and on interpolation, which has received little
attention in the literature, has a complexity that is essentially (up to
logarithmic factors) linear in the size of the computed polynomials. In
particular, it obtains the classical modular polynomials $\Phi_\ell$ of prime
level $\ell$ in time O (\ell^3 \log^4 \ell \log \log \ell). Besides treating
modular polynomials for $\Gamma^0 (\ell)$, which are an important ingredient in
many algorithms dealing with isogenies of elliptic curves, the algorithm is
easily adapted to more general situations. Composite levels are handled just as
easily as prime levels, as well as polynomials between a modular function and
its transform of prime level, such as the Schl\""afli polynomials and their
generalisations. Our distributed implementation of the algorithm confirms the
theoretical analysis by computing modular equations of record level around
10000 in less than two weeks on ten processors.

relation with the disk formation are not well understood. Theoretical models of
galactic chemical evolution make contrasting predictions about the time
evolution of metallicity gradients. To test chemical evolution models and trace
the star formation and accretion history of low luminosity disk galaxies we
focus on the Local Group galaxy M33. We analyze O/H and S/H abundances in
planetary nebulae, H{\sc ii} regions, and young stars, together with known
[Fe/H] abundances in the old stellar population of M33. With a theoretical
model, we follow the time evolution of gas (diffuse and condensed in clouds),
stars, and chemical abundances in the disk of M33, assuming that the galaxy is
accreting gas from an external reservoir. Our model is able to reproduce the
available observational constraints on the distribution of gas and stars in M33
and to predict the time evolution of several chemical abundances. In
particular, we find that a model characterized by a continuous infall of gas on
the disk, at a rate of $\dot M_{\rm inf}\approx 1$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, almost
constant with time, can also account for the relatively high rate of star
formation and for the shallow chemical gradients. Supported by a large sample
of high resolution observations for this nearby galaxy, we conclude that the
metallicity in the disk of M33 has increased with time at all radii, with a
continuous flattening of the gradient over the last $\sim 8$ Gyr.

place constraints on the metal abundance and the cosmic ionization rate. The
H13CO+ emission is well reproduced for metals abundances lower than 3e-9 and a
standard cosmic ray ionization rate. However, the observations are also
consistent with a complete depletion of metals, i.e. with cosmic rays as the
only source of ionization at visual extinctions greater than a few Av . The
DCO+ emission is found to be dependent of the ortho to para H2 ratio, and
indicates a ratio of ~1e-2. The derived ionization fraction is about 5e-9 with
respect to H nuclei, which is about an order of magnitude lower than the one
observed in the L1544 core. The corresponding ambipolar diffusion timescale is
found to be an order of magnitude larger than the free fall timescale at the
center of the core. The inferred metal abundance suggests that magnetically
inactive regions (dead zones) are present in protostellar disks.

established the space of the smooth test functions (consisting of the Green's

continuous linear functional. It is a linear topological space $K(c)$ of the

aerosol concentrations is done for March 2001 using different configurations of
the aerosol module of one of the model used for the intercomparison. Single
modifications of a reference setup for model configurations are performed and
compared to a reference case. These modifications concern the size
distribution, i.e. the number of sections, and physical processes, i.e.
coagulation, condensation/evaporation, cloud chemistry, heterogeneous reactions
and sea-salt emissions. Comparing monthly averaged concentrations at different
stations, the importance of each parameterization is first assessed. It is
found that sulfate concentrations are little sensitive to sea-salt emissions
and to whether condensation is computed dynamically or by assuming
thermodynamic equilibrium. Nitrate concentrations are little sensitive to cloud
chemistry. However, a very high sensitivity to heterogeneous reactions is
observed. Thereafter, the variability of the aerosol concentrations to the use
of different chemistry transport models (CTMs) and the variability to the use
of different parameterizations in the aerosol module are compared. For sulfate,
the variability to the use of different parameterizations in the aerosol module
is lower than the variability to the use of different CTMs. However, for

two variabilities have the same order of magnitude.

shows a peak energy at 53 keV. The XRT light curve of this GRB decays as a
power law with a slope of alpha=1.06+/-0.04. The spectrum is well reproduced by
an absorbed power law with a spectral index Gamma_x=2.4+/-0.4 and a low energy
absorption N_H=4(+3;-2)x10^21 cm^(-2) which is higher than the Galactic value.
The 15-150 keV prompt emission in GRB 050412 is modelled with a hard
(Gamma=0.7+/-0.2) power law. The XRT light curve follows a broken power law
with the first slope alpha_1=0.7+/-0.4, the break time T_break=254(-41;+79) s
and the second slope alpha_2=2.8(-0.8;+0.5). The spectrum is fitted by a power
law with spectral index Gamma_x=1.3+/-0.2 which is absorbed at low energies by
the Galactic column. The GRB 050410 afterglow reveals the expected
characteristics of the third component of the canonical Swift light curve.
Conversely, a complex phenomenology was detected in the GRB 050412 because of
the presence of the very early break. The light curve in this case can be
interpreted as being the last peak of the prompt emission. The two bursts
present tight upper limits for the optical emission, however, neither of them
can be clearly classified as dark. For GRB 050410, the suppression of the
optical afterglow could be attributed to a low density interstellar medium
surrounding the burst. For GRB 050412, the evaluation of the darkness is more
difficult due to the ambiguity in the extrapolation of the X-ray afterglow
light curve.

find that the temperatures derived by means of the LDR method are in excellent
agreement with those found by the spectral synthesis. This result is extremely
encouraging because it shows that spectra can be used to firmly derive
population characteristics (e.g., mass and age) of the observed stars. (ii) For
the IC 4651 stars we use the determined effective temperature to derive the
following results. a) The reddening E(B-V) of the cluster is 0.12+/-0.02,
largely independent of the color-temperature calibration used. b) The age of

unprecedented depth in Barnard 59, a star forming, dense core located in the
Pipe Nebula. The ratios A_\lambda/A_K were calculated from the slopes of the
distributions of sources in color-color diagrams \lambda-K vs. H-K. The
distributions in the color-color diagrams are fit well with single slopes to
extinction levels of A_K ~ 7 (A_V ~ 59 mag). Consequently, there appears to be
no significant variation of the extinction law with depth through the B59 line
of sight. However, when slopes are translated into the relative extinction
coefficients A_\lambda/A_K, we find an extinction law which departs from the
simple extrapolation of the near-infrared power law extinction curve, and
agrees more closely with a dust extinction model for a cloud with a total to
selective absorption R_V=5.5 and a grain size distribution favoring larger
grains than those in the diffuse ISM. Thus, the difference we observe could be
possibly due to the effect of grain growth in denser regions. Finally, the
slopes in our diagrams are somewhat less steep than those from the study of
Indebetouw et al. (2005) for clouds with lower column densities, and this
indicates that the extinction law between 3 and 8 micron might vary slightly as
a function of environment.

The analysis is based on methods introduced by J. Polchinski concerning the
perturbative renormalization with flow equations. In the first part of this
work, the program of renormalization with flow equations is reviewed and then
extended to effective field theories that have a finite UV cutoff. This is done
for a scalar field theory by imposing additional renormalization conditions for
some of the nonrenormalizable couplings. It turns out that one so obtains a
statement on the predictivity of the effective theory at scales far below the
UV cutoff. In particular, nonrenormalizable theories can be treated without
problems in the proposed framework. In the second part, the standard covariant
BRS quantization program for Euclidean Einstein gravity is applied. A momentum
cutoff regularization is imposed and the resulting violation of the
Slavnov-Taylor identities is discussed. Deriving Polchinski's renormalization
group equation for Euclidean quantum gravity, the predictivity of effective
quantum gravity at scales far below the Planck scale is investigated with flow
equations. A fine-tuning procedure for restoring the violated Slavnov-Taylor
identities is proposed and it is argued that in the effective quantum gravity
context, the restoration will only be accomplished with finite accuracy.
Finally, the no-cutoff limit of Euclidean quantum gravity is analyzed from the
viewpoint of the Polchinski method. It is speculated whether a limit with
nonvanishing gravitational constant might exist where the latter would
ultimatively be determined by the cosmological constant and the masses of the
elementary particles.

Order scheme for time dependent three-dimensional general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) and magnetodynamics (GRMD). ECHO is aimed at
providing a shock-capturing conservative method able to work at an arbitrary
level of formal accuracy (for smooth flows), where the other existing GRMHD and
GRMD schemes yield an overall second order at most. Moreover, our goal is to
present a general framework, based on the 3+1 Eulerian formalism, allowing for
different sets of equations, different algorithms, and working in a generic
space-time metric, so that ECHO may be easily coupled to any solver for
Einstein's equations. Various high order reconstruction methods are implemented
and a two-wave approximate Riemann solver is used. The induction equation is
treated by adopting the Upwind Constrained Transport (UCT) procedures,
appropriate to preserve the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field in
shock-capturing methods. The limiting case of magnetodynamics (also known as
force-free degenerate electrodynamics) is implemented by simply replacing the
fluid velocity with the electromagnetic drift velocity and by neglecting the
matter contribution to the stress tensor. ECHO is particularly accurate,
efficient, versatile, and robust. It has been tested against several
astrophysical applications, including a novel test on the propagation of large
amplitude circularly polarized Alfven waves. In particular, we show that
reconstruction based on a Monotonicity Preserving filter applied to a fixed
5-point stencil gives highly accurate results for smooth solutions, both in
flat and curved metric (up to the nominal fifth order), while at the same time
providing sharp profiles in tests involving discontinuities.

of transverse and longitudinal motion in an inextensible WLC significantly
weakens the polymer response compared to the widely used linear response
predictions. The corresponding feedback mechanism is rationalized by scaling
arguments and quantified by a multiple scale approach that exploits an inherent
separation of transverse and longitudinal correlation length scales. Crossover

theory of inflationary cosmological perturbations of quantum-mechanical origin.
The analogy with the well-known Schwinger effect is discussed in detail and a
systematic comparison of the two physical phenomena is carried out. In
particular, it is demonstrated that the two underlying formalisms differ only
up to an irrelevant canonical transformation. Hence, the basic physical
mechanisms at play are similar in both cases and can be reduced to the
quantization of a parametric oscillator leading to particle creation due to the
interaction with a classical source: pair production in vacuum is therefore
equivalent to the appearance of a growing mode for the cosmological
fluctuations. The only difference lies in the nature of the source: an electric
field in the case of the Schwinger effect and the gravitational field in the
case of inflationary perturbations. Although, in the laboratory, it is
notoriously difficult to produce an electric field such that pairs extracted
from the vacuum can be detected, the gravitational field in the early universe
can be strong enough to lead to observable effects that ultimately reveal
themselves as temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background.
Finally, the question of how quantum cosmological perturbations can be
considered as classical is discussed at the end of the article.
