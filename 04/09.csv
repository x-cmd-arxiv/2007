the putative circumnuclear molecular gas disk at sub-arcsecond resolution to
better understand both the spatial distribution and kinematics of the molecular
gas. We carried out CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) line observations of the nuclear region
of M51 with the new A configuration of the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer,
yielding a spatial resolution lower than 15 pc. The high resolution images show
no clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to the
radio jet axis, as suggested by previous observations, but show two separate
features located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The western
feature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocity
correspondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggesting
that this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongated
nearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in the
same direction with increasingly blueshifted velocities near the nucleus. This
velocity gradient is in the opposite sense of that previously inferred for the
putative circumnuclear disk. Possible explanations for the observed molecular
gas distribution and kinematics are that a rotating gas disk disturbed by the
jet, gas streaming toward the nucleus, or a ring with another smaller counter-

originates from the transfer of particles that are deflected through ~90 deg
into near-Earth orbits each time the particles cross the outer reaches of the
Sun which had captured them. Their multi-loop (cross-like) trajectories
traverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases
the probability for the particles to enter near-Earth orbits during this time.

Lifshitz theory of the van der Waals and Casimir forces is demonstrated to be
consistent with thermodynamics. The nonzero dc conductivity of dielectric
plates is proved to lead to a violation of the Nernst heat theorem and, thus,
is not related to the phenomenon of dispersion forces. The low-temperature

field fluid model, the results deduced from this model agree very well with the
observations. The observed cosmological redshift of light depends on both the
speed of the emitter and the distance between the emitter and the observer. If
the emitter moves away from us, a redshift is observed. If the emitter moves
towards us, whether a redshift, a blueshift or no shift is observed will depend
on the speed vs. the distance. If the speed is in the range of
c(exp[-beta*D]-1) < v < 0, a redshift is observed; if the speed equals
c(exp[-beta*D]-1), no shift is observed; if the speed v less than
c(exp[-beta*D]-1), a blueshift is observed. A redshift will be always observed
in all directions for any celestial objects as long as their distance from us
is large enough. Therefore, many more redshifts than blueshifts should be
observed for galaxies and supernovae, etc in the sky. This conclusion agrees
with current observations. The estimated value of the redshift constant beta of
the dark matter field fluid is in the range of 10^(-3) ~ 10^(-5)/Mpc. A large
redshift value from a distant celestial object may not necessarily indicate
that it has a large receding speed. Based on the redshift effect of dark matter
field fluid, it is concluded that at least in time average all photons have the

P_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory
(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in
the exponential form $e^{-\alpha_{NR}} p_B\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT
results are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\to 0$. In addition, we
have identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix
elements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\bar K|\bar ss|0>$, which can be
constrained from the decay $\bar B^0\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\to K^-K_SK_S$. The
intermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through
the vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated
with the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the
Breit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated
by the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of
$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the
data within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\to K^+K^-K_{S}$
decay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective
$\sin 2\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct
CP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the
latter. (iii) For $B\to K\pi\pi$ decays, we found sizable nonresonant

right-hand side. A known approach of splitting the saddle point problem into
separate equations for the primary unknown and for the Lagrange multiplier is
used. We revisit the traditional Ladygenskaya--Babu\v{s}ka--Brezzi (LBB) or
inf--sup condition as well as the standard coercivity condition, and analyze
how they are affected by the degeneracy of the corresponding bilinear forms. We
suggest and discuss generalized conditions that cover the degenerate case. The

positiveness of the minimum gap of relevant subspaces, and propose several
equivalent expressions for the minimum gap. Our results provide a foundation

very low detection probability. Planets of low metallicity stars typically do
not reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system
properties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is
considered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,
respectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems
at high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,

only at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it
is still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular

orbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on

non-chiral zero modes which could be easily lifted by the mentioned effects. A
few more orientifold examples are also found under less stringent constraints

property that R-parity conservation is automatic and the flavour structure of
the neutrino Majorana mass matrices has a simple factorized form.

analysed from a very general viewpoint. From this perspective the
renormalization prescriptions not only imply the renormalization of the
couplings of the theory in the bulk but also the appearance of a flow in the
space of boundary conditions. For regular boundaries this flow has a large
variety of fixed points and no cyclic orbit. The family of fixed points
includes Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In one-dimensional field
theories pseudoperiodic and quasiperiodic boundary conditions are also RG fixed
points. Under these conditions massless bosonic free field theories are
conformally invariant. Among all fixed points only Neumann boundary conditions
are infrared stable fixed points. All other conformal invariant boundary
conditions become unstable under some relevant perturbations. In finite volumes
we analyse the dependence of the vacuum energy along the trajectories of the
renormalization group flow providing an interesting framework for dark energy
evolution. On the contrary, the renormalization group flow on the boundary does
not affect the leading behaviour of the entanglement entropy of the vacuum in
one-dimensional conformally invariant bosonic theories.

based on using in matched filtering only the dominant harmonic of the inspiral

More significantly, inclusion of other harmonics in our matched filters would
mean that more massive systems that were previously thought to be {\it not}
visible in LISA should be detectable with reasonable SNRs. Our estimates show
that we should be able to significantly increase the mass reach of LISA and
observe the more commonly occurring supermassive black holes of masses $\sim
10^8M_\odot.$ More specifically, with the inclusion of all known harmonics LISA
will be able to observe even supermassive black hole coalescences with total
mass $\sim 10^8 M_\odot (10^9M_\odot)$ (and mass-ratio 0.1) for a low frequency
cut-off of $10^{-4}{\rm Hz}$ $(10^{-5}{\rm Hz})$ with an SNR up to $\sim 60$

\bm{r}')$ in terms of products of other functions that only depend on either
$\bm{r}$ or $\bm{r}'$. The best known example of such an addition theorem is
the Laplace expansion of the Coulomb potential which possesses a characteristic
two-range form. Guseinov [Chem. Phys. {\bf 309}, 209 - 213 (2005)] derived
one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential via the limit $\beta \to
0$ in previously derived one-range addition theorems for the Yukawa potential
$\exp \bigl(-\beta | \bm{r}-\bm{r}'| \bigr) /| \bm{r}-\bm{r}'|$. At first
sight, this looks like a remarkable achievement, but from a mathematical point
of view, Guseinov's work is at best questionable and in some cases
fundamentally flawed. One-range addition theorems are expansions in terms of
functions that are complete and orthonormal in a given Hilbert space, but
Guseinov replaced the complete and orthonormal functions by nonorthogonal
Slater-type functions and rearranged the resulting expansions. This is a
dangerous operation whose validity must be checked. It is shown that the
one-center limit $\bm{r}' = \bm{0}$ of Guseinov's rearranged Yukawa addition
theorems as well as of several other addition theorems does not exist.
Moreover, the Coulomb potential does not belong to any of the Hilbert spaces
implicitly used by Guseinov. Accordingly, one-range addition theorems for the
Coulomb potential diverge in the mean. Instead, these one-range addition
theorems have to interpreted as expansions of generalized functions in the
sense of Schwartz that converge weakly in suitable functionals.

consider the problem of description of polynomial hulls $\wh{Gv}$ for orbits
$Gv$, $v\in V$, assuming that the identity component of $G$ is a torus $T$. The
paper contains a universal construction for orbits which satisfy the inclusion
$Gv\subset T^\bbC v$ and a characterization of pairs $(G,V)$ such that it is
true for a generic $v\in V$. The hull of a finite union of $T$-orbits in
$T^\bbC v$ can be distinguished in $\clos T^\bbC v$ by a finite collection of
inequalities of the type $\abs{z_1}^{s_1}...\abs{z_n}^{s_n}\leq c$. In
particular, this is true for $Gv$. If powers in the monomials are independent
of $v$, $Gv\subset T^\bbC v$ for a generic $v$, and either the center of $G$ is
finite or $T^\bbC$ has an open orbit, then the space $V$ and the group $G$ are
products of standard ones; the latter means that $G=S_nT$, where $S_n$ is the
group of all permutations of coordinates and $T$ is either $\bbT^n$ or
$\SU(n)\cap\bbT^n$, where $\bbT^n$ is the torus of all diagonal matrices in

of isotropy groups of bounded symmetric domains. This result is already known,
but we formulate it in a different form and supply with a shorter proof.

$qq$ forces) to the analytical structure of the $qqq$ wave function is worked
out in the high momentum regime of QCD where the confining interaction may be
ignored, so that the dominant effect is $Coulombic$. A distinctive feature of
this study is that the spin-rich $qqq$ force is generated by a $ggg$ vertex (a
genuine part of the QCD Lagrangian) wherein the 3 radiating gluon lines end on
as many quark lines, giving rise to a (Mercedes-Benz type) $Y$-shaped diagram.
The dynamics is that of a Salpeter-like equation (3D support for the kernel)
formulated covariantly on the light front, a la Markov-Yukawa Transversality
Principle (MYTP) which warrants a 2-way interconnection between the 3D and 4D
Bethe-Salpeter (BSE) forms for 2 as well as 3 fermion quarks. With these
ingredients, the differential equation for the 3D wave function $\phi$ receives
well-defined contributions from the $qq$ and $qqq$ forces. In particular a
$negative$ eigenvalue of the spin operator $i \sigma_1.\sigma_2\times \sigma_3$
which is an integral part of the $qqq$ force, causes a characteristic
singularity in the differential equation, signalling the dynamical effect of a
spin-rich $qqq$ force not yet considered in the literature. The potentially
crucial role of this interesting effect vis-a-vis the so-called `spin anomaly'

improve the energy resolution by combining the two signals. The improvement is
explained by reduced electron-ion recombination fluctuations of the combined
signal compared to fluctuations of the individual signals. Simultaneous
measurements of ionization and scintillation signals were carried out with
Cs-137, Na-22 and Co-60 gamma rays, as a function of electric field in the
liquid. A resolution of 1.7%(sigma) at 662 keV was measured at 1 kV/cm,
significantly better than the resolution from either scintillation or
ionization alone. A detailed analysis indicates that further improvement to
less than 1%(sigma) is possible with higher light collection efficiency and
lower electronic noise.

  Parameters and Circumstellar Interactions""",,,,"astro-ph",,"  New facilities and technologies have advanced our understanding of massive
stars significantly over the past 30 years. Here I introduce a new large survey
of massive stars using VLT-FLAMES, noting the target fields and observed binary
fractions. These data have been used for the first empirical test of the
metallicity dependence of the intensity of stellar winds, finding good
agreement with theory -- an important result for the evolutionary models that
are used to interpret distant clusters, starbursts, and star-forming galaxies.
Looking ahead, plans for future Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) are now
undergoing significant development, and offer the exciting prospect of
observing spatially-resolved massive stars well beyond the Local Group.

ubiquitous trait seems to increase motivation and persistence, and is probably
evolutionarily adaptive. But how good really is our ability to control? How
successful is our track record in these areas? There is little understanding of
when and under what circumstances we may over-estimate or even lose our ability
to control and optimize outcomes, especially when they are the result of
aggregations of individual optimization processes. Here, we demonstrate
analytically using the theory of Markov Chains and by numerical simulations in
two classes of games, the Minority game and the Parrondo Games, that agents who
optimize their strategy based on past information actually perform worse than
non-optimizing agents. In other words, low-entropy (more informative)
strategies under-perform high-entropy (or random) strategies. This provides a
precise definition of the ""illusion of control"" in set-ups a priori defined to
emphasize the importance of optimization.
