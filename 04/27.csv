"0704.3448","Steve Gonek","S. M. Gonek","Finite Euler products and the Riemann Hypothesis","4 figures",,,,"math.NT math.CV",,"  We show that if the Riemann Hypothesis is true, then in a region containing
most of the right-half of the critical strip, the Riemann zeta-function is well
approximated by short truncations of its Euler product. Conversely, if the
approximation by products is good in this region, the zeta-function has at most
finitely many zeros in it. We then construct a parameterized family of
non-analytic functions with this same property. With the possible exception of
a finite number of zeros off the critical line, every function in the family
satisfies a Riemann Hypothesis. Moreover, when the parameter is not too large,
they have about the same number of zeros as the zeta-function, their zeros are
all simple, and they ""repel"". The structure of these functions makes the reason
for the simplicity and repulsion of their zeros apparent and suggests a
mechanism that might be responsible for the corresponding properties of the
zeta-function's zeros. Computer evidence suggests that the zeros of functions
in the family are remarkably close to those of the zeta-function (even for
small values of the parameter), and we show that they indeed converge to them
as the parameter increases. Furthermore, between zeros of the zeta-function,
the moduli of functions in the family tend to twice the modulus of the
zeta-function. Both assertions assume the Riemann Hypothesis. We end by
discussing analogues for other L-functions and show how they give insight into
the study of the distribution of zeros of linear combinations of L-functions.

non-Hermitian in the presence of a quark chemical potential. We show how the
action of the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix on an arbitrary vector
can be computed efficiently on large lattices by an iterative method. A Krylov
subspace approximation based on the Arnoldi algorithm is described for the
evaluation of a generic matrix function. The efficiency of the method is
spoiled when the matrix has eigenvalues close to a function discontinuity. This
is cured by adding a small number of critical eigenvectors to the Krylov
subspace, for which we propose two different deflation schemes. The ensuing
modified Arnoldi method is then applied to the sign function, which has a
discontinuity along the imaginary axis. The numerical results clearly show the
improved efficiency of the method. Our modification is particularly effective
when the action of the sign function of the same matrix has to be computed many
times on different vectors, e.g., if the overlap Dirac operator is inverted
using an iterative method.

solutions of type IIB supergravity, a metric background that deviates from
AdS_5 in the IR breaks supersymmetry, while the fermion mass hierarchy results
from the wavefunction overlap of bulk fermions with a UV-confined Higgs field.
The first and second generation squarks and sleptons, which are localized near
the IR brane, directly feel the supersymmetry breaking and obtain masses of
order 10 TeV. These are interpreted as composite states of the dual 4D theory.
The gauginos and third generation squarks and sleptons are elementary states
that obtain soft masses of order 1 TeV at the loop level via direct gauge
mediation. This particle spectrum leads to distinctive signatures at the LHC,
similar to the usual gauge mediation with a neutralino NLSP that decays
promptly to a gravitino LSP, but with lower event rates. Nevertheless we show
that with 1-10 fb^{-1} of LHC data ""single-sector"" models can easily be
detected above background and distinguished from conventional gravity and gauge
mediation.

simulations of magnetically supercritical, turbulent, isothermal molecular

lifetimes (given as a function of the mean density within the cores, which in
turn is determined by the density threshold n_thr used to define them) are
consistent with observationally reported values, ranging from a few to several
free-fall times. We also present estimates of the fraction of cores in the
""prestellar"", ""stellar'', and ""failed"" (those cores that redisperse back into
the environment) stages as a function of n_thr. The number ratios are measured
indirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach
contains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class
0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a
value t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores
ranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,
again in good agreement with observational determinations. We also find that
the mass in the failed cores is comparable to that in stellar cores at n_thr =
1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3, but becomes negligible at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3, in
agreement with recent observational suggestions that at the latter densities
the cores are in general gravitationally dominated. We conclude by noting that

increase energy efficiency in ad hoc networks through joint adaptation of
nodes' transmitting powers and route selection. The design maintains the
advantages of the classic OSI model, while accounting for the cross-coupling
between layers, through information sharing. The proposed joint power control
and routing algorithm is shown to increase significantly the overall energy
efficiency of the network, at the expense of a moderate increase in complexity.
Performance enhancement of the joint design using multiuser detection is also
investigated, and it is shown that the use of multiuser detection can increase
the capacity of the ad hoc network significantly for a given level of energy
consumption.

  Editors Franz Kerschbaum, Corinne Charbonnel, and Bob Wing",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Mass loss rate formulae are derived from observations or from suites of
models. For theoretical models, the following have all been identified as
factors greatly influencing the atmospheric structure and mass loss rates:
Pulsation with piston amplitude scaling appropriately with stellar L; dust
nucleation and growth, with radiation pressure and grain-gas interactions and
appropriate dependence on temperature and density; non-grey opacity with at
least 51 frequency samples; non-LTE and departures from radiative equilibrium
in the compressed and expanding flows; and non-equilibrium processes affecting
the composition (grain formation; molecular chemistry). No one set of models
yet includes all the factors known to be important. In fact, it is very
difficult to construct a model that can simultaneously include these factors
and be useful for computing spectra. Therefore, although theoretical model
grids are needed to separate the effects of M,L,R and/or $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ or
Z on the mass loss rates, these models must be carefully checked against
observations. Getting the right order of magnitude for the mass loss rate is
only the first step in such a comparison, and is not sufficient to determine
whether the mass loss formula is correct. However, there are observables that
do test the validity of mass loss formulae as they depend directly on $d\log
\dot M/d\log L$, $d\log \dot M/d\log R$, or $d\log \dot M/d\log P$.

recently characterized for the classical Gaussian ensembles of NxN random

as a function of beta (zero or positive) by Monte Carlo simulations. The
fluctuation of delta(n) and the autocorrelation function vary logarithmically
with n for any beta>0 (1<<n<<N). The simple logarithmic behavior reported for
the higher-order moments of delta(n) for the GOE (beta=1) and the GUE (beta=2)
is valid for any positive beta and is accounted for by Gaussian distributions
whose variances depend linearly on ln(n). The 1/f noise previously demonstrated
for delta(n) series of the three Gaussian ensembles, is characterized by
wavelet analysis both as a function of beta and of N. When beta decreases from
1 to 0, for a given and large enough N, the evolution from a 1/f noise at
beta=1 to a 1/f^2 noise at beta=0 is heterogeneous with a ~1/f^2 noise at the
finest scales and a ~1/f noise at the coarsest ones. The range of scales in
which a ~1/f^2 noise predominates grows progressively when beta decreases.
Asymptotically, a 1/f^2 noise is found for beta=0 while a 1/f noise is the rule
for beta positive.

regions where the mean free path of the electrons is large compared to the
temperature scaleheight. Significant structural and evolutionary differences
occur between simulations with and without heat conduction. Dense clouds in
pure dynamical models experience dynamical destruction by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)
instability. In static models heat conduction leads to evaporation of such
clouds. Heat conduction acting on clouds in a gas stream smooths out steep
temperature and density gradients at the edge of the cloud because the
conduction timescale is shorter than the cooling timescale. This diminishes the
velocity gradient between the streaming plasma and the cloud, so that the
timescale for the onset of KH instabilities increases, and the surface of the
cloud becomes less susceptible to KH instabilities. The stabilisation effect of
heat conduction against KH instability is more pronounced for smaller and less
massive clouds. As in the static case more realistic cloud conditions allow
heat conduction to transfer hot material onto the cloud's surface and to mix
the accreted gas deeper into the cloud.

from a strongly-lensed Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) at a redshift of z=3.038.
Gravitational lensing by the cluster magnifies its flux by a factor of ~16 and
produces six separate images with a total r-band magnitude of r_625=21.7. The
two spectra, each of which represents emission from different regions of the
LBG, show H I and interstellar metal absorption lines at the systemic redshift.
Significant variations are seen in Ly-alpha profile across a single galaxy,
ranging from strong absorption to a combination of emission plus absorption. A
spectrum of a third image close to the brightest arc shows Ly-alpha emission at
the same redshift as the LBG, arising from either another spatially distinct
region of the galaxy, or from a companion galaxy close to the LBG. Taken as a
group, the Ly-alpha equivalent width in these three spectra decreases with
increasing equivalent width of the strongest interstellar absorption lines. We
discuss how these variations can be used to understand the physical conditions
in the LBG. Intrinsically, this LBG is faint, ~0.1L*, and forming stars at a
modest rate, ~4 solar masses per year. We also detect absorption line systems
toward the Sextet Arcs at z=2.873 and z=2.534. The latter system is seen across

dynamics on $G(n,d/n)$ is polynomial in $n$. Our results are the first
polynomial time mixing results proven for a natural model on $G(n,d/n)$ for $d
> 1$ where the parameters of the model do not depend on $n$. They also provide
a rare example where one can prove a polynomial time mixing of Gibbs sampler in
a situation where the actual mixing time is slower than $n \polylog(n)$. Our
proof exploits in novel ways the local treelike structure of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graphs, comparison and block dynamics arguments and a recent result of
Weitz.
  Our results extend to much more general families of graphs which are sparse
in some average sense and to much more general interactions. In particular,
they apply to any graph for which every vertex $v$ of the graph has a
neighborhood $N(v)$ of radius $O(\log n)$ in which the induced sub-graph is a
tree union at most $O(\log n)$ edges and where for each simple path in $N(v)$
the sum of the vertex degrees along the path is $O(\log n)$. Moreover, our
result apply also in the case of arbitrary external fields and provide the
first FPRAS for sampling the Ising distribution in this case. We finally
present a non Markov Chain algorithm for sampling the distribution which is
effective for a wider range of parameters. In particular, for $G(n,d/n)$ it
applies for all external fields and $\beta < \beta_d$, where $d \tanh(\beta_d)

reasonable fit to the data. This indicates that shortly after the formation of
the clusters from a fractal gas, their radii have changed in a non-uniform way.

redder clusters in the interarm regions, suggesting that clusters in spiral
arms are more compact. We find a correlation between radius and galactocentric

local universe (z~0.1), spanning a range from gas-rich dwarfs to massive
ellipticals. We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (UV) and SDSS
(optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that include
dust attenuation. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare
remarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfect
agreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dust
attenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs for
galaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminated
with an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simple
prescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normal
star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar
mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, and
for (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinct
star formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-forming
and the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lie
on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong
AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN,
while also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm of
quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies
that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence)
galaxies via strong and weak AGN. We confirm that some galaxies with no H alpha
emission show signs of SF in the UV. We derive a UV-based cosmic SFR density at
z=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).

velocity dispersion at fixed richness. The mean velocity dispersion increases
from 202+/-10 km/s for small groups to more than 854+/-102 km/s for large
clusters. We show the scatter to be at most 40.5+/-3.5%, declining to
14.9+/-9.4% in the richest bins. We test our methods in the C4 cluster catalog,
a spectroscopic cluster catalog produced from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR2

one-sigma of the true value, and the mean to within 10%, in the mock catalogs.
By convolving the scatter in velocity dispersion at fixed richness with the
observed richness space density function, we measure the velocity dispersion
function of the maxBCG galaxy clusters. Although velocity dispersion and
richness do not form a true mass-observable relation, the relationship between
velocity dispersion and mass is theoretically well characterized and has low
scatter. Thus our results provide a key link between theory and observations up
to the velocity bias between dark matter and galaxies.

that the entanglement entropy is a singular function of temperature and system
size, and that the limit of zero temperature and the limit of infinite system
size do not commute. From the entanglement entropy we obtain the topological
entropy, which is shown to drop to half its zero-temperature value for any
infinitesimal temperature in the thermodynamic limit, and remains constant as
the temperature is further increased. Such discontinuous behavior is replaced
by a smooth decreasing function in finite-size systems. If the separation of
energy scales in the system is large but finite, we argue that our results hold
at small enough temperature and finite system size, and a second drop in the
topological entropy should occur as the temperature is raised so as to disrupt
the magnetic loop structure by allowing the appearance of free magnetic
charges. We interpret our results as an indication that the underlying magnetic
and electric closed loop structures contribute equally to the topological
entropy (and therefore to the topological order) in the system. Since each loop
structure \emph{per se} is a classical object, we interpret the quantum
topological order in our system as arising from the ability of the two

light in these objects, its relation to the circumnuclear starburst phenomenon,
and the connection of this to the evolution and growth of the galaxy bulge and
central black hole. In this paper, we describe the near-UV morphology of the
objects and characterize the near-UV emission. We estimate the size and the
luminosity of the emitting regions and extract the luminosity profile. We also
determine the presence of unresolved compact nuclei. In addition, the
circumnuclear stellar cluster population is identified, and the contribution of
the stellar clusters to the total light, at this wavelength, is estimated. The
size of the sample allows us to draw robust statistical conclusions. We find
that {Seyfert 1} galaxies are completely dominated by its bright and compact
nucleus, that remains point-like at this resolution, while we find almost no
unresolved nucleus in Seyfert 2. The Seyfert types 1 and 2 are quite segregated
in an asymmetry vs compactness plot. Stellar clusters are found somewhat more
frequently in Sy2 (in ~70% of the galaxies) than in Sy1 (~57%), and contribute
more to the total light in Sy2, but this two differences seem to be mostly due
to the large contribution of the compact nucleus in Sy1, as the luminosity
distribution of the clusters is similar in both Sy types.

of acoustic perturbations in an inhomogeneous dynamical fluid system, and some
kinematic features of space-time in general relativity. An effective metric,
referred to as the `acoustic metric', which describes the geometry of the
manifold in which acoustic perturbations propagate, can be constructed. This
effective geometry can capture the properties of curved space-time in general
relativity. Physical models constructed utilizing such analogies are called
`analogue gravity models'. Classical analogue gravity effect may be observed
when acoustic perturbations propagate through a inhomogeneous transonic
classical fluid. The acoustic horizon, which resembles a black hole event
horizon in many ways, is generated at the transonic point in the fluid flow.
The acoustic horizon is essentially a null hyper surface, generators of which
are the acoustic null geodesics, i.e. the phonons. The acoustic horizon emits
acoustic radiation with quasi thermal phonon spectra, which is analogous to the
actual Hawking radiation. The temperature of the radiation emitted from the
acoustic horizon is referred to as the analogue Hawking temperature.
  It has been demonstrated that, in general, the transonic accretion in
astrophysics can be considered as an example of the classical analogue gravity
model naturally found in the Universe.

become a major subject of study, because of its important role in scaffolding
the macroscopic aspects of animal behavior and intelligence. In this study we
present a computational reconstruction approach to the problem of network
organization, by considering the topological and spatial features of each area
in the primate cerebral cortex as subsidy for the reconstruction of the global
cortical network connectivity. Starting with all areas being disconnected,
pairs of areas with similar sets of features are linked together, in an attempt
to recover the original network structure. Inferring primate cortical
connectivity from the properties of the nodes, remarkably good reconstructions
of the global network organization could be obtained, with the topological
features allowing slightly superior accuracy to the spatial ones. Analogous
reconstruction attempts for the C. elegans neuronal network resulted in
substantially poorer recovery, indicating that cortical area interconnections
are relatively stronger related to the considered topological and spatial
properties than neuronal projections in the nematode. The close relationship
between area-based features and global connectivity may hint on developmental
rules and constraints for cortical networks. Particularly, differences between
the predictions from topological and spatial properties, together with the
poorer recovery resulting from spatial properties, indicate that the
organization of cortical networks is not entirely determined by spatial
constraints.

intermediate delays, and a strong sensitivity to pi-pulse phase. Experiments
that set limits on possible extrinsic causes for the phenomena are reported. We
find that the action of the system's internal Hamiltonian during any real pulse

disorder but does not produce a peak in the depinning force. Our results
indicate that for binary mixtures, optimal pinning occurs for topological

smaller degrees of warping, below a critical value, which depends on deficit

cosmological three dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations, we explore
in detail the virialization of baryons in the concordance cosmology, including
optically thin primordial gas cooling. We focus on early protogalaxies with
virial temperatures of 10^4 K and their progenitors. Without cooling, virial
heating occurs in shocks close to the virial radius for material falling in
from voids. Material in dense filaments penetrates deeper to about half that
radius. With cooling the virial shock position shrinks and also the filaments
reach scales as small as a third the virial radius. The temperatures in
protogalaxies found in adiabatic simulations decrease by a factor of two from
the center and show flat entropy cores. In cooling halos the gas reaches virial
equilibrium with the dark matter potential through its turbulent velocities. We
observe turbulent Mach numbers ranging from one to three in the cooling cases.
This turbulence is driven by the large scale merging and interestingly remains
supersonic in the centers of these early galaxies even in the absence of any
feedback processes. The virial theorem is shown to approximately hold over 3
orders of magnitude in length scale with the turbulent pressure prevailing over
the thermal energy. The turbulent velocity distributions are Maxwellian and by
far dominate the small rotation velocities associated with the total angular
momentum of the galaxies. Decomposing the velocity field using the
Cauchy-Stokes theorem, we show that ample amounts of vorticity are present
around shocks even at the very centers of these objects.

protein concentration gradients. Measuring the local concentration of such a
protein with a spatially-varying distribution allows the measurement of
position within the system. In order for these systems to work effectively,
position determination must be robust to noise. Here, we calculate fundamental
limits to the precision of position determination by concentration gradients
due to unavoidable biochemical noise perturbing the gradients. We focus on
gradient proteins with first order reaction kinetics. Systems of this type have
been experimentally characterised in both developmental and cell biology
settings. For a single gradient we show that, through time-averaging, great
precision can potentially be achieved even with very low protein copy numbers.
As a second example, we investigate the ability of a system with oppositely
directed gradients to find its centre. With this mechanism, positional
precision close to the centre improves more slowly with increasing averaging
time, and so longer averaging times or higher copy numbers are required for
high precision. For both single and double gradients, we demonstrate the
existence of optimal length scales for the gradients, where precision is
maximized, as well as analyzing how precision depends on the size of the
concentration measuring apparatus. Our results provide fundamental constraints
on the positional precision supplied by concentration gradients in various
contexts, including both in developmental biology and also within a single
cell.

receivers cooperate by using Wyner-Ziv compress-and-forward over an analogous

cooperation, the allocation of network power and bandwidth among the data and

outperforms receiver cooperation and improves capacity over non-cooperative
transmission under most operating conditions when the cooperation channel is
strong. However, a weak cooperation channel limits the transmitter cooperation
rate; in this case receiver cooperation is more advantageous.
Transmitter-and-receiver cooperation offers sizable additional capacity gain

personal digital archiving in practice. Our aim is to design a service for the
long-term storage, preservation, and access of digital belongings by examining
how personal archiving needs intersect with existing and emerging archiving
technologies, best practices, and policies. Our findings not only confirmed
that experienced home computer users are creating, receiving, and finding an
increasing number of digital belongings, but also that they have already lost
irreplaceable digital artifacts such as photos, creative efforts, and records.
Although participants reported strategies such as backup and file replication
for digital safekeeping, they were seldom able to implement them consistently.
Four central archiving themes emerged from the data: (1) people find it
difficult to evaluate the worth of accumulated materials; (2) personal storage
is highly distributed both on- and offline; (3) people are experiencing
magnified curatorial problems associated with managing files in the aggregate,
creating appropriate metadata, and migrating materials to maintainable formats;
and (4) facilities for long-term access are not supported by the current
desktop metaphor. Four environmental factors further complicate archiving in
consumer settings: the pervasive influence of malware; consumer reliance on ad
hoc IT providers; an accretion of minor system and registry inconsistencies;
and strong consumer beliefs about the incorruptibility of digital forms, the
reliability of digital technologies, and the social vulnerability of networked
storage.

the interaction are provided by vector meson (rho, omega) exchange and
higher-order box diagrams involving D*N, D\Delta, and D*\Delta intermediate
states. The short range part is assumed to receive additional contributions
from genuine quark-gluon processes. The predicted cross sections for Dbar-N for
excess energies up to 150 MeV are of the same order of magnitude as those for

shape and the motion of the filaments does not agree with a purely Keplerian
motion of the gas in the potential of the supermassive black hole at the
position of SgrA*. Therefore, additional mechanisms must be responsible for
their formation and motion. We argue that the properties of the filaments are
probably related to an outflow from the disk of young mass-losing stars around
SgrA*. In part, the outflow may originate from the black hole itself. We also
present some evidence and theoretical considerations that the outflow may be
collimated.

(LPM) effects in photon emission from the quark gluon plasma as a function of
photon mass. This approach was based on Generalized Emission Functions (GEF)
for photon emission, derived at a fixed temperature and strong coupling
constant. In the present work, we have extended the LPM calculations for
several temperatures and strong coupling strengths. The integral equations for
(${\bf \tilde{f}(\tilde{p}_\perp)}$) and ($\tilde{g}({\bf \tilde{p}_\perp})$)
are solved by the iterations method for the variable set
\{$p_0,q_0,Q^2,T,\alpha_s$\}, considering bremsstrahlung and $\bf aws$
processes. We generalize the dynamical scaling variables, $x_T$, $x_L$, for
bremsstrahlung and {\bf aws} processes which are now functions of variables
$p_0,q_0,Q^2,T,\alpha_s$. The GEF introduced earlier, $g^b_T$, $g^a_T$,
$g^b_L$, $g^a_L$, are also generalized for any temperatures and coupling
strengths. From this, the imaginary part of the photon polarization tensor as a
function of photon mass and energy can be calculated as a one dimensional
integral over these GEF and parton distribution functions in the plasma.
However, for phenomenological studies of experimental data, one needs a simple
empirical formula without involving parton momentum integrations. Therefore, we
present a phenomenological formula for imaginary photon polarization tensor as
a function of \{$q_0,Q^2,T,\alpha_s$\} that includes bremsstrahlung and $\bf
aws$ mechanisms along with LPM effects.

diffraction-limited (about 0.3 arcsec) images in the mid-infrared where strong
PAH features appear enable us to see the flaring structure of the disks around
Herbig Ae stars.
  Although great progress has been made in modelling the disk with radiative
transfer models able to reproduce the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
Herbig Ae stars, the constraints brought by images have not been yet fully
exploited. Here, we are interested in checking if these new observational
imaging constraints can be accounted for by predictions based on existing
models of passive centrally irradiated hydrostatic disks made to fit the SEDs
of the Herbig Ae stars.
  Methods: The images taken by VISIR in the 8.6 and 11.3 microns aromatic
features reveal a large flaring disk around HD97048 inclined to the line of
sight. In order to analyse the spatial distribution of these data, we use a
disk model which includes the most up to date understanding of disk structure
and physics around Herbig Ae stars with grains in thermal equilibrium in
addition to transiently-heated PAHs.
  Results: We compare the observed spatial distribution of the PAH emission
feature and the adjacent continuum emission with predictions based on existing
full disk models. Both SED and spatial distribution are in very good agreement
with the model predictions for common disk parameters.
  Conclusions: We take the general agreement between observations and
predictions as a strong support for the physical pictures underlying our flared
disk model.

magnetic fields in stellar convection zones and possibly also in other
astrophysical contexts. We continue the study started in the first paper of
this series by considering the stability properties of longitudinal flows along
magnetic flux tubes. A linear stability analysis was carried out to determine
criteria for the onset of instability in the framework of the approximation of
thin magnetic flux tubes. In the non-dissipative case, we find Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability for flow velocities exceeding a critical speed that depends on the
Alfv{\'e}n speed and on the ratio of the internal and external densities.
Inclusion of a friction term proportional to the relative transverse velocity
leads to a friction-driven instability connected with backward (or negative
energy) waves. We discuss the physical nature of this instability. In the case
of a stratified external medium, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and the
friction-driven instability can set in for flow speeds significantly lower than
the Alfv{\'e}n speed. Dissipative effects can excite flow-driven instability
below the thresholds for the Kelvin-Helmholtz and the undulatory (Parker-type)
instabilities. This may be important for magnetic flux storage in stellar
convection zones and for the stability of astrophysical jets.

evolution under their self-gravity of particles displaced from a perfect
lattice to quantify precisely, up to shell crossing, the effects of
discreteness in dissipationless cosmological N-body simulations. We give simple
expressions, explicitly dependent on the particle density, for the evolution of
power in each mode as a function of red-shift. For typical starting red-shifts
the effect of finite particle number is to {\it slow down} slightly the growth
of power compared to that in the fluid limit (e.g. by about ten percent at half
the Nyquist frequency), and to induce also dispersion in the growth as a
function of direction at a comparable level. In the limit that the initial
red-shift tends to infinity, at fixed particle density, the evolution in fact
diverges from that in the fluid limit (described by the Zeldovich
approximation). Contrary to widely held belief, this means that a simulation
started at a red-shift much higher than the red-shift of shell crossing
actually gives a worse, rather than a better, result. We also study how these
effects are modified when there is a small-scale regularization of the
gravitational force. We show that such a smoothing may reduce the anisotropy of
the discreteness effects, but it then {\it increases} their average effect.
This behaviour illustrates the fact that the discreteness effects described
here are distinct from those usually considered in this context, due to
two-body collisions. Indeed the characteristic time for divergence from the
collisionless limit is proportional to $N^{2/3}$, rather than $N/ \log N$ in
the latter case.

magnetic obstacle -- as an essential part of their constructions. Recently, it
has been demonstrated that the flow of an electrically conducting fluid
influenced by an external field can show several kinds of recirculation. The
present paper reports a 3D numerical study whose some results are compared with
an experiment about such a flow in a rectangular duct.

  excitation of standing surface-plasmon Bloch waves""","This posting is a comment on an article, I. I. Smolyaninov and Y.-J.
  Hung, Phys. Rev. B 75, 033411 (2007)",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.77.036401",,"physics.optics",,"  The purpose of this comment is first to correct a misapprehension of the role
played by composite wave diffraction on surface-wave generation at
subwavelength structures and second to point out that periodic Bloch structures
are unnecessary for the efficient production of the surface plasmon polariton
(SPP) guided mode either as traveling or standing waves. Guided surface waves
originate from simple slit or groove edges illuminated under normal incidence,
and one-dimensional (1-D) surface cavities from these standing waves are easily
realized.

"0704.3702","Bartlomiej Waclaw","B. Waclaw","Statistical mechanics of complex networks","78 pages, based on PhD thesis, see the Preface for more comments",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  The science of complex networks is a new interdisciplinary branch of science
which has arisen recently on the interface of physics, biology, social and
computer sciences, and others. Its main goal is to discover general laws
governing the creation and growth as well as processes taking place on
networks, like e.g. the Internet, transportation or neural networks. It turned
out that most real-world networks cannot be simply reduced to a compound of
some individual components. Fortunately, the statistical mechanics, being one
of pillars of modern physics, provides us with a very powerful set of tools and
methods for describing and understanding these systems. In this thesis, we
would like to present a consistent approach to complex networks based on
statistical mechanics, with the central role played by the concept of
statistical ensemble of networks. We show how to construct such a theory and
present some practical problems where it can be applied. Among them, we pay
attention to the problem of finite-size corrections and the dynamics of a
simple model of mass transport on networks.
