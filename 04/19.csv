limit of a nonrelativistic Fermi liquid on a flat two-dimensional plane. Here
we study this noncritical M-theory in the limit of high energies, analogous to
the \alpha'\to\infty limit of string theory. In the related case of
two-dimensional Type 0A strings, it has been argued that the conformal
\alpha'\to\infty limit leads to AdS_2 with a propagating fermion whose mass is
set by the value of the RR flux. Here we provide evidence that in the
high-energy limit, the natural ground state of noncritical M-theory similarly
describes the AdS_2\times S^1 spacetime, with a massless propagating fermion.
We argue that the spacetime effective theory in this background is captured by
a topological higher-spin extension of conformal Chern-Simons gravity in 2+1
dimensions, consistently coupled to a massless Dirac field. Intriguingly, the
two-dimensional plane populated by the original nonrelativistic fermions is
essentially the twistor space associated with the symmetry group of the
AdS_2\times S^1 spacetime; thus, at least in the high-energy limit, noncritical
M-theory can be nonperturbatively described as a ""Fermi liquid on twistor

Using 200 Mpc radiative transfer simulations, we calculate the effect that

most interestingly, on the clustering of emitters for several realistic models
of reionization. Reionization increases the measured clustering of emitters,
and we show that this enhancement would be essentially impossible to attribute
to anything other than reionization. Our results motivate looking for the
signature of reionization in existing LAE data. We find that for stellar
reionization scenarios the angular correlation function of the 58 LAEs in the
Subaru Deep Field z = 6.6 photometric sample is more consistent with a fully
ionized universe (mean volume ionized fraction x_i = 1) than a universe with
x_i < 0.5 at >2-sigma confidence level. Measurements in the next year on Subaru
will increase their z = 6.6 LAE sample by a factor of five and tighten these
limits. If the clustering signature of reionization is detected in a LAE
survey, a comparison with a Lyman-break or a H-alpha survey in the same field
would confirm the reionization hypothesis. We discuss the optimal LAE survey

aligned hard hexagons in the plane. Our aim is not just to provide a functional
for a new, admittedly academic, model, but to investigate the structure of
fundamental measure theory. A model of aligned hard hexagons has similarities
with the hard disk model. Both share ""lost cases"", i.e. admit configurations of
three particles in which there is pairwise overlap but not triple overlap.
These configurations are known to be problematic for fundamental measure
functionals, which are not able to capture their contribution correctly. This
failure lies in the inability of these functionals to yield a correct low
density limit of the third order direct correlation function. Here we derive
the functional by projecting aligned hard cubes on the plane x+y+z=0. The
correct dimensional crossover behavior of these functionals permits us to
follow this strategy. The functional of aligned hard cubes, however, does not
have lost cases, so neither had the resulting functional for aligned hard
hexagons. The latter exhibits, in fact, a peculiar structure as compared to the
one for hard disks. It depends on a uniparametric family of weighted densities
through a new term not appearing in the functional for hard disks. Apart from
studying the freezing of this system, we discuss the implications of the
functional structure for new developments of fundamental measure theory.

found that a large fraction of the SNII population do not show any association
with current star formation, which we put down to a 'runaway' fraction of these
progenitors. The SNIb/c population accurately traces the H-alpha emission, with
some suggestion that the SNIc progenitors show a higher degree of correlation
than the SNIb, suggesting higher mass progenitors for the former. Overall the
SNIa population only show a weak correlation to the positions of HII regions,
but as many as a half may be associated with a young stellar population.

  mass-loss rates","A&A (in press), see full abstract in the text",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20066377",,"astro-ph",,"  Context: The mass-loss rate is a key parameter of massive stars. Adequate
stellar atmosphere models are required for spectral analyses and mass-loss
determinations. Present models can only account for the inhomogeneity of
stellar winds in the approximation of small-scale structures that are optically
thin. This treatment of ``microclumping'' has led to reducing empirical
mass-loss rates by factors of two and more. Aims: Stellar wind clumps can be
optically thick in spectral lines. We investigate how this ``macroclumping''
impacts on empirical mass-loss rates. Methods: The Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR)
model atmosphere code is generalized in the ``formal integral'' to account for
clumps that are not necessarily optically thin. Results: Optically thick clumps
reduce the effective opacity. This has a pronounced effect on the emergent
spectrum. Our modeling for the O-type supergiant zeta Puppis reveals that the
optically thin H-alpha line is not affected by wind porosity, but that the PV
resonance doublet becomes significantly weaker when macroclumping is taken into
account. The reported discrepancies between resonance-line and
recombination-line diagnostics can be resolved entirely with the macroclumping
modeling without downward revision of the mass-loss rate. Conclusions:
Mass-loss rates inferred from optically thin emission, such as the H-alpha line
in O stars, are not influenced by macroclumping. The strength of optically
thick lines, however, is reduced because of the porosity effects. Therefore,
neglecting the porosity in stellar wind modeling can lead to underestimating
empirical mass-loss rates.

moderately intense in microwaves, yet showed very meager EUV and X-ray
emission. The flare occurred on 2001 Oct 24 and was well-observed at radio
wavelengths by the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH), the Nobeyama Radio
Polarimeters (NoRP), and by the Owens Valley Solar Array (OVSA). It was also
observed in EUV and X-ray wavelength bands by the TRACE, GOES, and Yohkoh
satellites. We find that the impulsive onset of the radio emission is
progressively delayed with increasing frequency relative to the onset of hard
X-ray emission. In contrast, the time of flux density maximum is progressively
delayed with decreasing frequency. The decay phase is independent of radio
frequency. The simple source morphology and the excellent spectral coverage at
radio wavelengths allowed us to employ a nonlinear chi-squared minimization
scheme to fit the time series of radio spectra to a source model that accounts
for the observed radio emission in terms of gyrosynchrotron radiation from
MeV-energy electrons in a relatively dense thermal plasma. We discuss plasma
heating and electron acceleration in view of the parametric trends implied by
the model fitting. We suggest that stochastic acceleration likely plays a role
in accelerating the radio-emitting electrons.

promising methods for probing dark energy up to large redshifts. However, their
premise is hinged upon an accurate mass-observable relationship, which could be
affected by the (rather poorly understood) physics of the intracluster gas. In
this letter, using a semi-analytic model of the intracluster gas that
accommodates various theoretical uncertainties, I develop a Fundamental Plane
relationship between the observed size, thermal energy, and mass of galaxy
clusters. In particular, I find that M ~ (Y_{SZ}/R_{SZ,2})^{3/4}, where M is
the mass, Y_{SZ} is the total SZ flux or thermal energy, and R_{SZ,2} is the SZ
half-light radius of the cluster. I first show that, within this model, using
the Fundamental Plane relationship reduces the (systematic+random) errors in
mass estimates to 14%, from 22% for a simple mass-flux relationship. Since
measurement of the cluster sizes is an inevitable part of observing the SZ
clusters, the Fundamental Plane relationship can be used to reduce the error of
the cluster mass estimates by ~ 34%, improving the accuracy of the resulting
cosmological constraints without any extra cost. I then argue why our
Fundamental Plane is distinctly different from the virial relationship that one
may naively expect between the cluster parameters. Finally, I argue that while
including more details of the observed SZ profile cannot significantly improve
the accuracy of mass estimates, a better understanding of the impact of
non-gravitational heating/cooling processes on the outskirts of the
intracluster medium (apart from external calibrations) might be the best way to
reduce these errors.

present a maximum-likelihood method of determining the intrinsic spectral index

determine the ISIDs with much improved accuracy. Should any difference exist
between the ISIDs of BL Lacs and FSRQs or between the ISIDs of blazars in the

evolution over the course of its history. It is possible, even likely, that
terrestrial planets in other planetary systems have undergone similar changes;
consequently, the age distribution of nearby stars is an important
consideration in designing surveys for Earth-analogues. Valenti & Fischer
(2005) provide age and metallicity estimates for 1039 FGK dwarfs in the Solar
Neighbourhood. Using the Hipparcos catalogue as a reference to calibrate
potential biases, we have extracted volume-limited samples of nearby stars from
the Valenti-Fischer dataset. Unlike other recent investigations, our analysis
shows clear evidence for an age-metallicity relation in the local disk, albeit
with substantial dispersion at any epoch. The mean metallicity increases from
-0.3 dex at a lookback time of ~10 Gyrs to +0.15 dex at the present day.
Supplementing the Valenti-Fischer measurements with literature data to give a
complete volume-limited sample, the age distribution of nearby FGK dwarfs is
broadly consistent with a uniform star-formation rate over the history of the
Galactic disk. In striking contrast, most stars known to have planetary
companions are younger than 5 Gyrs; however, stars with planetary companions
within 0.4 AU have a significantly flatter age distribution, indicating that
those systems are stable on timescales of many Gyrs. Several of the older,
lower metallicity host stars have enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios, implying
membership of the thick disk. If the frequency of terrestrial planets is also
correlated with stellar metallicity, then the median age of such planetary
system is likely to be ~3 Gyrs. We discuss the implications of this hypothesis

coarse estimate of the black-hole masses m_1, m_2 and of the coalescence time
of the binary t_c. The second stage uses a sequence of matched-filter template
banks, seeded by the first stage, to improve the measurement accuracy of the
masses and coalescence time. Finally, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo search is used
to estimate all nine physical parameters of the binary. Using results from the

to determine the number of SMBH-binary signals in the data before starting
parameter estimation. We demonstrate our analysis pipeline using simulated data

At the cellular level, such adjustment relies on the transcription factors
(TFs) which must rapidly find their target sequences amidst a vast amount of
non-relevant sequences on DNA molecules. Whether these transcription factors
locate their target sites through a 1D or 3D pathway is still a matter of
speculation. It has been suggested that the optimum search time is when the
protein equally shares its search time between 1D and 3D diffusions. In this
paper, we study the above problem using a Monte Carlo simulation by considering
a very simple physical model. A 1D strip, representing a DNA, with a number of
low affinity sites, corresponding to non-target sites, and high affinity sites,
corresponding to target sites, is considered and later extended to a 2D strip.
We study the 1D and 3D exploration pathways, and combinations of the two modes
by considering three different types of molecules: a walker that randomly walks
along the strip with no dissociation; a jumper that represents dissociation and
then re-association of a TF with the strip at later time at a distant site; and
a hopper that is similar to the jumper but it dissociates and then
re-associates at a faster rate than the jumper. We analyze the final
probability distribution of molecules for each case and find that TFs can
locate their targets fast enough even if they spend 15% of their search time
diffusing freely in the solution. This indeed agrees with recent experimental
results obtained by Elf et al. 2007 and is in contrast with theoretical
expectation.

all of these stars were formerly A-type dwarfs with masses ranging from 1.65 to

during their stars' main-sequence phases due to the large rotational velocities
and stellar jitter exhibited by early-type dwarfs. There are now 9 ""retired""

orbit at distances a \geq 0.78 AU, which is significantly different than the
semimajor axis distribution of planets around lower-mass stars. We examine the
possibility that the observed lack of close-in planets is due to engulfment by
their expanding host stars, but we find that this explanation is inadequate
given the relatively small stellar radii of K giants (Rstar < 32 Rsun = 0.15
AU) and subgiants (Rstar < 7 Rsun = 0.03 AU). Instead, we conclude that planets

98] 097) at z=0.485, based on GMOS/Gemini South g', r' photometry and
spectroscopy, and XMM-Newton observations. We examine its nature and
surroundings by analyzing the projected galaxy distribution, the galaxy
velocity distribution, the weak-lensing mass reconstruction, and the X-ray
spectroscopy and imaging. The cluster shows a complex morphology. It is
composed by at least two structures along the line-of-sight, with velocity
dispersions of 592+-82 km s^-1 and 391+-85 km s^-1 respectively. Other
structures are also detected in X-ray, in the galaxy projected number density
map, and by weak-lensing. One of these clumps, could be gravitationally bound
and associated to the main cluster. The derived temperature and bolometric
X-ray luminosity reveal that [VMF 98] 097 behave like a normal cluster, in
agreement with Lx-Tx correlation found for both local (z=0) and moderate
redshift (z~0.4) clusters. We find that the mass determination inferred from
weak-lensing is in average 3 to 4.8 times higher (depending on the model
assumed) than the X-ray mass. We have two possible explanations for this
discrepancy: i) the cluster is in non-equilibrium, then the deviation of the
X-ray estimated mass from the true value can be as high as a factor of two; ii)
the intervening mass along the line-of-sight of the cluster is producing an
over-estimation of the weak-lensing mass. Based on the analysis presented, we
conclude that [VMF 98] 097 is a perturbed cluster with at least two
substructures in velocity space and with other nearby structures at projected
distances of about 1 h^-1 Mpc. This cluster is an example of a poor cluster
caught in the process of accreting sub-structures to become a rich cluster.

(GRBs) are believed to be massive stars. The investigation of long GRBs
therefore requires modeling the propagation of ultra-relativistic blastwaves
through the circumburst medium surrounding massive stars. We simulate the
expansion of an isotropic, adiabatic relativistic fireball into the wind-shaped
medium around a massive GRB progenitor. The circumburst medium is composed of a
realistically stratified stellar wind zone up to its termination shock,
followed by a region of shocked wind characterized by a constant density. Aims:
We followed the evolution of the blastwave through all its stages, including
the extremely rapid acceleration up to a Lorentz factor 75 flow, its
deceleration by interaction with stellar wind, its passage of the wind
termination shock, until its propagation through shocked wind. Methods: We used
the adaptive mesh refinement versatile advection code to follow the evolution
of the fireball. Results: We show that the acceleration from purely thermal to
ultra-relativistic kinetic regimes is abrupt and produces an internally
structured blastwave. We resolved the structure of this ultra-relativistic
shell in all stages, thanks to the adaptive mesh. We comment on the dynamical
roles played by forward and reverse shock pairs in the phase of interaction
with the free stellar wind and clearly identify the complex shock-dominated
structure created when the shell crosses the terminal shock. Conclusion: We
show that in our model where the terminal shock is taken relatively close to
the massive star, the phase of self-similar deceleration of Blandford-McKee
type can only be produced in the constant density, shocked wind zone.

have differentiable manifolds as a basis. Such skew-symmetric forms (which were

network is its broadcast nature, in which the signal transmitted by a node may
reach several other nodes, and a node may receive signals from several other
nodes simultaneously. Rather than a blessing, this feature is treated more as
an interference-inducing nuisance in most wireless networks today (e.g., IEEE
802.11). This paper shows that the concept of network coding can be applied at
the physical layer to turn the broadcast property into a capacity-boosting
advantage in wireless ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose a
physical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions among
nodes. In contrast to straightforward network coding which performs coding
arithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes use
of the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) waves
for equivalent coding operation. And in doing so, PNC can potentially achieve
100% and 50% throughput increases compared with traditional transmission and
straightforward network coding, respectively, in multi-hop networks. More
specifically, the information-theoretic capacity of PNC is almost double that
of traditional transmission in the SNR region of practical interest (higher
than 0dB). We believe this is a first paper that ventures into EM-wave-based
network coding at the physical layer and demonstrates its potential for
boosting network capacity.

of random anisotropy disorder. We discuss the Larkin-Imry-Ma state, which is
characterized by the short-range orientational order of the vector l, while the
long-range orientational order is destroyed by the collective action of the
randomly oriented aerogel strings. On the other hand, sufficiently large
regular anisotropy produced either by the deformation of the aerogel or by
applied superflow suppresses the Larkin-Imry-Ma effect leading to the uniform

sunlight over the year for the growth of the plants on which these animals

Pleistocene. As the cause of this geographic pole shift, we postulate a massive
object, which moved in an extremely eccentric orbit and was hot from tidal work
and solar radiation. Evaporation produced a disk-shaped cloud of ions around
the Sun. This cloud partially shielded the solar radiation, producing the cold
and warm periods that characterize the Pleistocene. The shielding depends on
the inclination of Earth's orbit, which has a period of 100'000 years. The
cloud builds up to a density at which inelastic particle collisions induce its
collapse The resulting near-periodic time dependence resembles that of
Dansgaard-Oeschger events. During cold periods fine grained inclusions were
deposited into the ice. The Pleistocene ended when the massive object had a
close encounter with the Earth, which suffered a one per mil stretching
deformation. While the deformation relaxed to an equilibrium shape in one to
several years, the globe turned relative to the rotation axis: The North Pole
moved from Greenland to the Arctic Sea. The massive object was torn to pieces,

can constitute a dynamically important population. If a significant number of
black holes are retained (here we assume complete retention), these objects
rapidly form a dense core where interactions are common, resulting in the
scattering of black holes into the cluster halo, and the ejection of black
holes from the cluster. These two processes heat the stellar component,
resulting in prolonged core expansion of a magnitude matching the observations.
Significant core evolution is also observed in Magellanic Cloud clusters at
early times. We find that this does not result from the action of black holes,

evolution in a primordially mass segregated cluster.

algebraic explanation is provided for the 'ABBA' construction first proposed by
Tirkkonen et al and the tensor product construction proposed by Karmakar et al.
Furthermore, it is established that the 4 transmit antenna STBC originally
proposed by Tirkkonen et al based on the ABBA construction is actually a single
complex symbol ML decodable code if the design variables are permuted and
signal sets of appropriate dimensions are chosen.

studied with a relativistic Hamiltonian, including a relativistic
one-pion-exchange potential (OPEP) with off-shell terms as predicted by
pseudovector coupling of pions to nucleons. The bound and scattering states are
obtained in the center-of-mass frame, and then boosted from it to the Breit
frame, where the evaluation of the relevant matrix elements of the
electromagnetic current operator is carried out. The latter includes, in
addition to one-body, also two-body terms due to pion exchange, as obtained,
consistently with the OPEP, in pseudovector pion-nucleon coupling theory. The
full Lorentz structure of these currents is retained. In order to estimate the
magnitude of the relativistic effects we perform, for comparison, the
calculation with a non-relativistic phase-equivalent Hamiltonian and the
standard non-relativistic expressions for the one-body and two-body
pion-exchange currents. Our results for the electrodisintegration cross section
show that, in the calculations using one-body currents, relativistic
corrections become significant ({\it i.e.}, larger than 10%) only at high
momentum transfer $Q$ ($Q^2 \simeq 40$fm$^{-2}$ and beyond). However, the
inclusion of two-body currents makes the relativistic predictions considerably
smaller than the corresponding non-relativistic results in the $Q^2$ region

confirm the inadequacy, already established in a non-relativistic context, of
the present electromagnetic current model to reproduce accurately the

missing energy, and either $b$-tagged jets, opposite-sign isolated electron or
muon pairs, or top quarks reconstructed exploiting their fully hadronic decays.
With only 1 ${fb}^{-1}$ of data each of these signatures may allow to observe
an excess of events over Standard Model expectation with a statistical
significance exceeding 5 standard deviations. An analytical expression was
derived for the shape of the distribution of the dilepton invariant mass
arising from the three-body leptonic decay of the neutralinos under the
hypothesis of heavy scalars, which is appropriate for the focus-point scenario.
The resulting function was used to fit the distribution of the dilepton

two kinematic endpoints measuring the $\tilde \chi^0_2 - \tilde \chi^0_1$ and
the $\tilde \chi^0_3 - \tilde \chi^0_1$ mass differences. This information was

of all ages and are likely to originate from different progenitors to the long
duration bursts. However, it has become clear that duration alone is
insufficient to make a distinction between the two populations in many cases,
leading to a desire to find additional discriminators of burst type. GRB
060912A had a duration of 6 s and occurred only ~10 arcsec from a bright, low

that GRB 060912A more likely originates in a distant star forming galaxy at

identifying bright, nearby galaxies as the hosts of given GRBs without further
supporting evidence. Further, it implies that, in the absence of secure
identifications, ""host"" type, or more broadly discriminators which rely on
galaxy redshifts, may not be good indicators of the true nature of any given

quantum physics has shattered some of our cornerstone beliefs. According to
Bell's theorem, any theory that is based on the joint assumption of realism and
locality (meaning that local events cannot be affected by actions in space-like
separated regions) is at variance with certain quantum predictions. Experiments
with entangled pairs of particles have amply confirmed these quantum
predictions, thus rendering local realistic theories untenable. Maintaining
realism as a fundamental concept would therefore necessitate the introduction
of 'spooky' actions that defy locality. Here we show by both theory and
experiment that a broad and rather reasonable class of such non-local realistic
theories is incompatible with experimentally observable quantum correlations.
In the experiment, we measure previously untested correlations between two
entangled photons, and show that these correlations violate an inequality

giving up the concept of locality is not sufficient to be consistent with

evidence of the presence of a 100 nm long liquid condensate at the crack tip in

These observations are based on in-situ AFM phase imaging techniques applied on
DCDC glass specimens in controlled atmosphere. Here, we discuss the physical
origin of the AFM phase contrast between the liquid condensate and the glass
surface in relation to tip-sample adhesion induced by capillary bridges. We

  Testing Standard and New Results","Submitted to ApJ","Astrophys.J.665:1254-1267,2007","10.1086/519767",,"astro-ph",,"  Recent three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamics simulations of
protoplanetary disks report disparate disk behaviors, and these differences
involve the importance of convection to disk cooling, the dependence of disk
cooling on metallicity, and the stability of disks against fragmentation and
clump formation. To guarantee trustworthy results, a radiative physics
algorithm must demonstrate the capability to handle both the high and low
optical depth regimes. We develop a test suite that can be used to demonstrate
an algorithm's ability to relax to known analytic flux and temperature
distributions, to follow a contracting slab, and to inhibit or permit
convection appropriately. We then show that the radiative algorithm employed by
Meji\'a (2004) and Boley et al. (2006) and the algorithm employed by Cai et al.
(2006) and Cai et al. (2007, in prep.) pass these tests with reasonable
accuracy. In addition, we discuss a new algorithm that couples flux-limited
diffusion with vertical rays, we apply the test suite, and we discuss the
results of evolving the Boley et al. (2006) disk with this new routine.
Although the outcome is significantly different in detail with the new
algorithm, we obtain the same qualitative answers. Our disk does not cool fast
due to convection, and it is stable to fragmentation. We find an effective
$\alpha\approx 10^{-2}$. In addition, transport is dominated by low-order
modes.

  Networks, Singapore: World Scientific (2007)",,,,"nlin.AO physics.bio-ph q-bio.QM",,"  Is it possible to link a set of nodes without using preexisting positional

and the estabishment of chemical gradients, \emph{and} the process of network
formation, i.e. the establishment of links between nodes, occur in parallel, on
a comparable time scale, as a process of co-evolution?
  The paper discusses a model where the generation of relevant information for
establishing the links between nodes results from the interaction of many
\emph{agents}, i.e. subunits of the system that are capable of performing some
activities. Their collective interaction is based on (indirect) communication,
which also includes memory effects and the dissemination of information in the
system. The relevant (``pragmatic'') information that leads to the
establishment of the links then emerges from an evolutionary interplay of
selection and reamplification.

We compare results obtained using different physical models for the

cluster profiles and scaling relations. We also produce realistic mock
observations to verify whether the results from hydrodynamic simulations can be
confirmed. We find that SZ profiles depend marginally on the modelled physical
processes, while they exhibit a strong dependence on cluster mass. The central
and total SZ emission strongly correlate with the cluster X-ray luminosity and
temperature. The logarithmic slopes of these scaling relations differ from the
self-similar predictions by less than 0.2; the normalization of the relations
is lower for simulations including radiative cooling. The observational test
suggests that SZ cluster profiles are unlikely to be able to probe the ICM
physics. The total SZ decrement appears to be an observable much more robust
than the central intensity, and we suggest using the former to investigate
scaling relations.

rate and velocity. The differences between this wind model and previous

is revealed through the presence of both forward and reverse shocks, with a
separating contact discontinuity. The effects of radiative cooling are
investigated and key outburst parameters such as mass-loss rate, ejecta
velocity and mass are varied. The shock velocities as a function of time are
compared to the ones derived in Paper I. We show how the manner in which the

describes in the large N limit the microscopic structure in the bulk, which
arises when considering the disconnection time of a discrete cylinder with base
a d-1-dimensional discrete torus of side-length N, or the set of points visited
by simple random walk on the d-dimensional discrete torus of side-length N by
times of order uN^d. We study the percolative properties of the vacant set left
by the interlacement at level u, which is an infinite, connected, translation
invariant random subset of Z^d. We introduce a critical value such that the
vacant set percolates for u below the critical value, and does not percolate
for u above the critical value. Our main results show that the critical value
is finite when d is bigger or equal to 3, and strictly positive when d is
bigger or equal to 7.

of standard PDE hypotheses, we consider the Weyl M-function of extensions of
the operators. The extensions are determined by abstract boundary conditions
and we establish results on the relationship between the M-function as an
analytic function of a spectral parameter and the spectrum of the extension. We
also give an example where the M-function does not contain the whole spectral
information of the resolvent, and show that the results can be applied to
elliptic PDEs where the M-function corresponds to the Dirichlet to Neumann map.
