  Planck Satellite","25 pages, 16 figures, revtex",,,,"astro-ph hep-ph",,"  In several classes of particle physics models -- ranging from the classical
Majoron models, to the more recent scenarios of late neutrino masses or
Mass-Varying Neutrinos -- one or more of the neutrinos are postulated to couple
to a new light scalar field. As a result of this coupling, neutrinos in the
early universe instead of streaming freely could form a self-coupled fluid,
with potentially observable signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background and
the large scale structure of the universe. We re-examine the constraints on
this scenario from the presently available cosmological data and investigate
the sensitivity expected from the Planck satellite. In the first case, we find
that the sensitivity strongly depends on which piece of data is used. The SDSS
Main sample data, combined with WMAP and other data, disfavors the scenario of
three coupled neutrinos at about the 3.5$\sigma$ confidence level, but also
favors a high number of freely streaming neutrinos, with the best fit at 5.2.
If the matter power spectrum is instead taken from the SDSS Large Red Galaxy
sample, best fit point has 2.5 freely streaming neutrinos, but the scenario
with three coupled neutrinos becomes allowed at $2\sigma$. In contrast, Planck
alone will exclude even a single self-coupled neutrino at the $4.2\sigma$
confidence level, and will determine the total radiation at CMB epoch to
$\Delta N_\nu^{eff} = ^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$ ($1\sigma$ errors). We investigate the
robustness of this result with respect to the details of Planck's detector.
This sensitivity to neutrino free-streaming implies that Planck will be capable
of probing a large region of the Mass-Varying Neutrino parameter space. Planck
may also be sensitive to a scale of neutrino mass generation as high as 1 TeV.

black hole. This information is encoded in perturbations of the field
propagating in non-trivial scalar field backgrounds, which serve as a ""new
ether"". Although the action of the theory is manifestly Lorentz-invariant the
non-trivial solutions break this symmetry spontaneously, allowing, the
superluminal propagation of perturbations with respect to this ""new ether"". We
found the stationary solution for background, which describes the accretion of
the scalar field onto a black hole. Examining the propagation of small
perturbations around this solution we show that the signals emitted inside the
Schwarzschild horizon can reach an observer located outside the black hole.
Thus the accreting field forms a hydrodynamical analog of a black hole whose
horizon is inside of the gravitational black hole drawing in the scalar field.

regulatory input variables into a random Boolean network. We compute both
analytically and numerically the time evolution and the asymptotic behavior of
this propagation of external regulation (PER). In particular, this allows us to
identify variables which are completely determined by this external

PER form a core which contains in particular all non-trivial feedback loops. We
design a message-passing approach allowing to characterize the statistical
properties of these cores in dependence of the Boolean network and the external

the ionospheric plasma inhomogeneity whose length scale is of the order 10--100

controlled ionospheric modification experiments where the energy is provided by
an HF radio beam injected into the overhead ionospheric plasma. The ensuing
turbulence can be studied with radars and in the form of secondary radiation
recorded by ground-based receivers. We have analyzed spectral signatures of the
turbulence for different sets of parameters and different altitudes relative to
the turning point of the linear Langmuir mode where the Langmuir frequency
equals the local plasma frequency. By a parametric analysis, we have derived a
simple scaling law, which links the spectral width of the turbulent frequency
spectrum to the physical parameters in the ionosphere. The scaling law provides
a quantitative relation between the physical parameters (temperatures, electron
number density, ionospheric length scale, etc.) and the observed frequency
spectrum. This law may be useful for interpreting experimental results.

the ultraviolet spectral region via harmonic generation, it offers the prospect
of greatly improved accuracy for UV and far-UV transitions. To take advantage
of this accuracy an ultracold helium sample is needed. For measurements of the
triplet spectrum a magneto-optical trap (MOT) can be used to cool and trap
metastable 2^3S state atoms. We analyze schemes for measuring the two-photon
$2^3S \to 4^3S$ interval, and for resonant two-photon excitation to high

the $1^1S \to 2^1S$ transition with extremely high accuracy by use of
two-photon excitation in a magic wavelength trap that operates identically for
both states. We predict a ``triple magic wavelength'' at 412 nm that could
facilitate numerous experiments on trapped helium atoms, because here the
polarizabilities of the 1^1S, 2^1S and 2^3S states are all similar, small, and
positive.

(R_K=L_radio/L_K) galaxies in the 10 Mpc Abell 3558 cluster complex at the core
of the SSC (SSC-CR) is half as large than elsewhere. In the SSC-CR, R_K is
anti-correlated with the density of the large-scale environment and correlated
with R/r200: central brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the SSC-CR are 10x
less radio-loud than BCGs elsewhere, with signs of suppressed radio loudness in
the SSC-CR also present beyond the BCGs, out to at least 0.3 r200. This

(K-luminosity segregation), inside the SSC-CR. The suppression of radio
loudness in SSC-CR BCGs can be attributed to cluster-cluster mergers that
destroy the cool core and thus the supply of gas to the central AGN. We
analytically demonstrate that the low radio loudness of non-BCG galaxies within
SSC-CR clusters cannot be explained by direct major galaxy mergers or rapid
galaxy flyby collisions, but by the loss of gas supply through the enhanced ram
pressure felt when these galaxies cross the shock front between the 2 merging
clusters and are later subjected to the stronger wind from the 2nd cluster.

sensor networks for a class of linear observation models and a fixed SNR
regime. Sensing capacity is defined as the maximum number of signal dimensions
reliably identified per sensor observation. In this context sparsity of the
phenomena is a key feature that determines sensing capacity. Precluding the SNR
of the environment the effect of sparsity on the number of measurements
required for accurate reconstruction of a sparse phenomena has been widely
dealt with under compressed sensing. Nevertheless the development there was
motivated from an algorithmic perspective. In this paper our aim is to derive
these bounds in an information theoretic set-up and thus provide algorithm
independent conditions for reliable reconstruction of sparse signals. In this
direction we first generalize the Fano's inequality and provide lower bounds to
the probability of error in reconstruction subject to an arbitrary distortion
criteria. Using these lower bounds to the probability of error, we derive upper
bounds to sensing capacity and show that for fixed SNR regime sensing capacity
goes down to zero as sparsity goes down to zero. This means that
disproportionately more sensors are required to monitor very sparse events. Our
next main contribution is that we show the effect of sensing diversity on
sensing capacity, an effect that has not been considered before. Sensing
diversity is related to the effective \emph{coverage} of a sensor with respect
to the field. In this direction we show the following results (a) Sensing
capacity goes down as sensing diversity per sensor goes down; (b) Random
sampling (coverage) of the field by sensors is better than contiguous location
sampling (coverage).

asymmetry which suggests that tidal effects cannot be invoked to explain Leo

anisotropy. All in all, this galaxy exhibits dark matter properties which

its presence may be hidden by the change of its temperature and by the dilution
of a possible non-thermal power law component. We perform a time resolved
spectral analysis, and show that the sum of a power-law and a black-body gives
acceptable fits to the time dependent spectra within the BATSE energy range,
but overpredicts the flux in the WFC X-ray range. Moreover, a fit with a cutoff
power-law plus a black-body is consistent with the WFC data, but the black-body
component contributes a negligible fraction of the total flux. On the contrary,
we find that fitting the spectra with a Band model or a simple cutoff power-law
model yields an X-ray flux and spectral slope which well matches the WFC
spectra.

any dilute unpolarized system of attractive two-component fermions.
Operationally it can be viewed as a generalization of the Kohn-Sham equations
in density functional theory applied to N-body density correlations. While the
original Hamiltonian has an exact Z_2 symmetry, the heavy-light ansatz breaks
this symmetry by skewing the mass ratio of the two components. In the limit
where one component is infinitely heavy, the many-body problem can be solved in
terms of single-particle orbitals. The original Z_2 symmetry is recovered by
enforcing Z_2 symmetry as a constraint on N-body density correlations for the
two components. For the 1D, 2D, and 3D attractive Hubbard models the method is
in very good agreement with exact Lanczos calculations for few-body systems at
arbitrary coupling. For the 3D attractive Hubbard model there is very good
agreement with lattice Monte Carlo results for many-body systems in the limit
of infinite scattering length.

Provided we use two distinct prescriptions to embed luminous galaxies within

of their halos), we find a fair agreement between observation and theory.
Averaged over scales r_p \le 500 kpc, the satellites of red, high-mass hosts
with low star formation rates are found preferentially near the major axes of
their hosts. In contrast, the satellites of blue, low-mass hosts with low star
formation rates show little to no anisotropy when averaged over the same scale.
The difference between the locations of the satellites of red and blue hosts
cannot be explained by the effects of interlopers in the data. Instead, it is
caused primarily by marked differences in the dependence of the mean satellite
location, <\phi>, on the projected distance at which the satellites are found.
We also find that the locations of red, high-mass satellites with low star
formation rates show considerably more anisotropy than do the locations of
blue, low--mass satellites with high star formation rates. There are two
contributors to this result. First, the blue satellites have only recently
arrived within their hosts' halos, while the red satellites arrived in the far
distant past. Second, the sample of blue satellites is heavily contaminated by
interlopers, which suppresses the measured anisotropy compared to the intrinsic
anisotropy.

concentrated than typical cluster galaxies of this luminosity, although these
AGN have comparable velocity and substructure distributions to other cluster
members. In contrast, a larger sample of 30 cluster AGN with L_X > 10^41 erg/s
do not show evidence for greater concentration than inactive members, nor
evidence for a different kinematic or substructure distribution. As we do see
clear differences in the spatial and kinematic distributions of the blue

inactive galaxy population must be less distinct than that between these two

emission in this study to similarly-selected AGN in the field indicates that
the AGN fraction is not significantly lower in clusters, contrary to AGN
identified via visible-wavelength emission lines, but similar to the
approximately constant radio-selected AGN fraction in clusters and the field.
We also find significant evidence for variation between clusters and explore
the dependence of cluster AGN fraction on redshift, velocity dispersion,

based on the identification of a suitable matrix representation of the
multiplication operator associated with the corresponding orthogonality
measure. Two different alternatives are discussed, depending whether we use for
the matrix representation the standard basis of orthogonal rational functions,
or a new one with poles alternatively located in the exterior and the interior
of the unit circle. The corresponding representations are linear fractional
transformations with matrix coefficients acting respectively on Hessenberg and
five-diagonal unitary matrices.
  In consequence, the orthogonality measure can be recovered from the spectral
measure of an infinite unitary matrix depending uniquely on the poles and the
parameters of the recurrence relation for the orthogonal rational functions.
Besides, the zeros of the orthogonal and para-orthogonal rational functions are
identified as the eigenvalues of matrix linear fractional transformations of
finite Hessenberg and five-diagonal matrices.
  As an application of this operator approach, we obtain new relations between
the support of the orthogonality measure and the location of the poles and
parameters of the recurrence relation, generalizing to the rational case known
results for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle.

waves emitted into the solar interior from the site of the flare. Acoustic
egression power maps at 3 and 6 mHz with a 2 mHz bandpass reveal a compact
acoustic source strongly correlated with impulsive hard X-ray and
visible-continuum emission along the penumbral neutral line separating the two
major opposing umbrae in the $\delta$-configuration sunspot that predominates
AR10720. The acoustic emission signatures were directly aligned with both hard
X-ray and visible continuum emission that emanated during the flare. The
visible continuum emission is estimated at $2.0 \times 10^{23}$ J,
approximately 500 times the seismic emission of $\sim 4 \times 10^{20}$ J. The
flare of 2005 January 15 exhibits the same close spatial alignment between the
sources of the seismic emission and impulsive visible continuum emission as
previous flares, reinforcing the hypothesis that the acoustic emission may be
driven by heating of the low photosphere. However, it is a major exception in
that there was no signature to indicate the inclusion of protons in the
particle beams thought to supply the energy radiated by the flare. The
continued strong coincidence between the sources of seismic emission and
impulsive visible continuum emission in the case of a proton-deficient
white-light flare lends substantial support to the ``back -- warming''
hypothesis, that the low photosphere is significantly heated by intense Balmer
and Paschen continuum-edge radiation from the overlying chromosphere in
white-light flares.

for relatively short vertical distances (z<2.5 kpc) show systematic
fluctuations with Galactic longitude, similar to those of the thick-disc
scaleheight, which may be interpreted as indicating a common origin, viz., the
flare effect of the disc. This suggestion is supported by the metallicity
variations which we find as functions of radial distance. The metallicity
variation at larger vertical distances (6.5<z<9.5 kpc) is small but monotonic.
Three different vertical metallicity gradients could be detected:
d[M/H]/dz=-0.22(+/-0.03), d[M/H]/dz=-0.38 (+/-0.06), and d[M/H]/dz=-0.08
(+/-0.07) dex/kpc for the intervals z<3, 3<z<5, and 5<z<10 kpc, respectively.
Since our data cover the whole Galactic longitude interval, the resulting
metallicity gradients can be interpreted as properties of the larger-scale
Galaxy. The first gradient confirms the dissipational formation of the disc at
short z-distances. The steeper gradient corresponds to the transition region
between different population components of the Galaxy, and finally, the lowest
value provides an adequate description of the inner-halo metallicity gradient.

use two spacecraft--a telescope and a specially shaped occulter that is
specifically designed to prevent all but a tiny fraction of the starlight from
diffracting into the telescope. As the cost and observing cadence for such a
mission will be driven largely by the separation between the two spacecraft, it
is critically important to design an occulter that can meet the observing goals
while flying as close to the telescope as possible. In this paper, we explore
this tradeoff between separation and occulter diameter. More specifically, we
present a method for designing the shape of the outer edge of an occulter that
is as small as possible and gives a shadow that is deep enough and large enough
for a 4m telescope to survey the habitable zones of many stars for Earth-like
planets. In particular, we show that in order for a 4m telescope to detect in
broadband visible light a planet 0.06 arcseconds from a star shining $10^{10}$
times brighter than the planet requires a specially-shaped occulter 50m in
diameter positioned about $72,000$ km in front of the telescope.

giant radio halos in the framework of the re-acceleration scenario in a
simplified, but physically motivated, form, namely: radio power (P_R) vs size
of the radio emitting region (R_H), and P_R vs total cluster mass (M_H)
contained in the emitting region and cluster velocity dispersion (sigma_H) in
this region.
  We search for these correlations by analyzing the most recent radio and X-ray
data available in the literature for a well known sample of clusters with giant
radio halos. In particular we find a good correlation between P_R and R_H and a
very tight ``geometrical'' scaling between M_H and R_H. From these correlations
P_R is also expected to scale with M_H and sigma_H and this is confirmed by our
analysis. We show that all the observed trends can be well reconciled with
expectations in the case of a slight variation of the mean magnetic field
strength in the radio halo volume with M_H. A byproduct correlation between R_H
and sigma_H is also found, and can be further tested by optical studies. In
addition, we find that observationally R_H scales non-linearly with the virial
radius of the host cluster, and this immediately means that the fraction of the
cluster volume which is radio emitting increases with cluster mass and thus
that the non-thermal component in clusters is not self-similar.

2004. The meteors, at about 100km altitude, and artificial satellites/debris in
orbit, at 500km altitude or higher, were clearly discriminated by their
apparent defocused image sizes. CCD photometry of the 13 meteors, including 1
Perseid, 1 Aquarid, and 11 sporadic meteors, was performed. We defined a peak
video-rate magnitude by comparing the integrated photon counts from the
brightest portion of the track traversed within 33ms to those from a 0-mag star
during the same time duration. This definition gives magnitudes in the range
4.0< V_{vr} <6.4 and 4.1< I_{vr}<5.9 for these 13 meteors. The corresponding
magnitude for virtual naked-eye observers could be somewhat fainter especially
for the V-band observation, in which the [OI] 5577 line lasting about 1 sec as
an afterglow could contribute to the integrated flux of the present 5-10 min
CCD exposures. Although the spatial resolution is insufficient to resolve the
source size of anything smaller than about 1 m, we developed a new estimate of
the collisionally excited column diameter of these meteors. A diameter as small
as a few mm was derived from their collisionally excited photon rates, meteor
speed, and the volume density of the oxygen atoms at the 100km altitude. The
actual column diameter of the radiating zone, however, could be as large as few
100m because the excited atoms travel that distance before they emit forbidden
lines in 0.7 sec of its average lifetime. Among the 44 artificial space

centrifugal or pressure support take place. Starting from the above evidence,
supermassive compact objects at the centre of large-mass galaxies are conceived
as the end-product of the gravitational collapse of local density maxima around
which overdensities are located. At the beginning of evolution, local density
maxima are idealized as homogeneous peaks, while the surrounding envelopes are
described by a power-law density profile. The dependence of the density profile
on a second parameter, chosen to be the ratio between peak and total mass, is
analysed. Overdensity evolution is discussed in the context of quintessence
cosmological models and further investigation is devoted to a special case with
the aim to describe the central collapse. An empirical relation between hole
and dark halo mass is translated into a dependence of the fractional hole mass
on the overdensity mass. Computations are performed up to the end of central
collapse, and density profiles of related configurations are determined
together with additional parameters. The central collapse is completed in early
times, no longer than a few hundredths of Gyr, which implies hole formation
when proto-haloes, proto-bulges, and proto-disks are still expanding or
contracting. No appreciable change in evolution is found with regard to
different mean peak heights related to equal masses. On the other hand, it is
recognized that homogeneous peaks collapse ``faster'' with respect to
surroundings envelopes, in low-mass than in large-mass overdensities. In
conclusion, it is inferred that gravitational collapse of homogeneous peaks
within overdensities may be a viable mechanism for hole generation.

the relative recombination probability g, and a new parameter called
quasi-stationary (QS) state parameter q*=qIg are used for the analysis of the
TSL and TSC. The TSL and TSC curves and the temperature dependences of qI, q*,
g, the recombination lifetime, and the occupancies of active traps and
recombination centers are numerically calculated for five sets of kinetic
parameters and different heating rates. These calculation results show that:
(1) the upper limit of the heating rate for presence of the QS state appears at
higher heating rate than that for the QE state when the retrapping process is
present, and (2) the TSL (TSC) curves in the QS state have the properties
similar to those for the TSL (TSC) curves in the QE state. Approximate formulas
for calculation of the parameters qI and q* in the initial range of the TSL and

defining configurable styles of change. It is a preliminary prototype that has
been designed to be open and fully extensible. Though originally designed for
the object-oriented model, it can also be used within the object-relational

be added too. To illustrate the capabilities of DOEF, we conducted two
different sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, we used DOEF to
compare the performances of four state of the art dynamic clustering
algorithms. The results show that DOEF is effective at determining the
adaptability of each dynamic clustering algorithm to changes in access pattern.
They also led us to conclude that dynamic clustering algorithms can cope with
moderate levels of access pattern change, but that performance rapidly degrades
to be worse than no clustering when vigorous styles of access pattern change
are applied. In the second set of experiments, we used DOEF to compare the
performance of two different object stores: Platypus and SHORE. The use of DOEF
exposed the poor swapping performance of Platypus.

by recent detections of the TeV gamma-ray sources in the directions of two open
clusters (Cyg OB2 and Westerlund 2) and their directional proximity to some
unidentified EGRET sources. In fact, up to now a few different scenarios for
acceleration of particles inside open clusters have been considered, i.e.
shocks in massive star winds, pulsars and their nebulae, supernova shocks,
massive compact binaries. Here we consider in detail the radiation processes
due to both electrons and hadrons accelerated inside the open cluster. As a
specific scenario, we apply the acceleration process at the shocks arising in
the winds of WR type stars. Particles diffuse through the medium of the open
cluster during the activity time of the acceleration scenario defined by the
age of the WR star. They interact with the matter and radiation, at first
inside the open cluster and, later in the dense surrounding clouds. We
calculate the broad band spectrum in different processes for three example open
clusters (Berk 87, Cyg OB2, Westerlund 2) for which the best observational
constraints on the spectra are at present available. It is assumed that the
high energy phenomena, observed from the X-ray up to the GeV-TeV gamma-ray
energies, are related to each other. We conclude that the most likely
description of the radiation processes in these objects is achieved in the
hybrid (leptonic-hadronic) model in which leptons are responsible for the
observed X-ray and GeV gamma-ray emission and hadrons are responsible for the
TeV gamma-ray emission, which is produced directly inside and in dense clouds
surrounding the open cluster.

viable region in parameter space for $\tan\beta \ler ~35$. The $\tilde{\tau}$

However, this process is significantly constrained by the limited range in
which the stau is lighter than the neutralino. In fact, for a given $\tan\beta$
we find that there exists an upper bound on the lightest neutralino mass
($M_{\chi_1^0}$) in this region. The A-pole funnel region appears at very large
$\tan\beta \simeq 45-50$, while the focus-point region does not make an
appearance till large ($m_0,M_{1/2}$), namely a few TeV. Large $A_0$ terms at
high scale can lead to extended regions consistent with WMAP constraints and
remove the upper bounds in the stau coannihilation regions.

for close enough atoms and can be interpreted as a coherent mesoscopic effect.
We consider a model of multiple scattering of a photon among superradiant pairs

the case of a scalar wave which allows to obtain and to understand basic
features of cooperative effects and multiple scattering. We then turn to the

superconducting properties and crystal structure of MgB2 single crystals has
been investigated. It has been found that hole doping with Li decreases the
superconducting transition temperature Tc, but at a slower rate than electron
doping with C or Al. Tc of MgB2 crystals with simultaneously substituted Li for
Mg and C for B decreases more than in the case where C is substituted alone.
This means that holes introduced by Li cannot counterbalance the effect of
decrease of Tc caused by introduction of electrons coming from C. The possible
reason of it can be that holes coming from Li occupy the pi band while
electrons coming from C fill the sigma band. The temperature dependences of the
upper critical field Hc2 for Al and Li substituted crystals with the same Tc
show a similar dHc2/dT slope at Tc and a similar Hc2(T) behavior, despite of
much different substitution level. This indicates that the mechanism
controlling Hc2 and Tc is similar in both hole and electron doped crystals.
Electrical transport measurements show an increase of resistivity both in Li
substituted crystals and in Li and C co-substituted crystals. This indicates
enhanced scattering due to defects introduced by substitutions including
distortion of the lattice. The observed behavior can be explained as a result
of two effects, influencing both Tc and Hc2. The first one is doping related to
the changes in the carrier concentration, which may lead to the decrease or to
the increase of Tc. The second one is related to the introduction of new
scattering centers leading to the modification of the interband and/or
intraband scattering and therefore, to changes in the superconducting gaps and
to the reduction of Tc.

telescopes respectively. The observations were made from 18th October to 9th
December 2004 and 27th October 2005 to 1st January 2006. Detailed analysis of
the TACTIC data indicates absence of a statistically significant gamma-ray
signal both in overall data and on a nightly basis from the source direction.
We estimate an upper limit of I($\geq$1.5 TeV)$\leq 3.84 \times 10^{-12}$
photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at a 3$\sigma$ confidence level on the integrated
$\gamma$-ray flux. In addition, we have also compared TACTIC TeV light curves
with those of the RXTE ASM (2-12keV) for the contemporary period and find that
there are no statistically significant increases in the signal strengths from
the source in both these energy regions. During 2004 IR observations,
1ES2344+514 shows low level (~0.06 magnitude) day-to-day variation in both, J &
H bands. However, during 2005 observation epoch, the source brightens up by
about 0.41 magnitude from its October 2005 level J magnitude= 12.64 to J =
12.23 on December 6, 2005. It then fades by about 0.2 magnitude during 6 to 10
December, 2005. The variation is seen in both, J & H, bands simultaneously. The
light travel time arguments suggest that the emission region size is of the
order of $10^{17}$ cms.

mathematical problem of random walks with barriers. The statistics of a single
random walk can be used to calculate one-point distributions ranging from the
mass function of virialized halos to the distribution of ionized bubble sizes
during reionization. However, an analytical calculation of two-point
correlation functions or of spatially-dependent feedback processes requires the
joint statistics of random walks at two different points. An accurate
analytical expression for the statistics of two correlated random walks has
been previously found only for the case of a constant barrier height. However,
calculating bubble sizes or accurate statistics for halo formation involves
more general barriers that can often be approximated as linear barriers. We
generalize the two-point solution with constant barriers to linear barriers,
and apply it as an illustration to calculate the correlation function of
cosmological 21-cm fluctuations during reionization.

Some $k_t$-factorization subprocesses are included for the first time in the
literature. Different unintegrated gluon/parton distributions are used in the
$k_t$-factorization approach. The results depend on UGDF/UPDF used. For
collinear NLO case the situation depends significantly on whether we consider
correlations of any two jets or correlations of leading jets only. In the first
case the $2 \to 2$ contributions associated with soft radiations summed up in
the $k_t$-factorization approach dominate at $\phi \sim \pi$ and at equal
moduli of jet transverse momenta. The collinear NLO $2 \to 3$ contributions
dominate over $k_t$-factorization cross section at small relative azimuthal
angles as well as for asymmetric transverse momentum configurations. In the
second case the NLO contributions vanish at small relative azimuthal angles
and/or large jet transverse-momentum disbalance due to simple kinematical
constraints. There are no such limitations for the $k_t$-factorization
approach. All this makes the two approaches rather complementary. The role of
several cuts is discussed and quantified.

minihalos and that of the intergalactic medium at high redshift, pertinent to
cosmological reionization, with the initial expectation that gas in the high
density regions within formed dark matter halos may be more robust thus
resistant to mixing with lower density intergalactic medium. Using detailed
hydrodynamic simulations of gas clouds in minihalos subject to destructive
processes associated with the encompassing intergalactic shocks carrying
metal-enriched gas, we find, as an example, that, for realistic shocks of
velocities of 10-100km/s, more than (90%,65%) of the high density gas with
rho>500 rhob inside a minihalo virialized at z=10 of mass (10^7,10^6)Msun
remains at a metallicity lower than 3% of that of the intergalactic medium by
redshift z=6. It may be expected that the high density gas in minihalos becomes
fuel for subsequent star formation, when they are incorporated into larger
halos where efficient atomic cooling can induce gas condensation hence star
formation. Since minihalos virialize at high redshift when the universe is not
expected to have been significantly reionized, the implication is that gas in
virialized minihalos may provide an abundant reservoir of primordial gas to
possibly allow for the formation of Population-III metal-free stars to extend
to much lower redshift than otherwise expected based on the enrichment of
intergalactic medium.

fabrication technology in many industrial processes. In particular, for
micro-systems, it allows the production of devices with feature sizes down to
few tens of microns. An important parameter of this process is the surface
roughness of post-blasted surfaces. In this work the scaling properties of
Pyrex glass and silicon surfaces after bombardment with alumina particles is
investigated. The targets were bombarded at normal incidence using alumina
particles with two different average sizes, $29\mu m$ and $9\mu m$,
respectively. This investigation indicates that the resulting surfaces have
multifractal properties. Applying multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis
(MFDFA) allowed us to determine the singularity spectrum of the surfaces. This
spectrum did not depend on the target material or on the size of the particles.
Several parameters quantifying relevant quantities were determined. We argue
that for scales below $5 \mu m$, fracture processes are dominant while at large
scales long range correlations are responsible for the multifractal behaviour.

shown that adjacency of the monomers, the excluded volume effect incorporated

persistence length, affect particle diffusion. It is demonstrated how the
introduction of the effective chain occupancy, which is a convolution of the
geometric chain volume with the walker size, eliminates the conformational

above 50 GeV with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes are cosmic-ray
events. The images of most of the cosmic ray showers look significantly
different from those of gamma-rays and are therefore easily discriminated.
However, a small fraction of events seems to be indistinguishable from
gamma-rays. This constitutes an irreducible background to the observation of
high-energy gamma-ray sources, and limits the sensitivity achievable with a
given instrument. Here, a Monte Carlo study of gamma-like cosmic-ray events is
presented. The nature of gamma-like cosmic-ray events, the shower particles
that are responsible for the gamma-like appearance, and the dependence of these
results on the choice of the hadronic interaction model are investigated. Most
of the gamma-like cosmic ray events are characterised by the production of
high-energy pi0's early in the shower development which dump most of the shower
energy into electromagnetic sub-showers. Also Cherenkov light from single muons
can mimic gamma-rays in close-by pairs of telescopes. Differences of up to 25%
in the collection area for gamma-like proton showers between QGSJet/FLUKA and

modulation at an observing wavelength (when achievable) of both 21 and 92 cm
using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. In this paper we present the
92-cm data and a comparison is made with the already published 21-cm results.
We analysed 191 pulsars at 92 cm using fluctuation spectra. The sample of
pulsars is as unbiased as possible towards any particular pulsar
characteristics. For 15 pulsars drifting subpulses are discovered for the first
time and 26 of the new drifters found in the 21-cm data are confirmed. We
discovered nulling for 8 sources and 8 pulsars are found to intermittently emit
single pulses that have pulse energies similar to giant pulses. It is estimated
that at least half of the total population of pulsars have drifting subpulses
when observations with a high enough signal-to-noise ratio would be available.
It could well be that the drifting subpulse mechanism is an intrinsic property
of the emission mechanism itself, although for some pulsars it is difficult or
impossible to detect. Drifting subpulses are in general found at both
frequencies, although the chance of detecting drifting subpulses is possibly
slightly higher at 92 cm. It appears that the youngest pulsars have the most
disordered subpulses and the subpulses become more and more organized into
drifting subpulses as the pulsar ages. The correlations with the modulation
indices are argued to be consistent with the picture in which the radio
emission can be divided in a drifting subpulse signal plus a quasi-steady
signal which becomes, on average, stronger at high observing frequencies. The
measured values of P3 at the two frequencies are highly correlated, but there
is no evidence for a correlation with other pulsar parameters.
