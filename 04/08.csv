spin-1/2 chain focusing on the long-length and ground-state behavior of the
average time-independent spin-spin correlation function C(l)=\upsilon
l^{-\eta}. In addition to the well-known universal (disorder-independent)
power-law exponent \eta=2, we find interesting universal features displayed by
the prefactor \upsilon=\upsilon_o/3, if l is odd, and \upsilon=\upsilon_e/3,
otherwise. Although \upsilon_o and \upsilon_e are nonuniversal (disorder
dependent) and distinct in magnitude, the combination \upsilon_o + \upsilon_e =
-1/4 is universal if C is computed along the symmetric (longitudinal) axis. The
origin of the nonuniversalities of the prefactors is discussed in the
renormalization-group framework where a solvable toy model is considered.
Moreover, we relate the average correlation function with the average
entanglement entropy, whose amplitude has been recently shown to be universal.
The nonuniversalities of the prefactors are shown to contribute only to surface
terms of the entropy. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our
results by computing the structure factor whose scaling properties,
interestingly, depend on the correlation prefactors.

YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ is dominated by a sharp resonance peak at the frequency 40
meV in the superconducting state. Below and above the resonance frequency, the
incommensurate (IC) peaks develop and the intensity of the peaks decreases
dramatically. In the normal state, the resonant excitation does not occur and
the IC peaks are merged into commensurate ones. The spin excitation of
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ is significantly different from that of Y-based ones,
namely, the resonance peak does not exist due to the decreasing of the
superconducting gap and the presence of the possible spin-stripe order. The
spectra are only enhanced at the expected resonance frequency (about 18 meV)
while it is still incommensurate. On the other hand, another frequency scale at
the frequency 55 meV is also revealed, namely the spectra are commensurate and
local maximum at this frequency. We elaborate all the results based on the
Fermi surface topology and the d-wave superconductivity, and suggest that the
spin-stripe order be also important in determining the spin excitation of

range of dielectric constants from 1.0 to 37 by immersing SWNTs bridged over
trenches in various organic solvents by means of photoluminescence and the
excitation spectroscopies. With increasing environmental dielectric constant
($\epsilon_{\rm env}$), both $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ exhibited a redshift by
several tens meV and a tendency to saturate at a $\epsilon_{\rm env} \sim 5$
without an indication of significant ($n$,$m$) dependence. The redshifts can be
explained by dielectric screening of the repulsive electron-electron
interaction. The $\epsilon_{\rm env}$ dependence of $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ can
be expressed by a simple empirical equation with a power law in $\epsilon_{\rm
env}$, $E_{\rm ii} = E_{\rm ii}^{\infty} + A\epsilon_{\rm env}^{-\alpha}$. We
also immersed a sample in sodium-dodecyl-sulfate (SDS) solution to investigate
the effects of wrapping SWNTs with surfactant. The resultant $E_{11}$ and
$E_{22}$, which agree well with Weisman's data [Nano Lett. {\bf 3}, 1235
(2003)], are close to those of $\epsilon_{\rm env}$ of 2. However, in addition
to the shift due to dielectric screening, another shift was observed so that
the ($2n+m$)-family patterns spread more widely, similar to that of the
uniaxial-stress-induced shift.

partial monitoring. Given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights
can change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in
each round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the
loss of the chosen path (defined as the sum of the weights of its composing
edges) be as small as possible. In a setting generalizing the multi-armed
bandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the
weights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an
algorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of
the best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by
a quantity that is proportional to 1/\sqrt{n} and depends only polynomially on
the number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linear
complexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extension
to the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision
maker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen
path at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where the
decision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the
problem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit
setting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns
only the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual
edges on the path. Applications to routing in packet switched networks along
with simulation results are also presented.

properties of $WO_3$ surface using atomic force microscopy techniques (AFM). We
have applied both level crossing and structure function methods. Level crossing
analysis indicates an optimum annealing temperature of around 400$^oC$ at which
the effective area of the $WO_3$ thin film is maximum, whereas composition of
the surface remains stoichiometric. The complexity of the height fluctuation of
surfaces was characterized by roughness, roughness exponent and lateral size of
surface features. We have found that there is a phase transition at around
400$^oC$ from one set to two sets of roughness parameters. This happens due to
microstructural changes from amorphous to crystalline structure in the samples
that has been already found experimentally.
