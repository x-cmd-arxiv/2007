(T), and uracil (U) with graphene, carried out within the density functional
theory framework, with additional calculations utilizing Hartree--Fock plus
second-order Moeller-Plesset perturbation theory. The calculated binding energy
of the nucleobases shows the following hierarchy: G > T ~ C ~ A > U, with the
equilibrium configuration being very similar for all five of them. Our results
clearly demonstrate that the nucleobases exhibit significantly different
interaction strengths when physisorbed on graphene. The stabilizing factor in
the interaction between the base molecule and graphene sheet is dominated by
the molecular polarizability that allows a weakly attractive dispersion force
to be induced between them. The present study represents a significant step
towards a first-principles understanding of how the base sequence of DNA can
affect its interaction with carbon nanotubes, as observed experimentally.

anisotropic nearest-neighbour exchange couplings on the kagome net, i.e. with
coupling J in one lattice direction and couplings J' along the other two
directions. For J/J' > 1, this model is believed to describe the magnetic
properties of the mineral volborthite. In the classical limit, it exhibits two
kinds of ground states: a ferrimagnetic state for J/J' < 1/2 and a large
manifold of canted spin states for J/J' > 1/2. To include quantum effects
self-consistently, we investigate the Sp(N) symmetric generalisation of the
original SU(2) symmetric model in the large-N limit. In addition to the
dependence on the anisotropy, the Sp(N) symmetric model depends on a parameter
kappa that measures the importance of quantum effects. Our numerical
calculations reveal that in the kappa-J/J' plane, the system shows a rich phase
diagram containing a ferrimagnetic phase, an incommensurate phase, and a
decoupled chain phase, the latter two with short- and long-range order. We
corroborate these results by showing that the boundaries between the various
phases and several other features of the Sp(N) phase diagram can be determined
by analytical calculations. Finally, the application of a block-spin
perturbation expansion to the trimerised version of the original spin-1/2 model
leads us to suggest that in the limit of strong anisotropy, J/J' >> 1, the
ground state of the original model is a collinearly ordered antiferromagnet,
which is separated from the incommensurate state by a quantum phase transition.

used in Fan and Li (2001, 2002, 2004) which are reminiscent of the well-known
pitfalls related to Hodges' estimator. The oracle property is often a
consequence of sparsity of an estimator. We show that any estimator satisfying
a sparsity property has maximal risk that converges to the supremum of the loss
function; in particular, the maximal risk diverges to infinity whenever the
loss function is unbounded. For ease of presentation the result is set in the
framework of a linear regression model, but generalizes far beyond that
setting. In a Monte Carlo study we also assess the extent of the problem in
finite samples for the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) estimator
introduced in Fan and Li (2001). We find that this estimator can perform rather
poorly in finite samples and that its worst-case performance relative to
maximum likelihood deteriorates with increasing sample size when the estimator
is tuned to sparsity.

walls, capillary columnar ordering occurs via a first-order phase transition.
For higher chemical potentials the system exhibits layering transitions even
for very narrow slits (near the one-dimensional limit). The theoretical model
used was a density-functional theory based on the Fundamental-Measure
Functional applied to a fluid of hard rectangles in the restricted-orientation

experimentally in two-dimensional granular media made of rods, where vertical
motions induced by an external source and excluded volume interactions between

entropically maximize packing configurations. We claim that some of the surface

chiral logarithms, which come from loops with virtual decuplet-like states, as
well as terms the order of the cubed pion mass, which come from loops with
virtual octet-like states. Taste violations enter through the meson propagators
in loops and tree-level terms the order of the squared lattice spacing. The

results obtained from the study of Ap and Bp stars with accurate measurements
of the mean magnetic field modulus and mean quadratic magnetic fields that
magnetic stars of mass M < 3 M_sun are concentrated towards the centre of the
main-sequence band. In contrast, stars with masses M > 3 M_sun seem to be
concentrated closer to the ZAMS. The study of a few known members of nearby
open clusters with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes confirms these conclusions.
Stronger magnetic fields tend to be found in hotter, younger and more massive
stars, as well as in stars with shorter rotation periods. No evidence is found
for any loss of angular momentum during the main-sequence life. The magnetic
flux remains constant over the stellar life time on the main sequence. An
excess of stars with large obliquities beta is detected in both higher and
lower mass stars. The obliquity angle distribution as inferred from the
distribution of r-values appears random at the time magnetic stars become
observable on the H-R diagram. After quite a short time spent on the main
sequence, the obliquity angle beta tends to reach values close to either 90 deg
or 0 deg for M < 3 M_sun. The evolution of the obliquity angle beta seems to be
somewhat different for low and high mass stars. While we find a strong hint for
an increase of beta with the elapsed time on the main sequence for stars with M
> 3 M_sun, no similar trend is found for stars with M < 3 M_sun. However, the
predominance of high values of beta at advanced ages in these stars is notable.

describe the category of representations of the quantum group U_q(sl_n)
(thought of as a spherical category) via generators and relations?""
  For each n \geq 0, I define a certain tensor category of trivalent graphs,
modulo isotopy, and construct a functor from this category onto (a full
subcategory of) the category of representations of the quantum group U_q(sl_n).
One would like to describe completely the kernel of this functor, by providing
generators. The resulting quotient of the diagrammatic category would then be a
category equivalent to the representation category of U_q(sl_n).
  I make significant progress towards this, describing certain generators of
the kernel, and some obstructions to further elements. It remains a conjecture
that these relations generate the kernel. My results extend those of
q-alg/9712003, MR1659228, math.QA/0310143 and math.GT/0506403.
  The argument is essentially by constructing a diagrammatic version of the
forgetful functor coming from the inclusion of U_q(sl_{n-1}) in U_q(sl_n}. We
know this functor is faithful, so a diagram is in the kernel for n exactly if
its image under the diagrammatic forgetful functor is in the kernel for n-1.
This allows us to perform inductive calculations, both establishing families of
elements of the kernel, and finding obstructions.

pc away from the sun, taken in the F435W, F606W, and F814W bands. Scattered
light is detected up to 14'' from the star. The observations are consistent
with the presence of an extended flattened nebula with the same inclination as
the inner disk. The well-known ``spiral arms'' are clearly observed and they
trail the rotating disk material. Weaker arms never before reported are also
seen. The inter-arm space becomes brighter, but the structures become more
neutral in color at longer wavelengths, which is not consistent with models
that assume that they are due to the effects of a warped disk. Along the major
disk axis, the colors of the scattered-light relative to the star are \Delta
(F435W-F606W) ~ 0.0--0.2 mags and \Delta (F435W-F814W)~0.5--1 mags. To explain
these colors, we explore the role of asymmetric scattering, reddening, and
large minimum sizes on ISM-like grains. We conclude each of these hypotheses by
itself cannot explain the colors. The disk colors are similar to those derived
for Kuiper Belt objects, suggesting that the same processes responsible for
their colors may be at work here. We argue that we are observing only the
geometrically thick, optically thin envelope of the disk, while the optically
thick disk responsible for the far-IR emission is undetected. The observed
spiral arms are then structures on this envelope. The colors indicate that the
extended nebulosity is not a remnant of the infalling envelope but reprocessed

more realistic viscosity and sound-speed prescriptions than previous work to

mode in the generation of superhumps. Differential motions in the fluid disc
cause converging flows which lead to strong spiral shocks once each superhump
cycle. The dissipation associated with these shocks powers the superhump. We
compare 2D and 3D results, and conclude that 3D simulations are necessary to
faithfully simulate the disc dynamics. We ran our simulations for unprecedented
durations, so that an eccentric equilibrium is established except at high mass
ratios where the growth rate of the instability is very low. Our improved
simulations give a closer match to the observed relationship between superhump
period excess and binary mass ratio than previous numerical work. The observed
black hole X-ray transient superhumpers appear to have systematically lower
disc precession rates than the cataclysmic variables. This could be due to
higher disc temperatures and thicknesses. The modulation in total viscous
dissipation on the superhump period is overwhelmingly from the region of the
disc within the 3:1 resonance radius. As the eccentric instability develops,
the viscous torques are enhanced, and the disc consequently adjusts to a new
equilibrium state, as suggested in the thermal-tidal instability model. We
quantify this enhancement in the viscosity, which is ~10 per cent for q=0.08.
We characterise the eccentricity distributions in our accretion discs, and show
that the entire body of the disc partakes in the eccentricity.

non-gravitational processes such as radiative cooling, photoionization/heating,

thermalization and CR acceleration efficiencies based on nonlinear diffusive
shock acceleration calculations, we then estimate the gas thermal energy and
the CR energy dissipated at shocks through the history of the universe. Since
shocks can serve as sites for generation of vorticity, we also examine the
vorticity that should have been generated mostly at curved shocks in
cosmological simulations. We find that the dynamics and energetics of shocks
are governed primarily by the gravity of matter, so other non-gravitational

vorticity generation at cosmological shocks. Our results reinforce scenarios in

two fundamental quantum phenomena in solids: in three dimensions it can turn a
metal into a superconductor whereas in one dimension it can turn a metal into
an insulator. In two dimensions (2D) both superconductivity and charge-density
waves (CDW) are believed to be anomalous. In superconducting cuprates, critical
transition temperatures are unusually high and the energy gap may stay unclosed
even above these temperatures (pseudogap). In CDW-bearing dichalcogenides the
resistivity below the transition can decrease with temperature even faster than
in the normal phase and a basic prerequisite for the CDW, the favourable
nesting conditions (when some sections of the Fermi surface appear shifted by
the same vector), seems to be absent. Notwithstanding the existence of
alternatives to conventional theories, both phenomena in 2D still remain the
most fascinating puzzles in condensed matter physics. Using the latest
developments in high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) here we show that the normal-state pseudogap also exists in one of the
most studied 2D examples, dichalcogenide 2H-TaSe2, and the formation of CDW is
driven by a conventional nesting instability, which is masked by the pseudogap.
Our findings reconcile and explain a number of unusual, as previously believed,
experimental responses as well as disprove many alternative theoretical
approaches. The magnitude, character and anisotropy of the 2D-CDW pseudogap are
intriguingly similar to those seen in superconducting cuprates.

  The silicate strength of all type-I AGNs also follows a positive correlation
with the black hole mass and with the accretion rate. The Polycyclic Aromatic

detected in the average spectrum of luminous, high-z QSOs. The upper limit
inferred from the average spectrum points to a ratio between PAH luminosity and

AGNs, implying that the correlation between star formation rate and AGN power
saturates at high luminosities.

in the mid-IR galaxy luminosity function over the redshift range z ~ 0-2, and
this is reproduced by our model without requiring any adjustment of parameters.

little evolution in the mid-IR luminosity function, and is therefore excluded.

prominence oscillations is that they are damped in time and that the values of
the damping times are usually between one and three times the corresponding
oscillatory period. However, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation is
still not well-known. Aims. Thermal conduction, optically thin or thick
radiation and heating are taken into account in the energy equation, and their
role on the attenuation of prominence oscillations is evaluated. Methods. The
dispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves is derived
considering an equilibrium made of a prominence plasma slab embedded in an
unbounded corona. The magnetic field is orientated along the direction parallel
to the slab axis and has the same strength in all regions. By solving the
dispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, a complex oscillatory frequency is
obtained, and the period and the damping time are computed. Results. The effect
of conduction and radiation losses is different for each magnetoacoustic mode
and depends on the wavenumber. In the observed range of wavelengths the
internal slow mode is attenuated by radiation from the prominence plasma, the
fast mode by the combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction and
the external slow mode by coronal conduction. The consideration of the external
corona is of paramount importance in the case of the fast and external slow
modes, whereas it does not affect the internal slow modes at all. Conclusions.
Non-adiabatic effects are efficient damping mechanisms for magnetoacoustic
modes, and the values of the obtained damping times are compatible with those
observed.

the amount of one-wayness of permutations. We also introduce the word-length
asymmetry function for groups, which is an algebraic analogue of computational

Moreover, boolean circuits have a representation in terms of elements of a

word-length. We show that circuits built with gates that are not constrained to
have fixed-length inputs and outputs, are at most quadratically more compact
than circuits built from traditional gates (with fixed-length inputs and
outputs). Finally, we show that the computational asymmetry function is closely
related to certain distortion functions: The computational asymmetry function
is polynomially equivalent to the distortion of the path length in Schreier
graphs of certain Thompson groups, compared to the path length in Cayley graphs

209458b. We find a surface gravity of g_p = 9.28 +/- 0.15 m/s, which is an
order of magnitude more precise than the best available measurements of its

surface gravity that that predicted by published theoretical models of gas
giant planets. We apply our method to all fourteen known transiting extrasolar

correlation may be the underlying effect as surface gravity is a fundamental
parameter in the evaporation of planetary atmospheres.

available, and galactocentric distances for each cluster. The color
distribution of the M33 clusters appears to be similar to those in the Large

intrinsic colors are correlated with cluster ages, which range from 10^{7.5} to

of rapid cluster disruption with a slope of alpha=-1.09 +/- 0.07 in the

single stellar population models suggests the presence of an age-metallicity
relation among these clusters with younger clusters being more metal-rich.

younger clusters (age <~ 1 Gyr) may be more concentrated toward the center of

SDSS-DR4 with redshift information for the cluster members. We have derived
global properties for each cluster, such as their mean recessional velocity,
velocity dispersion, and virial radii. Cluster galaxies have been grouped in
two families according to their $u-r$ colours. The total sample consists of
10865 galaxies. As expected, the highest fraction of galaxies (62%) turned to
be early-type (red) ones, being located at smaller distances from the cluster
centre and showing lower velocity dispersions than late-type (blue) ones. The
brightest cluster galaxies are located in the innermost regions and show the
smallest velocity dispersions. Early-type galaxies also show constant velocity
dispersion profiles inside the virial radius and a mild decline in the
outermost regions. In contrast, late-type galaxies show always decreasing
velocity dispersions profiles. No correlation has been found between the
fraction of blue galaxies and cluster global properties, such as cluster
velocity dispersion and galaxy concentration. In contrast, we found correlation
between the X-ray luminosity and the fraction of blue galaxies. These results
indicate that early- and late-type galaxies may have had different evolution.
Thus, blue galaxies are located in more anisotropic and radial orbits than
early-type ones. Their star formation seems to be independent of the cluster
global properties in low mass clusters, but not for the most massive ones.
These observational results suggest that the global environment could be
important for driving the evolution of galaxies in the most massive cluster
($\sigma > 800$ km s$^{-1}$). However, the local environment could play a key
role in galaxy evolution for low mass clusters.

here refers to the combined procedure resulting from first selecting a model

that it is impossible to estimate the unconditional distribution with
reasonable accuracy even asymptotically. In particular, we show that no
estimator for this distribution can be uniformly consistent (not even locally).
This follows as a corollary to (local) minimax lower bounds on the performance
of estimators for the distribution; performance is here measured by the
probability that the estimation error exceeds a given threshold. These lower
bounds are shown to approach 1/2 or even 1 in large samples, depending on the
situation considered. Similar impossibility results are also obtained for the

fitted to a model with an intrinsic powerlaw X-ray spectrum produced close to
the central black hole that is reprocessed and absorbed by material around the
black hole. To test the robustness of our results, we performed Monte Carlo
simulations of the spectral sample. We find a complex relationship between the
iron line equivalent width (EW) and the underlying power law index (Gamma). The
data reveal a correlation between Gamma and EW which turns over at Gamma <~ 2,
but finds a weak anti-correlation for steeper photon indices. We propose that
this relationship is driven by dilution of a disk spectrum (which includes the
narrow iron line) by a beamed jet component and, hence, could be used as a
diagnostic of jet-dominance. In addition, our sample shows a strong correlation
between the reflection fraction (R) and Gamma, but we find that it is likely
the result of modeling degeneracies. We also see the X-ray Baldwin effect (an
anti-correlation between the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity and EW) for the sample

  Galaxies: from the Young to the Old Universe","20 pages with 12 encapsulated figures. Version accepted by A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20077609",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a detailed analysis of the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function of
galaxies up to z=2.5 as obtained from the VVDS. We estimate the stellar mass
from broad-band photometry using 2 different assumptions on the galaxy star
formation history and show that the addition of secondary bursts to a
continuous star formation history produces systematically higher (up to 40%)
stellar masses. At low redshift (z=0.2) we find a substantial population of
low-mass galaxies (<10^9 Msun) composed by faint blue galaxies (M_I-M_K=0.3).
In general the stellar mass function evolves slowly up to z=0.9 and more
significantly above this redshift. Conversely, a massive tail is present up to
z=2.5 and have extremely red colours (M_I-M_K=0.7-0.8). We find a decline with
redshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59+-5% for
M>10^8 Msun at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution
(`mass-downsizing'). In particular our data are consistent with mild/negligible
(<30%) evolution up to z=0.7 for massive galaxies (>6x10^10 Msun). For less
massive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded. A large fraction (>=50%)
of massive galaxies have been already assembled and converted most of their gas
into stars at z=1, ruling out the `dry mergers' as the major mechanism of their
assembly history below z=1. This fraction decreases to 33% at z=2. Low-mass
systems have decreased continuously in number and mass density (by a factor up
to 4) from the present age to z=2, consistently with a prolonged mass assembly
also at z<1.

self-focusing nonlinearity and a quasi-1D double-channel potential, i.e., a
straightforward 2D extension of the well-known double-well potential. The model
may be realized in terms of nonlinear optics and Bose-Einstein condensates. The
variational approximation (VA) predicts a bifurcation breaking the symmetry of
2D solitons trapped in the double channel, the bifurcation being of the
subcritical type. The predictions of the VA are confirmed by numerical
simulations. The work presents the first example of the spontaneous symmetry
breaking (SSB) of 2D solitons in any dual-core system.

coupling between vector and axial-vector mesons at finite baryon density. In
the AdS/CFT dictionary, the coefficient of this coupling is proportional to the
baryon number density, and is fixed uniquely in the five-dimensional
holographic dual by anomalies in the flavor currents. For the lightest mesons,
the coupling mixes transverse $\rho$ and $a_1$ polarization states. At
sufficiently large baryon number densities, it produces an instability, which
causes the $\rho$ and $a_1$ mesons to condense in a state breaking both
rotational and translational invariance.
