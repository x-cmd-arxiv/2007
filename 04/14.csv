In real space the situation is more subtle. V-representability is formally

theorem, long wavelength fluctuations destroy the long-range order for 2D

crumpled. These dangerous fluctuations can, however, be suppressed by
anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes making that a
two-dimensional membrane can exist but should present strong height
fluctuations. The discovery of graphene, the first truly 2D crystal and the
recent experimental observation of ripples in freely hanging graphene makes
these issues especially important. Beside the academic interest, understanding
the mechanisms of stability of graphene is crucial for understanding electronic
transport in this material that is attracting so much interest for its unusual
Dirac spectrum and electronic properties. Here we address the nature of these
height fluctuations by means of straightforward atomistic Monte Carlo
simulations based on a very accurate many-body interatomic potential for
carbon. We find that ripples spontaneously appear due to thermal fluctuations
with a size distribution peaked around 70 \AA which is compatible with
experimental findings (50-100 \AA) but not with the current understanding of
stability of flexible membranes. This unexpected result seems to be due to the
multiplicity of chemical bonding in carbon.

between the data being consistent with instrument noise alone, or instrument
noise and a gravitational wave signal. The analysis of data from ground based
gravitational wave detectors is mostly conducted using classical statistics,
and methods such as the Neyman-Pearson criteria are used for model selection.
Future space based detectors, such as the \emph{Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna} (LISA), are expected to produced rich data streams containing the
signals from many millions of sources. Determining the number of sources that
are resolvable, and the most appropriate description of each source poses a
challenging model selection problem that may best be addressed in a Bayesian
framework. An important class of LISA sources are the millions of low-mass
binary systems within our own galaxy, tens of thousands of which will be
detectable. Not only are the number of sources unknown, but so are the number
of parameters required to model the waveforms. For example, a significant
subset of the resolvable galactic binaries will exhibit orbital frequency
evolution, while a smaller number will have measurable eccentricity. In the
Bayesian approach to model selection one needs to compute the Bayes factor
between competing models. Here we explore various methods for computing Bayes
factors in the context of determining which galactic binaries have measurable
frequency evolution. The methods explored include a Reverse Jump Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm, Savage-Dickie density ratios, the Schwarz-Bayes
Information Criterion (BIC), and the Laplace approximation to the model
evidence. We find good agreement between all of the approaches.

concentration and enstrophy at Taylor microscale Reynolds numbers in the range
34 - 170 were used to directly determine multiplier distributions (PDFs) on
spatial scales 3 times the Kolmogorov length scale. The width of the PDFs,
which is a measure of intermittency, decreases with increasing mass loading
within the local region where the multipliers are measured. The functional form
of this dependence is not sensitive to Reynolds numbers in the range
considered. A partition correlation probability is included in the cascade
model to account for the observed spatial anticorrelation between particle
concentration and enstrophy. Joint probability distribution functions of
concentration and enstrophy generated using the cascade model are shown to be
in excellent agreement with those derived directly from our 3D simulations.
Probabilities predicted by the cascade model are presented at Reynolds numbers
well beyond what is achievable by direct simulation. These results clearly
indicate that particle mass loading significantly reduces the probabilities of
high particle concentration and enstrophy relative to those resulting from

feasibly explained by a group of two or more galaxies with separations ~ 100
kpc. The impact of these findings on single line of sight observations is also
discussed; we show that abundances of DLAs may be affected by up to a few
tenths of a dex by line of sight DLA blending. From a Keck ESI spectrum of the
two quasars, we measure metal column densities for all five absorbers and
determine abundances for the three absorbers with log N(HI) > 20. For the two
highest N(HI) absorbers, we determine high levels of metal enrichment,
corresponding to 1/3 and 1/5 solar. These metallicities are amongst the highest
measured for DLAs at any redshift and are consistent with values measured in

optimal as both source and channel codes when encoding and decoding are
performed optimally. More precisely, in the context of lossy compression, we
prove that finite degree constructions can achieve any pair $(R, D)$ on the
rate-distortion curve of the binary symmetric source. In the context of channel
coding, we prove that finite degree codes can achieve any pair $(C, p)$ on the

the Gelfand-Pinsker bound for channel coding with side information (CCSI).

of this technique is currently limited by interferometric measurements at the

of circumstellar envelopes (CSE) seem to be the two main sources of bias. The
observations we performed aim at improving our knowledge of the interferometric
visibility profile of Cepheids. In particular, we assess the systematic
presence of CSE around Cepheids in order determine accurate distances with the
IBWM free from CSE biased angular diameters. We observed a Cepheid (Y Oph) for
which the pulsation is well resolved and a non-pulsating yellow supergiant
(alpha Per) using long-baseline near-infrared interferometry. We interpreted
these data using a simple CSE model we previously developed. We found that our
observations of alpha Per do not provide evidence for a CSE. The measured CLD
is explained by an hydrostatic photospheric model. Our observations of Y Oph,
when compared to smaller baseline measurements, suggest that it is surrounded
by a CSE with similar characteristics to CSE found previously around other
Cepheids. We have determined the distance to Y Oph to be d=491+/-18 pc.
Additional evidence points toward the conclusion that most Cepheids are
surrounded by faint CSE, detected by near infrared interferometry: after
observing four Cepheids, all show evidence for a CSE. Our CSE non-detection
around a non-pulsating supergiant in the instability strip, alpha Per, provides
confidence in the detection technique and suggests a pulsation driven mass-loss
mechanism for the Cepheids.

in conjunction with a precise Strichartz estimate of S.Klainerman and D.Tataru,
we establish the $H^s (s<1)$ global well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for
the cubic convolution defocusing Klein-Gordon-Hartree equation. Before arriving
at the previously discussed conclusion, we obtain global solution for this
non-scaling equation with small initial data in $H^{s_0}\times H^{s_0-1}$ where
$s_0=\frac\gamma 6$ but not $\frac\gamma2-1$, for this equation that we
consider is a subconformal equation in some sense. In doing so a number of
nonlinear prior estimates are already established by using Bony's
decomposition, flexibility of Klein-Gordon admissible pairs which are slightly
different from that of wave equation and a commutator estimate. We establish
this commutator estimate by exploiting cancellation property and utilizing
Coifman and Meyer multilinear multiplier theorem. As far as we know, it seems
that this is the first result on low regularity for this Klein-Gordon-Hartree
equation.
