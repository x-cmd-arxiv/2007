N=4 SYM can be identified with the Casimir of a certain deformation of the
Poincare algebra, in which the energy and momentum operators are supplemented
by a boost generator J. By considering the relationship between J and su(2|2) x
R^2, we derive a q-deformed super-Poincare symmetry algebra of the kinematics.
Using this, we show that the dynamic magnon representations may be obtained by
boosting from a fixed rest-frame representation. We comment on aspects of the
coalgebra structure and some implications for the question of boost-covariance

UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey Early Data Release (UDS EDR). Combined with very deep
Subaru optical photometry, the depth (K_AB = 22.5) and area (0.62 deg^2) of the
UDS EDR allows us to investigate optical/near-IR selection using a large sample
of over 30,000 objects. By using the B-z, z-K colour-colour diagram (the BzK
technique) we identify over 7500 candidate galaxies at z > 1.4, which can be
further separated into passive and starforming systems (pBzK and sBzK
respectively). Our unique sample allows us to identify a new feature not
previously seen in BzK diagrams, consistent with the passively evolving track
of early type galaxies at z < 1.4. We also compare the BzK technique with the
R-K colour selection of Extremely Red Objects (EROs) and the J-K selection of
Distant Red Galaxies (DRGs), and quantify the overlap between these
populations. We find that the majority of DRGs, at these relatively bright
magnitudes are also EROs. Since previous studies have found that DRGs at these
magnitudes have redshifts of z ~ 1 we determine that these DRG/ERO galaxies
have SEDs consistent with being dusty star-forming galaxies or AGN at z < 2.
Finally we observe a flattening in the number counts of pBzK galaxies, similar
to other studies, which may indicate that we are sampling the luminosity
function of passive z > 1 galaxies over a narrow redshift range.

individual cavities and on their mutual interactions. Here, we discuss ways of
controllable manipulation of photonic molecule supermodes, which improve or add
new functionalities to microcavity-based optical components. We present several
optimally-tuned photonic molecule designs for lowering thresholds of
semiconductor microlasers, producing directional light emission, enhancing
sensitivity of microcavity-based bio(chemical)sensors, and optimizing
electromagnetic energy transfer around bends of coupled-cavity waveguides.
Photonic molecules composed of identical microcavities as well as of
microcavities with various degrees of size or material detuning are discussed.

irregular satellites are orbiting around Uranus. Despite many studies have been
performed in past years, very few is know for the light-curves of these objects

This situation motivated our effort to improve both the knowledge of colours
and light curves. We present and discuss time series observations of Sycorax,
Prospero, Stephano, Setebos and Trinculo, five faint irregular satellites of
Uranus, carried out at VLT, ESO Paranal (Chile) in the nights between 29 and 30
July, 2005 and 25 and 30 November, 2005. We derive light curves for Sycorax and
Prospero and colours for all of these these bodies. For Sycorax we obtain
colours B-V =0.839 +/- 0.014, V-R = 0.531 +/- 0.005 and a light curve which is
suggestive of a periodical variation with period about 3.6 hours and amplitude
about 0.067 +/- 0.004 mag. The periods and colours we derive for Sycorax are in
agreement with our previous determination in 1999 using NTT. We derive also a
light-curve for Prospero which suggests an amplitude of about 0.2 mag and a
periodicity of about 4 hours. However, the sparseness of our data, prevents a
more precise characterization of the light-curves, and we can not determine
wether they are one-peaked or two-peaked. Hence, these periods and amplitudes
have to be considered preliminary estimates. As for Setebos, Stephano and
Trinculo the present data do not allow to derive any unambiguous periodicity,
despite Setebos displays a significant variability with amplitude about as
large as that of Prospero. Colours for Prospero, Setebos, Stephano and Trinculo
are in marginal agreement with the literature.

enrichment up to very high redshifts. The present GRB samples with redshift
determination are largely incomplete and therefore a careful analysis of
selection effects is mandatory before any conclusion can be drawn from the
observed GRB redshift distribution. We study and compare three well defined
samples of long GRBs detected by Swift, HETE2 and BeppoSAX. We find that Swift
GRBs are slighly fainter and harder than BeppoSAX and HETE2 GRBs, as expected
due to the higher energy range in which Swift GRBs are detected and localized,
compared to BeppoSAX and HETE2. Gas and dust obscuration plays a role in
shaping the GRB samples and the present samples of GRBs with redshift. We argue
that the majority of the bright Swift GRBs without redshift might actually be
z<~2 events therefore the present Swift GRB sample with redshift is biased
against low-z GRBs. On the other hand, the detection of bright UV rest-frame
afterglows from high-z GRBs, and even from those with large X-ray obscuration,
implies a dust amount lower than in nearby GRBs,and/or a different dust
composition. If this is the case, the Swift sample of GRBs with redshifts is
probably a fair sample of the real high-z GRB population. The absence of high-z
GRBs in the BeppoSAX and HETE2 samples of GRBs with redshifts is probably due
to the fact at the time of BeppoSAX and HETE2 follow-up faint afterglows of
high redshift GRBs will have weaken below the spectroscopic capabilities of
even 10m class telescopes. The redshift distribution of a subsample of Swift
GRBs with distributions of peak-fluxes, X-ray obscuration and optical magnitude
at a fixed observing time similar to those of the BeppoSAX and HETE2 samples,
is roughly consistent with BeppoSAX+HETE2 redshift distribution.

calculation of the spectrum emerging from a pulsar accretion column that
includes an explicit treatment of the bulk and thermal Comptonization occurring
in the radiation-dominated shocks that form in the accretion flows. Using a
rigorous eigenfunction expansion method, we obtain a closed-form expression for
the Green's function describing the upscattering of monochromatic radiation
injected into the column. The Green's function is convolved with
bremsstrahlung, cyclotron, and blackbody source terms to calculate the emergent
photon spectrum. We show that energization of photons in the shock naturally
produces an X-ray spectrum with a relatively flat continuum and a high-energy
exponential cutoff. Finally, we demonstrate that our model yields good
agreement with the spectra of the bright pulsar Her X-1 and the low luminosity
pulsar X Per.

nominal uncertainty of 2%. We discuss the data-reduction procedures required to
attain this accuracy; without these procdures, the calibration factor obtained

function (PSF) fitting photometry is found to give more accurate flux densities

coarse-scale calibration is 702 +/- 35 MJy sr^-1 MIPS70^-1 (5% uncertainty) and
is based on measurements of 66 stars. The instrumental units of the MIPS 70
micron coarse- and fine-scale imaging modes are called MIPS70 and MIPS70F,

faithfully reproduces the known sequence of regulatory activity patterns along

dynamical sequence is robustly implemented in the regulatory network, with the
biological stationary state G1 corresponding to the dominant attractor in state

trajectory. Comparing the fission yeast cell-cycle model to a similar model of

explained in a non-adiabatic picture invoking spin-selection rules [J. Behler

conserve the initial spin-triplet character of the free O2 molecule during the

density-functional theory approach gave access to the corresponding
potential-energy surface (PES) seen by such an impinging spin-triplet molecule

Here, we further substantiate this non-adiabatic picture by providing a
detailed account of the employed approach. Building on the previous work, we
focus in particular on inaccuracies in present-day exchange-correlation
functionals. Our analysis shows that small quantitative differences in the
spin-triplet constrained PES obtained with different gradient-corrected

complement the 2003 observations discussed in Paper I. Using StarSpotz, a
program developed specifically to analyze MOST photometry, we have solved for
k, the differential rotation coefficient, and P_{EQ}, the equatorial rotation
period using the light curves from all three years. The spots range in latitude
from 10 to 75 degrees and k = 0.090^{+0.006}_{-0.005} -- less than the solar
value but consistent with the younger age of the star. k is also well
constrained by the independent spectroscopic estimate of vsini. We demonstrate
independently that the pattern of differential rotation with latitude in fact
conforms to solar.
  Details are given of the parallel tempering formalism used in finding the
most robust solution which gives P_{EQ} = 8.77^{+0.03}_{-0.04} days -- smaller
than that usually adopted, implying an age < 750 My. Our values of P_{EQ} and k
can explain the range of rotation periods determined by others by spots or
activity at a variety of latitudes. Historically, Ca II activity seems to occur
consistently between latitudes 50 and 60 degrees which might indicate a
permanent magnetic feature. Knowledge of k and P_{EQ} are key to understanding
the dynamo mechanism and rotation structure in the convective zone as well
assessing age for solar-type stars. We recently published values of k and

with rotation curve properties (shape and extent) and disk central surface
brightness. The best match with HI rotational velocities is obtained with
Polyex widths, which are measured at the optical radius (encompassing a fixed
fraction of the total light of the galaxy) from a model fit to the rotation
curve. In contrast with Polyex widths, optical rotational velocities measured
at 2.15 disk scale lengths r_d deviate from HI widths by an amount that
correlates with the central surface brightness of the disk. This bias occurs
because the rotation curves of galaxies are in general still rising at 2.15
r_d, and the fraction of total mass contained within this radius decreases with
increasing disk surface brightness. Statistical corrections, parameterized by
the radial extent of the observed rotation curve, are provided to reduce Polyex
and HI width measurements into a homogeneous system. This yields a single
robust estimate of rotational velocity to be used for applications of disk
scaling relations.

quantum field theory, ascribing the two fundamental interactions--so different
in their manifestations--to a common symmetry principle. How the electroweak
gauge symmetry is hidden is one of the most urgent and challenging questions
facing particle physics. The provisional answer incorporated in the ""standard
model"" of particle physics was formulated in the 1960s by Higgs, by Brout &
Englert, and by Guralnik, Hagen & Kibble: The agent of electroweak symmetry
breaking is an elementary scalar field whose self-interactions select a vacuum
state in which the full electroweak symmetry is hidden, leaving a residual
phase symmetry of electromagnetism. By analogy with the Meissner effect of the
superconducting phase transition, the Higgs mechanism, as it is commonly known,
confers masses on the weak force carriers W and Z. It also opens the door to
masses for the quarks and leptons, and shapes the world around us. It is a good
story--though an incomplete story--and we do not know how much of the story is
true. Experiments that explore the Fermi scale (the energy regime around 1 TeV)
during the next decade will put the electroweak theory to decisive test, and
may uncover new elements needed to construct a more satisfying completion of
the electroweak theory. The aim of this article is to set the stage by
reporting what we know and what we need to know, and to set some ""Big
Questions"" that will guide our explorations.

Yang-Mills. In order to describe these duals, we begin with a sequence of
breathing mode reductions of IIB supergravity: first on S^3, then S^3 x S^1,
and finally on S^3 x S^1 x CP^1. We then follow with a complete supersymmetry
analysis, yielding 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 BPS configurations, respectively (where in
the last step we take the Hopf fibration of S^3). The 1/8 BPS geometries, which
have an S^3 isometry and are time-fibered over a six-dimensional base, are
determined by solving a non-linear equation for the Kahler metric on the base.
Similarly, the 1/4 BPS configurations have an S^3 x S^1 isometry and a
four-dimensional base, whose Kahler metric obeys another non-linear,
Monge-Ampere type equation.
  Despite the non-linearity of the problem, we develop a universal bubbling AdS
description of these geometries by focusing on the boundary conditions which
ensure their regularity. In the 1/8 BPS case, we find that the S^3 cycle
shrinks to zero size on a five-dimensional locus inside the six-dimensional
base. Enforcing regularity of the full solution requires that the interior of a
smooth, generally disconnected five-dimensional surface be removed from the
base. The AdS_5 x S^5 ground state corresponds to excising the interior of an
S^5, while the 1/8 BPS excitations correspond to deformations (including
topology change) of the S^5 and/or the excision of additional droplets from the
base. In the case of 1/4 BPS configurations, by enforcing regularity
conditions, we identify three-dimensional surfaces inside the four-dimensional
base which separate the regions where the S^3 shrinks to zero size from those
where the S^1 shrinks.

which challenge current progenitor models. The lack of any bright SN down to
very strict limits and the vanishing spectral lags are typical of short GRBs,
strikingly at odds with the long (102s) duration of this event. Here we present
spectral and temporal analysis of the Swift observations. We show that the
burst presents standard optical, UV and X-ray afterglows. An achromatic break
is observed simultaneously in optical and X-rays, at a time consistent with the
break in the R-band light curve measured by the VLT. The achromatic behaviour
and the consistent post-break decay slopes make GRB 060614 one of the best
examples of a jet break for a Swift burst. The optical, UV and X-rays afterglow
light curves have also an earlier break at ~30 ks. In the optical, there is
strong spectral evolution around this break, suggesting the passage of a break
frequency through the optical/UV band. The very blue spectrum at early times
and the trend in the light curves (rising at low frequencies, and decaying at
higher energies) suggest this may be the injection frequency. The early X-ray
light curve is well interpreted as the X-ray counterpart of the burst extended
emission. Spectral analysis of BAT/XRT data in the 80s overlap time show that
the Ep of the burst has decreased to as low as 8keV at the beginning of the XRT
observation. The Ep continues to decrease through the XRT energy band and exits
it at about 500s after the trigger. The average Ep of the burst is likely < 24
keV but larger than 8 keV. The initial peak observed by BAT is however
distinctly harder than the rest with Ep ~300 keV as measured by Konus Wind.
Considering the time-averaged spectral properties, GRB 060614 is consistent
with the Eiso-Ep_rest, Egamma-Ep_rest, and Liso-Ep correlations.

over extensions of the states. One is a generalization of the squashed

the state's extension and takes the infimum over such extensions. Additivity of
the multipartite squashed entanglement is proved for both versions of the
multipartite information which turn out to be related. The second one is based
on taking classical extensions. This scheme is generalized, which enables to
construct measures of entanglement based on the {\it mixed convex roof} of a
quantity, which in contrast to the standard convex roof method involves
optimization over all decompositions of a density matrix rather than just the
decompositions into pure states. As one of the possible applications of these
results we prove that any multipartite monotone is an upper bound on the amount
of multipartite distillable key. The findings are finally related to analogous
results in classical key agreement.

structure of these two high-z populations. The LBGs without Ly-alpha emission
form a filamentary structure including the QSO, while the LAEs are distributed
around the QSO but avoid it within a distance of ~4.5Mpc. On the other hand, we
serendipitously discovered a protocluster with a significant concentration of
LBGs and LAEs where no strongly UV ionizing source such as a QSO or radio
galaxy is known to exist. In this cluster field, two populations are spatially
cross-correlated with each other. The relative spatial distribution of LAEs to
LBGs is in stark contrast between the QSO and the cluster fields. We also found
a weak trend showing that the number counts based on Ly-alpha and UV continuum
fluxes of LAEs in the QSO field are slightly lower than in the cluster field,
whereas the number counts of LBGs are almost consistent with each other. The
LAEs avoid the nearby region around the QSO where the local UV background
radiation could be ~100 times stronger than the average for the epoch. The
clustering segregation between LBGs and LAEs seen in the QSO field could be due
to either enhanced early galaxy formation in an overdense environment having
caused all the LAEs to evolve into LBGs, or local photoionization due to the
strong UV radiation from the QSO effectively causing a deficit in low-mass
galaxies like LAEs.

These were simulations of a pulsed, initially underdense jet in a high density

and since the jet velocity is very high, the jet bow shock and the internal
shocks are heated to high temperatures and should therefore emit X-ray
radiation. In this paper, we investigate in detail the X-ray properties of the
jets in our models. We have focused our study on the total X-ray luminosity and
its temporal variability, the resulting spectra and the spatial distribution of
the emission. Temperature and density maps from our hydrodynamical simulations
with radiative cooling presented in the second paper are used together with
emissivities calculated with the atomic database ATOMDB. The jets in our models
show extended and variable X-ray emission which can be characterized as a sum
of hot and warm components with temperatures that are consistent with
observations of CH Cyg and R Aqr. The X-ray spectra of our model jets show
emission line features which correspond to observed features in the spectra of
CH Cyg. The innermost parts of our pulsed jets show iron line emission in the
6.4 - 6.7 keV range which may explain such emission from the central source in
R Aqr. We conclude that MWC 560 should be detectable with Chandra or

degenerate rates, namely with nearest neighbor exchange rates which vanish for
certain configurations. These models belong to the class of {\sl kinetically
constrained lattice gases} (KCLG) which have been introduced and intensively
studied in physics literature as simple models for the liquid/glass transition.
Due to the degeneracy of rates for KCLG there exists {\sl blocked
configurations} which do not evolve under the dynamics and in general the
hyperplanes of configurations with a fixed number of particles can be
decomposed into different irreducible sets. As a consequence, both the Entropy
and Relative Entropy method cannot be straightforwardly applied to prove the
hydrodynamic limit. In particular, some care should be put when proving the One

that, for initial profiles smooth enough and bounded away from zero and one,
the macroscopic density profile for our KCLG evolves under the diffusive time
scaling according to the porous medium equation. Then we prove the same result
for more general profiles for a slightly perturbed dynamics obtained by adding
jumps of the Symmetric Simple Exclusion. The role of the latter is to remove
the degeneracy of rates and at the same time they are properly slowed down in
order not to change the macroscopic behavior. The equilibrium fluctuations and
the magnitude of the spectral gap for this perturbed model are also obtained.

outburst just 2 yr earlier, and we propose that the dust formation is a
consequence of the SN blast wave overtaking that LBV-like shell. The key
evidence for dust formation is (a) the appearance of a red/near-IR continuum
source fit by 1600 K graphite grains, and (b) fading of the redshifted sides of
He I emission lines, yielding progressively more asymmetric blueshifted lines
as dust obscures receding material. This provides the strongest case yet for
dust formation in any SN Ib/c. Both developments occurred between 51 and 75 d
after peak, while other SNe observed to form dust did so after a few hundred
days. Geometric considerations indicate that dust formed in the dense swept-up
shell between the forward and reverse shocks, and not in the freely expanding
SN ejecta. Rapid cooling leading to dust formation may have been aided by
extremely high shell densities, as indicated by He I line ratios. The brief
epoch of dust formation is accompanied by He II 4686 emission and enhanced
X-ray emission. These clues suggest that the unusual dust formation in this
object was not due to properties of the SN itself, but instead -- like most
peculiarities of SN 2006jc -- was a consequence of the dense environment
created by an LBV-like eruption 2 yr before the SN.

capacity of the wiretap channel is established. Unlike previous works, where a
noiseless public discussion channel is used for feedback, the feed-forward and
feedback signals share the same noisy channel in the present model. Quite
interestingly, this noisy feedback model is shown to be more advantageous in
the current setting. More specifically, the discrete memoryless modulo-additive
channel with a full-duplex destination node is considered first, and it is
shown that the judicious use of feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacity
to the capacity of the source-destination channel in the absence of the
wiretapper. In the achievability scheme, the feedback signal corresponds to a
private key, known only to the destination. In the half-duplex scheme, a novel
feedback technique that always achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate (even
when the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the source-destination
channel) is proposed. These results hinge on the modulo-additive property of
the channel, which is exploited by the destination to perform encryption over
the channel without revealing its key to the source. Finally, this scheme is
extended to the continuous real valued modulo-$\Lambda$ channel where it is
shown that the perfect secrecy capacity with feedback is also equal to the
capacity in the absence of the wiretapper.

GNR channel shares similarities with a zigzag CNT, but it has a different
geometry and quantum confinement boundary condition in the transverse
direction. The results indicate that the I-V characteristics are ambipolar and
strongly depend on the GNR width because the bandgap of the GNR is
approximately inversely proportional to its width, which agrees with recent
experiments. A multiple gate geometry improves immunity to short channel
effects, but it offers smaller improvement than it does for Si MOSFETs in terms
of the on-current and transconductance. Reducing the oxide thickness is more
useful for improving transistor performance than using a high-k gate insulator.
Significant increase of the minimal leakage current is observed when the
channel length is scaled below 10nm because the small effective mass
facilitates strong source-drain tunneling. The GNRFET, therefore, does not
promise extending the ultimate scaling limit of Si MOSFETs. The intrinsic
switching speed of a GNR SBFET, however, is several times faster than that of
Si MOSFETs, which could lead to promising high speed electronics applications,
where the large leakage of GNR SBFETs is of less concern.

two atoms can readily be extracted from dynamics of a simple two-level system.
Effectively, we engineer two coupled qubits whose the dynamics are analogous to
that of a driven single two-level system. It is found that spatial variations
of the coupling constants actually help to create transient entanglement which
may appear on the time scale much longer than that predicted for the case of
equal coupling constants. When the atoms are initially prepared in an entangled
state, they may remain entangled for all times. We also find that the
entanglement exhibits an interesting phenomenon of diffraction when the the
atoms are located between the nodes and antinodes of the cavity mode. The
diffraction pattern of the entanglement varies with time and we explain this

the 1720 MHz line. It is therefore a potentially valuable indicator of
remnant-cloud interaction.
  We present preliminary results of a survey using the Parkes Methanol
Multibeam receiver for 6049 MHz and 6035/6030 MHz OH masers towards 36
supernova remnants and 4 fields in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. While
no 6049 MHz masers have been found, three new sites of 6035 and 6030 MHz OH
maser emission have been discovered in star-forming regions.

slope in the fundamental space for each class of early-type galaxies and find
that there are obvious differences in the slopes of the fundamental planes

slopes for Seyferts and star-forming galaxies are flatter than those for normal

variation of the FP slope among the subclasses of early-type galaxies. The
difference in the FP slope might be caused by the difference in the degree of
nonhomology among different classes or by the difference of gas contents in
their merging progenitors. One possible scenario is that the AGN host galaxies

evolve into normal early-type galaxies after finishing their star formation or

energy of a slowly rolling scalar field. Making a quantum expansion around such
a time dependent solution is found to break fundamental symmetries of quantum
field theory. We call this mechanism cosmological symmetry breaking and argue
that it is different from the standard phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry
breaking. We illustrate this with a toy scalar field theory, whose action
displays a U(1) symmetry. We identify a symmetry, called pseudo-scale
invariance, which sets the cosmological constant exactly equal to zero, both in
classical and quantum theory. This symmetry is also broken cosmologically and
leads to a nonzero vacuum or dark energy. The slow roll condition along with
the observed value of dark energy leads to a value of the background scalar
field of the order of Planck mass. We also consider a U(1) gauge symmetry
model. Cosmological symmetry breaking, in this case, leads to a non zero mass
for the vector field. We also show that a cosmologically broken pseudo-scale
invariance can generate a wide range of masses.

Our formalism, which is described in some detail, relies on a nonadiabatic

presented for a number of unstable modes in a model of SPB star, at rotation
rates up to 250 km/s. It is shown that rotation has a large effect on mode
visibility in light and in mean radial velocity variations. In most cases, fast
rotation impairs mode detectability of g-modes in light variation, as Townsend
(2003b) has already noted, but it helps detection in radial velocity variation.
The mixed modes, which exist only at sufficiently fast rotation, are also more
easily seen in radial velocity. The amplitude ratios and phase differences are
strongly dependent on the aspect, the rotational velocity and on the mode. The
latter dependence is essential for mode identification.

behaviour is proposed as a basis for molecular computation. The proposal is
highly speculative but may have tremendous impact.
  Kekul\'e states with the same boundary behaviour (port assignment) can be
regarded as equivalent. This gives rise to the abstraction of Kekul\'e cells.
The basic theory of Kekul\'e states and Kekul\'e cells is developed here, up to
the classification of Kekul\'e cells with $\leq 4$ ports. To put the theory in

may be useful as connectors between computational elements. We finally

using a time-dependent, 3D hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere,
exhibits a significant decrease of C, N, O abundances compared to their
previous values. Solar models that use these new abundances are not consistent
with helioseismological determinations of the sound speed profile, the surface
helium abundance and the convection zone depth. Aims. We investigate the effect
of changes of solar abundances on low degree p-mode and g-mode characteristics
which are strong constraints of the solar core. We consider particularly the
increase of neon abundance in the new solar mixture in order to reduce the
discrepancy between models using new abundances and helioseismology. Methods.
The observational determinations of solar frequencies from the GOLF instrument
are used to test solar models computed with different chemical compositions. We
consider in particular the normalized small frequency spacings in the low
degree p-mode frequency range. Results. Low-degree small frequency spacings are
very sensitive to changes in the heavy-element abundances, notably neon. We
show that by considering all the seismic constraints, including the small
frequency spacings, a rather large increase of neon abundance by about (0.5 +/-
0.05)dex can be a good solution to the discrepancy between solar models that
use new abundances and low degree helioseismology, subject to adjusting
slightly the solar age and the highest abundances. We also show that the change
in solar abundances, notably neon, considerably affects g-mode frequencies,
with relative frequency differences between the old and the new models higher
than 1.5%

a remote server when even the users' inputs are not hidden from an adversary.
Recently, the authors proposed a human identification protocol in the RSA
Conference 2007, which is loosely based on the ability of humans to efficiently
process an image. The advantage being that an automated adversary is not
effective in attacking the protocol without human assistance. This paper
extends that work by trying to solve some of the open problems. First, we
analyze the complexity of defeating the proposed protocols by quantifying the
workload of a human adversary. Secondly, we propose a new construction based on
textual CAPTCHAs (Reverse Turing Tests) in order to make the generation of
automated challenges easier. We also present a brief experiment involving real
human users to find out the number of possible attributes in a given image and
give some guidelines for the selection of challenge questions based on the
results. Finally, we analyze the previously proposed protocol in detail for the
relationship between the secrets. Our results show that we can construct human
identification protocols based on image evaluation with reasonably
``quantified'' security guarantees based on our model.

unambiguous definition of the non-perturbative massive quark condensate could
be provided by considering a non positive-definite class of solutions to the

this definition is incomplete without considering a third class of solutions.
Indeed, studying these three classes reveals a degeneracy of possible
condensate definitions leading to a whole range of values. However, we show
that the {\it physical} condensate may in fact be extracted by simple fitting
to the Operator Product Expansion, a procedure which is stabilised by
considering the three classes of solution together. We find that for current
quark masses in the range from zero to 25 MeV or so (defined at a scale of 2
GeV in the $\bar{MS}$ scheme), the dynamically generated condensate increases
from the chiral limit in a wide range of phenomenologically successful models
of the confining QCD interaction. Lastly, the role of a fourth class of noded

one of a half-plane, when $\beta e^2=2$, where $\beta$ is the inverse
temperature and $e$ is the charge of a particle: all the classical $n$-body
densities are known. For the quantum one-component plasma, two sum rules
involving the truncated two-body density (and, for one of them, the density
profile) have been derived, a long time ago, by heuristic macroscopic
arguments: one sum rule is about the asymptotic form along the wall of the
truncated two-body density, the other one is about the dipole moment of the
structure factor. In the two-dimensional case at $\beta e^2=2$, we have now
explicit expressions up to order $\hbar^2$ of these two quantum densities, thus
we can microscopically check the sum rules at this order. The checks are
positive, reinforcing the idea that the sum rules are correct.

""pebbles"" in the outer parts of disks around pre-main-sequence stars. The
observations suggest that large grains are produced relatively early in disk
evolution (< 1 Myr) and remain at large radii for longer periods of time (5 to
10 Myr). Simple theoretical estimates of the radial drift time of solid
particles, however, imply that they would drift inward over a time scale of
less than 0.1 Myr. In this paper, we address this conflict between theory and
observation, using more detailed theoretical models, including the effects of
sedimentation, collective drag forces and turbulent viscosity. We find that,
although these effects slow down the radial drift of the dust particles, this
reduction is not sufficient to explain the observationally determined long
survival time of mm/cm-sized grains in protoplanetary disks. However, if for
some reason the gas to dust ratio in the disk is reduced by at least a factor
of 20 from the canonical value of 100 (for instance through photoevaporation of
the gas), then the radial drift time scales become sufficiently large to be in
agreement with observations.

choice in a context of positive additive endogenous externalities. It
encompasses as particular cases several models from the sociology and economics
literature. We extend previous results to the case of a general distribution of
idiosyncratic preferences, called here Idiosyncratic Willingnesses to Pay
(IWP). Positive additive externalities yield a family of inverse demand curves
that include the classical downward sloping ones but also new ones with non
constant convexity. When j, the ratio of the social influence strength to the
standard deviation of the IWP distribution, is small enough, the inverse demand
is a classical monotonic (decreasing) function of the adoption rate. Even if
the IWP distribution is mono-modal, there is a critical value of j above which
the inverse demand is non monotonic, decreasing for small and high adoption
rates, but increasing within some intermediate range. Depending on the price
there are thus either one or two equilibria. Beyond this first result, we
exhibit the generic properties of the boundaries limiting the regions where the
system presents different types of equilibria (unique or multiple). These
properties are shown to depend only on qualitative features of the IWP
distribution: modality (number of maxima), smoothness and type of support
(compact or infinite). The main results are summarized as phase diagrams in the
space of the model parameters, on which the regions of multiple equilibria are
precisely delimited.

spectra of 4 turn off (TO) stars obtained with the UVES spectrograph at the
8.2m VLT Kueyen telescope. results: The four stars observed, span the range
1.6<~A(Li)} <~ 2.14, providing a mean A(Li) = 1.84 with a standard deviation of
0.25 dex. When coupled with data of other two TO stars of the cluster,
available in the literature, the full range in Li abundances observed in this
cluster is 1.6<~A(Li)<~ 2.3. The variation in A(Li) is at least 0.6 dex (0.7
dex considering also the data available in the literature) and the scatter is
six times larger than what expected from the observational error. We claim that
these variations are real. A(Li) seems to be anti-correlated with A(Na) exactly
as observed in NGC 6752. No systematic error in our analysis could produce such
an anti-correlation. conclusions: Na production through p captures on 22Ne at
temperatures in excess of 3x10^7 K and the contemporary Li destruction could
result in this anti-correlation. However such nuclear processing cannot have
taken place in the stars themselves, which do not reach such high temperatures,
even at their centre. This points towards the processing in a previous
generation of stars. The low N/O ratios in the observed stars and the apparent
lack of correlation between N an Li abundances, place a strong constraint on
the properties of this previous generation. Our results indicate a different
behaviour among the Globular Clusters so far studied as far as the abundance
patterns are concerned.

models. Here we argue that these difficulties arise owing to the significant
modulation of the solar activity cycle, and that this modulation arises owing
to either stochastic or deterministic processes. We analyse the implications
for predictability in both of these situations by considering two separate
solar dynamo models. The first model represents a stochastically-perturbed flux
transport dynamo. Here even very weak stochastic perturbations can give rise to
significant modulation in the activity cycle. This modulation leads to a loss
of predictability. In the second model, we neglect stochastic effects and
assume that generation of magnetic field in the Sun can be described by a fully
deterministic nonlinear mean-field model -- this is a best case scenario for
prediction. We designate the output from this deterministic model (with
parameters chosen to produce chaotically modulated cycles) as a target
timeseries that subsequent deterministic mean-field models are required to
predict. Long-term prediction is impossible even if a model that is correct in
all details is utilised in the prediction. Furthermore, we show that even
short-term prediction is impossible if there is a small discrepancy in the
input parameters from the fiducial model. This is the case even if the
predicting model has been tuned to reproduce the output of previous cycles.
Given the inherent uncertainties in determining the transport coefficients and
nonlinear responses for mean-field models, we argue that this makes predicting
the solar cycle using the output from such models impossible.

low energy realization of the two-flavour QCD. We show that the $\sigma$ field
is described by its four-quark component at least in the $\sigma$ resonance
energy (virtuality) region and the $\sigma\to\gamma\gamma$ decay is the four
quark transition.
  We emphasize that residues of the $\sigma$ pole in the $\pi\pi\to\pi\pi$ and
$\gamma\gamma\to\pi\pi$ amplitudes do not give an idea about the $\sigma$ meson
nature, and the progress in studying the $\sigma$ meson production mechanisms
in different processes could essentially further us in understanding its
nature.

using a generalization of Darcy's Law. We consider flows in both Lagrangian and
Eulerian formulations. The Lagrangian formulation includes a dissipative
modification of fluid mechanics. Eulerian equations for self-organization of
scalars, 1-forms and 2-forms are shown to reduce to nonlocal characteristic
equations. We identify singular solutions of these equations corresponding to
collapsed (clumped) states and discuss their evolution.

leads. When the electrons interact inside the nano-system, the coefficient
|ts(E_F)|^2 describing its effective transmission at the Fermi energy E_F
ceases to be local. This effect of electron-electron interactions upon
|ts(E_F)|^2 is studied using a one dimensional model of spinless fermions and
the Hartree-Fock approximation. The non locality of |ts(E_F)|^2 is due to the
coupling between the Hartree and Fock corrections inside the nano-system and
the scatterers outside the nano-system via long range Friedel oscillations.
Using this phenomenon, one can vary |ts(E_F)|^2 by an Aharonov-Bohm flux
threading a ring which is attached to one lead at a distance Lc from the
nano-system. For small distances Lc, the variation of the quantum conductance
induced by this non local effect can exceed 0.1 (e^2/h).

to $t\to\infty$ for $m\ge m_c=(d-2)/d$, or as t approaches the extinction time
when m < mc. For a class of initial data we prove that the solution converges
with a polynomial rate to a self-similar solution, for t large enough if $m\ge
m_c$, or close enough to the extinction time if m < mc. Such results are new in
the range $m\le m_c$ where previous approaches fail. In the range mc < m < 1 we
improve on known results.
