current (FCNC) top quark decays, whose observation would be a clear sign of
physics beyond the standard model. Although many details of top flavor
violation are model dependent, the standard model gauge symmetries relate top
FCNCs to other processes, which are strongly constrained by existing data. We
study these constraints in a model independent way, using a low energy
effective theory from which the new physics is integrated out. We consider the
most important operators which contribute to top FCNCs and analyze the current
constraints on them. We find that the data rule out top FCNCs at a level
observable at the LHC due to most of the operators comprising left-handed first
or second generation quark fields, while there remains a substantial window for
top decays mediated by operators with right-handed charm or up quarks. If FCNC
top decays are observed at the LHC, such an analysis may help decipher the
underlying physics.

astrophysical sources, foremost giving information about their geometry,
magnetic fields, and radiation mechanisms. However, very few X-ray polarization
measurements have been made, and then only mono-energetic detections, whilst
several objects are assumed to have energy dependent polarization signatures.
In this paper we investigate whether detection of energy dependent polarization
from cosmic sources is possible using the Compton technique, in particular with
the proposed PoGOLite balloon-experiment, in the 25-100 keV range. We use
Geant4 simulations of a PoGOLite model and input photon spectra based on Cygnus
X-1 and accreting magnetic pulsars (100 mCrab). Effective observing times of 6
and 35 hours were simulated, corresponding to a standard and a long duration
flight respectively. Both smooth and sharp energy variations of the
polarization are investigated and compared to constant polarization signals
using chi-square statistics. We can reject constant polarization, with energy,
for the Cygnus X-1 spectrum (in the hard state), if the reflected component is
assumed to be completely polarized, whereas the distinction cannot be made for
weaker polarization. For the accreting pulsar, constant polarization can be
rejected in the case of polarization in a narrow energy band with at least 50%
polarization, and similarly for a negative step distribution from 30% to 0%
polarization.

allowing observations to be made from the optical to gamma-ray bands. Many
other telescopes, including Konus-Wind, XMM-Newton, ROTSE and the Faulkes
Telescope North, also observed the burst. The gamma-ray, X-ray and UV/optical
emission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical and
X-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the main
peak. Spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the prompt
emission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.
The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the prompt emission, stretching from
1eV up to 1MeV, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1keV. The
optical-to-X-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, rather
than single, power-law, similar to previous results for X-ray flares. The SED
shows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. This behaviour
might be a symptom of self-Comptonisation, although circumstellar densities
similar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. The
afterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.
Although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both are
consistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. GRB 061121 is
the instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by Swift. Using a
combination of Swift and Konus-Wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of
2.8x10^53 erg over 1keV - 10MeV in the GRB rest frame. A probable jet break is
detected at ~2x10^5s, leading to an estimate of ~10^51 erg for the
beaming-corrected gamma-ray energy.

HEW, Half Energy Width) strongly depend on both mirrors deformations and photon
scattering caused by the microroughness of reflecting surfaces. In particular,
the contribution of X-ray Scattering (XRS) to the HEW of the optic is usually
an increasing function H(E) of the photon energy E. Therefore, in future hard
X-ray imaging telescopes of the future (SIMBOL-X, NeXT, Constellation-X, XEUS),
the X-ray scattering could be the dominant problem since they will operate also
in the hard X-ray band (i.e. beyond 10 keV). [...]
  Several methods were proposed in the past years to estimate the scattering
contribution to the HEW, dealing with the surface microroughness expressed in
terms of its Power Spectral Density (PSD), on the basis of the well-established
theory of X-ray scattering from rough surfaces. We faced that problem on the
basis on the same theory, but we tried a new approach: the direct, analytical
translation of a given surface roughness PSD into a H(E) trend, and - vice
versa - the direct translation of a H(E) requirement into a surface PSD. This
PSD represents the maximum tolerable microroughness level in order to meet the
H(E) requirement in the energy band of a given X-ray telescope.
  We have thereby found a new, analytical and widely applicable formalism to
compute the XRS contribution to the HEW from the surface PSD, provided that the
PSD had been measured in a wide range of spatial frequencies. The inverse
problem was also solved, allowing the immediate evaluation of the mirror
surface PSD from a measured function H(E). The same formalism allows
establishing the maximum allowed PSD of the mirror in order to fulfill a given
H(E) requirement. [...]

catalogue from the second phase of the Optical Gravitational Microlensing
Experiment (OGLE-II, Sumi et al. 2004) for 45 fields. The proper motion
dispersions are measured to a few per cent accuracy due to the large number of
stars in the fields. The observational sample is comprised of 577736 stars.
These observed data are compared to a state-of-the-art particle simulation of
the Galactic bulge region. The predictions are in rough agreement with
observations, but appear to be too anisotropic in the velocity ellipsoid. We
note that there is significant field-to-field variation in the observed proper
motion dispersions. This could either be a real feature, or due to some unknown
systematic effect.

long-range intrachain correlations in concentrated solutions and melts of long
flexible polymers which cause a systematic swelling of short chain segments.
They can be traced back to the incompressibility of the melt leading to an
effective repulsion $u(s) \approx s/\rho R^3(s) \approx ce/\sqrt{s}$ when
connecting two segments together where $s$ denotes the curvilinear length of a
segment, $R(s)$ its typical size, $ce \approx 1/\rho be^3$ the ``swelling
coefficient"", $be$ the effective bond length and $\rho$ the monomer density.
The relative deviation of the segmental size distribution from the ideal
Gaussian chain behavior is found to be proportional to $u(s)$. The analysis of
different moments of this distribution allows for a precise determination of
the effective bond length $be$ and the swelling coefficient $ce$ of
asymptotically long chains. At striking variance to the short-range decay
suggested by Flory's ideality hypothesis the bond-bond correlation function of
two bonds separated by $s$ monomers along the chain is found to decay
algebraically as $1/s^{3/2}$. Effects of finite chain length are considered
briefly.

understanding of quantum transport far from equilibrium and a conceptual
framework has emerged through a combination of the Landauer approach with the
non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) method, which is now being widely used in
the analysis and design of nanoscale devices. It provides a unified description
for all kinds of devices from molecular conductors to carbon nanotubes to
silicon transistors covering different transport regimes from the ballistic to
the diffusive limit. In this talk I use a simple version of this model to
analyze a specially designed device that could be called an electronic
Maxwell's demon, one that lets electrons go preferentially in one direction
over another. My objective is to illustrate the fundamental role of contacts
and demons in transport and energy conversion. The discussion is kept at an
academic level steering clear of real world details, but the illustrative
devices we use are very much within the capabilities of present-day technology.
For example, recent experiments on thermoelectric effects in molecular
conductors agree well with the predictions from our model. The Maxwell's demon
device itself is very similar to the pentalayer spin-torque device which has
been studied by a number of groups though we are not aware of any discussion of
the possibility of using the device as a nanoscale heat engine or as a
refrigerator as proposed here. However, my objective is not to evaluate
possible practical applications. Rather it is to introduce a simple transparent
model showing how out-of-equibrium demons suitably incorporated into
nanodevices can achieve energy conversion.

lithosphere, or as a dynamical effect due to lithospheric flexure caused by
mantle convection. In both cases the response of the lithosphere to external
forces can be calculated with the theory of thin elastic plates or shells. On
one-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric shell plays an
important role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing the
deformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under the
assumption of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravity
and topography data suggest large variations in the thickness of the
lithosphere. In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governing
the deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variable
Young's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, except
for a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the
transverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include
bottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress
functions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We further
show that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thickness
varies, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that the
degree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal
tangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shell
and are associated with translational and rotational freedom. The flexure
equations for a shell of variable thickness are useful not only for the
prediction of the gravity signal in local admittance studies, but also for the
construction of stress maps in tectonic analysis.

hardened. The pulsed count rate increased by a factor of 10 (0.5-8.0 keV), but

  (Accepted for ApJL)",,"10.1086/522337",,"astro-ph",,"  In the decreasing intrinsic redshift (DIR) model galaxies are assumed to be
born as compact objects that have been ejected with large intrinsic redshift
components, z_(i), out of the nuclei of mature AGN galaxies. As young AGN
(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies
but their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and
they evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented
here that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to
radio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that
the high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been
pushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large
intrinsic component in their redshifts. An increase in luminosity below z =
0.06 is also seen. It is associated in the DIR model with an increase in
luminosity as the sources mature but, if real, is difficult to interpret in the
cosmological redshift (CR) model since at this low redshift it is unlikely to
be associated with a higher star formation rate or an increase in the material
used to build galaxies. Whether it might be possible in the CR model to explain
these results by selection effects is also examined.

various ideas about parity doubling. The experimental evidence for this

manifold X. Any fixed smooth Hermitian metric on L induces a Hilbert space
structure on the space of global holomorphic sections with values in the k:th
tensor power of L. In this paper various convergence results are obtained for
the corresponding Bergman kernels. The convergence is studied in the large k
limit and is expressed in terms of the equilibrium metric associated to the
fixed metric, as well as in terms of the Monge-Ampere measure of the fixed
metric itself on a certain support set. It is also shown that the equilibrium
metric has Lipschitz continuous first derivatives. These results can be seen as
generalizations of well-known results concerning the case when the curvature of
the fixed metric is positive (the corresponding equilibrium metric is then
simply the fixed metric itself).

double-peaked H$\alpha$ emission line, and obtained a semi-amplitude value that
is in excellent agreement with the obtained from observations in the
ultraviolet spectral region by Sion et al. (1998). We present also a new method
to obtain K_2, which enhances the detection of absorption or emission features
arising in the late-type companion. Our results are compared with published
values derived from the near-infrared NaI line doublet. From a comparison of
the TiO band with those of late type M stars, we find that a best fit is
obtained for a M6V star, contributing 5 percent of the total light at that
spectral region. Assuming that the radial velocity semi-amplitudes reflect
accurately the motion of the binary components, then from our results: K_em =
107+/-2 km/s; K_abs = 310+/-5 km/s, and using the inclination angle given by
Zhang & Robinson(1987); i = 69.7+/-0.7, the system parameters become: M_WD =
1.20+/-0.05 M_sun,; M_RD = 0.42+/-0.04 M_sun; and a = 1.55+/- 0.02 R_sun. Based
on the separation of the double emission peaks, we calculate an outer disk
radius of R_out/a ~0.61, close to the distance of the inner Lagrangian point
L_1/a~0.63. Therefore we suggest that, at the time of observations, the
accretion disk was filling the Roche-Lobe of the primary, and that the matter
leaving the L_1 point was colliding with the disc directly, producing the hot
spot at this location.

X-ray emission depend on cometary, observational and solar wind
characteristics. It is further demonstrated that cometary X-ray spectra mainly
reflect the state of the local solar wind. The current sample of Chandra
observations was fit using the constrains of the charge exchange model, and
relative solar wind abundances were derived from the X-ray spectra. Our
analysis showed that spectral differences can be ascribed to different solar
wind states, as such identifying comets interacting with (I) fast, cold wind,
(II), slow, warm wind and (III) disturbed, fast, hot winds associated with
interplanetary coronal mass ejections. We furthermore predict the existence of
a fourth spectral class, associated with the cool, fast high latitude wind.

Solar System formation considered a supernova shock that triggered the collapse
of the Sun's nascent molecular cloud. We advocate an alternative hypothesis,
that the Solar System's protoplanetary disk had already formed when a very
close (< 1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk.
We conduct the first numerical simulations designed to answer two questions
related to this hypothesis: will the disk be destroyed by such a close
supernova; and will any of the ejecta be mixed into the disk? Our simulations
demonstrate that the disk does not absorb enough momentum from the shock to
escape the protostar to which it is bound. Only low amounts (< 1%) of mass loss
occur, due to stripping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across the top of the
disk, which also mix into the disk about 1% of the intercepted ejecta. These
low efficiencies of destruction and injectation are due to the fact that the
high disk pressures prevent the ejecta from penetrating far into the disk
before stalling. Injection of gas-phase ejecta is too inefficient to be
consistent with the abundances of radionuclides inferred from meteorites. On
the other hand, the radionuclides found in meteorites would have condensed into
dust grains in the supernova ejecta, and we argue that such grains will be
injected directly into the disk with nearly 100% efficiency. The meteoritic
abundances of the short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe therefore are
consistent with injection of grains condensed from the ejecta of a nearby (< 1
pc) supernova, into an already-formed protoplanetary disk.

applying peculiar velocity corrections to the local SNe using three different
flow models. The models are based on the IRAS PSCz galaxy redshift survey, have
varying beta = Omega_m^0.6/b, and reproduce the Local Group motion in the CMB

Delta Omega_Lambda = -0.04 and for Omega_m, the potential error is Delta

is different for each spin subspace, with the critical value decreasing with
increasing spin. As a consequence, with the lowering of temperature, there can
occur a transition from a Wigner crystal charge-ordered state to a spin-Peierls
state that is a Bond-Charge-Density Wave with charge occupancies different from
the Wigner crystal. This transition is possible because spin excitations from
the spin-Peierls state in the 1/4-filled band are necessarily accompanied by
changes in site charge densities. We apply our theory to the 1/4-filled band
quasi-one-dimensional organic charge-transfer solids in general and to 2:1

Galactic Nuclei (AGN) sample obtained from the first epoch data of the
VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS). The sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line AGN
with redshift up to z=5 and 17.5< I <24.0, selected on the basis of their
spectra. In this paper we present the measurement of the Optical Luminosity
Function up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results with
previous results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. Our
data, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow us
to constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. By
combining our faint VVDS sample with the large sample of bright AGN extracted
from the SDSS DR3 (Richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of different
evolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents the
combined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, is
a luminosity dependent density evolution (LDDE) model, similar to those derived
from the major X-surveys. Such a parameterization allows the redshift of the
AGN space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains the
excess of faint AGN that we find at 1.0< z <1.5. On the basis of this model we
find, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, that
the peak of the AGN space density shifts significantly towards lower redshift
going to lower luminosity objects. This result, already found in a number of
X-ray selected samples of AGN, is consistent with a scenario of ""AGN cosmic
downsizing"", in which the density of more luminous AGN, possibly associated to
more massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the Universe, than
that of low luminosity ones.

cluster light within one quarter of the virial radius in r and 4 to 21% in the

corrected to the present epoch. In several clusters we also detect ICL in group
environments near the cluster center and up to ~1 h^{-1} Mpc distant from the

incomplete in that it does not include high redshift clusters with low density,
low flux, or low mass, and it does not include low redshift clusters with high
flux, mass, or density. This bias makes it difficult to interpret correlations
between ICL flux and cluster properties. Despite this selection bias, we do
find that the presence of a cD galaxy corresponds to both centrally
concentrated galaxy profiles and centrally concentrated ICL profiles. This is
consistent with ICL either forming from galaxy interactions at the center, or
forming at earlier times in groups and later combining in the center.

of downstream targets in a network. Here, we develop an analytic framework to
investigate the phenomenon of noise correlation in molecular networks.
Specifically, we focus on the metabolic network, which is highly inter-linked,

analogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of the
exactly soluable linear queueing network or, alternatively, a mass transfer
system, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in the
abundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolic
network. For all but one case examined, we find the steady-state fluctuation in
different nodes of the pathways to be effectively uncorrelated. Consequently,
fluctuations in enzyme levels only affect local properties and do not propagate
elsewhere into metabolic networks, and intermediate metabolites can be freely
shared by different reactions. Our approach may be applicable to study
metabolic networks with more complex topologies, or protein signaling networks
which are governed by similar biochemical reactions. Possible implications for

effects of dynamical environment on planet formation and evolution.
  Aims. Considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellar
metallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster NGC 6791 and searched
for close-in planets using the transit technique.
  Methods. A ten-night observational campaign was performed using the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (3.6m), the San Pedro M\'artir telescope (2.1m),
and the Loiano telescope (1.5m). To increase the transit detection probability
we also made use of the Bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observational
campaign. Adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetary
transits was achieved.
  Results. Should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in NGC 6791
be similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailed
simulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. Instead, we do not
confirm the transit candidates proposed by Bruntt et al. (2003). The
probability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence is
estimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster.
  Conclusions. Possible explanations of the null-detection of transits include:
(i) a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters; (ii) a smaller
planetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars; or (iii)
limitations in the basic assumptions. More extensive photometry with 3-4m class
telescopes is required to allow conclusive inferences about the frequency of
planets in NGC 6791.

maximum allowed for a population-II stellar population having a Salpeter mass
function. In this paper we study characteristics of the sources powering Lya
emission in high redshift galaxies. We propose a simple model for Lya emitters
in which galaxies undergo a burst of very massive star formation that results
in a large intrinsic EW, followed by a phase of population-II star formation
with a lower EW. We confront this model with a range of high redshift
observations and find that the model is able to simultaneously describe the
following eight properties of the high redshift galaxy population with
plausible values for parameters like the efficiency and duration of star
formation: i-iv) the UV and Lya luminosity functions of LAEs at z=5.7 and 6.5,
v-vi) the mean and variance of the EW distribution of Lya selected galaxies at
z=5.7, vii) the EW distribution of i-drop galaxies at z~6, and viii) the
observed correlation of stellar age with EW. Our modeling suggests that the
observed anomalously large intrinsic equivalent widths require a burst of very
massive star formation lasting no more than a few to ten percent of the
galaxies star forming lifetime. This very massive star formation may indicate
the presence of population-III star formation in a few per cent of i-drop
galaxies, and in about half of the Lya selected galaxies.

magnetized fluid is the main subject of this work. The ideal constant
$\Gamma$-law equation of state, commonly adopted in a wide range of
astrophysical applications, is compared with a more realistic equation of state
that better approximates the single-specie relativistic gas. The paper focus on
three different topics. First, the influence of a more realistic equation of
state on the propagation of fast magneto-sonic shocks is investigated. This
calls into question the validity of the constant $\Gamma$-law equation of state
in problems where the temperature of the gas substantially changes across
hydromagnetic waves. Second, we present a new inversion scheme to recover
primitive variables (such as rest-mass density and pressure) from conservative
ones that allows for a general equation of state and avoids catastrophic
numerical cancellations in the non-relativistic and ultrarelativistic limits.
Finally, selected numerical tests of astrophysical relevance (including
magnetized accretion flows around Kerr black holes) are compared using
different equations of state. Our main conclusion is that the choice of a
realistic equation of state can considerably bear upon the solution when
transitions from cold to hot gas (or viceversa) are present. Under these
circumstances, a polytropic equation of state can significantly endanger the
solution.

current in such a thin film device often decays drastically. The present paper
is focused on understanding this problem. A systematic, multiphysics based
modelling approach is proposed. First, a nucleation coupled model for
degradation of the CNT thin film is derived, where the CNTs are assumed to
decay by fragmentation and formation of clusters. The random orientation of the
CNTs and the electromechanical interaction are then modeled to explain the
self-assembly. The degraded state of the CNTs and the electromechanical force
are employed to update the orientation of the CNTs. Field emission current at
the device scale is finally obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation and
integration over the computational cell surfaces on the anode side. The
simulated results are in close agreement with the experimental results. Based
on the developed model, numerical simulations aimed at understanding the
effects of various geometric parameters and their statistical features on the
device current history are reported.

thin inner disc surrounded by an optically thick outer disc) suggest that
significant disc evolution has occured in these systems. We explore the nature
of these systems by examining their demographics, specifically their stellar
accretion rates (Mdot) and disc masses (Mdisc) compared to those of accreting T
Tauri stars of comparable age. We find that transition objects in Taurus occupy
a restricted region of the Mdot vs. Mdisc plane. Compared to non-transition
single stars in Taurus, they have stellar accretion rates that are typically
~10 times lower at the same disc mass and median disc masses ~4 times larger.
These properties are anticipated by several proposed planet formation theories
and suggest that the formation of Jovian mass planets may play a significant
role in explaining the origin of at least some transition objects. Considering
transition objects as a distinct demographic group among accreting T Tauri
stars leads to a tighter relationship between disc masses and stellar accretion
rates, with a slope between the two quantities that is close to the value of
unity expected in simple theories of disc accretion.

stellar emission and dust re-processing of starlight. Where the energy density
of the ISRF is high (e.g., the Galactic Centre), the dominant gamma-ray
emission in individual supernova remnants (SNRs), such as G0.9+0.1, may come
from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of the ISRF. Several models of the ISRF
exist. The most recent one, which has been calculated by us, predicts a
significantly higher ISRF than the well-used model of Mathis, Mezger, and
Panagia. However,comparison with data is limited to local observations. Based
on our current estimate of the ISRF we predict the gamma-ray emission in the
SNRs G0.9+0.1 and RXJ1713, and pair-production absorption features above 20 TeV
in the spectra of G0.9+0.1, J1713-381, and J1634-472. We discuss how GLAST,
along with current and future very high energy instruments, may be able to
provide upper bounds on the large-scale ISRF.

The power law spectrum of protons extends up to the energy $3\times 10^{15}$ eV

observed knee in the Galactic CR spectrum. The maximum energy of the
accelerated nuclei is proportional to their charge number $Z$. Therefore the
break in the Galactic CR spectrum is the result of the contribution of
progressively heavier species in the overall CR spectrum so that at $10^{17}$

includes 150 sources. In this paper, the third of the series, we report the
results of a dedicated optical spectroscopy campaign that, together with
results from other independent optical follow up programs, led to the
spectroscopic identification of all sources in the sample. We carried out a
systematic spectroscopic campaign for the observation of all unidentified
objects of the sample using the ESO 3.6m, the KPNO 4m, and the TNG optical
telescopes. We present new identifications and optical spectra for 76 sources,
50 of which are new BL Lac objects, 18 are sources previously referred as BL
Lacs but for which no redshift information was available, and 8 are broad
emission lines AGNs. We find that the multi-frequency selection technique used
to build the survey is highly efficient (about 90%) in selecting BL Lacs
objects. We present positional and spectroscopic information for all confirmed
BL Lac objects. Our data allowed us to determined 36 redshifts out of the 50
new BL Lacs and 5 new redshifts for the previously known objects. The redshift
distribution of the complete sample is presented and compared with that of
other BL Lacs samples. For 26 sources without recognizable absorption features,
we calculated lower limits to the redshift using a method based on simulated
optical spectra with different ratios between jet and galaxy emission. For a
subsample of 38 object with high-quality spectra, we find a correlation between
the optical spectral slope, the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity, and the Ca H&K break
value, indicating that for powerful/beamed sources the optical light is
dominated by the non-thermal emission from the jet.

unambiguously resolved by working from the energy balance equation and taking
advantage of the Rayleigh's variational method. The efficiency of this method
is demonstrated by solid globe models of nuclear physics and pulsar

Fermi-solid with homogeneous and non-homogeneous profiles of the bulk density,
the shear modulus, and the shear viscosity.

discovery of a kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in 1A 1246-588. The
kilohertz QPO was only detected when the source was in a soft high-flux state
reminiscent of the lower banana branch in atoll sources. Only one kilohertz QPO
peak is detected at a relatively high frequency of 1258+-2 Hz and at a single
trial significance of more than 7 sigma. Kilohertz QPOs with a higher frequency
have only been found on two occasions in 4U 0614+09. Furthermore, the frequency
is higher than that found for the lower kilohertz QPO in any source, strongly
suggesting that the QPO is the upper of the kilohertz QPO pair often found in
LMXBs. The full-width at half maximum is 25+-4 Hz, making the coherence the
highest found for an upper kilohertz QPO. From a distance estimate of ~6 kpc
from a radius expansion burst we derive that 1A 1246-588 is at a persistent
flux of ~0.2-0.3 per cent of the Eddington flux, hence 1A 1246-588 is one of
the weakest LMXBs for which a kilohertz QPO has been detected. The
root-mean-square (rms) amplitude in the 5-60 keV band is 27+-3 per cent, this
is the highest for any kilohertz QPO source so far, in line with the general
anti-correlation between source luminosity and rms amplitude of the kilohertz
QPO peak identified before. Using the X-ray spectral information we produce a
colour-colour diagram. The source behaviour in this diagram provides further
evidence for the atoll nature of the source.

basic properties of entropy or mutual information, up to now Shannon's entropy
power inequality (EPI) is an exception: Existing information theoretic proofs
of the EPI hinge on representations of differential entropy using either Fisher
information or minimum mean-square error (MMSE), which are derived from de
Bruijn's identity. In this paper, we first present an unified view of these
proofs, showing that they share two essential ingredients: 1) a data processing
argument applied to a covariance-preserving linear transformation; 2) an
integration over a path of a continuous Gaussian perturbation. Using these
ingredients, we develop a new and brief proof of the EPI through a mutual
information inequality, which replaces Stam and Blachman's Fisher information
inequality (FII) and an inequality for MMSE by Guo, Shamai and Verd\'u used in
earlier proofs. The result has the advantage of being very simple in that it
relies only on the basic properties of mutual information. These ideas are then
generalized to various extended versions of the EPI: Zamir and Feder's
generalized EPI for linear transformations of the random variables, Takano and
Johnson's EPI for dependent variables, Liu and Viswanath's

There is good evidence that the growth of these galaxies does continue longer
in the field than in clusters, via (nearly) dissipationless mergers of already
old galaxies. These results are consistent with predictions of recent galaxy

the most massive halos. Systematic studies of the relation of galaxies with

do this, we study the mid-IR contribution of PAH emission, continuum, and
extinction. About 3/4 of our sample are continuum- (i.e. AGN) dominated
sources, but ~60% of these show PAH emission, suggesting the presence of
star-formation activity. These sources have redder mid-IR colors than typical
optically-selected quasars. About 25% of our sample have strong PAH emission,
but none are likely to be pure starbursts as reflected in their relatively high
5um hot dust continua. However, their steep 30um-to-14um slopes suggest that
star-formation might dominate the total infrared luminosity. Six of our z~2
sources have EW6.2>~0.3um and L_14um>~10^12Lsun (implying L_IR>~10^13Lsun). At

with local IRAS-selected ULIRGs, but differs from early results on
SCUBA-selected z~2 ULIRGs. Similar to local ULIRGs about 25% of our sample show
extreme obscuration (tau_9.7>~3) suggesting buried nuclei. In general, we find
that our sources are similar to local ULIRGs, but are an order of magnitude
more luminous. It is not clear whether our z~2 ULIRGs are simply scaled-up

the virial velocity of the halo: \sigma_{sat}/V_{vir}=0.9 +/- 0.2. Applied to
the Milky Way and M31 this gives V_{vir}^{MW}=109 +/- 22$ km/s and

halo of the simulated galaxies is kinematically and spatially distinct from the

depends on mass and on time of accretion; surviving satellites are biased
toward low-mass systems that have been recently accreted by the galaxy. Our
results support recent proposals for the origin of the systematic differences
between stars in the Galactic halo and in Galactic satellites: the elusive
``building blocks'' of the Milky Way stellar halo were on average more massive,

two-dimensional velocity distributions in the UV, UW, and VW planes are
analyzed. The evolution of the main peaks in the velocity distributions can be
followed to an average age of approximately 9 Gyr. We find that: (1) in the
distributions of the UV velocity components, stars of different types are
concentrated toward several stable peaks (the Hyades, Pleiades, and Sirius
Cluster), suggesting that the stars belonging to these formations did not form
simultaneously; (2) the peak associated with the Hyades Cluster dominates in
all age intervals; and (3) the Hyades peak is strongest for stars with an
average age of 1.5 Gyr, suggesting that this peak contains a considerable
fraction of stars from the Hyades cluster. The age dependences of the kinematic

galaxy formation, we speculate that this three-body ejection mechanism may be
the origin of (i) some of the newly discovered high-speed satellites around M31
(such as Andromeda XIV); (ii) some of the distant fast-receding Local Group
members, such as Leo I; and (iii) the oddly isolated dwarf spheroidals Cetus
and Tucana in the outskirts of the Local Group. Our results suggest that care
must be exercised when using the orbits of the most weakly bound satellites to
place constraints on the total mass of the Local Group.

magnetic moments $\mu_{\Lambda\Sigma}$ and $\mu_{N\Delta}$ are well reproduced

recently. The results explains consistently the recent findings of a new $N^*$
resonance from the GRAAL and Tohoku LNS group. We also obtain the transition
axial-vector constants for the $\Theta^+\to KN$ from which the decay width of
the $\Theta^{+}$ pentaquark baryon is determined as a function of the
pion-nucleon sigma term $\Sigma_{\pi N}$. We investigate the dependence of the
decay width of the $\Theta^{+}$ on the $g_{A}^{(0)}$, with the $g_{A}^{(0)}$
varied within the range of the experimental uncertainty. We show that a small
decay width of the $\Theta^{+}\to KN$, i.e. $\Gamma_{\Theta KN} \leq 1$ MeV, is
compatible with the values of all known semileptonic decays with the generally
accepted value of $g_{A}^{(0)} \approx 0.3$ for the proton.

spectroscopy and photometry were carried out to determine the properties of

HS1857+5144 display a sinusoidal variation with a period of Porb=383.52 min and
peak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.7 mag and 1.1 mag in the B-band and R-band,
respectively. The large amplitude of the brightness variation results from a
reflection effect on the heated inner hemisphere of the companion star,
suggesting a very high temperature of the white dwarf. Our radial velocity
study confirms the photometric period as the orbital period of the system. A
model atmosphere fit to the spectrum of the white dwarf obtained at minimum
light provides limits to its mass and temperature of Mwd=~0.6-1.0 Msun and
Twd=~70000-100000 K, respectively. The detection of HeII 4686 absorption
classifies the primary star of HS1857+5144 as a DAO white dwarf. Combining the
results from our spectroscopy and photometry, we estimate the mass of the
companion star and the binary inclination to be Msec=~0.15-0.30 Msun and
i=~45-55 deg, respectively. We classify HS1857+5144 as one of the youngest
pre-CV known to date. The cooling age of the white dwarf suggests that the
present system has just emerged from a common envelope phase ~10^5 yr ago.
HS1857+5144 will start mass transfer within or below the 2-3h period gap.

routing problem in networks with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. To
attain this, first we translate the network adapting it to a weighted graph
(unicast) or and-or graph (multicast), where the weight on a connector
corresponds to the multidimensional cost of sending a packet on the related
network link: each component of the weights vector represents a different QoS
metric value (e.g. bandwidth, cost, delay, packet loss). The second step
consists in writing this graph as a program in Soft Constraint Logic
Programming (SCLP): the engine of this framework is then able to find the best
paths/trees by optimizing their costs and solving the constraints imposed on
them (e.g. delay < 40msec), thus finding a solution to QoS routing problems.
Moreover, c-semiring structures are a convenient tool to model QoS metrics. At
last, we provide an implementation of the framework over scale-free networks
and we suggest how the performance can be improved.

that the phase of the de Broglie waves further extended for stationary
particles is a relativistic invariant being the same for all corresponding
observers. Also the phase of the electromagnetic waves transporting energy at
light speed is a relativistic invariant. Therefore the universe and its matter
