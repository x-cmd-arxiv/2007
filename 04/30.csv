convergence, in a statistical sense, of the inertial range dynamics in
simulations on grids larger than 512^3 points. The simulations allowed us to
measure the absolute velocity scaling exponents for the first time. The
inertial range velocity scaling in this strongly compressible regime deviates
substantially from the incompressible Kolmogorov laws. The slope of the
velocity power spectrum, for instance, is -1.95 compared to -5/3 in the
incompressible case. The exponent of the third-order velocity structure
function is 1.28, while in incompressible turbulence it is known to be unity.
We propose a natural extension of Kolmogorov's phenomenology that takes into
account compressibility by mixing the velocity and density statistics and
preserves the Kolmogorov scaling of the power spectrum and structure functions
of the density-weighted velocity v=\rho^{1/3}u. The low-order statistics of v
appear to be invariant with respect to changes in the Mach number. For
instance, at Mach 6 the slope of the power spectrum of v is -1.69, and the
exponent of the third-order structure function of v is unity. We also directly
measure the mass dimension of the ""fractal"" density distribution in the
inertial subrange, D_m = 2.4, which is similar to the observed fractal
dimension of molecular clouds and agrees well with the cascade phenomenology.

regions due to the balance between Coulomb interaction $U_{\rm ee}$ and
phonon-mediated attraction $U_{\rm ph}$. For $U_{\rm ee}>U_{\rm ph}$, we
observe the standard Kondo effect concerning spin degree of freedom. Since the
Coulomb interaction is effectively reduced as $U_{\rm ee}-U_{\rm ph}$, the
Kondo temperature $T_{\rm K}$ is increased when $U_{\rm ph}$ is increased. On
the other hand, for $U_{\rm ee}<U_{\rm ph}$, there occurs the Kondo effect
concerning charge degree of freedom, since vacant and double occupied states
play roles of pseudo-spins. Note that in this case, $T_{\rm K}$ is decreased
with the increase of $U_{\rm ph}$. Namely, $T_{\rm K}$ should be maximized for
$U_{\rm ee} \approx U_{\rm ph}$. Then, we analyze in detail the Kondo behavior
at $U_{\rm ee}=U_{\rm ph}$, which is found to be explained by the polaron
Anderson model with reduced hybridization of polaron and residual repulsive
interaction among polarons. By comparing the NRG results of the polaron
Anderson model with those of the original Anderson-Holstein model, we clarify
the Kondo behavior in the competing region of $U_{\rm ee} \approx U_{\rm ph}$.

been shown to exist between the transmit power and the output

shown that, for this family of receivers, when users seek to selfishly maximize

a unified power control (UPC) algorithm for reaching the Nash equilibrium is

computing the large-system multiuser efficiency, which is independent of

for the matched filter, the decorrelator, and the MMSE receiver, and is
demonstrated by means of simulation for an optimal detector. Moreover, the

finite bias, shot noise at zero field exhibits an asymmetry related to the 0.7
structure in conductance. The asymmetry in noise evolves smoothly into the
symmetric signature of spin-resolved electron transmission at high field.
Comparison to a phenomenological model with density-dependent level splitting
yields quantitative agreement. Additionally, a device-specific contribution to
the finite-bias noise, particularly visible on conductance plateaus (where shot
noise vanishes), agrees quantitatively with a model of bias-dependent electron
heating.

absorption of the intrinsic gamma-ray spectrum. TeV observations of the distant
blazar 1ES 1101-232 were thus recently used to put an upper limit on the
infrared extragalactic background light density. The created pairs can
upscatter background photons to high energies, which in turn may pair produce,
thereby initiating a cascade. The pairs diffuse on the extragalactic magnetic
field (EMF) and cascade emission has been suggested as a means for measuring
its intensity. Limits on the IR background and EMF are reconsidered taking into
account cascade emissions. The cascade equations are solved numerically.
Assuming a power-law intrinsic spectrum, the observed 100 MeV - 100 TeV
spectrum is found as a function of the intrinsic spectral index and the
intensity of the EMF. Cascades emit mainly at or below 100 GeV. The observed
TeV spectrum appears softer than for pure absorption when cascade emission is
taken into account. The upper limit on the IR photon background is found to be
robust. Inversely, the intrinsic spectra needed to fit the TeV data are
uncomfortably hard when cascade emission makes a significant contribution to
the observed spectrum. An EMF intensity around 1e-8 nG leads to a
characteristic spectral hump in the GLAST band. Higher EMF intensities divert
the pairs away from the line-of-sight and the cascade contribution to the

object appears in three-dimensional space. From an observational point of view
this may give us a misleading picture. The faint stars may be the most common
stars in the system but the morphological information obtained by observations
of an object may be dominated by the color properties of the bright stars. Due
to dynamical effects, such as energy equipartition, different masses of stars
may populate different regions in the object. Since stars are evolving in mass
the stellar evolution may also influence the dynamics of the system. Hence, if
one is interested in simulating what the morphology will look like through a
telescope, one needs to simulate in addition evolving stars and weight them by
their luminosity. Therefore we need to combine simulations of the dynamical
evolution and a stellar population synthesis at the same time. For the
dynamical evolution part we use a parallel version of a direct N-body code,
NBODY6++. This code also includes stellar evolution. We link the parameters
from this stellar evolution routine to the BaSeL 2.0 stellar library. For
isolated clusters we found results assimilable to standard stellar population
synthesis codes such as the PEGASE code. For clusters in a tidal field we found
that the integrated colors become relatively bluer due to energy equipartition
effects. In the time shortly before dissolution of the cluster the stellar M/L
ratio becomes lower compared to isolated clusters. We compared the results of
our simulations to integrated spectra of galactic globular clusters. For the
cluster NGC 1851 we found good agreement between simulation and observation.
For extragalactic clusters in M81 and M31 we looked at medium band spectral
energy distributions and found for some clusters also a good agreement.

flows with a constant shearing rate and with gravity-induced stratification.
The general set of linearized equations is derived and the two-dimensional case
is considered in detail. The Boussinesq approximation is used in order to
examine relatively small-scale perturbations of low-frequency modes:
Gravito-Alfven waves (GAW) and Entropy Mode (EM) perturbations. It is shown
that for flows with arbitrary shearing rate there exists a finite time interval
of non-adiabatic evolution of the perturbations. The non-adiabatic behavior
manifests itself in a twofold way, viz. by the over-reflection of the GAWs and
by the generation of GAWs from EM perturbations. It is shown that these
phenomena act as efficient transformers of the equilibrium flow energy into the
energy of the perturbations for moderate and high shearing rate solar plasma
flows. Efficient generation of GAW by EM takes place for shearing rates about
an order of magnitude smaller than necessary for development of a shear
instability. The latter fact could have important consequences for the problem
of angular momentum redistribution within the Sun and solar-type stars.

a rapid redistribution of e_g electron density, as a function of T, between the

gravitational forces. The shape of an unperturbed gaseous disk can be used to
constrain dark matter models. Aims. We derive the 3-D HI volume density
distribution for the Milky Way out to a galactocentric radius of 40 kpc and a
height of 20 kpc to constrain the Galactic mass distribution. Methods. We used
the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn all sky 21-cm line survey. The transformation from
brightness temperatures to densities depends on the rotation curve. We explored
several models, reflecting different dark matter distributions. Each of these
models was set up to solve the combined Poisson-Boltzmann equation in a
self-consistent way and optimized to reproduce the observed flaring. Results.
Besides a massive extended halo of M ~ 1.8 10^{12} Msun, we find a
self-gravitating dark matter disk with M=2 to 3 10^{11} Msun, including a dark
matter ring at 13 < R < 18.5 kpc with M = 2.2 to 2.8 10^{10} Msun. The
existence of the ring was previously postulated from EGRET data and coincides
with a giant stellar structure that surrounds the Galaxy. The resulting Milky
Way rotation curve is flat up to R~27 kpc and slowly decreases outwards. The
\hi gas layer is strongly flaring. The HWHM scale height is 60 pc at R = 4 kpc
and increases to ~2700$ pc at R=40 kpc. Spiral arms cause a noticeable imprint
on the gravitational field, at least out to R = 30 kpc. Conclusions. Our mass
model supports previous proposals that the giant stellar ring structure is due
to a merging dwarf galaxy. The fact that the majority of the dark matter in the
Milky Way for $R \la 40$ kpc can be successfully modeled by a self-gravitating
isothermal disk raises the question of whether this massive disk may have been
caused by similar merger events in the past.

measured close to the endpoint of molecular tritium beta decay. The endpoint,
together with the neutrino mass, should be fitted from the KATRIN data as a
free parameter. The right-handed couplings change the electron energy spectrum
close to the endpoint, therefore they have some effect also to the precise
neutrino mass determination. The statistical calculations show that, using the
endpoint as a free parameter, the unaccounted right-handed couplings
constrained by many beta decay experiments can change the fitted neutrino mass
value, relative to the true neutrino mass, by not larger than about 5-10 %.

of the neutrino mass can be much larger, order of 100 %, and for some cases it
can happen that for large true neutrino mass value the fitted neutrino mass
squared is negative. Publications using fixed endpoint and presenting large

\lambda-calculus and the modal \lambda-calculus. This makes it a highly
expressive temporal logic that is capable of expressing various interesting
correctness properties of programs that are not expressible in the modal
\lambda-calculus.
  This paper provides complexity results for its model checking problem. In
particular we consider those fragments of HFL built by using only types of
bounded order k and arity m. We establish k-fold exponential time completeness
for model checking each such fragment. For the upper bound we use fixpoint
elimination to obtain reachability games that are singly-exponential in the
size of the formula and k-fold exponential in the size of the underlying
transition system. These games can be solved in deterministic linear time. As a
simple consequence, we obtain an exponential time upper bound on the expression
complexity of each such fragment.
  The lower bound is established by a reduction from the word problem for
alternating (k-1)-fold exponential space bounded Turing Machines. Since there
are fixed machines of that type whose word problems are already hard with
respect to k-fold exponential time, we obtain, as a corollary, k-fold
exponential time completeness for the data complexity of our fragments of HFL,
provided m exceeds 3. This also yields a hierarchy result in expressive power.

form of the Coulomb logarithm. The latter converges on small scales, because
encounters of the test and field stars with impact parameters less than the
size of the massive perturber become inefficient. We confirm this way earlier

similar, and possibly related, bimodal partition as for current accretion
activity relative to the past. To this aim we use an updated semianalytic
model; based on Monte Carlo simulations, this follows with a large statistics
the galaxy assemblage, the star generations and the black hole accretions in
the cosmological framework over the redshift span from z=10 to z=0. We test our
simulations for yielding in close detail the observed split of galaxies into a
red, early and a blue, late population. We find that the black hole accretion
activities likewise give rise to two source populations: early, bright quasars
and later, dimmer AGNs. We predict for their Eddington parameter $\lambda_E$ --
the ratio of the current to the past black hole accretions -- a bimodal
distribution; the two branches sit now under $\lambda_E \approx 0.01$ (mainly
contributed by low-luminosity AGNs) and around $\lambda_E \approx 0.3-1$. These
not only mark out the two populations of AGNs, but also will turn out to
correlate strongly with the red or blue color of their host galaxies.

entangled and can be applied to different partitions of the $N$-partite system.
We provide examples that show the ability of this criterion to detect
entanglement. We show that this criterion can detect bound entangled states. We
prove a sufficiency condition for separability of a 3-partite state,
straightforwardly generalizable to the case $N > 3,$ under certain condition.
We also give a necessary and sufficient condition for separability of a class

signals from the annihilation of supersymmetric dark matter in the spectra of
cosmic rays.
  Measurements of cosmic ray antiparticles, such as positrons, can impose
strong constraints on the nature of new physics beyond the Standard Model.
However, cosmic ray positron measurements are experimentally very challenging
due to the vast proton background. A novel approach of positron identification
with the space-borne AMS-01 experiment, namely through the detection of
bremsstrahlung conversion in a silicon microstrip detector, is introduced.
Bremsstrahlung from protons is suppressed by a factor of more than 3*10^6 with
respect to positrons. The results of the positron measurement show that the
bremsstrahlung approach extends the sensitivity range of AMS-01 to positron
momenta up to 50 GeV/c, which is far beyond the original scope of the
experiment. At momenta above 8 GeV/c there is indication for a positron
overabundance with respect to model predictions for purely secondary positron
production. Therefore, the AMS-01 data lend further weight to the hints of a
positron overabundance seen in the data from earlier experiments.
  The positron fraction measurements from the most recent experiments are
combined with the results of this analysis, giving the most precise positron
fraction data yet available.

some collective effects, we derive a kinetic equation satisfied by the smooth
vorticity field which is valid at order $O(1/N)$. This equation was obtained
previously [P.H. Chavanis, Phys. Rev. E, 64, 026309 (2001)] from a more
abstract projection operator formalism. If we consider axisymmetric flows and
make a markovian approximation, we obtain a simpler kinetic equation which can
be studied in great detail. We discuss the properties of these kinetic
equations in regard to the $H$-theorem and the convergence (or not) towards the
statistical equilibrium state. We also study the growth of correlations by
explicitly calculating the time evolution of the two-body correlation function
in the linear regime. In a second part of the paper, we consider the relaxation
of a test vortex in a bath of field vortices and obtain the Fokker-Planck
equation by directly calculating the second (diffusion) and first (drift)
moments of the increment of position of the test vortex. A specificity of our
approach is to obtain general equations, with a clear physical meaning, that
are valid for flows that are not necessarily axisymmetric and that take into

  Kerr-(anti-)de Sitter black holes","9 pages, 4 figures, accepted for Class. Quant. Grav","Class.Quant.Grav.24:2637-2644,2007","10.1088/0264-9381/24/10/009",,"gr-qc astro-ph",,"  It has been recently demonstrated that the orbital velocity profile around
Kerr black holes in the equatorial plane as observed in the locally
non-rotating frame exhibits a non-monotonic radial behaviour. We show here that
this unexpected minimum-maximum feature of the orbital velocity remains if the
Kerr vacuum is generalized to the Kerr-de Sitter or Kerr-anti-de Sitter metric.
This is a new general relativity effect in Kerr spacetimes with non-vanishing
cosmological constant. Assuming that the profile of the orbital velocity is
known, this effect constrains the spacetime parameters.
