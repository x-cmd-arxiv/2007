disk in the pulsar's electrosphere is diocotron unstable in the
non-relativistic regime. In this paper, we extend these results and study the
relativistic and electromagnetic stabilisation effects by including the
magnetic field perturbation and allow for relativistic speeds of the guiding
centre, in a self-consistent manner. We use the electric drift approximation,
valid for low-density plasmas.
  We linearise the coupled relativistic cold-fluid and Maxwell equations in the
electric drift approximation. The non-linear eigenvalue problem for the
perturbed azimuthal electric field is solved numerically with standard technics
for boundary value problems like the shooting method. The spectrum of the
relativistic diocotron instability in a non-neutral plasma column confined
between two cylindrically conducting walls is computed.
  For low-speed motions, we recover the eigenfunctions and eigenspectra of the
non-relativistic diocotron instability. Our algorithm is also checked in the
relativistic planar diode geometry for which an analytical expression of the
dispersion relation is known. As expected, when the relativistic and
electromagnetic effects become significant, the diocotron instability tends to
stabilise. In cylindrical geometry, for some special rotation profile, all
azimuthal modes $l$ are completely suppressed for sufficiently relativistic
flows. However, for the profile relevant to the electrosphere, depending on the
exact rotation curves, the growth rates can either significantly decrease till
they vanish or persist for moderate $l$.

performed dust radiative transfer modeling and compared the model results with
the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs), the radial profiles of the
total intensity image, and the fraction of linear polarization map. The total
intensity image shows a nearly spherical core with ~3"" radius, an S-shaped arm
extending ~10"" in the northwest to southeast direction, and an extended lobe
towards the southwest. The polarization map shows a centro-symmetric vector
alignment in almost the entire nebula and low polarizations along the S-shaped

transfer modeling, we estimated the stellar temperature, the bolometric

5.3x10^{-6} M_sun yr^{-1}, respectively. Taking into account previous

currently very lifely debate. Since a sophisticated matching algorithm is
applied here, exact ground states of large systems up to L^2=256^2 spins can be
generated. Furthermore, no equilibration or extrapolation to T=0 is necessary.
Three different +-J models are studied here: a) with open boundary conditions,
b) with fixed boundary conditions and c) a diluted system where a fraction
p=0.125 of all bonds is zero. For large systems, the droplet energy shows for
all three models a power-law behavior E_D L^\theta'_D with \theta'_D<0. This is
different from previous studies of domain walls, where a convergence to a
constant non-zero value (\theta_dw=0) has been found for such models. After
correcting for the non-compactness of the droplets, the results are likely to
be compatible with \theta_D= -0.29 for all three models.
  This is in accordance with the Gaussian system where \theta_D=-0.287(4)

correlation exponent \eta is determined here via the probability to have a

the narrow component of the Fe Kalpha line. The rxte PCA data are used to put
an upper limit on the broad line component and constrain the hard X-ray
continuum. A strong soft excess below 1 keV is observed in the time-averaged
HETG spectrum, which can be parameterized with a steep power law or a thermal
model. The flux variability at low energies indicates that the origin of the
soft excess cannot be entirely ascribed to the circumnuclear diffuse emission,
detected by chandra on scales of 20-30 arcsec (22-33 kpc). A narrow (sigma<90
eV) Fe Kalpha line (with EW< 100 eV) is observed by the chandra HEG. Similar
values for the line parameters are measured by the rxte PCA, suggesting that
the contribution from a broad line component is negligible. The fact that the
exposure is split into two observations taken three days apart allows us to
investigate the spectral and temporal evolution of the source on different
timescales. Significant flux variability associated with spectral changes is
observed on timescales of hours and days. The spectral variability is similar
to that observed in radio-quiet AGN ruling out a jet-dominated origin of the
X-rays.

Upsilon(1S)->ggg compared with nearby continuum (e+e- -> qqbar) indicating
greater (x2) per-event yields of baryons in 3-gluon fragmentation. We find
similar results when we extend that comparison to include the Upsilon(2S) and
Upsilon(3S) resonances. With higher statistics, we now also probe the momentum
dependence of these per-event particle yields. Next, we compare particle
production in the photon-tagged process Upsilon(1S)->gggamma with that in e+e-

particle-specific fragmentation. For each particle, we determine the
`enhancement' ratio, defined as the ratio of particle yields per gluon
fragmentation event compared to quark fragmentation event. Thus defined, an
enhancement of 1.0 implies equal per-event production in both gluon and quark
fragmentation. In the photon-tagged analysis (U(1S)->gggamma compared to e+e-
-> qqbar+gamma), we find almost no enhancement for protons (1.2+/-0.1), but a
significant enhancement (1.9+/-0.3) for /\'s. Overall, per-event baryon
production in radiative two-gluon fragmentation is somewhat smaller than that
observed in three-gluon decays of the Upsilon(1S). Our results for baryon
production are inconsistent with the predictions of the JETSET (7.3)

emission using the VLA and OVRO. The 87 GHz continuum emission reveals two
continuum peaks MM-1 and MM-2 along a molecular ridge. The dominant peak MM-1
coincides with a compact emission feature at 43 GHz, and arises mostly from the
dust emission. For dust emissivity index $\beta$ of 1.3, the masses in the dust
peaks amount to 70 \msun for MM-1, and 27 \msun for MM-2. Assuming internal
heating, the central luminosities of MM-1 and MM-2 are $6 \times 10^4$ and $8
\times 10^3$ \lsun, respectively.
  The SiO emission reveals a well collimated outflow emanating from MM-1. The
jet-like outflow is also detected in \nh3 at velocities similar to the SiO
emission. The outflow, with a mass of 27 \msun, causes significant heating in
the gas to temperatures of 70 K, much higher than the temperature of $\lsim 15$
K in the extended core. Compact ($< 3''$) and narrow line ($<1.5$ \kms-1) \nh3
(3,3) emission features are found associated with the outflow. They likely
arise from weak population inversion in \nh3 similar to the maser emission.

increases from 5.5 \kms-1 FHWM measured at 3$''$ resolution to 8.7 \kms-1\
measured at 1$''$ resolution. This linewidth is much larger than the FWHM of
$<$ 2 \kms-1 in the entire core, and does not appear to originate from the

is considered first. The broadcast service process is analyzed assuming a
channel that allows for packet capture and multipacket reception. In this small
network, the stability and throughput regions are observed to coincide. The
same problem for a network with N sources and M destinations is considered
next. The channel model is simplified in that multipacket reception is no

concept of stability rank and the throughput region of the system is compared
to the bounds. Our results show that as the number of destination nodes
increases, the stability and throughput regions diminish. Additionally, a
previous conjecture that the stability and throughput regions coincide for a

of the optical emission associated with the supernova remnant 3C 58 (Fesen et
al. 2007) as they relate to the topic of pre-SN mass loss. Spectroscopically
measured radial velocities of ~450 emission knots within the remnant show two
distinct kinematic populations of optical knots: a high-velocity group with
radial velocities in the range of 700 - 1100 km/s and a lower velocity group
exhibiting radial expansion velocities below ~250 km/s. We interpret the
high-velocity knots as ejecta from the SN explosion and the low-velocity knots
as shocked circumstellar material likely resulting from pre-SN mass loss. The
chemical signatures of the two populations also show marked differences. The
high velocity group includes a substantial number of knots with notably higher
[N II]/H-alpha ratios not seen in the lower velocity population, suggesting
greater nitrogen enrichment in the SN ejecta than in the CSM. These results are
compared with evidence for pre-SN mass loss in the Crab Nebula, perhaps the SNR
most similar to 3C 58. These SNRs may comprise two case studies of pre-SN mass
loss in relatively low mass (~8 - 10 solar masses) core-collapse SN

cluster and a massive black hole. The gravitational field of the system is
dominated by the black hole in its sphere of influence. It is further modified
by the cluster mean field (a spherical term) and a gaseous disc/torus (an
axially symmetric term) causing a secular evolution of stellar orbits via Kozai
oscillations. Intermittent phases of large eccentricity increase the chance
that stars become damaged inside the tidal radius of the central hole. Such
events can produce debris and lead to recurring episodes of enhanced accretion
activity. We introduce an effective loss cone and associate it with tidal
disruptions during the high-eccentricity phases of the Kozai cycle. By
numerical integration of the trajectories forming the boundary of the loss cone
we determine its shape and volume. We also include the effect of relativistic
advance of pericentre. The potential of the disc has the efffect of enlarging
the loss cone and, therefore, the predicted number of tidally disrupted stars
should grow by factor of ~10^2. On the other hand, the effect of the cluster
mean potential together with the relativistic pericentre advance act against
the eccentricity oscillations. In the end we expect the tidal disruption events
to be approximately ten times more frequent in comparison with the model in
which the three effects -- the cluster mean field, the relativistic pericentre
advance, and the Kozai mechanism -- are all ignored. The competition of
different influences suppresses the predicted star disruption rate as the black
hole mass increases. Hence, the process under consideration is more important
for intermediate-mass black holes, M_bh~10^4M_s.

true values, society has flexibility in the degree to which it chooses to
exploit these reserves, especially unconventional fossil fuels and those
located in extreme or pristine environments. If conventional oil production
peaks within the next few decades, it may have a large effect on future
atmospheric CO2 and climate change, depending upon subsequent energy choices.
Assuming that proven oil and gas reserves do not greatly exceed estimates of
the Energy Information Administration, and recent trends are toward lower
estimates, we show that it is feasible to keep atmospheric CO2 from exceeding
about 450 ppm by 2100, provided that emissions from coal, unconventional fossil
fuels, and land use are constrained. Coal-fired power plants without
sequestration must be phased out before mid-century to achieve this CO2 limit.
It is also important to ""stretch"" conventional oil reserves via energy
conservation and efficiency, thus averting strong pressures to extract liquid
fuels from coal or unconventional fossil fuels while clean technologies are
being developed for the era ""beyond fossil fuels"". We argue that a rising price
on carbon emissions is needed to discourage conversion of the vast fossil
resources into usable reserves, and to keep CO2 beneath the 450 ppm ceiling.

n-space where each edge is of one of three types: an edge with a fixed length
(bar) or an edge with an upper (cable) or lower (strut) bound on its length.
Roth and Whiteley, in their 1981 paper ""Tensegrity Frameworks"", showed that in
certain cases, the struts and cables can be replaced with bars when analyzing
the framework for infinitesimal rigidity. In that case we call the tensegrity
""bar equivalent"". In specific, they showed that if there exists a set of
positive weights, called a positive ""stress"", on the edges such that the
weighted sum of the edge vectors is zero at every vertex, then the tensegrity
is bar equivalent.
  In this paper we consider an extended version of the tensegrity framework in
which the vertex set is a (possibly infinite) set of points in Euclidean
n-space and the edgeset is a compact set of unordered pairs of vertices. These
are called ""continuous tensegrities"". We show that if a continuous tensegrity
has a strictly positive stress, it is bar equivalent and that it has a
semipositive stress if and only if it is partially bar equivalent. We also show
that if a tensegrity is minimally bar equivalent (it is bar equivalent but
removing any open set of edges makes it no longer so), then it has a strictly
positive stress.
  In particular, we examine the case where the vertices form a rectifiable
curve and the possible motions of the curve are limited to local isometries of
it. Our methods provide an attractive proof of the following result: There is
no locally arclength preserving motion of a circle that increases any antipodal
distance without decreasing some other one.

paper'' in which the sum of the input and the interference, or dirt, is
multiplied by a random variable that models resizing, known to the decoder but
not to the encoder. The achievable rate of Costa's dirty paper coding (DPC)
scheme is calculated and compared to the case of the decoder's also knowing the
dirt. In the ergodic case, the corresponding rate loss vanishes asymptotically
in the limits of both high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and is small at
all finite SNR for typical distributions like Rayleigh, Rician, and Nakagami.
In the quasi-static case, the DPC scheme is lossless at all SNR in terms of
outage probability. Quasi-static fading broadcast channels (BC) without
transmit channel state information (CSI) are investigated as an application of
the robustness properties. It is shown that the DPC scheme leads to an outage
achievable rate region that strictly dominates that of time division.

small, significant noise is associated with chemical reaction events. This
molecular noise can give rise to behavior that is very different from the
predictions of deterministic rate equation models. Unfortunately, there are few
analytic methods for examining the qualitative behavior of stochastic systems.
Here we describe such a method that extends deterministic analysis to include
leading-order corrections due to the molecular noise. The method allows the
steady-state behavior of the stochastic model to be easily computed,
facilitates the mapping of stability phase diagrams that include stochastic
effects and reveals how model parameters affect noise susceptibility, in a
manner not accessible to numerical simulation. By way of illustration we
consider two genetic circuits: a bistable positive-feedback loop and a
negative-feedback oscillator. We find in the positive feedback circuit that
translational activation leads to a far more stable system than transcriptional
control. Conversely, in a negative-feedback loop triggered by a
positive-feedback switch, the stochasticity of transcriptional control is
harnessed to generate reproducible oscillations.
