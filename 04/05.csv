Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) on board the {\em Chandra X-ray
Observatory}. Numerous absorption lines were detected in the HETGS spectrum.
The lines are associated with highly ionized Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe,
some of which have been seen in earlier HETGS observations. Surprisingly,
however, we discovered dramatic variability of the lines over the duration of
the present observation. For instance, the flux of the Ne X line at 12.14 \AA\
was about $5 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the early part of
the observation but became subsequently undetectable, with a 99% upper limit of
$0.06 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on the flux of the line. This
implies that the line weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescale
of hours. The overall X-ray flux of the source did also vary during the
observation but only by 20--30%. For Cyg X-1, the absorption lines are
generally attributed to the absorption of X-rays by ionized stellar wind in the
binary system. Therefore, they may provide valuable diagnostics on the physical
condition of the wind. We discuss the implications of the results.

the density of the ionized gas, in a sample of 41 Type 1 and Type 2 active

[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density
limit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths and
ignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have
lower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line
flux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that
differential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in

ratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities
associated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We
also find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended
and originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission from
low-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios from

leads to a universal scaling behavior for the dipole scattering amplitude. The
running coupling corrections calculated recently significantly change the shape
of the scaling function as compared to the fixed coupling case leading to a
considerable increase in the anomalous dimension and to a slow-down of the

due to an extra contribution to the evolution kernel, referred to as the
subtraction term, which arises when running coupling corrections are included.
These subtraction terms were neglected in both recent calculations. We evaluate
numerically the subtraction terms for both calculations, and demonstrate that
when the subtraction terms are added back to the evolution kernels obtained in
the two works the resulting dipole amplitudes agree with each other! We then
use the complete running coupling kernel including the subtraction term to find
the numerical solution of the resulting full non-linear evolution equation with

properties have been obtained comparing the observations with self-consistent
disk models for the dust and CO emission. The circumstellar disk is resolved
both in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellar
material is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun. The disk
inclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a position
angle of 128+-4 deg. The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7
mm (beta=1) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane.
The dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200
AU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU. The comparison between dust and
CO temperature indicates that CO is present only in the disk interior. Finally,
we obtain an increasing depletion of CO isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O.
We argue that these results support the idea that the disk of HD 163296 is
strongly evolved. In particular, we suggest that there is a strong depletion of
dust relative to gas outside 200 AU; this may be due to the inward migration of
large bodies that form in the outer disk or to clearing of a large gap in the
dust distribution by a low mass companion.

arise from a change in the higgsino mass parameter mu, which enters both via
higher-order radiative corrections and via the kinematics of Higgs decays into
supersymmetric particles. While the variation of $\mu$ can shift the
prospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by
about Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable
with respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the

measure masses with an uncertainty of 0.02 M$_\odot$. The CSPN mass
distribution is sharply peaked at $0.61 \rm M_\odot$. The WD distribution peaks
at lower masses ($0.58 \rm M_\odot$) and shows a much broader range of masses.
Some of the difference can be explained if the early post-AGB evolution is
faster than predicted by the Bl\""ocker tracks. Between 30 and 50 per cent of WD
may avoid the PN phase because of too low mass. However, the discrepancy cannot
be fully resolved and WD mass distributions may have been broadened by
observational or model uncertainties.

electromigration driving force acts in the step up/down direction, and
step-edge diffusion is the dominant mass-transport mechanism, we find that
significant deviations from the usual $t^{1/4}$ scaling of the terrace-width
correlation function occurs for a critical time $\tau$ which is dependent upon
the three energy scales in the problem: $k_{B}T$, the step stiffness, $\gamma$,
and the bias associated with adatom hopping under the influence of an
electromigration force, $\pm \Delta U$. For ($t < \tau$), the correlation
function evolves as a superposition of $t^{1/4}$ and $t^{3/4}$ power laws. For
$t \ge \tau$ a closed form expression can be derived. This behavior is
confirmed by a Monte-Carlo simulation using a discrete model of the step
dynamics. It is proposed that the magnitude of the electromigration force
acting upon an atom at a step-edge can by estimated by a careful analysis of
the statistical properties of step-edge fluctuations on the appropriate

define three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity,

the WMAP and NVSS data are made with each of these morphological measures. The
most significant detection is obtained in the correlation of the
signed-intensity of local features at a significance of 99.9%. By inspecting

instrumental systematics in the WMAP data are ruled out as the source of all

ISW effect by probing the morphological nature of the correlation induced

detection of the ISW effect again provides direct and independent evidence for

goals: 1) detecting and characterizing low-mass planets increasingly similar to
the Earth, and 2) improving our understanding of planet formation. We present a
new planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towards
both of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that is
able to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planet
transits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the time
between transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to infer
the orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a mass
that is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection technique
complements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motion
resonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reduced
sensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded the
photometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTV
planet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number of
high-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existing
telescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transiting
planets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future.
A relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\sim 0.5

increase the effectiveness of transit timing observations.

directed multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.
It has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is
manifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that
circuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients
of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those
coefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral
dynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been
studied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.
The neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of
existing memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in
classical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has
been introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and
produces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even
be impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible
explanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain
has been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential
behavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance
to hemodynamics has been outlined.

the outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense
filaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption
near galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We
also find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to
galaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the
galaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal
absorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without
feedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50
kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV
and OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean
transmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming
galaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is
independent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS
with lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can
produce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude
that OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.

candidates have similar line fluxes and line widths, while velocity offsets

parameters are larger than 10 kpc, and lower column density systems are found

density in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +/-

distortions, imposed at the mesoscopic or macroscopic scales, have a dramatic
effect on electronic properties at the atomic scale and on electrical transport
along DNA. Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture the
electronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, we
begin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronic
states in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurations
encountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results are
complemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states
of a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,
using previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronic
states are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that can
describe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the
presence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the
substrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian which
leads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by several
orders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretched

expands to a full size of J/psi. Such a dynamical evolution process is included
here in calculations for the J/psi number distribution as a function of

LHC energies. The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the
partonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic
channels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they
dissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occurs
via two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octet
ccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There are
modest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the
reactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average
momentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal
stage at LHC energy. Production from the partonic system competes with the
suppression of the initial yield in the deconfined medium. Consequently, a
bulge within -1.5<y<1.5 has been found for the J/psi number distribution and
the ratio of J/psi number distributions for Au-Au collisions to nucleon-nucleon
collisions. This bulge is caused by the partonic system and is thus an
indicator of a deconfined partonic medium. Based on this result we suggest the
rapidity region worth measuring in future experiments at RHIC and LHC to be
-3<y<3.

transmission that occurs in a parallel array of independently noisy identical
threshold nonlinearities, including model neurons. Unlike most forms of
stochastic resonance, the output response to suprathreshold random input
signals of arbitrary magnitude is improved by the presence of even small
amounts of noise. In this paper the information transmission performance of SSR
in the limit of a large array size is considered. Using a relationship between
Shannon's mutual information and Fisher information, a sufficient condition for
optimality, i.e. channel capacity, is derived. It is shown that capacity is
achieved when the signal distribution is Jeffrey's prior, as formed from the
noise distribution, or when the noise distribution depends on the signal
distribution via a cosine relationship. These results provide theoretical
verification and justification for previous work in both computational

  Methods: We present new spectroscopic observations allowing a reliable
spectral classification of the star, and discuss existing MSX observations of
its associated bow shock and astrometric information not previously studied.
  Results: Our observations reveal that BD+43 3654 is a very early and luminous
star of spectral type O4If, with an estimated mass of (70 +/- 15) solar masses
and an age of about 1.6 Myr. The high spatial resolution of the MSX
observations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of the
sky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matches
well the orientation expected from the proper motion. Tracing back its path
across the sky we find that BD+43 3654 was located near the central, densest
region of Cygnus OB2 at a time in the past similar to its estimated age.
  Conclusions: BD+43 3654 turns out to be one of the three most massive runaway
stars known, and it most likely formed in the central region of Cygnus OB2. A
runaway formation mechanism by means of dynamical ejection is consistent with
our results.

existence of a partially disordered chiral state at ambient pressure in the
magnetic field applied along $<111>$ axis below the first order transition to
the non-chiral ferromagnetic state. This unexpected phenomenon is explained by
the analysis of the spin-wave spectrum. We demonstrate that the square of the
spin-wave gap becomes negative under magnetic field applied along $<111>$ and
$<110>$ but not along the $<100>$ direction. It is a result of competition
between the spin-wave interaction and cubic anisotropy. This negative sign
means an instability of the spin wave spectrum for the helix and leads to a
destruction of the helical order, giving rise to the partially disordered state
below the first order ferromagnetic transition.

both over initial conditions and over the amount of smoothing.

The Green's tensor approach permits computation of the phase and amplitude

shown that the field diffracted along the interface by the groove is equivalent
to replacing the groove by an oscillating dipolar line source. An analytic

the asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transient

second-order eikonal corrections are significant and bring the calculations in
closer agreement with the data and/or the exact results from models adopting

optical, and X-ray emission associated with the SNR and is probably a radiative

investigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that

emitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state
interpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is
similar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at
which the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between
`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really does
have a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGN
and GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present an
improved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on
considerably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of
continuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, well
fitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.
Although a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by
adding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not
unusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second
break at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate
implies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found

the compact dimension, but vanishing angular momentum. These black holes are
stationary, but non-rotating. We derive the first law for these spacetimes and
find that the parameter conjugate to variations in the length of the compact
direction is an effective tension, which generally differs from the ADM
tension. For the boosted black string, this effective tension is always
positive, while the ADM tension is negative for large boost parameter. We also
derive two Smarr formulas, one that follows from time translation invariance,
and a second one that holds only in the case of exact translation symmetry in
the compact dimension. Finally, we show that the `tension first law' derived by
Traschen and Fox in the static case has the form of a thermodynamic Gibbs-Duhem

makes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to
keep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router.
Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by
the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating
flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all
cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a
per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the
collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant
for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted.
However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative
accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of
sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the
original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the
impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.
In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in
NetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss
of monitoring detail.

keV band from the HELLAS2XMM survey.
  Methods: We use IRAC and MIPS 24 micron observations, along with optical and
Ks-band photometry, to obtain the SEDs of the sources. The observed SEDs are
modeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (using
the phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associated
with passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of red
quasars are adopted. The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-L_K relation are
used to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the black
holes residing in these AGN.
  Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron)
bands. The SED modeling described above is in good agreement with the observed
near- and mid-infrared data. The derived bolometric luminosities are in the
range ~10^45-10^47 erg s^-1, and the median 2--10 keV bolometric correction is
~25, consistent with the widely adopted value derived by Elvis et al. (1994).

stellar masses (0.8-6.2)X10^11 Mo, black hole masses in the range

the sum of $p$ characteristic functions of disjoint discs of radius $p^{-1}$.
The case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our MRA is a 2-adic analog of the real
Haar MRA. But in contrast to the real setting, the refinable function
generating our Haar MRA is periodic with period 1, which never holds for real
refinable functions. This fact implies that there exist infinity many different
2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\cL}^2(\bQ_2)$ generated by the same Haar
MRA. All of these bases are constructed. Since $p$-adic pseudo-differential
operators are closely related to wavelet-type bases, our bases can be
intensively used for applications.

Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is
limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and
self-optimisation of the society as a whole. We have developed a new algorithm
based on clique percolation, that allows, for the first time, to investigate
the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, to
uncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is on
networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between

capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to
change the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small
groups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being that
their composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of the
time commitment of the members to a given community can be used for estimating
the community's lifetime. These findings offer a new view on the fundamental
differences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.
