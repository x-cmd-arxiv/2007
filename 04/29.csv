electrons to metal surfaces. We present and validate a method to measure the
energy distribution of dense electron ensembles at ambient conditions. We have
found sharp structures in the energy distribution of charge confined at metal
surfaces. These structures correspond to the onset of space charge i.e.
electron emission. The threshold energy for emission increases linear with the
free electron density. We conclude that the work function is a direct measure
of the Hartree-Fock exchange energy. Remarkably, the emissions that have been
observed do not obey the Einstein-Millikan threshold relation for the photo
electric effect. By discrimination between requirements for energy and momentum
we deduce that electron emissions are trigged by photon momentum. We claim that
the photo electric effect is the result of a phase transition in an electron
gas that connects a surface bound, condensed state to a free continuum state.
The assignment of a phase transition to the effect under consideration is
justified by analyzing the behaviour of the Fermi-Dirac energy distribution
upon raising the Fermi level. We predict an abrupt increment in the number of
electrons in the continuum that exceeds 70 orders of magnitude. Both the
observed threshold energy and the line shape of the transition are in good
agreement with theoretical predictions.

interaction between the valence electron and the core using a model potential.
This method allows for configuration interactions (CI) and relativistic effects
in the Breit-Pauli formalism. Collision strengths in LS-coupling were
calculated in the close coupling approximation with the R-matrix method. Then,
fine structure collision strengths were obtained by means of the
intermediate-coupling frame transformation (ICFT) method which accounts for
spin-orbit coupling effects. We present extensive comparisons with the most
recent calculations and measurements for Ca II as well as a comparison between
the core polarization results and the ""unpolarized"" values. We find that core
polarization affects the computed lifetimes by up to 20%. Our results are in
very close agreement with recent measurements for the lifetimes of metastable
levels. The present collision strengths were integrated over a Maxwellian

strengths are given for a wide range of temperatures. Our effective collision
strengths for the resonance transitions are within ~11% from previous values

networks. Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a driving
force in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has been
noted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferential
attachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions of
molecular networks.
  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring by
including directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result of
unidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes to
quantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this in
itself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sites
in procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degree
distribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in the
non-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.
  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantial
recombination of upstream regions could generate main features of genetic
regulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broad
to be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as a
main additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that gene
duplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degree
distributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstream
regions of genes.

lattice, which is a generalization of Kitaev model. The topological phases of
the system are analyzed by study of the ground state sector of this model, the
vortex-free states. Basically, there are two phases, A phase and B phase. The
behaviors of both A and B phases may be studied by mapping the ground state
sector into a general p-wave paired states of spinless fermions with tunable
pairing parameters on a square lattice. In this p-wave paired state theory, the
A phase is shown to be the strong paired phase, an insulating phase. The B
phase may be either gapped or gapless determined by the generalized inversion
symmetry is broken or not. The gapped B is the weak pairing phase described by
either the Moore-Read Pfaffian state of the spinless fermions or anti-Pfaffian
state of holes depending on the sign of the next nearest neighbor hopping
amplitude. A phase transition between Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian states are
found in the gapped B phase. Furthermore, we show that there is a hidden SU(2)
gauge symmetry in our model. In the gapped B phase, the ground state has a
non-trivial topological number, the spectral first Chern number or the chiral
central charge, which reflects the chiral anomaly of the edge state. We proved
that the topological number is identified to the reduced eta-invariant and this
anomaly may be cancelled by a bulk Wess-Zumino term of SO(3) group through an
index theorem in 2+1 dimensions.

oscillations of a perpendicular magnetic field. Our theory follows a recent
proposal of using phenomenological 2D modeling for the description of crossed
field dynamics in high-T$_c$ superconductors [{\tt arXiv:cond-mat/0703330}].
  Stationary regimes with either saturation to metastable configurations, or
complete decay to the thermodynamic equilibrium are obtained. The transition
between both types of response is related to the disappearance of a flux free
core within the sample. As a common feature, a step-like dependence in the time
relaxation is predicted for both cases. The theory may be applied to long bars
of arbitrary and non homogeneous cross section, under in-plane magnetic field
processes.

  suggestions",,"10.1086/521018",,"astro-ph",,"  The triple nucleus of M31 consists of a population of old red stars in an
eccentric disk (P1 and P2) and another population of younger A stars in a
circular disk (P3) around M31's central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We
argue that P1 and P2 determine the maximal radial extent of the younger A star
population and provide the gas that fueled the starburst that generated P3. The
eccentric stellar disk creates an $m=1$ non-axisymmetric perturbation to the
potential. This perturbed potential drives gas into the inner parsec around the
SMBH, if the pattern speed of the eccentric stellar disk is $\Omega_p \lesssim
3-10 {\rm km s^{-1} pc^{-1}}$. We show that stellar mass loss from P1 and P2 is
sufficient to create a gravitationally unstable gaseous disk of $\sim
10^5\Msun$ every $0.1-1$ Gyrs, consistent with the 200 Myr age of P3. Similar
processes may act in other systems to produce very compact nuclear starbursts.

  http://astro.berkeley.edu/~pchang/full_res_weibel.pdf",,"10.1086/524764",,"astro-ph",,"  We study the long term evolution of magnetic fields generated by a
collisionless relativistic $e^+e^-$ shock which is initially unmagnetized. Our
2D particle-in-cell numerical simulations show that downstream of such a
Weibel-mediated shock, particle distributions are close to isotropic,
relativistic Maxwellians, and the magnetic turbulence is highly intermittent
spatially, with the non-propagating magnetic fields forming relatively isolated
regions with transverse dimension $\sim 10-20$ skin depths. These structures
decay in amplitude, with little sign of downstream merging. The fields start
with magnetic energy density $\sim (0.1-0.2)$ of the upstream kinetic energy
within the shock transition, but rapid downstream decay drives the fields to
much smaller values, below $10^{-3}$ of equipartition after $10^3$ skin depths.
  In an attempt to construct a theory that follows field decay to these smaller
values, we explore the hypothesis that the observed damping is a variant of
Landau damping in an unmagnetized plasma. The model is based on the small value
of the downstream magnetic energy density, which suggests that particle orbits
are only weakly perturbed from straight line motion, if the turbulence is
homogeneous. Using linear kinetic theory applied to electromagnetic fields in
an isotropic, relativistic Maxwellian plasma, we find a simple analytic form
for the damping rates, $\gamma_k$, in two and three dimensions for small
amplitude, subluminous electromagnetic fields. We find that magnetic energy
does damp due to phase mixing of current carrying particles as $(\omega_p
t)^{-q}$ with $q \sim 1$. (abridged)
