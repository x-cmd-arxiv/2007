correctness proof is given which shows that this algorithm achieves a relative
error-correction radius of $\tau \leq (1 - \sqrt{{\ell q^{m-1}}/{n}})$. This is
an improvement over the proof using one-point Algebraic-Geometric codes given
in \cite{PW2005}. The described algorithm can be adapted to decode
Product-Reed-Solomon codes.
  We then propose a new low complexity recursive algebraic decoding algorithm
for Reed-Muller and Product-Reed-Solomon codes. Our algorithm achieves a
relative error correction radius of $\tau \leq \prod_{i=1}^m (1 -
\sqrt{k_i/q})$. This technique is then proved to outperform the Pellikaan-Wu

measure several key age, metallicity and abundance ratio sensitive indices from
the Lick/IDS system over a contiguous two-dimensional field including bulge and
inner disc. We present maps of H beta, Fe 5015 and Mg b, for each galaxy
  The absorption line maps show that many galaxies contain some younger
populations (<= 1 Gyr), distributed in small or large inner discs, or in
circumnuclear star forming rings. In many cases these young stars are formed in
circumnuclear mini-starbursts, which are dominating the light in the centres of
some of the early-type spirals. These mini-starburst cause a considerable
scatter in index-index diagrams such as Mg b- H beta and Mg b -Fe 5015, more
than is measured for early-type galaxies. We find that the central regions of
Sa galaxies display a wide range in ages, even within the galaxies. 50% of the
sample show velocity dispersion drops in their centres.
  All of the galaxies of our sample lie on or below the Mg b- $\sigma$ relation
for elliptical galaxies in the Coma cluster, and above the H beta absorption
line - $\sigma$ relation for elliptical galaxies. If those relations are
considered to be relations for the oldest local galaxies we see that our sample
of spirals has a considerable scatter in age, with the largest scatter at the
lowest $\sigma$. This is in disagreement with highly inclined samples, in which
generally only old stellar populations are found in the central regions.

  Information Sciences and Systems, John Hopkins University, March 2007",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  In wireless ad hoc networks, distributed nodes can collaboratively form an
antenna array for long-distance communications to achieve high energy
efficiency. In recent work, Ochiai, et al., have shown that such collaborative
beamforming can achieve a statistically nice beampattern with a narrow main
lobe and low sidelobes. However, the process of collaboration introduces
significant delay, since all collaborating nodes need access to the same
information. In this paper, a technique that significantly reduces the
collaboration overhead is proposed. It consists of two phases. In the first
phase, nodes transmit locally in a random access fashion. Collisions, when they
occur, are viewed as linear mixtures of the collided packets. In the second
phase, a set of cooperating nodes acts as a distributed antenna system and
beamform the received analog waveform to one or more faraway destinations. This
step requires multiplication of the received analog waveform by a complex
number, which is independently computed by each cooperating node, and which
enables separation of the collided packets based on their final destination.
The scheme requires that each node has global knowledge of the network
coordinates. The proposed scheme can achieve high throughput, which in certain
cases exceeds one.

the number of switch nodes, the distribution of long- versus short-range

confirm that (1) computation in irregular assemblies is a promising and

bandwidth that exceeds the pump bandwidth, they can obtain a behavior that is
pulse-like temporally, yet spectrally narrow. At low photon fluxes this
behavior reflects the time and energy entanglement between the down-converted
photons. However, two-photon interactions such as two-photon absorption (TPA)
and sum-frequency generation (SFG) can exhibit such a behavior even at high
power levels, as long as the final state (i.e. the atomic level in TPA, or the
generated light in SFG) is narrowband enough. This behavior does not depend on
the squeezing properties of the light, is insensitive to linear losses, and has
potential applications. In this paper we describe analytically this behavior
for travelling-wave down-conversion with continuous or pulsed pumping, both for
high- and low-power regimes. For this we derive a quantum-mechanical expression
for the down-converted amplitude generated by an arbitrary pump, and formulate
operators that represent various two-photon interactions induced by broadband
light. This model is in excellent agreement with experimental results of TPA
and SFG with high power down-converted light and with entangled photons [Dayan

  Not one of the exoplanets discovered thus far is a planet. They are
cryptoplanets formed from matter ejected by protostars. When protostars have
excessive infall at high latitudes, they partially balance angular momentum
through outflow at the equator as they spin up. The ejected matter is trapped
in the magnetic torus formed between the star and the disk, like a tokamak. The
tokamak eventully reconnects and magnetic compression forms self-gravitating
remnants trapped and compressed by a closed spherical magnetic field,
spheromaks. Cooled spheromaks are cryptoplanets. They orbit near the star. They
can merge with each other or fall into the star or be ejected. They can grow by
accreting gas. They have a low density core and abundances characteristic of
the protostar. Their masses, radii, densities, and orbits are random, and are
inconsistent with the parameters for planets. They tend to have lower density
than planets.

of the cyclotron resonance absorption line near the maximum of the X-ray flux

in cyclotron harmonic energy corresponds to a decrease in the height of the
emitting region by ~2 km, while other spectral parameters, in particular, the
cutoff energy, remain essentially constant. At a luminosity ~7x10^{37} erg/s,

some striking features emerging in the later case such as (i) the appearance of
non-abelian gauge theories in four dimensions starting from an abelian gauge
theory in higher dimensions, (ii) the fact that the spontaneous symmetry
breaking of the theory takes place entirely in the extra dimensions and (iii)
the renormalizability of the theory both in higher as well as in four
dimensions. Then reversing the above approach we present a renormalizable four
dimensional SU(N) gauge theory with a suitable multiplet of scalar fields,
which via spontaneous symmetry breaking dynamically develops extra dimensions
in the form of a fuzzy sphere. We explicitly find the tower of massive
Kaluza-Klein modes consistent with an interpretation as gauge theory on $M^4

on the parameters of the model the low-energy gauge group can be of the form

that it locates Kamioka underground site for low seismic noise level, and
adopts cryogenic Sapphire mirrors for low thermal noise level. The first
operation of the cryogenic interferometer was successfully demonstrated in
February of 2006. Current sensitivity at room temperature is close to the

room temperature have been done. Once the displacement noise reaches at thermal
noise level of room temperature, its improvement by cooling test mass mirrors

optical bands for the same parent sample. We also present the fraction of
BALQSOs as functions of apparent magnitudes, absolute magnitudes, and redshift
in the 2MASS and SDSS bands. The 2MASS fractions are consistently higher than
the SDSS fractions in every comparison, and the BALQSO fractions steadily
increase with wavelength from the SDSS u to the 2MASS K_s bands. Furthermore,
the i - K_s color distributions of BALQSOs and non-BALQSOs indicate that
BALQSOs are redder than non-BALQSOs, with a K-S test probability of 2e-12.
These results are consistent with the spectral difference between BALQSOs and
non-BALQSOs including both the absorption troughs and dust extinction in
BALQSOs, which leads to significant selection biases against BALQSOs in the
optical bands. Using a simple simulation incorporating the luminosity function

tolerant attitude toward a low-p (p<2%) minority B. This remains true even when

it is a velocity field for a stationary flow of an ideal fluid. Right- or

such flows.
  Consider now a mechanical system, whose configuration space is a Lie group

assume that the mass geometry of the system may change under the action of
internal control forces. Such system can also be reduced to the Lie group. With
no controls, this mechanical system describes a geodesic flow of the
left-invariant metric, given by the Lagrangian, and thus its reduced flow is a
stationary ideal fluid flow on the Lie group. The standard control problem for
such system is to find the conditions, under which the system can be brought

disk evolution. M67 is well studied but the lack of a wide and deep Stromgren
photometric study makes our results worthwhile. The brightest stars of the open
cluster M67 were used as uvby-Hbeta standard stars in our studies of NGC1817
and NGC2548, and the extension of the field covered, as well as the amount of
observations, allowed to obtain the best set of Stromgren data ever published
for this cluster. We discuss the results of our CCD uvby-Hbeta
intermediate-band photometry, covering an area of about 50'x50' down to V 19.
Moreover, a complete membership segregation based on astrometric and
photometric criteria is obtained. The photometric analysis of a selected sample
of stars yields a reddening value of E(b-y)= 0.03\pm0.03, a distance modulus of
V_0-M_V= 9.7\pm0.2 and [Fe/H]= 0.01\pm0.14. Through isochrone fitting we found
an age of log t= 9.6\pm0.1 (4.2\pm0.2 Gyr). A clump of approximately 60 stars
around V= 16, (b-y)= 0.4 could be interpreted as a population of
pre-cataclysmic variable stars (if members), or as a stream of field G-type
stars placed at twice the distance of the cluster (if non-members).

new hard gamma-ray source class seems required from the predicted aggregate

(2005). For smooth marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS) in a smooth
spacetime we define stability with respect to variations along arbitrary
vectors v normal to the MOTS. After giving some introductory material about
linear non self-adjoint elliptic operators, we introduce the stability operator
L_v and we characterize stable MOTS in terms of sign conditions on the
principal eigenvalue of L_v. The main result shows that given a strictly stable
MOTS S contained in one leaf of a given reference foliation in a spacetime,
there is an open marginally outer trapped tube (MOTT), adapted to the reference
foliation, which contains S. We give conditions under which the MOTT can be
completed. Finally, we show that under standard energy conditions on the
spacetime, the MOTT must be either locally achronal, spacelike or null.

biodiversity may be induced by cosmic rays which vary as the Solar System
oscillates normal to the galactic disk. We re-examine the evidence for a 62
million year (Myr) periodicity in biodiversity throughout the Phanerozoic
history of animal life reported by Rohde & Mueller (2005), as well as related
questions of periodicity in origination and extinction. We find that the signal
is robust against variations in methods of analysis, and is based on
fluctuations in the Paleozoic and a substantial part of the Mesozoic.
Examination of origination and extinction is somewhat ambiguous, with results
depending upon procedure. Origination and extinction intensity as defined by RM
may be affected by an artifact at 27 Myr in the duration of stratigraphic
intervals. Nevertheless, when a procedure free of this artifact is implemented,
the 27 Myr periodicity appears in origination, suggesting that the artifact may
ultimately be based on a signal in the data. A 62 Myr feature appears in
extinction, when this same procedure is used. We conclude that evidence for a
periodicity at 62 Myr is robust, and evidence for periodicity at approximately
27 Myr is also present, albeit more ambiguous.
