deformations in open superstring field theory can be reduced to a problem in
the bosonic theory of finding a finite gauge parameter for a certain pure-gauge
configuration labeled by the parameter of the marginal deformation. We find a
gauge transformation generated by a real gauge parameter which infinitesimally
changes the deformation parameter and construct a finite gauge parameter by its
path-ordered exponential. The resulting solution satisfies the reality

\nu = \pm, concentrating on the quantum Hall ferromagnetic regime, within a
non-perturbative bosonization formalism. We start by developing a bosonization
scheme for electrons with two discrete degrees of freedom (spin-1/2 and
pseudospin-1/2) restricted to the lowest Landau level. Three distinct phases
are considered, namely the so-called spin-pseudospin, spin, and pseudospin
phases. The first corresponds to a quarter-filled (\nu =-1) while the others to
a half-filled (\nu = 0) lowest Landau level. In each case, we show that the
elementary neutral excitations can be treated approximately as a set of
n-independent kinds of boson excitations. The boson representation of the
projected electron density, the spin, pseudospin, and mixed spin-pseudospin
density operators are derived. We then apply the developed formalism to the
effective continuous model, which includes SU(4) symmetry breaking terms,
recently proposed by Alicea and Fisher. For each quantum Hall state, an
effective interacting boson model is derived and the dispersion relations of
the elementary excitations are analytically calculated. We propose that the
charged excitations (quantum Hall skyrmions) can be described as a coherent
state of bosons. We calculate the semiclassical limit of the boson model
derived from the SU(4) invariant part of the original fermionic Hamiltonian and
show that it agrees with the results of Arovas and co-workers for SU(N) quantum
Hall skyrmions. We briefly discuss the influence of the SU(4) symmetry breaking
terms in the skyrmion energy.

M-type giant and a compact object. Using the accurate X-ray position allowed by
Swift/XRT data, we pinpointed the optical counterpart, a M2 III star. Besides,
the combined use of the spectral information afforded by XRT and INTEGRAL/IBIS
shows that the 0.5-200 keV spectrum of this source can be described with an
absorbed Comptonization model, usually found in LMXBs and, in particular, in
SyXBs. No long-term (days to months) periodicities are detected in the IBIS
data. The time coverage afforded by XRT reveals shot-noise variability typical
of accreting Galactic X-ray sources, but is not good enough to explore the
presence of X-ray short-term (seconds to hours) oscillations in detail. By
using the above information, we infer important parameters for this source such
as its distance (about 3.7 kpc) and X-ray luminosity (about 1.4e35 erg/s in the
0.5-200 keV band), and we give a description for this system (typical of SyXBs)
in which a compact object (possibly a neutron star) accretes from the wind of
its M-type giant companion. We also draw some comparisons between IGR

problems often emerge. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for
the data, the resulting posterior distribution may be multimodal or exhibit
pronounced (curving) degeneracies, which can cause problems for traditional
MCMC sampling methods. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models,
calculation of the Bayesian evidence for each model is computationally
expensive. The nested sampling method introduced by Skilling (2004), has
greatly reduced the computational expense of calculating evidences and also
produces posterior inferences as a by-product. This method has been applied
successfully in cosmological applications by Mukherjee et al. (2006), but their
implementation was efficient only for unimodal distributions without pronounced
degeneracies. Shaw et al. (2007), recently introduced a clustered nested
sampling method which is significantly more efficient in sampling from
multimodal posteriors and also determines the expectation and variance of the
final evidence from a single run of the algorithm, hence providing a further
increase in efficiency. In this paper, we build on the work of Shaw et al. and
present three new methods for sampling and evidence evaluation from
distributions that may contain multiple modes and significant degeneracies; we
also present an even more efficient technique for estimating the uncertainty on
the evaluated evidence. These methods lead to a further substantial improvement
in sampling efficiency and robustness, and are applied to toy problems to
demonstrate the accuracy and economy of the evidence calculation and parameter
estimation. Finally, we discuss the use of these methods in performing Bayesian
object detection in astronomical datasets.

significant softening but, in the first case the bulk modulus is mainly
dependent on the density, while in the mixed phase model it also strongly
depends on the temperature. We also show that the bulk modulus is not vanishing
in the mixed phase due to the presence of two conserved charges, the baryon and

incompressibility becomes extremely small. Finally we compare our results with

build a net from the projection of syntactic relations. Recall that, as opposed
to adult grammars, early-child language has not a well-defined concept of
structure. To overcome such difficulty, we develop a set of systematic criteria
assuming constituency hierarchy and a grammar based on lexico-thematic
relations. At the end, what we obtain is a well defined corpora annotation that
enables us i) to perform statistics on the size of structures and ii) to build
a network from syntactic relations over which we can perform the standard
measures of complexity. We also provide a detailed example.

different RHF and MP2 calculations for the geometry and the energy. The basis
sets used belong to a sample of 39 selected representants from Pople's
split-valence families, ranging from the small 3-21G to the large
6-311++G(2df,2pd). The reference PES to which the rest are compared is the
MP2/6-311++G(2df,2pd) homolevel, which, as far as we are aware, is the more
accurate PES of a dipeptide in the literature. The aim of the study presented
is twofold: On the one hand, the evaluation of the influence of polarization
and diffuse functions in the basis set, distinguishing between those placed at
1st-row atoms and those placed at hydrogens, as well as the effect of different
contraction and valence splitting schemes. On the other hand, the investigation
of the heterolevel assumption, which is defined here to be that which states
that heterolevel MCs are more efficient than homolevel MCs. The heterolevel
approximation is very commonly used in the literature, but it is seldom
checked. As far as we know, the only tests for peptides or related systems,
have been performed using a small number of conformers, and this is the first
time that this potentially very economical approximation is tested in full
PESs. In order to achieve these goals, all data sets have been compared and
analyzed in a way which captures the nearness concept in the space of MCs.

  Maintenance","Accepted to PLoS One. 8 figures at end",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0000445",,"q-bio.NC q-bio.MN",,"  Late long-term potentiation (L-LTP) appears essential for the formation of
long-term memory, with memories at least partly encoded by patterns of
strengthened synapses. How memories are preserved for months or years, despite
molecular turnover, is not well understood. Ongoing recurrent neuronal
activity, during memory recall or during sleep, has been hypothesized to
preferentially potentiate strong synapses, preserving memories. This hypothesis
has not been evaluated in the context of a mathematical model representing
biochemical pathways important for L-LTP. I incorporated ongoing activity into
two such models: a reduced model that represents some of the essential
biochemical processes, and a more detailed published model. The reduced model
represents synaptic tagging and gene induction intuitively, and the detailed
model adds activation of essential kinases by Ca. Ongoing activity was modeled
as continual brief elevations of [Ca]. In each model, two stable states of
synaptic weight resulted. Positive feedback between synaptic weight and the
amplitude of ongoing Ca transients underlies this bistability. A tetanic or
theta-burst stimulus switches a model synapse from a low weight to a high
weight stabilized by ongoing activity. Bistability was robust to parameter
variations. Simulations illustrated that prolonged decreased activity reset
synapses to low weights, suggesting a plausible forgetting mechanism. However,
episodic activity with shorter inactive intervals maintained strong synapses.
Both models support experimental predictions. Tests of these predictions are
expected to further understanding of how neuronal activity is coupled to
maintenance of synaptic strength.

principle and the tri-bimaximal mixing (TBM) scheme, have been proposed to
explain the observed mixing pattern of neutrinos. We argue that such symmetry
relations need to be imposed at a high scale $\Lambda \sim 10^{12}$ GeV
characterizing the large masses of right-handed neutrinos required to implement
the seesaw mechanism. For nonhierarchical neutrinos, renormalisation group
evolution down to a laboratory energy scale $\lambda \sim 10^3$ GeV tends to
radiatively break these symmetries at a significant level and spoil the mixing
pattern predicted by them. However, for Majorana neutrinos, suitable
constraints on the extra phases $\alpha_{2,3}$ enable the retention of those
high scale mixing patterns at laboratory energies. We examine this issue within
the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and demonstrate the fact
posited above for two versions of QLC and two versions of TBM. The appropriate
constraints are worked out for all these four cases. Specifically, a preference
for $\alpha_2 \approx \pi$ (i.e. $m_1 \approx -m_2$) emerges in each case. We
also show how a future accurate measurement of $\theta_{13}$ may enable some
discrimination among these four cases in spite of renormalization group
evolution.

cosmic microwave background (CMB) are detected on the three-year WMAP data,
through a decomposition of the signal with steerable wavelets on the sphere.
Firstly, an alignment analysis identifies two mean preferred planes in the sky,
both with normal axes close to the CMB dipole axis. The first plane is defined
by the directions toward which local CMB features are anomalously aligned. A
mean preferred axis is also identified in this plane, located very close to the
ecliptic poles axis. The second plane is defined by the directions anomalously
avoided by local CMB features. This alignment anomaly provides further insight
on recent results (Wiaux et al. 2006). Secondly, a signed-intensity analysis
identifies three mean preferred directions in the southern galactic hemisphere
with anomalously high or low temperature of local CMB features: a cold spot
essentially identified with a known cold spot (Vielva et al. 2004), a second
cold spot lying very close to the southern end of the CMB dipole axis, and a
hot spot lying close to the southern end of the ecliptic poles axis. In both
analyses, the anomalies are observed at wavelet scales corresponding to angular
sizes around 10 degress on the celestial sphere, with global significance
levels around 1%. Further investigation reveals that the alignment and
signed-intensity anomalies are only very partially related. Instrumental noise,
foreground emissions, as well as some form of other systematics, are strongly
rejected as possible origins of the detections. An explanation might still be
envisaged in terms of a global violation of the isotropy of the Universe,
inducing an intrinsic statistical anisotropy of the CMB.

We have selected Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) using single epoch SDSS
riz-photometry to i<20.5 and z<20.2. We have observed in 3 fields including the
COSMOS field and the COMBO-17 S11 field, obtaining a sample of ~600 redshift
z>=0.5 LRGs. Exposure times varied from 1 - 4 hours to determine the minimum
exposure for AAOmega to make an essentially complete LRG redshift survey in
average conditions. We show that LRG redshifts to i<20.5 can measured in
approximately 1.5hr exposures and present comparisons with 2SLAQ and COMBO-17
(photo-)redshifts. Crucially, the riz selection coupled with the 3-4 times
improved AAOmega throughput is shown to extend the LRG mean redshift from
z=0.55 for 2SLAQ to z=0.681+/- 0.005 for riz-selected LRGs. This extended range
is vital for maximising the S/N for the detection of the baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAOs). Furthermore, we show that the amplitude of LRG clustering
is s_0 = 9.9+/-0.7 h^-1 Mpc, as high as that seen in the 2SLAQ LRG Survey.
Consistent results for the real-space amplitude are found from projected and
semi-projected correlation functions. This high clustering amplitude is
consistent with a long-lived population whose bias evolves as predicted by a
simple ``high-peaks'' model. We conclude that a redshift survey of 360 000 LRGs
over 3000deg^2, with an effective volume some 4 times bigger than previously
used to detect BAO with LRGs, is possible with AAOmega in 170 nights.

times after screening were: 70 ks per X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) camera,
60.8 ks for the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) PIN, and 17.1 ks for the HXD-GSO. The
hard X-rays are fit by two power-laws of the same slope, absorbed by columns of
1.5 and 7 * 10^{23} cm^{-2} respectively. The spectrum is consistent with
previous suggestions that the power-law components are X-ray emission from the
sub-pc VLBI jet and from Bondi accretion at the core, but it is also consistent
with a partial covering interpretation. The soft band is dominated by thermal
emission from the diffuse plasma and is fit well by a two-temperature VAPEC
model, plus a third power-law component to account for scattered nuclear
emission, jet emission, and emission from X-ray Binaries and other point
sources. Narrow fluorescent emission lines from Fe, Si, S, Ar, Ca and Ni are
detected. The Fe K alpha line width yields a 200 light-day lower limit on the
distance from the black hole to the line-emitting gas. Fe, Ca, and S K-shell
absorption edges are detected. Elemental abundances are constrained via
absorption edge depths and strengths of the fluorescent and diffuse plasma
emission lines. The high metallicity ([Fe/H]=+0.1) of the circumnuclear
material suggests that it could not have originated in the relatively
metal-poor outer halo unless enrichment by local star formation has occurred.
Relative abundances are consistent with enrichment from Type II and Ia
supernovae.

rest and has a constant acceleration vector. The CFs and the energy density at
the rotating reference system should be periodic with rotation period because
CF and energy density measurements is one of the tools the detector can use to
justify the periodicity of its motion. The CFs have been calculated for both
electromagnetic and massless scalar fields in two cases, with and without
taking this periodicity into consideration. It turned out that only periodic
CFs have some thermal features and particularly the Planck's factor with the
temperature T= h w /k . Regarding to the energy density of both electromagnetic

zero-point radiation observes not only this original zero-point radiation but,
above that, also the radiation which would have been observed by an inertial
detector in the thermal bath with the Plank's spectrum at the temperature T.

and 2/9 (4 gamma ^2-1) for the massless scalar field, where the Lorentz factor
gamma=(1 - v^2 / c^2)^(1/2). Appearance of these masking factors is connected

space with a cutoff which may be varied within a certain range. The operator
runs as a result of the variation of the cutoff [renormalization group (RG)
running]. In order for ChPT to be useful, the operator should run in a way
consistent with the counting rule; that is, the running of chiral counter terms
have to be of natural size. We vary the cutoff using the Wilsonian
renormalization group (WRG) equation, and examine this consistency. As an
example, we study the s-wave pion production operator for NN\to d pi, derived
in ChPT. We demonstrate that the WRG running does not generate any
chiral-symmetry-violating (CSV) interaction, provided that we start with an
operator which does not contain a CSV term. We analytically show how the
counter terms are generated in the WRG running in case of the infinitesimal
cutoff reduction. Based on the analytic result, we argue a range of the cutoff
variation for which the running of the counter terms is of natural size. Then,
we numerically confirm this.

automatic discovery of such structure is a fundamental task in many
disciplines, including sociology, biology, engineering, and computer science.
Recently, several community discovery algorithms have been proposed based on
the optimization of a quantity called modularity (Q). However, the problem of
modularity optimization is NP-hard, and the existing approaches often suffer
from prohibitively long running time or poor quality. Furthermore, it has been
recently pointed out that algorithms based on optimizing Q will have a
resolution limit, i.e., communities below a certain scale may not be detected.
In this research, we first propose an efficient heuristic algorithm, Qcut,
which combines spectral graph partitioning and local search to optimize Q.
Using both synthetic and real networks, we show that Qcut can find higher
modularities and is more scalable than the existing algorithms. Furthermore,
using Qcut as an essential component, we propose a recursive algorithm, HQcut,
to solve the resolution limit problem. We show that HQcut can successfully
detect communities at a much finer scale and with a higher accuracy than the
existing algorithms. Finally, we apply Qcut and HQcut to study a
protein-protein interaction network, and show that the combination of the two
algorithms can reveal interesting biological results that may be otherwise
undetectable.

defined notions of structure. This enables us to quantitatively demonstrate
hierarchical self-organization in the soup in terms of complexity. We found
that replicating processes evolve the strategy of successively building higher
levels of organization by autocatalysis. Moreover, this is facilitated by local
components that have low structural complexity, but high generality. In effect,
the finitary process soup spontaneously evolves a selection pressure that
favors such components. In light of the finitary process soup's generality,
these results suggest a fundamental law of hierarchical systems: global

is well fit by the product of the residual fluxes in the unblended troughs. For
these optically thick systems to yield such a result, at least one of them must
consist of individual subunits rather than being a single structure with
velocity-dependent coverage of the source. If these subunits are identical,
opaque, spherical clouds, we estimate the cloud radius to be r = 3.9 10^15 cm.

terms of matrix exponentials are introduced and compared. The first approach is
based on a formal solution of the stress transport equation in which the
production terms can be integrated exactly in terms of matrix exponentials.
This formal solution of the subgrid-scale stress transport equation is shown to
be useful to explore special cases, such as the response to constant velocity
gradient, but neglecting pressure-strain correlations and diffusion effects.
The second approach is based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian change of variables,
combined with the assumption of isotropy for the conditionally averaged
Lagrangian velocity gradient tensor and with the `Recent Fluid Deformation'
(RFD) approximation. It is shown that both approaches lead to the same basic
closure in which the stress tensor is expressed as the product of the matrix
exponential of the resolved velocity gradient tensor multiplied by its
transpose. Short-time expansions of the matrix exponentials are shown to
provide an eddy-viscosity term and particular quadratic terms, and thus allow a
reinterpretation of traditional eddy-viscosity and nonlinear stress closures.
The basic feasibility of the matrix-exponential closure is illustrated by
implementing it successfully in Large Eddy Simulation of forced isotropic
turbulence. The matrix-exponential closure employs the drastic approximation of
entirely omitting the pressure-strain correlation and other `nonlinear
scrambling' terms. But unlike eddy-viscosity closures, the matrix exponential
approach provides a simple and local closure that can be derived directly from
the stress transport equation with the production term, and using physically
motivated assumptions about Lagrangian decorrelation and upstream isotropy.

exponentiation for resummation leads to divergent results. We study the
resummation of these $\ln^2 x$ terms. We show that the $\ln^2 x$ terms come
partly from the light-cone wave function(LCWF) and partly from the form factor.
We introduce a jet factor to factorize the $\ln^2 x$ term in the form factor.
To handel the $\ln^2 x$ terms from the LCWF we introduce a nonstandard
light-cone wave function(NLCWF) with the gauge links off the light-cone
direction. An interesting relation between two wave function is found. With the
introduced NLCWF and the jet factor we can re-factorize the form factor and
obtain a new hard part which does not contain terms with $\ln^2 x$. Beside the
renormalization scale $\mu$ the introduce NLCWF and jet factor have extra
scales to characterize their $x$-behaviors. Using the evolutions of the extra
scales and the relation we can do the resummation perturbatively in sense that
the LCWF is the only nonpertubative object in the resumed formula. Our results

in reproducing the true ground state and causes systematic errors of calculated
physical quantities because the samples are often trapped in some metastable or

Troyer in conjunction with the importance sampling of the original GBMC method.
This improvement allows us to carry out the importance sampling in the
quantum-number-projected phase-space. Some comparisons with the previous
quantum-number projection scheme indicate that, in our method, the convergence
with the ground state is accelerated, which makes it possible to extend the
applicability and widen the range of tractable parameters in the GBMC method.
The present scheme offers an efficient practical way of computation for
strongly correlated electron systems beyond the range of system sizes,

the surface of the star. The annular free flow model for $\gamma$-ray emission
of pulsars is suggested in this paper. It is emphasized that: (1). Two kinds of
acceleration regions (annular and core) need to be taken into account. The
annular acceleration region is defined by the magnetic field lines that cross
the null charge surface within the light cylinder. (2). If the potential drop
in the annular region of a pulsar is high enough (normally the cases of young
pulsars), charges in both the annular and the core regions could be accelerated
and produce primary gamma-rays. Secondary pairs are generated in both regions
and stream outwards to power the broadband radiations. (3). The potential drop
in the annular region grows more rapidly than that in the core region. The
annular acceleration process is a key point to produce wide emission beams as
observed. (4). The advantages of both the polar cap and outer gap models are
retained in this model. The geometric properties of the $\gamma$-ray emission
from the annular flow is analogous to that presented in a previous work by Qiao
et al., which match the observations well. (5). Since charges with different
signs leave the pulsar through the annular and the core regions, respectively,
the current closure problem can be partially solved.
