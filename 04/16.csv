the new systems forms two components of a 2300 AU separation triple system. We

the M5 spectral type. The target sample was also selected to investigate X-ray

stellar bulge masses (Mbulge) and there are several ideas to explain the origin
of this relationship. This study isolates the role of galaxy mergers from
considerations of other detailed physics to more clearly show how a linear
BH-galaxy mass relation (MBH-Mgal) can naturally emerge regardless of how
primordial BHs were seeded inside galaxies, if the galaxy mass function
declines with increasing mass. Under this circumstance, the MBH-Mgal relation
is a passive attractor that eventually converges to a tight linear relation
because of two basic statistical effects: a central limit-like tendency for
galaxy mergers which is much stronger for major mergers than minor mergers, and
a convergence toward a linear relation that is due mainly to minor mergers. A
curious consequence of this thought experiment is that, if galaxy bulges are
formed by major mergers, then merging statistics naturally show that MBH would
correlate more strongly with bulge dominated galaxies, because of stronger
central-seeking tendencies, than with disk dominated galaxies. Even if some
other physics is ultimately responsible for causing a linear MBH-Mbulge
relationship, this thought experiment shows that, counter to intuition, random
merging of galaxies that harbor random BH masses tends to strengthen rather
than weaken a pre-existing, linear, correlation. This idea may be generalized
to other gravitationally bound systems (dark matter halo, compact nuclear
objects) that retain their physical identities after experiencing mergers.

essential for computing accurate band gaps, we found that they produce smaller

broadening effect is obtained for the O 2p valence bands. The ab initio data
are in good agreement with the energy gap and band width derived from

demonstrate analytically and through numerical solutions of the linear,

works extremely well for stars of mass <1.4 Msun with thick surface convection
zones. More massive stars with largely radiative envelopes do not conform to
the equilibrium-tide approximation and can exhibit flux variations $\ga$10
times larger than naive estimates. Over the full range of stellar masses
considered, we treat the oscillatory response of the convection zone by
adapting a prescription that A. J. Brickhill developed for pulsating white
dwarfs. Compared to other sources of periodic variability, the ellipsoidal
lightcurve has a distinct dependence on time and system parameters. We suggest

latter causes gradual drifting of the orbits of km-sized asteroids and plays an
important role in the delivery of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) from the main
belt and in the dynamical spreading of asteroid families. At present, very
little is known about the thermal inertia of asteroids in the km size range.

a more complex function than the generally adopted D^(&#8722;1) dependence, and
that the size distribution of objects injected by Yarkovsky-driven orbital

previously been accomplished. This allows sufficient separation of scales to
observe a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial
range. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the
predicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy
spectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as
k^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the
sub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure
in the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in
different spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is
subdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible
for the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no
internal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS
attractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either
for arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a
formulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully
converged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct
numerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance
between truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead
of the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS
contributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower
energy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude
LANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow.

find that the jet-like explosions are obtained by the magnetodriven shock waves

black-hole masses at the formation decrease with the initial field strength, on
the other hand, increase with the initial rotation rates. As for the neutrino
properties, we point out that the degree of the differential rotation plays an
important role to determine which species of the neutrino luminosity is more
dominant than the others. Furthermore, we find that the stronger magnetic
fields make the peak neutrino luminosities smaller, because the magnetic
pressure acts to halt the collapse in the central regions, leading to the
suppression of the releasable gravitational binding energies.

requires the extrapolation to high z and L of a relation whose calibration
relies so far on reverberation mapping measurements performed for L<10^46 erg/s
and z<0.4. We initiated a campaign for the monitoring of a few luminous,
intermediate z quasars whose apparent magnitude V<15.7 allows observations with
a 1.8m telescope, aimed at proving that emission lines vary and respond to
continuum variations even for luminosities >10^47 erg/s, and determining
eventually their M_BH from reverberation mapping. We have repeatedly performed
simultaneous observations of quasars and reference stars to determine relative
variability of continuum and emission lines. We describe the observations and

no continuum variability has been detected and the evidence for line
variability is marginal, while in the latter case both continuum and line
variability are detected with high significance and the line variations appear
correlated with continuum variations. The detection of the emission line
variability in a quasar with L~10^47 erg/s encourages the prosecution of the

typical range of mass ratios the final stage of the merger is preceded by a
rapid precession and a subsequent spin-flip of the main black hole. This
already occurs in the inspiral phase, therefore can be described analytically

of noisy information about future cash flows is used to derive the price
processes. In this framework an asset is defined by its cash-flow structure.
Each cash flow is modelled by a random variable that can be expressed as a
function of a collection of independent random variables called market factors.
With each such ""X-factor"" we associate a market information process, the values
of which are accessible to market agents. Each information process is a sum of
two terms; one contains true information about the value of the market factor;
the other represents ""noise"". The noise term is modelled by an independent
Brownian bridge. The market filtration is assumed to be that generated by the
aggregate of the independent information processes. The price of an asset is
given by the expectation of the discounted cash flows in the risk-neutral
measure, conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. When
the cash flows are the dividend payments associated with equities, an explicit
model is obtained for the share-price, and the prices of options on
dividend-paying assets are derived. Remarkably, the resulting formula for the
price of a European call option is of the Black-Scholes-Merton type. The

geometry are not only functions of the positional argument $x$, but also depend
on the directional argument $y$. In other words, instead of dealing with
geometric objects defined on the manifold $M$, as in the case of classical
AP-geometry, we are dealing with geometric objects in the pullback bundle
$\pi^{-1}(TM)$ (the pullback of the tangent bundle $TM$ by $ \pi: T
M\longrightarrow M$). Many new geometric objects, which have no counterpart in
the classical AP-geometry, emerge in this more general context. We refer to
such a geometry as generalized AP-geometry (GAP-geometry). In analogy to
AP-geometry, we define a $d$-connection in $\pi^{-1}(TM)$ having remarkable
properties, which we call the canonical $d$-connection, in terms of the unique
torsion-free Riemannian $d$-connection. In addition to these two
$d$-connections, two more $d$-connections are defined, the dual and the
symmetric $d$-connections. Our space, therefore, admits twelve curvature
tensors (corresponding to the four defined $d$-connections), three of which
vanish identically. Simple formulae for the nine non-vanishing curvatures
tensors are obtained, in terms of the torsion tensors of the canonical
$d$-connection. The different $W$-tensors admitted by the space are also
calculated. All contractions of the $h$- and $v$-curvature tensors and the
$W$-tensors are derived. Second rank symmetric and skew-symmetric tensors,
which prove useful in physical applications, are singled out.

hydrodynamic Reynolds number Re is obtained for 1<Re<6700. In the limit Pm<<1,
Rm_c is ~3 times larger than for Pm>1. The stability curve Rm_c(Re) (and, it is
argued, the nature of the dynamo) is substantially different from the case of
the simulations and liquid-metal experiments with a mean flow. It is not as yet
possible to determine numerically whether the growth rate is ~Rm^{1/2} in the
limit Re>>Rm>>1, as should be the case if the dynamo is driven by the
inertial-range motions. The magnetic-energy spectrum in the low-Pm regime is
qualitatively different from the Pm>1 case and appears to develop a negative
spectral slope, although current resolutions are insufficient to determine its
asymptotic form. At 1<Rm<Rm_c, the magnetic fluctuations induced via the
tangling by turbulence of a weak mean field are investigated and the
possibility of a k^{-1} spectrum above the resistive scale is examined. At low
Rm<1, the induced fluctuations are well described by the quasistatic
approximation; the k^{-11/3} spectrum is confirmed for the first time in direct
numerical simulations.

making process of agents. The decision process depends on agent's

In addition, in some systems the size of agents can be highly heterogeneous

size of some agents poses challenging problems to agents who want to control
their impact, either by forcing the system in a given direction or by hiding
their intentionality. Here we consider the financial market as a model system,
and we study empirically how agents strategically adjust the properties of
large orders in order to meet their preference and minimize their impact. We
quantify this strategic behavior by detecting scaling relations of allometric
nature between the variables characterizing the trading activity of different
institutions. We observe power law distributions in the investment time
horizon, in the number of transactions needed to execute a large order and in
the traded value exchanged by large institutions and we show that heterogeneity
of agents is a key ingredient for the emergence of some aggregate properties
characterizing this complex system.

useful tool in the detection of the remote homologue protein families.
Unfortunately, their performance is not always satisfactory when proteins are
in the 'twilight zone'. We present HMMER-STRUCT, a model construction algorithm
and tool that tries to improve pHMM performance by using structural information
while training pHMMs. As a first step, HMMER-STRUCT constructs a set of pHMMs.
Each pHMM is constructed by weighting each residue in an aligned protein
according to a specific structural property of the residue. Properties used
were primary, secondary and tertiary structures, accessibility and packing.
HMMER-STRUCT then prioritizes the results by voting. Results: We used the SCOP
database to perform our experiments. Throughout, we apply leave-one-family-out
cross-validation over protein superfamilies. First, we used the MAMMOTH-mult
structural aligner to align the training set proteins. Then, we performed two
sets of experiments. In a first experiment, we compared structure weighted
models against standard pHMMs and against each other. In a second experiment,
we compared the voting model against individual pHMMs. We compare method

self consistency in hadron physics. The first example concerns the quark-mass
dependence of the baryon octet and decuplet masses. It is shown that within a
self consistent one-loop approach based on the chiral Lagrangian the
'mysterious' quark-mass dependence of the $\Xi$ mass predicted by the MILC
collaboration may be recovered in terms of a discontinuous chiral
extrapolation. This is a consequence of self consistency imposed on the partial
summation, i.e. the masses used in the loop functions are identical to those
obtained from the baryon self energies. In the second example we discuss recent
studies on the properties of D mesons in cold nuclear matter as they are
predicted by coupled-channel dynamics. Here a self consistent many-body
approach reveals the close interlink of the properties of D meson and
open-charm baryon resonances in nuclear matter. The relevance of exotic baryon
resonances for the spectral distortion of the $D_s^\pm$ in nuclear matter is
pointed out.

ceremoniously unveiled direct evidence of particle acceleration in SNRs to
energies approaching the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum. Nonthermal X-ray
emission from shell-type SNRs reveals multi-TeV electrons, and the dynamical
properties of several SNRs point to efficient acceleration of ions.
Observations of TeV gamma-ray emission have confirmed the presence of energetic
particles in several remnants as well, but there remains considerable debate as
to whether this emission originates with high energy electrons or ions. Equally
uncertain are the exact conditions that lead to efficient particle
acceleration.
  Based on the catalog of EGRET sources, we know that there is a large
population of Galactic gamma-ray sources whose distribution is similar to that
of SNRs. With the increased resolution and sensitivity of GLAST, the gamma-ray
SNRs from this population will be identified. Their detailed emission
structure, along with their spectra, will provide the link between their
environments and their spectra in other wavebands to constrain emission models
and to potentially identify direct evidence of ion acceleration in SNRs. Here I
summarize recent observational and theoretical work in the area of cosmic ray
acceleration by SNRs, and discuss the contributions GLAST will bring to our
understanding of this problem.

intermediate-mass stars and supernovae of both types, as well as the effect of
these objects on the energetics of the systems. For both galaxies, the model
that best fits the data contains an intense continuous galactic wind, occurring
at a rate proportional to the star formation rate. Models with a wind rate
assumed to be proportional only to the supernova rate also reproduce the
observed SMD, but do not match the gas mass, whereas the models with no
galactic winds fail to reproduce the observed SMDs. In the case of Ursa Minor,
the same model as in previous works reproduces the observed distribution very
well with no need to modify the main parameters of the model. The model for
Draco, on the other hand, is slightly modified. The observed SMD requires a
model with a lower supernova type Ia thermalization efficiency ($\eta_{SNeIa}$
= 0.5 instead of $\eta_{SNeIa}$ = 1.0) in order to delay the galactic wind,
whereas all the other parameters are kept the same. The model results, compared

play a very important role in the evolution of local dSphs.
