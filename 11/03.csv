Up to now only three intermediate long bursts, all with duration between ~15-30
minutes, have been recorded for SLX 1737-282. The properties of two
intermediate long X-ray bursts observed by INTEGRAL from SLX 1737-282 are

the Interstellar Medium (ISM) of the Galaxy. This distribution can be analyzed
by studying different molecular species along different sight lines whose
abundances are sensitive to the cosmic-ray ionization rate. Recently several
groups have reported an enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rate in diffuse clouds
compared to the standard value, zeta(average)=2.5e-17 s^-1, measured toward
dense molecular clouds. In an earlier work we reported an enhancement in the
cosmic ray rate of 20 towards HD185418. McCall et al. have reported
enhancements of 48 towards zeta Persei based on the observed abundance of
H$_{3}^+ while Le Petit et al. found a cosmic ray enhancement of ~10 to be
consistent with their models for this same sight line. Here we revisit zeta
Persei and perform a detailed calculation using a self-consistent treatment of
the hydrogen chemistry, grain physics, energy and ionization balance, and
excitation physics. We show that the value of zeta deduced from the H$_{3}^+$
column density in the diffuse region of the sightline depends strongly on the
properties of the grains because they remove free electrons and change the
hydrogen chemistry. The observations are largely consistent with a cosmic ray
enhancement of 40, with several diagnostics indicating higher values. This
underscores the importance of a full treatment of grain physics in studies of
interstellar chemistry.

materials in which precipitations of a known ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic or
antiferromagnetic compound account for magnetic characteristics at high
temperatures. The second class forms alloys showing chemical nano-scale phase
separation into the regions with small and large concentrations of the magnetic
constituent. To the third class belong (Ga,Mn)As, heavily doped p-(Zn,Mn)Te,
and related semiconductors. In these solid solutions the theory built on p-d
Zener's model of hole-mediated ferromagnetism and on either the Kohn-Luttinger
kp theory or the multi-orbital tight-binding approach describes qualitatively,
and often quantitatively many relevant properties. Finally, in a number of
carrier-doped DMS and DMO a competition between long-range ferromagnetic and
short-range antiferromagnetic interactions and/or the proximity of the
localisation boundary lead to an electronic nano-scale phase separation.

time-frequency resolution which is best suited to analyze data when in quest of
a signal of unknown shape, like a burst. In the other wavelet methods currently
employed, like LIGO WaveBurst, the analysis is performed at some trial
resolutions. We propose a decomposition which automatically selects at any
frequency the best resolution. The criterion for resolution selection is based
on minimization of a function of the data, named entropy in analogy with the
information theory. As a qualitative application we show how a multiresolution
time-frequency scalogram looks in the case of a sample signal injected over
Gaussian noise. For a more quantitative application of the method we tested its
efficiency as a non-linear filter of simulated data for burst searches, finding
that it is able to lower the false alarm rate of the WaveBurst algorithm with

threshold on the tolerable noise for formulas with 2-input gates and it is
theta. We conjecture that the same threshold also holds for circuits.

for steady and intermittent neutrino point sources, searches for dark matter
candidates, magnetic monopoles and other exotic particles, improvements in
analysis techniques, as well as future detector extensions.
  The IceCube observatory will be finalized in 2011 to form a cubic-kilometer
ice-Cherenkov detector at the location of the geographic South Pole. At the
present state of construction, IceCube consists of 52 paired IceTop surface
tanks and 22 IceCube strings with a total of 1426 Digital Optical Modules
deployed at depths up to 2350 m. The observatory also integrates the 19 string
AMANDA subdetector, that was completed in 2000 and extends IceCube's reach to
lower energies. Before the deployment of IceTop, cosmic air showers were
registered with the 30 station SPASE-2 surface array.
  IceCube's low noise Digital Optical Modules are very reliable, show a uniform
response and record waveforms of arriving photons that are resolvable with
nanosecond precision over a large dynamic range. Data acquisition,
reconstruction and simulation software are running in production mode and the
analyses, profiting from the improved data quality and increased overall
sensitivity, are well under way.

of the NS-$\alpha$ model using a lid-driven cavity flow at a Reynolds number of
10,000. Previously the NS-$\alpha$ model has only been used numerically in the
isotropic form. The subgrid model is developed from the Eulerian-averaged
anisotropic equations [Holm, \textit{Physica D}, v.133, pp 215-269, 1999]. It
was found that when $\alpha^{2}$ was based on the mesh numerical oscillations
developed which manifested themselves in the appearance of streamwise vortices
and a `mixing out' of the velocity profile. This is analogous to the
Craik-Leibovich mechanism, with the difference being that the oscillations here
are not physical but numerical. The problem could be traced back to the
discontinuity in $\alpha^{2}$ encountered when $\alpha^{2}=0$ on the endwalls.
An alternative definition of $\alpha^{2}$ based on velocity gradients, rather
than mesh spacing, is proposed and tested. Using this definition the results
with the model shown a significant improvement. The splitting of the downstream
wall jet, rms and shear stress profiles are correctly captured a coarse mesh.
The model is shown to predict both positive and negative energy transfer in the
jet impingement region, in qualitative agreement with DNS results.

polarizability are critical for predicting the permeation of ions inside

based on Density Functional Theory (DFT), accounts for the polarizability of
materials, water, and solutes, and it should be the method of choice for
predicting accurate electrostatic energies of ions. In practice, DFT coupled
with the use of periodic boundary conditions in a charged system leads to large
energy shifts. Results obtained using different DFT packages may vary because
of the way pseudopotentials and long-range electrostatics are implemented.
Using maximally localized Wannier functions, we apply robust corrections that
yield relatively unambiguous ion energies in select molecular and aqueous
systems and inside carbon nanotubes. Large binding energies are predicted for
ions in metallic carbon nanotube arrays, while with consistent definitions
Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ energies are found to exhibit asymmetries comparable with
those computed using non-polarizable water force fields.

we study the two-dimensional case, in particular we examine the effects of the

potential on the vortex formation. We find that many vortices are created by
instant removal of the optical potential regardless of relative phases, and
that fewer vortices are created if the intensity of the optical potential is
gradually ramped down and the condensed fragments gradually merge. In all
cases, self-annihilation of vortices of opposite charge is observed. We also
find that for sufficiently long barrier ramp times, the initial relative phases
between the fragments leave a clear imprint on the resulting topological

plastic or even super-plastic deformation. As GB sliding is a source of energy
dissipation in the material, mechanical loss measurements are well suited to
study such a mechanism. They reveal, in general, a mechanical loss peak, which
evolves into an exponential increase at higher temperature. When intergranular

we show that introducing carbon nanotubes in zirconia, in particular, reduces
drastically GB sliding and consequently the mechanical loss at high

high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and were related to the
reduction of superplasic flow through the boundaries, which should improve the

  Methods: We use the GOODS-MUSIC catalog, which provides multiband photometry
from the U--filter to the 8 mum Spitzer band for almost 15,000 galaxies with
either spectroscopic (for ~7 % of the sample) or photometric redshifts, and
apply a standard model fitting technique to estimate stellar masses. We then
repeat our calculations with fixed photometric redshifts excluding Spitzer
photometry and directly compare the outcomes to look for systematic deviations.
Finally we use our results to compute stellar mass functions and mass densities
up to redshift z = 5.
  Results: We find that stellar masses tend to be overestimated on average if
further constraining Spitzer data are not included into the analysis. Whilst
this trend is small up to intermediate redshifts z < 2.5 and falls within the
typical error in mass, the deviation increases strongly for higher redshifts
and reaches a maximum of a factor of three at redshift z = 3.5. Thus, up to
intermediate redshifts, results for stellar mass density are in good agreement
with values taken from literature calculated without additional Spitzer
photometry. At higher redshifts, however, we find a systematic trend towards
lower mass densities if Spitzer/IRAC data are included.

onions). Their dense packing induces a slight deviation from their prefered
circular or spherical shape. As a frustrated assembly of interacting bodies,
such a material evolves from one conformation to another through a succession
of discrete, topological events driven by finite external forces. As a result,
the material exhibits a finite yield threshold. The individual objects usually
evolve spontaneously (colloidal diffusion, object coalescence, molecular
diffusion), and the material properties under low or vanishing stress may alter
with time, a phenomenon known as aging. We neglect such effects to address the
simpler behaviour of (uncommon) immortal fluids: we construct a minimal, fully
tensorial, rheological model, equivalent to the (scalar) Bingham model.
Importantly, the model consistently describes the ability of such soft
materials to deform substantially in the elastic regime (be it compressible or
not) before they undergo (incompressible) plastic creep -- or viscous flow
under even higher stresses.

possible foreground population of stars somewhat older than the ONC. Stars
without infrared excesses (as detected with the IRAC instrument on the Spitzer

excess stars; this spread is mostly due to a blue-shifted population of stars
that may constitute a foreground population. We also identify some accreting
stars, based on H-alpha, that do not have detectable infrared excesses with
IRAC, and thus are potential transitional disk systems (objects with inner disk
holes). We propose that the substructure seen both in stellar and gaseous
component is the result of non-uniform gravitational collapse to a filamentary
distribution of gas. The spatial and kinematic correlation between the stellar

structure factors of the solvent dipolar orientations and density and continuum

the protein with force-field atomic charges and solvent structure factors
obtained from separate MD simulations of the homogeneous solvent. The MD

energies of electron transfer in the temperature range 280--310 K. We found
that continuum models universally underestimate solvation entropies, and a more
favorable agreement is reported between the microscopic calculations and MD

inhomogeneous structure of the solvation shell at the protein-water interface

partial dewetting of hydrophobic patches. Quantitative theories of

law of thermodynamics. In the framework of the approach different internal
dissipative channels of energy are taken in account in an explicit form,
namely, the thermal channel and channels of defect subsystems. The identity has
a perfect differential form what permits to introduce an extended
non-equilibrium state and use the good developed mathematical formalism of
equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The evolution of
non-equilibrium variables of a physical system are described by a Landau-based
equation set expressed through internal or different kinds of free energy
connected by means of the Legendre transforms. The accordance between the
different kinds of energy is possible owing to introduction of some trends into
the equation subset described the defect subsystems and having a nature of
structural viscosity. The possibilities of the approach are illustrated on the
example of quasibrittle solid damage and failure. Taking into account only one
type of defects (viz., microcracks) and mechanical parameters in an expansion
of free energy down to third powers in relative to average energy per
microcrack, the description of destruction of quasi-brittle solids during

star, leading to stochastic light-curves. In the stable regime, matter accretes
in ordered funnel streams and the light-curves are almost periodic. A star may
switch between these two regimes depending on the accretion rate and may thus
show alternate episodes of ordered pulsations and stochastic light-curves. In
the intermediate regime, both stochastic and ordered pulsations are observed.

there is a very similar flow which DOES appear to be connected to geometric
entropy. The new flow may find applications in black hole physics suggesting
for instance, new approaches to the Penrose inequality.

of a two dimensional closed surface under the Ricci flow. The physical
relevance of our study derives from the fact that, in general relativity the
area of apparent horizons is related to black hole entropy and the Hawking mass
of an asymptotic round 2-sphere is the ADM energy.We begin by considering the
special case of spherical symmetry to develop a physical feel for the geometric
quantities involved. We then consider a general asymptotically flat Riemannian

indicate that W33A has a FWHM size of approximately 120AU (0.030'') at 8 micron
which increases to 240AU at 13 micron, scales previously unexplored among
MYSOs. This observed trend is consistent with the temperature falling off with

visibility spectrum, the strong silicate feature and the shape of the mid
infrared spectral energy distribution (SED). For any powerlaw density
distribution, we find that the sizes (as implied by the visibilities) and the
stellar luminosity are incompatible. A reduction to a third of W33A's
previously adopted luminosity is required to match the visibilities; such a
reduction is consistent with new high resolution 70 micron data from Spitzer's

symmetry and increases in the AFM state. Second, the non-linear response to the
magnetic field are investigated on the basis of an effective model for CePt_3Si
which may be also applicable to CeRhSi_3 and CeIrSi_3. The role of
antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC), helical superconductivity,
anisotropic Fermi surfaces and AFM order are examined in the dominantly s-, p-

of superconducting (SC) order parameters in the p-wave state which enhances the
spin susceptibility and suppresses paramagnetic depairing effect in a
significant way. Therefore, the dominantly p-wave superconductivity admixed
with the s-wave order parameter is consistent with the paramagnetic properties
of CePt_3Si at ambient pressure. We propose some experiments which can
elucidate the novel pairing states in CePt_3Si as well as CeRhSi_3 and

existing data on regulation of cellular processes. Recent work can be roughly
classified into either dynamical models of well-described subsystems, or
coarse-grained descriptions of the topology of the molecular networks at the
scale of the whole organism. In order to bridge these two disparate approaches
one needs to develop simplified descriptions of dynamics and topological
measures which address the propagation of signals in molecular networks. Here,
we consider the directed network of protein regulation in E. coli,
characterizing its modularity in terms of its potential to transmit signals. We
demonstrate that the simplest measure based on identifying sub-networks of
strong components, within which each node could send a signal to every other
node, indeed partitions the network into functional modules. We then suggest
measures to quantify the cost and spread associated with sending a signal
between any particular pair of proteins. Thereby, we address the signalling
specificity within and between modules, and show that in the regulation of
E.coli there is a systematic reduction of the cost and spread for signals
traveling over more than two intermediate reactions.

Linear Collider (ILC) for probing the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(MSSM) via the sensitivity of the electroweak precision observables measured at
the ILC to quantum corrections. A particular focus is put on the effective
leptonic weak mixing angle, sin^2_theta_eff. The MSSM predictions take into
account the complete one-loop results including the full complex phase
dependence, all available MSSM two-loop corrections as well as the full
Standard Model (SM) results. We find that the anticipated experimental accuracy
at the ILC with GigaZ option may resolve the virtual effects of SUSY particles
even in scenarios where the SUSY particles are so heavy that they escape direct
detection at the LHC and the first phase of the ILC.

finite-size systems are reviewed, with a focus on the strongly correlated
regime of electrons in two-dimensional semicoductor quantum dots and trapped
ultracold bosonic atoms in harmonic traps. Throughout the review we emphasize
universal aspects and similarities of symmetry breaking found in these systems,
as well as in more traditional fields like nuclear physics and quantum
chemistry, which are characterized by very different interparticle forces. A
unified description of strongly correlated phenomena in finite systems of
repelling particles (whether fermions or bosons) is presented through the
development of a two-step method of symmetry breaking at the unrestricted
Hartree-Fock level and of subsequent symmetry restoration via post Hartree-Fock
projection techniques. Quantitative and qualitative aspects of the two-step
method are treated and validated by exact diagonalization calculations.
  Strongly-correlated phenomena emerging from symmetry breaking include: (I)
Chemical bonding, dissociation, and entanglement (at zero and finite magnetic
fields) in quantum dot molecules and in pinned electron molecular dimers formed
within a single anisotropic quantum dot. (II) Electron crystallization, with
particle localization on the vertices of concentric polygonal rings, and
formation of rotating electron molecules (REMs) in circular quantum dots. (III)
At high magnetic fields, the REMs are described by parameter-free analytic wave
functions, which are an alternative to the Laughlin and composite-fermion
approaches. (IV) Crystalline phases of strongly repelling bosons. In rotating
traps and in analogy with the REMs, such repelling bosons form rotating boson
molecules (RBMs).
