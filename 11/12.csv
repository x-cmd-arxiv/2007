key to solving the mystery of dark energy. Improving the calibration of SNe Ia
increases their power as cosmological standard candles. We find tentative
evidence for a correlation between the late-time lightcurve slope and the peak
luminosity of SNe Ia in the B band; brighter SNe Ia seem to have shallower
lightcurve slopes between 100 and 150 days from maximum light. Using a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo analysis in calibrating SNe Ia, we are able to simultaneously
take into consideration the effect of dust extinction, the luminosity and
lightcurve width correlation (parametrized by \Delta m_{15}), and the
luminosity and late-time lightcurve slope correlation. For the available sample
of 11 SNe Ia with well-measured late-time lightcurves, we find that correcting
for the correlation between luminosity and late-time lightcurve slope of the
SNe Ia leads to an intrinsic dispersion of 0.12 mag in the Hubble diagram. Our
results have significant implications for future supernova surveys aimed to
illuminate the nature of dark energy.

  Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  The problem of channel code design for the $M$-ary input AWGN channel with
additive $Q$-ary interference where the sequence of i.i.d. interference symbols
is known causally at the encoder is considered. The code design criterion at
high SNR is derived by defining a new distance measure between the input
symbols of the Shannon's \emph{associated} channel. For the case of
binary-input channel, i.e., M=2, it is shown that it is sufficient to use only
two (out of $2^Q$) input symbols of the \emph{associated} channel in the
encoding as far as the distance spectrum of code is concerned. This reduces the
problem of channel code design for the binary-input AWGN channel with known
interference at the encoder to design of binary codes for the binary symmetric
channel where the Hamming distance among codewords is the major factor in the
performance of the code.

The time-dependent spectra of the delayed emission are evaluated for a wide

wavelength of the layer undulation mode. It turns out that an unlocking of the
layer normal and the director reduces the layer bending rigidity for
wavelengths smaller than the director penetration length. In the achiral

between the layer displacement and director. The effective layer bending
rigidity is calculated as a function of the angle $\vartheta$ between the layer
undulation wave-vector and the director field. We compute the free energy
minimizer $\vartheta=\theta$. It turns out that $\theta$ varies from $0\deg$ to
$90\deg$ depending on the tilt angle, undulation wave-length and other elastic

appear to be either of heliospheric or solar wind origin. Likewise, the NPI
instrument on Mars Express has revealed streams of neutral atoms with different
properties than those observed by NPD. Independently, IMAGE/LENA has reported
neutral atom observations that may be interpreted as a ""secondary stream""
having different characteristics and flowing from a higher ecliptic longitude
than the nominal upstream direction. Both sets of observations do not appear to
fit in easily with the neutral atom environment from 1.0-1.57 AU as it is
currently understood. In this paper we examine some highly suggestive
similarities in the IMAGE/LENA and Mars Express/ASPERA-3/NPI data to try to
determine potential origins for the observed signal.

variant of the problem of efficiently maintaining dynamic rooted trees. This
variant requires merging two paths in a single operation. In contrast to the
standard problem, in which only one tree arc changes at a time, a single merge
operation can change many arcs. In spite of this, we develop a data structure
that supports merges on an n-node forest in O(log^2 n) amortized time and all
other standard tree operations in O(log n) time (amortized, worst-case, or
randomized depending on the underlying data structure). For the special case
that occurs in the motivating application, in which arbitrary arc deletions
(cuts) are not allowed, we give a data structure with an O(log n) time bound
per operation. This is asymptotically optimal under certain assumptions. For
the even-more special case in which both cuts and parent queries are
disallowed, we give an alternative O(log n)-time solution that uses standard
dynamic trees as a black box. This solution also applies to the motivating
application. Our methods use previous work on dynamic trees in various ways,
but the analysis of each algorithm requires novel ideas. We also investigate
lower bounds for the problem under various assumptions.

be high-Tc superconductors (HTSCs), and similar anomalous transport phenomena
have been observed in metals near their antiferromagnetic (AF) quantum critical
point (QCP). Here, we develop a transport theory involving resistivity and Hall
coefficient on the basis of the microscopic Fermi liquid theory, by considering
the current vertex correction (CVC). In nearly AF Fermi liquids, the CVC
accounts for the significant enhancements in the Hall coefficient,
magnetoresistance, thermoelectric power, and Nernst coefficient in nearly AF
metals. According to the numerical study, aspects of anomalous transport
phenomena in HTSC are explained in a unified way by considering the CVC,
without introducing any fitting parameters; this strongly supports the idea
that HTSCs are Fermi liquids with strong AF fluctuations. In addition, the
striking \omega-dependence of the AC Hall coefficient and the remarkable
effects of impurities on the transport coefficients in HTSCs appear to fit
naturally into the present theory. The present theory also explains very
similar anomalous transport phenomena occurring in CeCoIn5 and CeRhIn5, which
is a heavy-fermion system near the AF QCP, and in the organic superconductor
\kappa-(BEDT-TTF).

unitary evolution operator to a Hilbert space corresponding to the graph.
Hitting times for discrete quantum walks on graphs give an average time before
the walk reaches an ending condition. We derive an expression for hitting time
using superoperators, and numerically evaluate it for the walk on the hypercube
for various coins and decoherence models. We show that, by contrast to
classical walks, quantum walks can have infinite hitting times for some initial
states. We seek criteria to determine if a given walk on a graph will have
infinite hitting times, and find a sufficient condition for their existence.
The phenomenon of infinite hitting times is in general a consequence of the
symmetry of the graph and its automorphism group. Symmetries of a graph, given
by its automorphism group, can be inherited by the evolution operator. Using
the irreducible representations of the automorphism group, we derive conditions
such that quantum walks defined on this graph must have infinite hitting times
for some initial states. Symmetry can also cause the walk to be confined to a
subspace of the original Hilbert space for certain initial states. We show that
a quantum walk confined to the subspace corresponding to this symmetry group
can be seen as a different quantum walk on a smaller quotient graph and we give
an explicit construction of the quotient graph. We conjecture that the
existence of a small quotient graph with finite hitting times is necessary for
a walk to exhibit a quantum speed-up. Finally, we use symmetry and the theory
of decoherence-free subspaces to determine when the subspace of the quotient
graph is a decoherence-free subspace of the dynamics.

in extensive plastic deformation failure of two-dimensional sheets of amorphous
media, were discussed in the context of the athermal Shear-Transformation-Zones
(STZ) theory. These modes pertain to perfect circular symmetry of the cavity
and the stress conditions. In this paper we study the shape stability of the
expanding circular cavity against perturbations, in both the unbounded and the
bounded growth regimes (for the latter the unperturbed theory predicts no
catastrophic failure). Since the unperturbed reference state is time dependent,
the linear stability theory cannot be cast into standard time-independent
eigenvalue analysis. The main results of our study are: (i) sufficiently small
perturbations are stable, (ii) larger perturbations within the formal linear
decomposition may lead to an instability; this dependence on the magnitude of
the perturbations in the linear analysis is a result of the non-stationarity of
the growth, (iii) the stability of the circular cavity is particularly
sensitive to perturbations in the effective disorder temperature; in this
context we highlight the role of the rate sensitivity of the limiting value of
this effective temperature. Finally we point to the importance of the form of
the stress-dependence of the rate of STZ transitions. The present analysis
indicates the importance of nonlinear effects that were not taken into account
yet. Even more importantly, the analysis suggests that details of the
constitutive relations appearing in the theory can be constrained by the modes
of macroscopic failure in these amorphous systems.

a relativistically hot gas with or without shocks in astrophysical processes of
stellar core collapse, formation of compact objects, and supernova remnants
with central voids. The model system is taken to be spherically symmetric and
the conservation of specific entropy along streamlines is adopted for a
relativistic hot gas. In terms of equation of state, this leads to a polytropic
index $\gamma=4/3$. The conventional polytropic gas of $P=\kappa\rho^\gamma$,
where $P$ is the thermal pressure, $\rho$ is the mass density, $\gamma$ is the
polytropic index, and $\kappa$ is a global constant, is included in our
theoretical model framework. Two qualitatively different solution classes arise
according to the values of a simple power-law scaling index $a$, each of which
is analyzed separately and systematically. We obtain new asymptotic solutions
that exist only for $\gamma=4/3$. Global and asymptotic solutions in various
limits as well as eigensolutions across sonic critical lines are derived
analytically and numerically with or without shocks. By specific entropy
conservation along streamlines, we extend the analysis of Goldreich & Weber for
a distribution of variable specific entropy with time $t$ and radius $r$ and
discuss consequences in the context of a homologous core collapse prior to
supernovae. As an alternative rebound shock model, we construct an Einstein-de
Sitter explosion with shock connections with various outer flows including a
static outer part of a singular polytropic sphere (SPS). Under the joint action
of thermal pressure and self-gravity, we can also construct self-similar
solutions with central spherical voids with sharp density variations along
their edges.

Sequence lifetime results from an interplay between meridional circulation

key role in determining for each metallicity, a limiting range of initial

defined over the fraction field $K$ of a complete d.v.r. $R$, every tamely
ramified extension $K'/K$ with Galois group $G$ induces a $G$-action on
$X_{K'}$. In this paper we study the extension of this $G$-action to certain
regular models of $X_{K'}$. In particular, we obtain a formula for the Brauer
trace of the endomorphism induced by a group element on the alternating sum of
the cohomology groups of the structure sheaf of the special fiber of such a
regular model. Inspired by this global study, we also consider similar
questions for Galois actions on the exceptional locus of a tame cyclic quotient
singularity.
  We apply these results to study a natural filtration of the special fiber of
the N\'eron model of the Jacobian of $X$ by closed, unipotent subgroup schemes.
We show that the jumps in this filtration only depend on the fiber type of the
special fiber of the minimal regular model with strict normal crossings for $X$
over $\Spec(R)$, and in particular are independent of the residue
characteristic. Furthermore, we obtain information about where these jumps
occur. We also compute the jumps for each of the finitely many possible fiber

been traced from the perfectly rigid rod limit till very flexible particles,
and from the high density region till the isotropic phase. From the perfectly
rigid rod limit and enhancing the internal flexibility, the range of the
smectic A phase is squeezed out by the concomitant action of the scarcely
affected crystalline phase at higher density and the nematic phase at lower
density, until it disappears. These results confirm the supposition, drawn from
previous theoretical, simulational and experimental studies, that the smectic A
phase is destabilized by introducing and enhancing the degree of particle
internal flexibility. However, no significant changes in the order of
nematic--to--smectic A phase transition, which appears always first order, nor
in the value of the layer spacing, are observed upon varying the degree of
particle internal flexibility. Moreover, no evidence of a columnar phase, which
was tought of as a possible superseder of the smectic A phase in flexible rods,

as a stationary bound state in a temperature-dependent real potential, but as a
short-lived transient, with an exponentially decaying wave function. The reason
is the existence of an imaginary part in the pertinent static potential,
signalling the ``disappearance'', due to inelastic scatterings with hard
particles in the plasma, of the off-shell gluons that bind the quarks together.
By solving the corresponding Schr\""odinger equation, we estimate numerically
the near-threshold spectral functions in scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and axial
vector channels, as a function of the temperature and of the heavy quark mass.
In particular, we point out a subtlety in the determination of the scalar
channel spectral function and, resolving it to the best of our understanding,
suggest that at least in the bottomonium case, a resonance peak can be observed
also in the scalar channel, even though it is strongly suppressed with respect
to the peak in the vector channel. Finally, we plot the physical dilepton
production rate, stressing that despite the eventual disappearance of the
resonance peak from the corresponding spectral function, the quarkonium
contribution to the dilepton rate becomes more pronounced with increasing
temperature, because of the yield from free heavy quarks.

theory of orthogonal matrix polynomials satisfying second order differential
equations. The last few years have witnessed some examples of a (fixed) family
of orthogonal matrix polynomials whose elements are common eigenfunctions of
several linearly independent second order differential operators. We show that
the dual situation is also possible: there are examples of different families
of matrix polynomials, each family orthogonal with respect to a different
weight matrix, whose elements are eigenfunctions of a common second order
differential operator.
  These examples are constructed by adding a discrete mass at certain point to
a weight matrix: $\widetilde{W}=W+\delta_{t_0}M(t_0)$. Our method consists in
showing how to choose the discrete mass $M(t_0)$, the point $t_0$ where the
mass lives and the weight matrix $W$ so that the new weight matrix
$\widetilde{W}$ inherits some of the symmetric second order differential
operators associated with $W$. It is well known that this situation is not
possible for the classical scalar families of Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi.

consistent with an axisymmetric shape.

the central kinematics of the ionised gas, obtained with the integral-field
spectrograph SAURON. We introduce a new way of correcting the observed
velocities of the ionised gas for asymmetric drift, and hereby disentangle the
random motions of the gas caused by gravitational interaction from those caused
by turbulence. To reproduce the observed flat rotation curve of the HI gas, we
need to include a dark halo in our mass models. A pseudo-isothermal sphere
provides the best model to fit our data, but we also tested an NFW halo and
Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), which fit the data marginally worse.

networks relevant to the investigation of systemic risk control in financial
networks. In the model, the hypothesis of a trend reinforcement in the
stochastic process describing the fragility of the nodes, induces a trade-off
in the systemic risk with respect to the density of the network. Increasing the
average link density, the network is first less exposed to systemic risk, while
above an intermediate value the systemic risk increases. This result offers a
simple explanation for the emergence of instabilities in financial systems that
get increasingly interwoven. In this paper, we study the dynamics of the
probability density function of the average fragility. This converges to a
unique stable distribution which can be computed numerically and can be used to
estimate the systemic risk as a function of the parameters of the model.

problem has been a severe obstacle for using GRBs as cosmological candles. In
this paper, we present a new method to deal with such a problem in MCMC global
fitting analysis. Assuming that a certain type of correlations between
different observables exists in a subsample of GRBs, for the parameters
involved in the correlation relation, we treat them as free parameters and
determine them simultaneously with cosmological parameters through MCMC
analysis on GRB data together with other observational data. Then the circular
problem is naturally eliminated in this procedure. We take the Ghirlanda
relation as an example while keeping in mind the debate about its physical
validity. Together with SNe Ia, WMAP and SDSS data, we include 27 GRBs with the
reported Ghirlanda relation in our study, and perform MCMC global fitting. We
consider the $\Lambda$CDM model and dynamical dark energy models. In each case,
in addition to the constraints on the relevant cosmological parameters, we
obtain the best fit values as well as the distributions of the correlation
parameters $A$ and $C$. We find that the observational data sets other than
GRBs can affect $A$ and $C$ considerably through their degeneracies with the
cosmological parameters. The results on $A$ and $C$ for different cosmological
models are in well agreement within $1\sigma$ range. The best fit value of $A$
in all models being analyzed is $A\sim 1.53$ with $\sigma \sim 0.08$. For $C$,
we have the best value in the range of $0.94-0.98$ with $\sigma\sim 0.1$. It is
also noted that the distributions of $A$ and $C$ are generally broader than the
priors used in many studies in literature. (Abriged)

fluctuations produced during inflation and leave their imprint on the cosmic

(Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) data show no evidence for the particular
signature considered in this work but give an upper bound on the parameters of
the model. However, a hypothetical experiment shows that with proper data, the
trans-Planckian effects should be detectable through alternate sampling
methods. This fuzzy conclusion is a result of the nature of the oscillations,
since they give rise to a likelihood hypersurface riddled with local maxima. A
simple Bayesian analysis shows no significant evidence for the simulated data
to prefer a trans-Planckian model. Conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods are not suitable for exploring this complicated landscape, but
alternative methods are required to solve the problem. This, however, requires
extremely high-precision data.

finite fraction of walks drift off to infinity for b<b_c. They rely on rigorous
results obtained for biased walks on Galton-Watson (GW) trees to calculate b_c,
and give arguments indicating that this result should also hold for random
graphs such as Erdos-Renyi (ER) graphs and Molloy-Reed (MR) graphs. To validate
their prediction, they show by numerical simulations that the mean return time

transition around the expected b_c.
