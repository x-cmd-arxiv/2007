consisting of 691 absorption systems in the spectra of 310 QSOs including 170
pairings. All these absorption systems have metal lines, usually C IV or Mg II.
We see 17 cases of absorption in one line-of-sight within 200 km/s (1 Mpc) of
absorption in the paired line-of-sight with the probability at least approx 50%
at 100kpc, declining rapidly to 23% at 100 - 200 kpc. We detect clustering on
0.5Mpc scales and see a hint of the ""fingers of God"" redshift-space distortion.
The distribution matches absorbers arising in galaxies at z=2 with a normal
correlation function and systematic infall velocities but unusually low random
pair-wise velocity differences. Absorption in gas flowing out from galaxies at
a mean velocity of 250 km/s would produce vastly more elongation than we see.
The UV absorption from fast winds that Adelberger et al. 2005 see in spectra of
LBGs is not representative of the absorption that we see. Either the winds are
confined to LBGs, or they can not extend to 40 kpc with large velocities, while
continuing to make UV absorption we see, implying most metals were in place in
the IGM long before z=2. Separately, when we examine the absorption seen when a
sight line passes a second QSO, we see 19 absorbers within 400 km/s of the
partner QSO. The probability of seeing absorption is approximately constant for
impact parameters 0.1 - 1.5 Mpc. Perhaps we do not see a rapid rise in the
probability at small impact parameters because the UV from QSOs destroys some
absorbers near to the QSOs. The 3D distribution of 64 absorbers around 313 QSOs
is to first order isotropic, with just a hint of the anisotropy expected if the
QSO UV emission is beamed, or alternatively QSOs might emit UV isotropically
but for a surprisingly short time of only 0.3Myr.

emitting sources such as galaxies and quasars. The emitted Lya radiation is
often scattered by surrounding neutral hydrogen atoms. We show that the
scattered Lya radiation obtains a high level of polarization for a wide range
of likely environments of high-redshift galaxies. For example, the
back-scattered Lya flux observed from galaxies surrounded by a superwind-driven
outflow may reach a fractional polarization as high as ~40%. Equal levels of
polarization may be observed from neutral collapsing protogalaxies. Resonant
scattering in the diffuse intergalactic medium typically results in a lower
polarization amplitude (<7%), which depends on the flux of the ionizing
background. Spectral polarimetry can differentiate between Lya scattering off
infalling gas and outflowing gas; for an outflow the polarization should
increase towards longer wavelengths while for infall the opposite is true. Our
numerical results suggest that Lya polarimetry is feasible with existing
instruments, and may provide a new diagnostic of the distribution and
kinematics of neutral hydrogen around high-redshift galaxies. Moreover,
polarimetry may help suppress infrared lines originating in the Earth's
atmosphere, and thus improve the sensitivity of ground-based observations to
high-redshift Lya emitting galaxies outside the currently available redshift
windows.

plus an inherent feature of the SSC (synchro-self-Compton) process of blazar
emission. First, flux dimming introduces a bias that favors detection of
progressively more flaring sources at higher redshifts. According to mainstream
SSC models, more flaring source states imply sources with flatter TeV slopes.
This results in a structured relation between intrinsic TeV slope and redshift.
The second effect, spectral steepening by intergalactic absorption, affects
sources progressively with distance and effectively wipes out the intrinsic
slope-redshift correlation.

  radius","submitted to ApJL",,"10.1086/529492",,"astro-ph",,"  Two methods are used to observationally determine the solar radius: One is
the observation of the intensity profile at the limb, the other one uses f-mode
frequencies to derive a 'seismic' solar radius which is then corrected to
optical depth unity. The two methods are inconsistent and lead to a difference
in the solar radius of $\sim$0.3 Mm. Because of the geometrical extention of
the solar photosphere and the increased path lengths of tangential rays the Sun
appears to be larger to an observer who measures the extent of the solar disk.
Based on radiative transfer calculations we show that this discrepancy can be
explained by the difference between the height at disk center where
$\tau_{\mathrm{5000}}=1$ ($\tau_{\mathrm{Ross}}=2/3$) and the inflection point
of the intensity profile on the limb. We calculate the intensity profile of the
limb for the MDI continuum and the continuum at 5000 {\AA} for two atmosphere
structures and compare the position of the inflection points with the radius at
$\tau_{\mathrm{5000}}=1$ ($\tau_{\mathrm{Ross}}=2/3$). The calculated
difference between the 'seismic' radius and the inflection point is $0.347\pm
0.06$ Mm with respect to $\tau_{\mathrm{5000}}=1$ and $0.333\pm 0.08$ Mm with
respect to $\tau_{\mathrm{Ross}}=2/3$. We conclude that the standard solar
radius in evolutionary models has to be lowered by $0.333\pm 0.08$ Mm and is
695.66 Mm. Furthermore, this correction reconciles inflection point
measurements and the 'seismic' radii within the uncertainty.

ionized mass of (3.3+/-1.1)x10^3 Mo based on the radio continuum data at 4.9

The HI structure is 10.0+/-1.7 pc in radius, has a neutral mass of 1500+/-500
Mo, and is expanding at 11 km/s. The associated molecular gas amounts to
1.1+/-0.5)x10^5 Mo, being its volume density of about 350 cm^3. This molecular
shell could represent the remains of the cloud where the young open cluster
NGC3324 was born or could have originated by the shock front associated with
the HII region. The difference between the ambient density and the electron
density of the HII region suggests that the HII region is expanding. The
distributions of the ionized and molecular material, along with that of the
emission in the MSX band A, suggest that a photodissociation region has
developed at the interface between the ionized and molecular gas. The
characteristics of a relatively large number of the IRAS, MSX, and 2MASS point
sources projected onto the molecular envelope are compatible with protostellar
candidates, showing the presence of active star forming regions. Very probably,
the expansion of the HII region has triggered stellar formation in the
molecular shell.

burns, or simply dilutes, the remaining hydrogen atmosphere. But despite its
success in matching the photospheric abundances of these stars, this scenario
is faced with several observational challenges. A binary scenario is proposed
here as a more natural way to face some of the most stringent observational

during a common envelope on the AGB, suffers a last helium shell flash, which
results in a H-deficient primary with some of the characteristics needed to

regions of the Galaxy, we aim to obtain new insights into the properties of the
offset dust lanes leading the bar's major axis in the Milky Way. On the one
hand, the molecular emission of the dust lanes is extracted from the observed
CO l-b-V distribution according to the interpretation of a dynamical model. On
the other hand, a three dimensional extinction map of the Galactic central
region constructed from near-infrared observations is used as a tracer of the
dust itself and clearly reveals dust lanes in its face-on projection.
Comparison of the position of both independent detections of the dust lanes is
performed in the (l, b) plane. These two completely independent methods are
used to provide a coherent picture of the dust lanes in the Milky Way bar. In
both the gas and dust distributions, the dust lanes are found to be out of the
Galactic plane, appearing at negative latitudes for l > 0 deg and at positive
latitudes for l < 0 deg. However, even though there is substantial overlap
between the two components, they are offset from one another with the dust
appearing to lie closer to the b = 0 deg plane. Two scenarios are proposed to
explain the observed offset. The first involves grain destruction by the bar
shock and reformation downstream. Due to the decrease in velocity caused by the
shock, this occurs at lower z. The second assumes that the gas and dust remain
on a common tilted plane, but that the molecular gas decouples from the Milky
Way's magnetic field, itself strong enough to resist the shear of the bar's
shock. The diffuse gas and dust remain coupled to the field and are carried
further downstream. This second scenario has recently been suggested in order
to explain observations of the barred galaxy NGC 1097.

leading medium-enhanced higher twist corrections which describe the multiple
scattering of the jet in the nucleus are re-summed to all orders of twist. The
propagation of the jet in the absence of further radiative energy loss is shown
to be governed by a transverse momentum diffusion equation. We compute the
final photon spectrum in the limit of soft photons, taking into account the
leading and next-to-leading terms in the photon momentum fraction y. In this
limit, the photon spectrum in a physical gauge is shown to arise from two
interfering sources: one where the initial hard scattering produces an
off-shell quark which immediately radiates the photon and then undergoes
subsequent soft re-scattering; alternatively the quark is produced on-shell and
propagates through the medium until it is driven off-shell by re-scattering and
radiates the photon. Our result has a simple formal structure as a product of
the photon splitting function, the quark transverse momentum distribution
coming from a diffusion equation and a dimensionless factor which encodes the
effect of the interferences encountered by the propagating quark over the
length of the medium. The destructive nature of such interferences in the small
y limit are responsible for the origin of the Landau-Pomeranchuck-Migdal (LPM)
effect. Along the way we also discuss possible implications for quark jets in

  We also find an intimate link between the cosmic tidal field and the void
orientations. Over a very wide range of scales we find a coherent and strong
alignment of the voids with the tidal field computed from the smoothed density
distribution. This orientation-tide alignment remains significant on scales
exceeding twice the typical void size, which shows that the long range external

obtained. We compare the results of our observations to the results from two
previous simultaneous multiwavelength campaigns on PKS 2155-304. We conclude
that the correlation between the X-ray and UV/optical variability is strongest
and the time lag is shortest (only a few hours) when the object is brightest.
As the object becomes fainter, the correlations are weaker and the lags longer,
increasing to a few days. Based on the results of four campaigns, we find
evidence for a linear relationship between the mean optical brightness and lag
time of X-ray and UV/optical events. Furthermore, we assert that this behavior,
along with the different multiwavelength flare lag times across different flux
states is consistent with a highly relativistic shock propagating down the jet
producing the flares observed during a high state. In a quiescent state, the
variability is likely to be due to a number of factors including both the jet
and contributions outside of the jet, such as the accretion disk.

specific requirements concerning annotation needs. Based on these requirements,
we propose an annotation model, inspired from the Speech Act Theory (SAT) to
support communication in a 3D digital environment. We define two types of
annotations in the engineering design context, locutionary and illocutionary
annotations. The annotations we describe in this paper are materialised by a
set of digital artefacts, which have a semantic dimension allowing
express/record elements of technical justifications, traces of contradictory
debates, etc. In this paper, we first clarify the semantic annotation concept,
and we define general properties of annotations in the engineering design
context, and the role of annotations in different design project situations.
After the description of the case study, where we observe and analyse
annotations usage during the design reviews and minute making, the last section
is dedicated to present our approach. We then describe the SAT concept, and
define the concept of annotation acts. We conclude with a description of basic
annotation functionalities that are actually implemented in a software, based

decoding, due to Forney, is revisited. Instead of using Jensen's inequality as
well as some other inequalities in the derivation, we demonstrate that an
exponentially tight analysis can be carried out by assessing the relevant
moments of a certain distance enumerator. The resulting bound has the following
advantages: (i) it is at least as tight as Forney's bound, (ii) under certain
symmetry conditions associated with the channel and the random coding
distribution, it is simpler than Forney's bound in the sense that it involves
an optimization over one parameter only (rather than two), and (iii) in certain
special cases, like the binary symmetric channel (BSC), the optimum value of
this parameter can be found in closed form, and so, there is no need to conduct
a numerical search. We have not found yet, however, a numerical example where
this new bound is strictly better than Forney's bound. This may provide an
additional evidence to support Forney's conjecture that his bound is tight for
the average code. We believe that the technique we suggest in this paper can be
useful in simplifying, and hopefully also improving, exponential error bounds

young planets, as well as investigating the origin of the brown dwarf desert.
As part of this survey, we discovered large-amplitude, periodic, radial
velocity variations in the spectrum of the weak line T Tauri star LkCa 19.
Using line bisector analysis and a new simulation of the effect of star spots
on the photometric and radial velocity variability of T Tauri stars, we show
that our measured radial velocities for LkCa19 are fully consistent with
variations caused by the presence of large star spots on this rapidly rotating
young star. These results illustrate the level of activity-induced radial
velocity noise associated with at least some very young stars. This
activity-induced noise will set lower limits on the mass of a companion
detectable around LkCa 19, and similarly active young stars.

distance along the line-of-sight corresponds to an earlier cosmic time at which
the properties of the surveyed galaxy population may change. The effect of
observing a survey volume along the light-cone must be considered in the regime
where the mass function of galaxies varies exponentially with redshift. This
occurs when the halos under consideration are rare, that is either when they
are very massive or observed at high-redshift. While the effect of the
light-cone is negligible for narrow-band surveys of Lyman-alpha emitters, it
can be significant for drop-out surveys of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) where
the selection functions of the photometric bands are broad. Since there are
exponentially more halos at the low-redshift end of the survey, the
low-redshift tail of the selection function contains a disproportionate
fraction of the galaxies observed in the survey. This leads to a redshift
probability distribution (RPD) for the dropout LBGs with a mean less than that
of the photometric selection function (PHSF) by an amount of order the standard
deviation of the PHSF. The inferred mass function of galaxies is then shallower
than the true mass function at a single redshift with the abundance at the
high-mass end being twice or more as large as expected. Moreover, the
statistical moments of the count of galaxies calculated ignoring the light-cone
effect, deviate from the actual values.

paper, we constrain X-ray outbursts with harder spectra, higher redshifts, and
lower luminosities than have been studied previously. We performed a systematic
survey of 24668 optical galaxies in the Chandra Deep Fields to search for such
X-ray outbursts; the median redshift of these galaxies is ~0.8. The survey
spans 798 days for the Chandra Deep Field-North, and 1828 days for the Chandra
Deep Field-South. No outbursts were found, and thus we set upper limits on the
rate of such events in the Universe, which depend upon the adopted outburst
X-ray luminosity. For an outburst with X-ray luminosity $\ga 10^{43}$ ergs/s
and a duration of 6 months, the upper limit on its event rate is ~10^{-4}
/galaxy/yr, roughly consistent with theoretical predictions. Compared to
previous survey results, our harder-band and deeper survey suggests that the
outburst rate may increase by a maximum factor of 10 when considering both
obscured X-ray outbursts and redshift evolution from z~0 to z~0.8. Our results
also suggest that the X-ray luminosity function for moderate-luminosity active
galactic nuclei is not primarily due to stellar tidal disruptions.

hadronic interactions of cosmic rays (CRs) including resonances and heavier
secondaries. For this purpose we use the same ethodology discussed earlier
\cite{Huang07}, namely the Monte Carlo particle collision code DPMJET3.04 to
determine the multiplicity spectra of various secondary particles with leptons
as the final decay states, that result from inelastic collisions of cosmic-ray
protons and Helium nuclei with the interstellar medium of standard composition.
By combining the simulation results with parametric models for secondary
particle (with resonances included) for incident cosmic-ray energies below a
few GeV, where DPMJET appears unreliable, we thus derive production matrices
for all stable secondary particles in cosmic-ray interactions with energies up
to about 10 PeV. We apply the production matrices to calculate the radio
synchrotron radiation of secondary electrons in a young shell-type SNR, RX
J1713.7-3946, which is a measure of the age, the spectral index of hadronic
cosmic rays, and most importantly the magnetic field strength. We find that the
multi-mG fields recently invoked to explain the X-ray flux variations are
unlikely to extend over a large fraction of the radio-emitting region,
otherwise the spectrum of hadronic cosmic rays in the energy window 0.1-100 GeV
must be unusually hard. We also use the production matrices to calculate the
muon event rate in an IceCube-like detector that are induced by muon neutrinos
from high-energy $\gamma$-ray sources such as RX J1713.7-3946, Vela Jr. and
MGRO J2019+37. At muon energies of a few TeV, or in other word, about 10 TeV

medium (IGM) at z = 2. We follow statistics of the cold dark matter (CDM) and
the Lya absorption. We find that the larger boxes have fewer pixels with
significant absorption (flux < 0.96) and more pixels in longer stretches with
little or no absorption, and they have wider Lya lines. We trace these effect
back to the additional power in larger boxes from longer wavelength modes. The
IGM in our larger boxes is hotter, from increased pressure heating due to
faster hydrodynamical infall. When we increase the photoheating in smaller
boxes to compensate, their Lya statistics change to mimic those of a box of
twice the size. Statistics converge towards their value in the largest (76.8
Mpc) box, except for the most common value of the CDM density which continues
to rise. When we compare to errors with data, we find that our 76.8 Mpc box is
larger than we need for the mean flux, barely large enough for the column
density distribution and the power spectrum of the flux, and too small for the
line widths. This box with 75 kpc cells has approximately the same mean flux as
QSO spectra, but the Lya lines are too wide by 2.6 km/s, there are too few
lines with log H I column densities > 10^17 cm^-2, and the power of the flux is
too low by 20 - 50%, from small to large scales. Four times smaller cell size
does not resolve these differences, nor do simple changes to the ultraviolet
background that drives the H and He II ionization. It is hard to see how
simulations using popular cosmological and astrophysical parameters can match
Lyman-alpha forest data at z=2.

103 Beta Cephei stars, nearly doubling the number of previously known stars of

have modes equidistant or nearly equidistant in frequency. In addition, we
found five Beta Cephei stars that show low-frequency periodic variations, very
likely due to pulsations. We therefore regard them as candidate hybrid Beta
Cephei/SPB pulsators. All these stars are potentially very useful for seismic
modeling. Moreover, we found Beta Cephei-type pulsations in three late O-type

the emerging species cluster around different locations in phenotype space, How
such multimodal patterns in phenotype space can emerge from a single ancestral
species is a fundamental question in biology. Frequency-dependent competition
is one potential mechanism for such pattern formation, as has previously been
shown in models based on the theory of adaptive dynamics. Here we demonstrate
that also in models similar to those used in quantitative genetics, phenotype
distributions can split into multiple modes under the force of
frequency-dependent competition. In sexual populations, this requires
assortative mating, and we show that the multimodal splitting of initially
unimodal distributions occurs over a range of assortment parameters. In
addition, assortative mating can be favoured evolutionarily even if it incurs
costs, because it provides a means of alleviating the effects of frequency
dependence. Our results reveal that models at both ends of the spectrum between
essentially monomorphic (adaptive dynamics) and fully polymorphic (quantitative
genetics) yield similar results. This underscores that frequency-dependent
selection is a strong agent of pattern formation in phenotype distributions,
potentially resulting in adaptive speciation.

clouds is used to attempt discrimination between grain alignment mechanisms in
dense regions of the ISM. Background field stars are used to probe polarization
efficiency in quiescent regions of dark clouds, yielding a dependence on visual
extinction well-represented by a power law. No significant change in this
behavior is observed in the transition region between the diffuse outer layers
and dense inner regions of clouds, where icy mantles are formed, and we
conclude that mantle formation has little or no effect on the efficiency of
grain alignment. Young stellar objects generally exhibit greater polarization
efficiency compared with field stars at comparable extinctions, displaying
enhancements by factors of up to 6. Of the proposed alignment mechanisms, that
based on radiative torques appears best able to explain the data. The
attenuated external radiation field accounts for the observed polarization in
quiescent regions, and radiation from the embedded stars themselves may enhance
alignment in the lines of sight to YSOs. Enhancements in polarization
efficiency observed in the ice features toward several YSOs are of greatest
significance, as they demonstrate efficient alignment in cold molecular clouds
associated with star formation.

mass segregation, which provides support for the ``primordial'' mass

the quantum LQG problem where measurement is performed on the plant and the

branches into subclasses who learn different information from the outcome of

the relative numbers of observers in each subclass. For practical purposes,
wider reference classes can be used, where we trace over all information which
is uncorrelated to the outcome of the experiment, or whose correlation with it
is beyond our current understanding. We argue that, once we have gathered all

to consider ourselves typical in any reference class we belong to, unless we

of the velocity of the incoming electrons is kept fixed as its absolute value
goes to infinity. In the case of one torus our results give a rigorous proof
that quantum mechanics predicts the interference patterns observed in the
fundamental experiments of Tonomura et al. that gave a conclusive evidence of
the existence of the Aharonov-Bohm effect using a toroidal magnet. We give a
method for the reconstruction of the flux of the magnetic field over a
cross-section of the torus modulo $2\pi$. Equivalently, we determine modulo
$2\pi$ the difference in phase for two electrons that travel to infinity, when
one goes inside the hole and the other outside it. For this purpose we only
need the high-velocity limit of the scattering operator for one direction of
the velocity of the incoming electrons. When there are several tori -or more
generally handlebodies- the information that we obtain in the fluxes, and on
the difference of phases, depends on the relative position of the tori and on
the direction of the velocities when we take the high-velocity limit of the
incoming electrons. For some locations of the tori we can determine all the
fluxes modulo 2$\pi$ by taking the high-velocity limit in only one direction.

analysis of both the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) images taken with the

the Keck optical spectrum obtained at a similar phase. In the image procedure,
both the radial-profile analysis and the point-spread-function (PSF)
subtraction method resolve significant excess emission at 2--5 ACS pixels
($\sim0.05''-0.13''$) from the center. In particular, the PSF-subtracted ACS
images distinctly appear to have an extended, ring-like echo. Due to
limitations of the image resolution, we cannot confirm any structure or flux
within 2 ACS pixels from the SN. The late-time spectrum of SN 2006X can be
reasonably fit with two components: a nebular spectrum of a normal SN Ia and a
synthetic LE spectrum. Both image and spectral analysis show a rather blue
color for the emission of the LE, suggestive of a small average grain size for
the scattering dust. Using the Cepheid distance to M100 of 15.2 Mpc, we find
that the dust illuminated by the resolved LE is $\sim$27--170 pc from the SN.
The echo inferred from the nebular spectrum appears to be more luminous than
that resolved in the images (at the $\sim2\sigma$ level), perhaps suggesting
the presence of an inner echo at $<$2 ACS pixels ($\sim0.05''$). It is not
clear, however, whether this possible local echo was produced by a distinct
dust component (i.e., the local circumstellar dust) or by a continuous, larger
distribution of dust as with the outer component. Nevertheless, our detection
of a significant echo in SN 2006X confirms that this supernova was produced in

transient CenX-4 in quiescence one can use the RGS spectrum to constrain the
interstellar extinction to the source. This removes this parameter from the
X-ray spectral fitting of the pn and MOS spectra and allows us to investigate
whether the variability observed in the quiescent X-ray spectrum of this source
is due to variations in the soft thermal spectral component or variations in
the power law spectral component coupled with variations in N_H. This will test
whether the soft thermal spectral component can indeed be due to the hot
thermal glow of the neutron star. Potentially such an observation could also
reveal redshifted spectral lines from the neutron star surface. Second,
XMM-Newton observations of radius expansion type I X-ray bursts might reveal
redshifted absorption lines from the surface of the neutron star. Third,
XMM-Newton observations of eclipsing quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries provide
the eclipse duration. With this the system inclination can be determined
accurately. The inclination determined from the X-ray eclipse duration in
quiescence, the rotational velocity of the companion star and the
semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve determined through optical
spectroscopy, yield the neutron star mass.

provide important constraints on the equation of state of neutron stars. The
mass and radius of the neutron star can potentially be determined from fitting
a neutron star atmosphere model to the observed X-ray spectrum. For a radius
measurement it is of critical importance that the distance to the source is
well constrained since the fractional uncertainty in the radius is at least as
large as the fractional uncertainty in the distance. Uncertainties in modelling
the neutron star atmosphere remain. At this stage it is not yet clear if the
soft thermal component in the spectra of many quiescent X-ray binaries is
variable on timescales too short to be accommodated by the cooling neutron star
scenario. This can be tested with a long XMM-Newton observation of the neutron
star X-ray transient CenX-4 in quiescence. With such an observation one can use
the Reflection Grating Spectrometer spectrum to constrain the interstellar
extinction to the source. This removes this parameter from the X-ray spectral
fitting of the EPIC pn and MOS spectra and allows one to investigate whether
the variability observed in the quiescent X-ray spectrum of this source is due
to variations in the soft thermal spectral component or variations in the power
law spectral component coupled with variations in N_H. This will test whether
the soft thermal component can indeed be due to the hot thermal glow of the
neutron star. Irrespective of the outcome of such a study, the observed cooling
in quiescence in sources for which the crust is significantly out of thermal
equilibrium with the core due to a prolonged outburst, such as KS 1731-260,
seem excellent candidates for mass and radius determinations through modelling
the observed X-rays with a neutron star atmosphere model.

due to the Hanle and Zeeman effects operating in a weakly magnetized plasma
that is in a state far from local thermodynamic equilibrium. The physical
origin of their enigmatic linear polarization Q and U components is the
existence of atomic polarization in their metastable lower-levels, which
permits the action of a dichroism mechanism that has nothing to do with the
transverse Zeeman effect. It is also pointed out that the population imbalances
and coherences among the Zeeman sublevels of such long-lived atomic levels can
survive in the presence of horizontal magnetic fields having intensities in the
gauss range, and produce significant polarization signals. Finally, it is shown
how the most recent developments in the observation and theoretical modelling

codes of nine research groups in the field have been used in this study. The
same physics has been imposed for all the codes in order to isolate the
non-physical dependence of any possible difference. Two equilibrium models with
different grids, 2172 and 4042 mesh points, have been used, and the latter
model includes an explicit modelling of semiconvection just outside the
convective core. Comparing the results for these two models illustrates the
effect of the number of mesh points and their distribution in particularly
critical parts of the model, such as the steep composition gradient outside the
convective core. A comprehensive study of the frequency differences found for
the different codes is given as well. These differences are mainly due to the
use of different numerical integration schemes. The use of a second-order
integration scheme plus a Richardson extrapolation provides similar results to
a fourth-order integration scheme. The proper numerical description of the
Brunt-Vaisala frequency in the equilibrium model is also critical for some
modes. An unexpected result of this study is the high sensitivity of the
frequency differences to the inconsistent use of values of the gravitational

work, we have examined the effect of photophoresis, acting together with
stellar gravity, radiation pressure, and gas drag, on the evolution of solids
in transitional circumstellar disks. We have applied our calculations to four
different systems: the disks of HR 4796A and HD 141569A, which are several Myr
old AB-type stars, and two hypothetical systems that correspond to the solar
nebula after disk dispersal has progressed sufficiently for the disk to become
optically thin. Our results suggest that solid objects migrate inward or
outward, until they reach a certain size-dependent stability distance from the
star. The larger the bodies, the closer to the star they tend to accumulate.
Photophoresis increases the stability radii, moving objects to larger
distances. What is more, photophoresis may cause formation of a belt of
objects, but only in a certain range of sizes and only around low-luminosity
stars. The effects of photophoresis are noticeable in the size range from
several micrometers to several centimeters (for older transitional disks) or
even several meters (for younger, more gaseous, ones). We argue that due to gas
damping, rotation does not substantially inhibit photophoresis.

largely unknown. In this paper the magnetospheric accretion and inner wind
contributions to the observed permitted He and H near infrared (NIR) lines of
the bright southern CTTS RU Lupi are investigated for the first time. Previous
optical observations of RU Lupi showed a large H-alpha profile, due to the
emission from a wind in the line wings, and a micro-jet detected in forbidden
lines. We extend this analysis to NIR lines through seeing-limited high
spectral resolution spectra taken with VLT/ISAAC, and adaptive optics (AO)
aided narrow-band imaging and low spectral resolution spectroscopy with
VLT/NACO. Using spectro-astrometric analysis we investigate the presence of
extended emission down to very low spatial scales (a few AU). The HeI 10830
line presents a P Cygni profile whose absorption feature indicates the presence
of an inner stellar wind. Moreover the spectro-astrometric analysis evidences
the presence of an extended emission superimposed to the absorption feature and
likely coming from the micro-jet detected in the optical. On the contrary, the
origin of the Hydrogen Paschen and Brackett lines is difficult to address. We
tried tentatively to explain the observed line profiles and flux ratios with
both accretion and wind models showing the limits of both approaches. The lack
of spectro-astrometric signal indicates that the HI emission is either compact
or symmetric. Our analysis confirms the sensitivity of the HeI line to the
presence of faint extended emission regions in the close proximity of the star.

synchronization (GS) in a system of two coupled scalar piecewise linear
time-delay systems using the auxiliary system approach. We demonstrate that the
transition to GS occurs via on-off intermittency route and also it exhibits
characteristically distinct behaviors for different coupling configurations. In
particular, the intermittency transition occurs in a rather broad range of
coupling strength for error feedback coupling configuration and in a narrow
range of coupling strength for direct feedback coupling configuration. It is
also shown that the intermittent dynamics displays periodic bursts of period
equal to the delay time of the response system in the former case, while they
occur in random time intervals of finite duration in the latter case. The
robustness of these transitions with system parameters and delay times has also
been studied for both linear and nonlinear coupling configurations. The results
are corroborated analytically by suitable stability conditions for
asymptotically stable synchronized states and numerically by the probability of
synchronization and by the transition of \emph{sub}Lyapunov exponents of the
coupled time-delay systems. We have also indicated the reason behind these
distinct transitions by referring to unstable periodic orbit theory of
intermittency synchronization in low-dimensional systems.

would in particular imply nonadditivity of distillable entanglement. Moreover
it would rule out a simple mathematical description of the set of distillable
states. Distillability is equivalent to so called n-copy distillability for
some n. We consider a particular state, known to be 1-copy nondistillable,
which is supposed to be bound entangled. We study the problem of its two-copy
distillability, which boils down to show that maximal overlap of some projector
Q with Schmidt rank two states does not exceed 1/2. Such property we call the
the half-property. We first show that the maximum overlap can be attained on
vectors that are not of the simple product form with respect to cut between two
copies. We then attack the problem in twofold way: a) prove the half-property
for some classes of Schmidt rank two states b) bound the required overlap from
above for all Schmidt rank two states. We have succeeded to prove the
half-property for wide classes of states, and to bound the overlap from above
by c<3/4. Moreover, we translate the problem into the following matrix analysis

being characterised by high amount of clustering, are small-world networks.
Apart from the small-world nature, we found that proteins have another general

as all other complex networks (except for social networks) are known to be

the basic primitives of distributed computing, namely low level communication
and distributed termination, while the upper layers use these primitives to
implement high level communication among players, including broadcasting and
multicasting, and distributed decision making.
  This yields a highly flexible distributed system whose specific applications
are realized as instances of its top layer. This design is implemented in Java.

provision for distributed policing the purpose of which is to exclude

shock heated to the virial temperature, and extensive cooling, leading to

indicated by the massive body of evidence, referred to as ""downsizing"").
Massive plasma clouds are potentially observable through the thermal and
kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects and their free-free emission. We find that
the detection of substantial numbers of galaxy-scale thermal SZ signals is
achievable by blind surveys with next generation radio telescope arrays such as
EVLA, ALMA and SKA. This population is even detectable with the 10% SKA, and
wide field of view options at high frequency on any of these arrays would
greatly increase survey speed. An analysis of confusion effects and of the
contamination by radio and dust emissions shows that the optimal frequencies
are those in the range 10-35 GHz. Predictions for the redshift distributions of
detected sources are also worked out.

approach, high accuracy, faithful analytic waveforms describing the
gravitational wave signal emitted by inspiralling and coalescing binary black
holes (BHs). We present the comparable-mass version of a new, resummed
3PN-accurate EOB quadrupolar waveform recently introduced in the
small-mass-ratio limit. We compare the phase and the amplitude of this waveform
to the recently published results of a high-accuracy numerical relativity (NR)
simulation of 15 orbits of an inspiralling equal-mass binary BHs system
performed by the Caltech-Cornell group. We find a remarkable agreement, both in
phase and in amplitude, between the new EOB waveform and the published
numerical data. More precisely: (i) in the gravitational wave (GW) frequency
domain $M\omega <0.08$ where the phase of one of the non-resummed ``Taylor
approximant'' (T4) waveform matches well with the numerical relativity one, we
find that the EOB phase fares as well, while (ii) for higher GW frequencies,
$0.08<M\omega\lesssim 0.14$, where the TaylorT4 approximant starts to
significantly diverge from the NR phase, we show that the EOB phase continues
to match well the NR one. We further propose various methods of tuning the two
inspiral flexibility parameters, $a_5$ and $v_{\rm pole}$, of the EOB waveform
so as to ``best fit'' EOB predictions to numerical data. We find that the
maximal dephasing between EOB and NR can then be reduced below $10^{-3}$ GW
cycles over the entire span (30 GW cycles) of the simulation. Our resummed EOB
amplitude agrees much better with the NR one than any of the previously
considered non-resummed, post-Newtonian one.

sources in the NEWPS5 sample L\'opez-Caniego et al. (2007). The flux
calibrations at all the WMAP channels have been reassessed both by comparison
with ground based observations and through estimates of the effective beam
areas. The two methods yield consistent statistical correction factors. A
search of the NED has yielded optical identifications for 89% of sources in the
complete sub-sample of 252 sources with S/N>5 and S>1.1 Jy at 23 GHz; 5 sources
turned out to be Galactic and were removed. The NED also yielded redshifts for
92% of the extragalactic sources at |b|>10deg. Their distribution was compared
with model predictions; the agreement is generally good but a possible
discrepancy is noted. Using the 5 GHz fluxes from the GB6 or PMN surveys, we
find that 76% of the 191 extragalactic sources with S_23GHz>1.3,Jy can be
classified as flat-spectrum sources between 5 and 23 GHz. A spectral steepening
is observed at higher frequencies: only 59% of our sources are still
flat-spectrum sources between 23 and 61 GHz and the average spectral indexes
steepen from <alpha_5^23>= 0.01\pm 0.03 to <alpha_41^61>= 0.37\pm 0.03. We
think, however, that the difference may be due to a selection effect. The
source number counts have a close to Euclidean slope and are in good agreement
with the predictions of the cosmological evolution model by De Zotti et al.
(2005). The observed spectral index distributions were exploited to get
model-independent extrapolations of counts to higher frequencies. The risks of
such operations are discussed and reasons of discrepancies with other recent
estimates are clarified.

burst (GRB) flow in which energy is dissipated gradually by magnetic
reconnection. In this picture, the energy of the radiating particles is
determined by heating and cooling balance (slow heating model). Detailed
radiative transfer calculations show that, at Thomson optical depths of order
of unity, the dominant radiative process is inverse Compton scattering.
Synchrotron-self-absorbed emission and inverse Compton dominate in the Thomson
thin parts of the flow. The electrons stay thermal throughout the dissipation
region because of Coulomb collisions (Thomson thick part of the flow) and
exchange of synchrotron photons (Thomson thin part). The resulting spectrum
naturally explains the observed sub-MeV break of the GRB emission and the
spectral slopes above and below the break. The model predicts that the
gamma-ray power-law tail has a high-energy cutoff typically in the ~0.1-1 GeV
energy range that should be observable with {\it GLAST}. The model also
predicts a prompt emission component in the optical and UV associated with the
GeV emission. Observations of the prompt emission of GRB 061121 that cover the
energy range from the optical to ~1 MeV are explained by the model.
