In the case of EW Lyr we have found a third body in the orbit with a period of
about 78 years, an amplitude A=0.052 days and orbital eccentricity e=0.57. For
IV Cas the long period is 58 years, amplitude A=0.034 days and zero

Kauffman proposed them in the 1960's as models for gene regulatory networks.

  An important question is which conditions on the network topology can rule
out exponentially long periodic orbits in the system. In this paper, we
consider systems with positive feedback interconnections among all variables
(known as cooperative systems), which in a continuous setting guarantees a very
stable dynamics. We show that for an arbitrary constant 0<c<2 and sufficiently

the indegree and outdegree of each variable is bounded by two, and which
nevertheless contain periodic orbits of length at least c^n. In Part II of this

i.e. networks of $M$ transmitters and $N$ receivers where every transmitter has
an independent message for every receiver. We derive a general outerbound on

single antenna and all channel coefficients vary in time or frequency, we show
that the \emph{total} number of degrees of freedom of the $X$ network is equal
to $\frac{MN}{M+N-1}$ per orthogonal time and frequency dimension.
Achievability is proved by constructing interference alignment schemes for $X$
networks that can come arbitrarily close to the outerbound on degrees of
freedom. For the case where either M=2 or N=2 we find that the outerbound is
exactly achievable. While $X$ networks have significant degrees of freedom
benefits over interference networks when the number of users is small, our
results show that as the number of users increases, this advantage disappears.
Thus, for large $K$, the $K\times K$ user wireless $X$ network loses half the
degrees of freedom relative to the $K\times K$ MIMO outerbound achievable
through full cooperation. Interestingly, when there are few transmitters
sending to many receivers ($N\gg M$) or many transmitters sending to few
receivers ($M\gg N$), $X$ networks are able to approach the $\min(M,N)$ degrees
of freedom possible with full cooperation on the $M\times N$ MIMO channel.
Similar to the interference channel, we also construct an example of a 2 user
$X$ channel with propagation delays where the outerbound on degrees of freedom
is achieved through interference alignment based on a simple TDMA strategy.

Navier-Stokes-$\alpha$ and the Leray-$\alpha$ models for two-dimensional

spectrum of the smoothed velocity field for the two-dimensional
Navier-Stokes-$\alpha$ (NS-$\alpha$) model scales as $k^{-7}$. This result is
in agreement with the scaling deduced by dimensional analysis of the flux of
the conserved enstrophy using its characteristic time scale. We therefore
hypothesize that the spectral scaling of any $\alpha$-model in the sub-$\alpha$
spatial scales must depend only on the characteristic time scale and dynamics
of the dominant cascading quantity in that regime of scales. The data presented
here, from simulations of the two-dimensional Leray-$\alpha$ model, confirm our
hypothesis. We show that for $k\alpha\gg 1$, the energy spectrum for the
two-dimensional Leray-$\alpha$ scales as $k^{-5}$, as expected by the
characteristic time scale for the flux of the conserved enstrophy of the
Leray-$\alpha$ model. These results lead to our conclusion that the dominant
directly cascading quantity of the model equations must determine the scaling
of the energy spectrum.

exhibit rebrightenings after superoutbursts. The rebrightening phenomenon is
problematic for the disk instability theory of dwarf novae since it requires a
large amount of remnant matter in the disk even after superoutbursts. Here, we
report our optical and infrared observations during the first-ever outburst of
a new dwarf nova, SDSS J102146.44+234926.3. During the outburst, we detected
superhumps with a period of 0.056281 +/- 0.000015 d, which is typical for
superhump periods in WZ Sge stars. In conjunction with the appearance of a
long-lived rebrightening, we conclude that the object is a new member of WZ Sge
stars. Our observations, furthermore, revealed infrared behaviors for the first
time in the rebrightening phase of WZ Sge stars. We discovered prominent
infrared superhumps. We calculate the color temperature of the infrared
superhump source to be 4600-6400 K. These temperatures are too low to be
explained with a fully-ionized disk appearing during dwarf nova outbursts. We
also found a Ks-band excess over the hot disk component. These unprecedented
infrared activities provide evidence for the presence of mass reservoir at the
outermost part of the accretion disk. We propose that a moderately high
mass-accretion rate at this infrared active region leads to the long-lived
rebrightening observed in SDSS J102146.44+234926.3.

proper $k$-coloring of the vertices of $G$ such that every vertex $v$ of degree
$d(v)$ in $G$ is adjacent to vertices with at least $min\{r, d(v)\}$ different
colors. The smallest integer $k$ for which a graph $G$ has a conditional
$(k,r)$-coloring is called the $r$th order conditional chromatic number,
denoted by $\chi_r(G)$. It is easy to see that the conditional coloring is a
generalization of the traditional vertex coloring for which $r=1$. In this
paper, we consider the complexity of the conditional colorings of graphs. The
main result is that the conditional $(3,2)$-colorability is $NP$-complete for
triangle-free graphs with maximum degree at most 3, which is different from the
old result that the traditional 3-colorability is polynomial solvable for
graphs with maximum degree at most 3. This also implies that it is
$NP$-complete to determine if a graph of maximum degree 3 is $(3,2)$- or
$(4,2)$-colorable. Also we have proved that some old complexity results for
traditional colorings still hold for the conditional colorings.

reasonable subclass of claw-free graphs with maximum degree 3, for which the

linear time algorithm to recognize this subclass of graphs, and a linear time

such an interface in a disordered Potts ferromagnet in dimension $d=2$ within
Migdal-Kadanoff real space renormalization. We first focus on the interface
free-energy and energy to measure the singularities of the average and random
contributions, as well as the corresponding histograms, both in the
low-temperature phase and at criticality. We then consider the critical
behavior of the interfacial adsorption of non-boundary states. Our main
conclusion is that all singularities involve the correlation length
$\xi_{av}(T) \sim (T_c-T)^{-\nu}$ appearing in the average free-energy $\bar{F}
\sim (L/\xi_{av}(T))^{d_s}$ of the interface of dimension $d_s=d-1$, except for
the free-energy width $\Delta F \sim (L/\xi_{var}(T))^{\theta}$ that involves
the droplet exponent $\theta$ and another correlation length $\xi_{var}(T)$
which diverges more rapidly than $\xi_{av}(T)$. We compare with the spin-glass
transition in $d=3$, where $\xi_{var}(T)$ is the 'true' correlation length, and
where the interface energy presents unconventional scaling with a chaos
critical exponent $\zeta_c>1/\nu$ [Nifle and Hilhorst, Phys. Rev. Lett. 68,

in the simulation is compared directly with the chirality of observed

through a continuous sequence of nonlinear force-free equilibria, in response
to the changing photospheric boundary conditions and the emergence of new
magnetic flux. In total 119 magnetic bipoles with properties matching observed
active regions are inserted. These bipoles emerge twisted and inject magnetic
helicity into the solar atmosphere. When we choose the sign of this
active-region helicity to match that observed in each hemisphere, the model
produces the correct chirality for up to 96% of filaments, including exceptions
to the hemispheric pattern. If the emerging bipoles have zero helicity, or
helicity of the opposite sign, then this percentage is much reduced. In
addition, the simulation produces a higher proportion of filaments with the
correct chirality after longer times. This indicates that a key element in the
evolution of the coronal field is its long-term memory, and the build-up and
transport of helicity from low to high latitudes over many months. It
highlights the importance of continuous evolution of the coronal field, rather
than independent extrapolations at different times. This has significant
consequences for future modelling such as that related to the origin and
development of coronal mass ejections.

  and modeling of fluctuations in particle displacements and rotations","22 pages, 8 figures",,"10.1016/j.camwa.2007.04.015",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  We determine the elastic moduli of two-dimensional assemblies of disks by
computer simulations. The disks interact through elastic contact forces, that
oppose the relative displacement at the contact points by means of a normal and
a tangential stiffness, both taken constant. Our simulations confirm that the
uniform strain assumption results in inaccurate predictions of the elastic
moduli, since large fluctuations in particle displacements and rotations occur.
We phrase their contribution in terms of the relative displacement they induce
at the contact points. We show that the fluctuations that determine the
equivalent continuum behavior depend on the average geometry of the assembly.
We further separate the contributions from the center displacement and the
particle rotation. The fluctuations result in a relaxation of the system, but
along the tangential direction the relaxation is generally entirely due to
rotations. We consider two theoretical formulations for predicting the elastic
moduli that include the fluctuations, namely the ``pair-fluctuation'' and the
``particle-fluctuation'' method. They are both based on the equilibrium of a
small subassembly, which is considered representative of the average structure.
We investigate the corresponding predictions of the elastic moduli over a range
of coordination numbers and of ratios between tangential and normal stiffness.
We find a significant improvement with respect to the uniform strain theory.

mathematics and computer science concerned with decision making. Here we
consider this notion in the context of three formalisms used for different
purposes in reasoning about multi-agent systems: strategic games, CP-nets, and
soft constraints. To relate the notions of optimality in these formalisms we
introduce a natural qualitative modification of the notion of a strategic game.
We show then that the optimal outcomes of a CP-net are exactly the Nash
equilibria of such games. This allows us to use the techniques of game theory
to search for optimal outcomes of CP-nets and vice-versa, to use techniques
developed for CP-nets to search for Nash equilibria of the considered games.
Then, we relate the notion of optimality used in the area of soft constraints
to that used in a generalization of strategic games, called graphical games. In
particular we prove that for a natural class of soft constraints that includes
weighted constraints every optimal solution is both a Nash equilibrium and
Pareto efficient joint strategy. For a natural mapping in the other direction
we show that Pareto efficient joint strategies coincide with the optimal
solutions of soft constraints.

built from number-density, mass-density and surface-brightness distributions,
assuming as well different photometric conditions. Star clusters of different
ages, structure and mass functions are modelled by assuming that the radial
distribution of stars follows a pre-defined analytical form. Near-infrared
surface brightness and mass-density profiles result from mass-luminosity
relations taken from a set of isochrones. Core, tidal and half-light, half-mass
and half-star count radii, together with the concentration parameter, are
measured in the three types of profiles, which are built under different
photometric depths. While surface-brightness profiles are almost insensitive to
photometric depth, radii measured in number-density and mass-density profiles
change significantly with it. Compared to radii derived with deep photometry,
shallow profiles result in lower values. This effect increases for younger
ages. Radial profiles of clusters with a spatially-uniform mass function
produce radii that do not depend on depth. With deep photometry, number-density
profiles yield radii systematically larger than those derived from
surface-brightness ones. In general, low-noise surface-brightness profiles
result in uniform structural parameters that are essentially independent of
photometric depth. For less-populous star clusters, those projected against
dense fields and/or distant ones, which result in noisy surface-brightness
profiles, this work provides a quantitative way to estimate the intrinsic radii
by means of number-density profiles built with depth-limited photometry.

re-examination of the entire AAO/UKST H$\alpha$ survey of the southern Galactic
Plane in digital form. We have spectroscopically confirmed over 240 of these
new candidates as bona-fide PNe and we include other high quality candidates
awaiting spectroscopic confirmation as possible PNe. These latest discoveries
largely comprise two distinct groups: small, star-like or moderately resolved
PNe at one end and mostly large, extremely low surface brightness PNe at the
other. Neither group were easy to discover from simple visual scrutiny of the
original survey exposures as for MASH but were relatively straightforward to
uncover from the digital images via application of semi-automated discovery
techniques. We suspect the few PNe still hidden in the H$\alpha$ survey will
lie outside our search criteria or be difficult to find.

  Cylinder Composed of an Incompressible Hyperelastic Material","27 pages 10 figures",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.comp-ph",,"  In this paper, we study the localization phenomena in a slender cylinder
composed of an incompressible hyperelastic material subjected to axial tension.
We aim to construct the analytical solutions based on a three-dimensional
setting and use the analytical results to describe the key features observed in
the experiments by others. Using a novel approach of coupled series-asymptotic
expansions, we derive the normal form equation of the original governing
nonlinear partial differential equations. By writing the normal form equation
into a first-order dynamical system and with the help of the phase plane, we
manage to solve two boundary-value problems analytically. The explicit solution
expressions (in terms of integrals) are obtained. By analyzing the solutions,
we find that the width of the localization zone depends on the material
parameters but remains almost unchanged for the same material in the post-peak
region. Also, it is found that when the radius-length ratio is relatively small
there is a snap-back phenomenon. These results are well in agreement with the
experimental observations. Through an energy analysis, we also deduce the
preferred configuration and give a prediction when a snap-through can happen.
Finally, based on the maximum-energy-distortion theory, an analytical criterion
for the onset of material failure is provided.

is divided into two subspaces. One of them contains the wave functions
localized in a certain finite region while the continuum of extended scattering
wave functions is involved in the other subspace. The Hamilton operator of the
whole system is Hermitian, that of the localized part is, however,
non-Hermitian. This non-Hermitian Hamilton operator $H_{\rm eff}$ represents
the core of the FPO method in present-day studies. It gives a unified
description of discrete and resonance states. Furthermore, it contains the time
operator. The eigenvalues $z_\lambda$ and eigenfunctions $\phi_\lambda$ of
$H_{\rm eff}$ are an important ingredient of the $S$ matrix. They are energy
dependent. The phases of the $\phi_\lambda$ are, generally, nonrigid. Most
interesting physical effects are caused by the branch points in the complex
plane. On the one hand, they cause the avoided level crossings that appear as
level repulsion or widths bifurcation in approaching the branch points under
different conditions. On the other hand, observable values are usually enhanced
and accelerated in the vicinity of the branch points. In most cases, the theory
is time asymmetric. An exception are the ${\cal PT}$ symmetric bound states in
the continuum appearing in space symmetric systems due to the avoided level
crossing phenomenon in the complex plane. In the paper, the peculiarities of
the FPO method are considered and three typical phenomena are sketched: (i) the
unified description of decay and scattering processes, (ii) the appearance of
bound states in the continuum and (iii) the spectroscopic reordering processes

radiation or transported particles. We develop a pragmatic approximation in
order to enable multi-dimensional simulations with basic spectral radiative
transfer when the computational resources are not sufficient to solve the
complete Boltzmann transport equation. The distribution function of the
transported particles is decomposed into trapped and streaming particle
components. Their separate evolution equations are coupled by a source term
that converts trapped particles into streaming particles. We determine this
source term by requiring the correct diffusion limit. For a smooth transition
to the free streaming regime, this 'diffusion source' is limited by the matter
emissivity. The resulting streaming particle emission rates are integrated over
space to obtain the streaming particle flux. A geometric estimate of the flux
factor is used to convert the particle flux to the streaming particle density.
The efficiency of the scheme results from the freedom to use different
approximations for each particle component. In supernovae, reactions with
trapped particles on fast time scales establish equilibria that reduce the
number of primitive variables required to evolve the trapped particle
component. On the other hand, a stationary-state approximation facilitates the
treatment of the streaming particle component. Different approximations may
apply in applications to stellar atmospheres, star formation, or cosmological
radiative transfer. We compare the isotropic diffusion source approximation
with Boltzmann neutrino transport of electron flavour neutrinos in spherically
symmetric supernova models and find good agreement. An extension of the scheme
to the multi-dimensional case is also discussed.

exponential decay for larger r_S which reflects a formation of a pinned Wigner

simulations of early structure formation with radiative transfer. This takes
into account self-consistently the reionization history, density, velocity and
ionization structures and nonlinear source clustering. We find that all fields
are highly anisotropic and as a consequence there are very large variations in
opacity among the different lines-of-sight. The velocity effects, from both
infall and source peculiar velocity are most important for the luminous
sources, affecting the line profile and depressing the bright end of the
luminosity function. The line profiles are generally asymmetric and the line
centers of the luminous sources are always absorbed due to the high density of
the local IGM. For both luminous and average sources the damping wing effects
are of similar magnitude and remain significant until fairly late.
  The ionizing flux in the ionized patch surrounding a high density peak is
generally strongly dominated, particularly at late times, by the cluster of
faint sources, rather than the central massive galaxy. The IGM absorption does
not change appreciably the correlation function of sources at high redshift.
Our derived luminosity function assuming constant mass-to-light ratio provides
an excellent match to the shape of the observed luminosity function at z=6.6
with faint-end slope of alpha=-1.5. The resulting mass-to-light ratio implies
that the majority of sources responsible for reionization are too faint to be
observed by the current surveys. (abridged)

cardiomyocytes using heptanol and isoproterenol as means of altering
cell-to-cell coupling and automaticity respectively. Experimental findings were
explained and expanded using a modified Beeler-Reuter numerical model. The data
suggests that the combination of a heterogeneous substrate, a gradient of
coupling and an increase in oscillatory activity of individual cells creates a
rich set of behaviors associated with self-generated spiral waves and ectopic
sources. Spiral waves feature a flattened shape and a pin-unpin drift type of
tip motion. These intercellular waves are action-potential based and can be
visualized with either voltage or calcium transient measurements. A source/load
mismatch on the interface between the boundary and well-coupled layers can lock
wavefronts emanating from both ectopic sources and rotating waves within the
inner layers of the coupling gradient. A numerical approach allowed us to
explore how: i) the spatial distribution of cells, ii) the amplitude and
dispersion of cell automaticity, iii) and the speed at which the coupling
gradient moves in space, affects wave behavior, including its escape into

important in order to trace the earliest phase of the evolution of the radio
emission. RXJ1459+3337, with its high turnover frequency (~25 GHz) provides a
unique opportunity to study this class of extreme objects. Methods:
High-sensitivity multi-frequency VLA observations have been carried out to
measure the flux-density with high accuracy, while multi-frequency VLBA
observations were performed, aimed at determining the pc-scale structure.
Archival ROSAT data have been used to infer the X-ray luminosity. Results: The
comparison between our new VLA data and those available in the literature shows
a steady increment of the flux-density in the optically-thick part of the
spectrum and a decrement of the turnover frequency. In the optically-thin
regime, the source flux density has already started to decrease. Such a
variability can be explained in terms of an adiabatically-expanding homogeneous
radio component. The frequency range spanned by our VLBA observations, together
with the resolution achieved, allows us to determine the source size and the
turnover frequency, and then to derive the magnetic field directly from these
observable quantities. The value obtained in this way is in good agreement with
that computed assuming equipartition condition. A similar value is also
obtained by comparing the radio and X-ray luminosities.

distance of 2x2mm in a round-trip time of T=20us, which corresponds to 4 axial
oscillations only. We theoretically and experimentally investigate the
excitation of oscillations caused by fast ion transports with error-function
voltage ramps: For a slightly slower transport (a round-trip shuttle within
T=30us) we observe non-adiabatic motional excitation of 0.89(15)meV.

to a subset of the Pareto set of given maximum size k with bounds on the
approximation quality. The core of the algorithm is a new selection criterion
based on a hypothetical multilevel grid on the objective space. It is shown
that, when using this criterion for accepting new search points, the sequence
of solution archives converges with probability one to a subset of the Pareto
set that epsilon-dominates the entire Pareto set. The obtained approximation
quality epsilon is equal to the size of the grid cells on the finest level of
resolution that allows an approximation with at most k points within the family
of grids considered. While the convergence result is of general theoretical
interest, the archiving algorithm might be of high practical value for any type
iterative multiobjective optimization method, such as evolutionary algorithms
or other metaheuristics, which all rely on the usage of a finite on-line memory
to store the best solutions found so far as the current approximation of the
Pareto set.

explicitly include a near detector in the analysis. Our main result is that
even an idealised near detector cannot remove the dependence on systematical
uncertainties completely. Thus additional information is required. We identify
certain combinations of uncertainties, which are the key to improve the
sensitivity to CP violation, for example the ratio of electron to muon neutrino
cross sections and efficiencies. For uncertainties on this ratio larger than
2%, T2HK is systematics dominated. We briefly discuss how our results apply to
a possible two far detector configuration, called T2KK. We do not find a
significant advantage with respect to the reduction of systematical errors for
the measurement of CP violation for this setup.

which has origin in the adiabatic decaying mode, and by regarding this quantity
as the source term we determine the correction term which corrects the
discrepancy between the exactly homogeneous perturbations and the $k \to 0$
limit of the evolutions of cosmological perturbations. This LWL formula is
useful for investigating the evolutions of cosmological perturbations in the
early stage of our universe such as reheating after inflation and the curvaton
decay in the curvaton scenario. When we extract the long wavelength limits of
evolutions of cosmological perturbations from the exactly homogeneos
perturbations by the LWL formula, it is more convenient to describe the
corresponding exactly homogeneous system with not the cosmological time but the
scale factor as the evolution parameter. By applying the LWL formula to the
reheating model and the curvaton model with multiple scalar fields and multiple

sources brighter than ~2 x 10^{-13} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2} (2--10 keV), and
already deeply observed with Chandra. Thanks to the low and stable background
and high spectral resolution of Suzaku, we were able to resolve, for the first
time, three narrow iron K-emission lines from low-ionized (6.41 keV),
helium-like (6.67 keV), and hydrogenic ions (7.00 keV) in the GRXE spectrum.
These line features constrain the GRXE emission mechanisms: The cosmic-ray ion
charge exchange model or the non-equilibrium ionization plasma model are
unlikely, since they require either broad emission lines or lines at
intermediate ionization states. Collisional ionization equilibrium plasma is
the likely origin for the 6.67 keV and 7.00 keV lines, while origin of the 6.41
keV line, which is due to fluorescence from cold material, is not elucidated.
