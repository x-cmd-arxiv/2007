a limited line-of-sight or redshift resolution. The lack of radial accuracy in
these surveys can be modelled by picturing the universe as a set of concentric
radial shells of finite width around the observer, i.e, an onion-like
structure. We present a new N-body simulation with 2048^3 particles developed
at the Marenostrum supercomputer with the GADGET-2 code. Using the lightcone
output we build a set of angular maps that mimic this onion-like representation
of the universe. The onion maps are a highly compressed version of the raw data
(i.e. a factor >1000 smaller size for arcminute resolution maps) and they
provide a new and powerful tool to exploit large scale structure observations.
We introduce two basic applications of these maps that are especially useful
for constraning dark energy properties: the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO)
in the galaxy power spectrum and all-sky maps of the weak lensing distortion.
Using the weak lensing maps, we measure the convergence power spectra and
compare it to halo fit predictions. As a further application, we compute the
variance and higher-order moments of the maps. We show that sampling variance
on scales of few degrees is quite large, resulting in a significant (25% at 10
arminute scales) bias in the variance. We caution that current lensing surveys
such as the COSMOS HST should take into account this bias and extra sampling
error in their clustering analyses and inferred cosmological parameter
constraints. Finally, we test the importance of projection effects in the weak
lensing mass reconstruction. On the mean, the mass calibration works well but
it exhibits a large non-Gaussian scatter what could induce a large bias in the
recovered mass function.

small change in its second derivative (the effective mass of the inflaton). An
exact treatment demonstrates that the resulting density perturbation has a
quasi-flat power spectrum with a break in its slope (a step in n_s). The step
in the spectral index is modulated by characteristic oscillations and results
in large running of the spectral index localised over a few e-folds of scales.
A field-theoretic model giving rise to such behaviour of the inflationary
potential is based on a fast phase transition experienced by a second scalar
field weakly coupled to the inflaton. Such a transition is similar to that
which terminates inflation in the hybrid inflationary scenario. This scenario
suggests that the observed running of the spectral index in the WMAP data may
be caused by a fast second order phase transition which occurred during
inflation.

to the Coulomb enhancement factor acting on a charged fermion pair. In the case
of e+e- in proton-antiproton it is found that Coulomb final state interactions
largely dominate the cross section and the form factor is |G^p(4M^2_p)|~1,

planets orbiting their parent stars at a distance lower than 0.1 astronomical
unit (and the launch and the preparation of dedicated space missions such as
CoRoT and KEPLER), with the position of inner natural satellites around giant
planets in our Solar System and with the existence of very closed but separated
binary stars, tidal interaction has to be carefully studied. In particular, a
question arises about the validity of usual approximations used in the
modelling of this interaction. The purpose of this paper is to examine the step
beyond the ponctual approximation for the tidal perturber. To achieve this aim,
the gravitational interaction between two extended bodies and more precisely
the interaction between mass multipole moments of their gravitational fields
and the associated tidal phenomena are studied. Use of Cartesian Symmetric
Trace Free (STF) tensors, of their relation with spherical harmonics and of the
Kaula's transform enables to derive analytically the tidal and mutual
interaction potentials as well as the associated disturbing functions in
extended bodies systems. The tidal and mutual interaction potentials of two
extended bodies are derived. Next, the external gravitational potential of such
tidally disturbed extended body is obtained, using the Love's number theory, as
well as the associated disturbing function. Finally, the dynamical evolution
equations for such systems are given in their more general form without any
linearization. The dynamical equations for the gravitational and tidal
interactions between extended bodies and associated dynamics are derived in a
form where they could be directly implemented to perform coherent numerical
simulations of planetary systems or multiple stars tidal evolution.

both objects were discovered less than 3 days after they exploded, making these
the earliest SN II-P spectra ever studied. They reveal broad and very weak
lines from highly-ionized fast ejecta with an extremely steep density profile.
We identify He{\sc ii} 4686\AA emission in the SN 2006bp ejecta. Days later,
the spectra resemble the prototypical Type II-P SN 1999em, which had a
supergiant-like photospheric composition. Despite the association of SN 2005cs
with possible X-ray emission, the emergent UV and optical light comes from the
photosphere, not from circumstellar emission.
  We surmise that the very steep density fall-off we infer at early times may
be a fossil of the combined actions of the shock wave passage and radiation
driving at shock breakout. Based on tailored CMFGEN models, the direct-fitting
technique and the Expanding Photosphere Method both yield distances and
explosion times that agree within a few percent. We derive a distance to NGC

also addressed, and its effect on the calcium absorption spectrum discussed. At

anisotropy power spectra from semilocal cosmic strings, obtained via
simulations of a classical field theory. Semilocal strings are a type of
non-topological defect arising in some models of inflation motivated by
fundamental physics, and are thought to relax the constraints on the symmetry
breaking scale as compared to models with (topological) cosmic strings. We
derive constraints on the model parameters, including the string tension
parameter mu, from fits to cosmological data, and find that in this regard BPS
semilocal strings resemble global textures more than topological strings. The
observed microwave anisotropy at l = 10 is reproduced if Gmu = 5.3x10^{-6} (G
is Newton's constant). However as with other defects the spectral shape does
not match observations, and in models with inflationary perturbations plus
semilocal strings the 95% confidence level upper bound is Gmu<2.0x10^{-6} when
CMB data, Hubble Key Project and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data are used (c.f.
Gmu<0.9x10^{-6} for cosmic strings). We additionally carry out a Bayesian model
comparison of several models with and without defects, showing models with
defects are neither conclusively favoured nor disfavoured at present.

formed. The conclusion is applicable to all the post-AGB stars studied,
irrespective of the dominant chemistry or the spectral type of the star
considered. A detailed radial velocity analysis of the features observed in
individual sources confirms this result, as the Doppler shifts measured are
found to be consistent with an interstellar origin.

states $f_1$, $f_2$ on $A$ and $g_1$, $g_2$ on $B$ such that for all $a\in A$
and $b\in B$,
  |u(a, b)| \leq ||u||_{jcb}(f_1(aa^*)^{1/2}g_1(b^*b)^{1/2} +
f_2(a^*a)^{1/2}g_2(bb^*)^{1/2}) .

techniques, our proof uses more classical operator algebra theory, namely,
Tomita-Takesaki theory and special properties of the Powers factors of type

cannot appear in the orbits generated by a map taking values on a linearly
ordered space, in which case we say that the map has forbidden patterns. Once a
map has a forbidden pattern of a given length $L_{0}$, it has forbidden
patterns of any length $L\ge L_{0}$ and their number grows superexponentially
with $L$. Using recent results on topological permutation entropy, we study in
this paper the existence and some basic properties of forbidden ordinal
patterns for self maps on n-dimensional intervals. Our most applicable
conclusion is that expansive interval maps with finite topological entropy have
necessarily forbidden patterns, although we conjecture that this is also the
case under more general conditions. The theoretical results are nicely
illustrated for n=2 both using the naive counting estimator for forbidden
patterns and Chao's estimator for the number of classes in a population. The
robustness of forbidden ordinal patterns against observational white noise is
also illustrated.

taking into account the threshold resonance in the 1^{++} channel. The

demonstrate that Minimum Variance Optimization (MVO), a technique used by many

contaminating foregrounds, has the effect of forcing the extracted CMB map to
have zero statistical correlation with the foreground emission. Over an
ensemble of universes the true CMB and foreground are indeed expected to be
uncorrelated, but any particular sky pattern (such as the one we happen to
observe) will generate non-zero measured correlations simply by chance. We call
this effect ""cosmic covariance"" and it is a possible source of bias in the CMB
maps cleaned using the MVO technique. We show that the presence of cosmic
covariance is expected to artificially suppress the variance of the Internal
Linear Combination (ILC) map obtained via MVO. It also propagates into the
multipole expansion of the ILC map, generating a quadrupole deficit with more
than 90% confidence. Since we do not know the CMB and the foregrounds a priori,
there is therefore an unknown contribution to the uncertainty in the measured
quadrupole power, over and above the usual cosmic variance contribution. Using
the MVO on a series of Monte Carlo simulations that assume Gaussian CMB
fluctuations, we estimate that the real quadrupole power of the CMB lies in the
range [305.16,400.40] microKelvin^2 (at the 1-sigma level).

the continuum fit in the normalised flux range 0.8 < F < 1.0 and to metal

due to a combination of our improved removal of the metal absorption and cosmic

large. The HI effective optical depth at 1.7 < z < 4 is best fit with a single
power law, (0.0023 +-0.0007) (1+z)^(3.65 +- 0.21), in good agreement with

motion of a domain wall in a magnetic nanowire in an effort to increase the

driven by a magnetic field placed along the direction of the nanowire. Here we
present data showing a significant increase in the maximum speed of a domain
wall due to the addition of a magnetic field placed perpendicular to the
longitudinal driving field. The results are expressed in terms of the relative
alignment of the transverse field direction with respect to the direction of
the magnetic moments within the domain wall. In particular, when the transverse
field is parallel to the magnetic moments within the domain wall, the velocity
of the wall varies linearly with the strength of the transverse field
increasing by up to 20%. Further examination of the domain wall structure shows
that the length of the domain wall also depends linearly on the strength of the
transverse field. We present a simple model to correlate the effects.

that forms around them as a result of angular momentum conservation in the
collapsing protostellar cloud. Accretion initially proceeds at high rates of
10^{-6}-10^{-5} M_Sun/yr resulting in strong irradiation of the stellar surface
by the hot inner portion of the disk and leading to the suppression of the
intrinsic stellar luminosity. Here we investigate how this luminosity
suppression affects evolution of the protostellar properties. Using simple
model based on the energy balance of accreting star we demonstrate that disk
irradiation causes only a slight increase of the protostellar radius, at the
level of several per cent. Such a weak effect is explained by a minor role
played by the intrinsic stellar luminosity (at the time when it is
significantly altered by irradiation) in the protostellar energy budget
compared to the stellar deuterium burning luminosity and the inflow of the
gravitational potential energy brought in by the freshly accreted material. Our
results justify the neglect of irradiation effects in previous studies of the
protostellar growth via disk accretion. Evolution of some other actively
accreting objects such as young brown dwarfs and planets should also be only
weakly sensitive to the effects of disk irradiation.

used for thousands of years, from lodestones in primitive compasses[1] to a
candidate material for magnetoelectronic devices.[2] In 1939 Verwey[3] found
that bulk magnetite undergoes a transition at T$_{V}$ $\approx$ 120 K from a
high temperature ""bad metal"" conducting phase to a low-temperature insulating
phase. He suggested[4] that high temperature conduction is via the fluctuating
and correlated valences of the octahedral iron atoms, and that the transition
is the onset of charge ordering upon cooling. The Verwey transition mechanism
and the question of charge ordering remain highly controversial.[5-11] Here we
show that magnetite nanocrystals and single-crystal thin films exhibit an
electrically driven phase transition below the Verwey temperature. The
signature of this transition is the onset of sharp conductance switching in
high electric fields, hysteretic in voltage. We demonstrate that this
transition is not due to local heating, but instead is due to the breakdown of
the correlated insulating state when driven out of equilibrium by electrical
bias. We anticipate that further studies of this newly observed transition and
its low-temperature conducting phase will shed light on how charge ordering and
vibrational degrees of freedom determine the ground state of this important
compound.

analysis correctly accounts for the removal of singleton traits, which are
commonly discarded in real data sets. We illustrate Bayesian inference for two
binary-trait data sets which arise in historical linguistics. The Bayesian
approach allows for the incorporation of information from ancestral languages.
The marginal prior distribution of the root time is uniform. We present a
thorough analysis of the robustness of our results to model mispecification,
through analysis of predictive distributions for external data, and fitting
data simulated under alternative observation models. The reconstructed ages of
tree nodes are relatively robust, whilst posterior probabilities for topology
are not reliable.

micron--selected galaxies, and combine the results with 4 additional very faint
galaxies with IRS spectra in the literature. The median intrinsic 24 micron
flux density of the sample is 130 microJy, enabling a systematic survey of the
spectral properties of the very faint 24 micron sources that dominate the
number counts of Spitzer cosmological surveys. Six of the 19 galaxy spectra
(32%) show the strong mid-IR continuua expected of AGN; X-ray detections
confirm the presence of AGN in three of these cases, and reveal AGNs in two
other galaxies. These results suggest that nuclear accretion may contribute
more flux to faint 24 micron--selected samples than previously assumed. Almost
all the spectra show some aromatic (PAH) emission features; the measured
aromatic flux ratios do not show evolution from z=0. In particular, the high
S/N mid-IR spectrum of SMM J163554.2+661225 agrees remarkably well with
low--redshift, lower--luminosity templates. We compare the rest-frame 8 micron
and total infrared luminosities of star--forming galaxies, and find that the
behavior of this ratio with total IR luminosity has evolved modestly from z=2
to z=0. Since the high aromatic--to--continuum flux ratios in these galaxies
rule out a dominant contribution by AGN, this finding implies systematic
evolution in the structure and/or metallicity of infrared sources with
redshift. It also has implications for the estimates of star forming rates
inferred from 24 micron measurements, in the sense that at z ~2, a given
observed frame 24 micron luminosity corresponds to a lower bolometric
luminosity than would be inferred from low-redshift templates of similar
luminosity at the corresponding rest wavelength.

Simultaneously, we also solve for the local ionization of \heii to \heii and
the associated photoheating of the gas. We find that the percolation of the
\heiii regions is essentially complete by z=2.5. When comparing to a
self-consistent optically thin simulation we find that in optically thick
calculation the gas temperature is higher by a factor of approximately 1.7 at
the mean gas density level. We use 300 random lines of sight to compute at
$\bar{z} = 2.5 \pm 0.1$ a mean \heii \lya line transmission of $\bar{F} = 0.304

dark matter annihilation (DMA) for a WIMP mass in the range 50-100 GeV,
especially the distribution of the excess is compatible with a standard halo
profile with some additional ringlike substructures at 4 and 13 kpc from the
Galactic centre. These substructures coincide with the gravitational potential
well expected from the ring of dust at 4 kpc and the tidal stream of dark
matter from the Canis Major satellite galaxy at 13 kpc, as deduced from N-body
simulations fitting to the Monoceros ring of stars. Strong independent support
for this substructure is given by the gas flaring in our Galaxy.
  The gamma rays from DMA are originating predominantly from the hadronization
of mono-energetic quarks, which should produce also a small, but known fraction
of protons and antiprotons. Bergstrom et al. an antiproton flux far above the
observed antiproton flux and they conclude that the DMA interpretation of the
EGRET excess can therefore be excluded. However, they used an isotropic
propagation model, i.e. the same diffusive propagation in the disk and the
halo. It is shown that an anisotropic propagation model is consistent with the
EGRET gamma ray excess, the antiproton flux and the ratios of secondary/primary
and unstable/stable cosmic ray particles. Such an anisotropic propagation is
supported by the large bulge/disk ratio of the positron annihilation line, as
observed by the INTEGRAL satellite. In this case no need for new sources
specific to the bulge are needed, so the claimed evidence for strong DMA in the
bulge from these observations is strongly propagation model dependent.

hyperbolic stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) can have
random-field solutions only in spatial dimension one. Here we show that in many
cases, where the ``spatial operator'' is the L^2-generator of a L\'evy process
X, a linear SPDE has a random-field solution if and only if the symmetrization
of X possesses local times. This result gives a probabilistic reason for the
lack of existence of random-field solutions in dimensions strictly bigger than
one. In addition, we prove that the solution to the SPDE is [H\""older]
continuous in its spatial variable if and only if the said local time is
[H\""older] continuous in its spatial variable. We also produce examples where
the random-field solution exists, but is almost surely unbounded in every open
subset of space-time. Our results are based on first establishing a
quasi-isometry between the linear L^2-space of the weak solutions of a family
of linear SPDEs, on one hand, and the Dirichlet space generated by the
symmetrization of X, on the other hand. We study mainly linear equations in
order to present the local-time correspondence at a modest technical level.
However, some of our work has consequences for nonlinear SPDEs as well. We
demonstrate this assertion by studying a family of parabolic SPDEs that have
additive nonlinearities. For those equations we prove that if the linearized
problem has a random-field solution, then so does the nonlinear SPDE. Moreover,
the solution to the linearized equation is [H\""older] continuous if and only if
the solution to the nonlinear equation is. And the solutions are bounded and
unbounded together as well. Finally, we prove that in the cases that the
solutions are unbounded, they almost surely blow up at exactly the same points.

both in conventional matrix models and in topological string theory. We test
these predictions in detail in various examples, including the quartic matrix
model, topological strings on the local curve, and Hurwitz theory. In all these
cases we provide extensive numerical checks which heavily support our
nonperturbative analytical results. Moreover, since all these models have a
critical point describing two-dimensional gravity, we also obtain in this way
the large-order asymptotics of the relevant solution to the Painleve I
equation, including corrections in inverse genus. From a mathematical point of
view, our results predict the large-genus asymptotics of simple Hurwitz numbers
and of local Gromov-Witten invariants.

large stable regions in and out of the stability region of the Schubart orbit

the existence of a reverse shock in arbitrarily magnetized ejecta that
decelerate and interact with the circumburst medium. Both constant and
wind-like density profiles are considered. We show, in contrast to previous
estimates, that ejecta with magnetization larger than unity are not crossed by
a reverse shock for a large fraction of the parameter space relevant to GRB
flows. Allowing for shell spreading, there is always a relativistic or mildly
relativistic reverse shock forming in sigma_o < 0.3 ejecta. From this, we
conclude that the paucity of optical flashes, believed to be a distinctive
signature of a reverse shock, may be explained by the existence of dynamically
important magnetic fields in the ejecta.

in the Sun) the future duration of our favourable terrestrial environment will
be short (compared with the present age of the Earth) has been interpreted as
evidence for a hard step scenario. This means that some of the essential steps
(such as the development of eukaryotes) in the evolution process leading to the
ultimate emergence of intelligent life would have been hard, in the sense of
being against the odds in the available time, so that they are unlikely to have
been achieved in most of the earth-like planets that may one day be discovered
in nearby extra-solar systems. It was originally estimated that only one or two
of the essential evolutionary steps had to have been hard in this sense, but it
has become apparent that this figure may need upward revision, because recent
studies of climatic instability suggest that the possible future duration of
our biologically favourable environment may be shorter than had been supposed,
only about one Giga year rather than five. On the basis of the statistical
requirement of roughly equal spacing between hard steps, it is argued that the
best fit with the fossil record is now obtainable by postulating the number of
hard steps to be five, if our evolution was exclusively terrestrial, or six if,
as now seems very plausible, the first step occurred on Mars.

reliability is not perfectly estimated at the receiver, we derive a novel
analytical framework for evaluating the decoder's performance. It is derived
the important result that a ""good code"", i.e., a code which allows to fully
exploit the potential benefit of a-priori information, must associate
information sequences with high Hamming weights to codewords with low Hamming
weights. Basing on the proposed analysis, we analyze the performance of
convolutional codes, random codes, and turbo codes. Moreover, we consider the
transmission of correlated binary sources from independent nodes, a problem
which has several practical applications, e.g. in the case of sensor networks.
In this context, we propose a very simple joint source-channel turbo decoding
scheme where each decoder works by exploiting a-priori information given by the
other decoder. In the case of block fading channels, it is shown that the
inherent correlation between information signals provide a form of
non-cooperative diversity, thus allowing joint source-channel decoding to
outperform separation-based schemes.

Kingman's house of cards model [J.F.C. Kingman, \textit{J. Appl. Probab.}
\textbf{15}, 1 (1978)]. In contrast to Kingman's work, the focus here is on
unbounded distributions $g(w)$ which lead to an indefinite growth of the
population fitness. The model is solved analytically in the limit of infinite
population size $N \to \infty$ and simulated numerically for finite $N$. When
the genome-wide mutation probability $U$ is small, the long time behavior of
the model reduces to a point process of fixation events, which is referred to
as a \textit{diluted record process} (DRP). The DRP is similar to the standard
record process except that a new record candidate (a number that exceeds all
previous entries in the sequence) is accepted only with a certain probability
that depends on the values of the current record and the candidate. We develop
a systematic analytic approximation scheme for the DRP. At finite $U$ the
fitness frequency distribution of the population decomposes into a stationary
part due to mutations and a traveling wave component due to selection, which is
shown to imply a reduction of the mean fitness by a factor of $1-U$ compared to
the $U \to 0$ limit.

dominated by a compact clump (P2) with a high rotation temperature (29 K),
large line width (4.3 km s$^{-1}$), and is associated with strong water maser
(240 Jy) and a 24 $\mu$m point source with far IR luminosity of $10^3$ \lsun.

rotation temperature in the southern region decreases with the increase of the
integrated NH3 intensity, which indicates an absence of strong internal heating
in these clumps. In addition, the compact core P1 in the south has small line
width (1.2 km s$^{-1}$) surrounded by extended emission with larger line width

$-3.03 \pm 0.55_{stat} \pm < 0.62_{syst}$ between 6 TeV and 40 TeV, consistent
with $-$2.7 from direct energy spectrum measurements. Potentially, this CG

``knee'' against models for non-standard hadronic interactions in the
atmosphere.

found as a solution of the initial value linearized problem. The plasma initial

it reproduces the spectrum obtained from the fluctuation-dissipation relation.

is triggered by a finite jump in the free energy density across the interface,
and it leads to the formation of finger-like structures aligned with the
principal direction of compaction. The model is proposed as an explanation for
the roughening of stylolites - irregular interfaces associated with the
compaction of sedimentary rocks that fluctuate about a plane perpendicular to
the principal direction of compaction.

at the LHC both for the total cross section and for the distributions. In the
limit of vanishing bottom Yukawa coupling where the LO contribution vanishes,
the process can still be induced at one-loop through the top quark transition.
Though this contribution which can be counted as part of the NNLO correction is
small for Higgs masses around 120GeV, it quickly picks up for higher Higgs
masses. This contribution represents the rescattering of the top quarks and
their decay into W's leading to Higgs production through WW fusion

techniques to test the laws of fundamental physics which determine dynamics in
the solar system. It could lead to major discoveries by using demonstrated
technologies. The mission proposes to perform a set of precision gravitation
experiments from the vicinity of Earth to the outer Solar System. Its
scientific objectives can be summarized as follows: i) test of the gravity
force law in the Solar System up to and beyond the orbit of Saturn; ii) precise
investigation of navigation anomalies at the fly-bys; iii) measurement of
Eddington's parameter at occultations; iv) mapping of gravity field in the
outer solar system and study of the Kuiper belt. To this aim, the Odyssey
mission is built up on a main spacecraft, designed to fly up to 13 AU, with the
following components: a) a high-precision accelerometer, with bias-rejection
system, measuring the deviation of the trajectory from the geodesics; b)
Ka-band transponders, as for Cassini, for a precise range and Doppler
measurement up to 13 AU, with additional VLBI equipment; c) optional laser
equipment, which would allow one to improve the range and Doppler measurement.
In this baseline concept, the main spacecraft is designed to operate beyond the
Saturn orbit, up to 13 AU. It experiences multiple planetary fly-bys at Earth,
Mars or Venus, and Jupiter. The cruise and fly-by phases allow the mission to
achieve its baseline scientific objectives (i) to iii) in the above list). In
addition to this baseline concept, the Odyssey mission proposes the release of
the Enigma radio-beacon at Saturn, allowing one to extend the deep space
gravity test up to at least 50 AU, while achieving the scientific objective of
a mapping of gravity field in the outer Solar System.

long-range charge stripe order we find that the manifestation of charge order
changes abruptly as a function of momentum along the Fermi surface. The
disorder averaged local density of states is almost perfectly homogeneous when
integrated only over states which contribute to the ``nodal'' spectral weight
whereas it displays long range charge stripe order when integrated only over
states which contribute to the ``antinodal'' spectral weight. An effectively
two dimensional nodal liquid can thus coexist with static charge stripes
provided there is no static spin order. We also study commensurate spin and
charge stripe ordered systems where the Fermi surface consists of a nodal hole
pocket and an open ``stripe band'' section. Due to the stripe order the
relation between hole density and size of a pocket will be reduced compared to
a paramagnet by a factor of two for even charge period and four for odd charge
period and we find an estimated upper limit on the area fraction of a hole
pocket of 1.6% for charge period four and 4% for charge period five. We also
discuss why electron pockets are not expected for a stripe ordered system and
show that the open Fermi surface section may be electron like with a negative
Hall coefficient.

calculation of quantitative relations between physical quantities is presented
and analyzed. In the simplest cases of the stationary solutions to the CGD
equations the approach implies separation of internal and external parts
(relative to a certain boundary) from the solutions and using inverse
transformations transforming the parts into each other. For the
quasi-stationary (metastable) states, the possibility of the nonperturbative
calculation of their lifetimes is shown. The approach is illustrated by several
examples. In particular, it is shown that the Dirac ``large number hypothesis''
is a consequence of the approach. Also, the evaluated radiation lifetime of the
first excited level of 2p hydrogen atom and neutron lifetime are presented.
