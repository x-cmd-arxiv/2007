star-forming galaxies drawn from the SDSS DR4. On scales less than 100 kpc, the
amplitude of the correlation function exhibits a strong dependence on the
specific star formation rate of the galaxy. We interpret this as the signature
of enhanced star formation induced by tidal interactions. We then explore how
the average star formation rate in a galaxy is enhanced as the projected
separation r_p between the galaxy and its companions decreases. We find that
the enhancement depends strongly on r_p, but very weakly on the relative
luminosity of the companions. The enhancement is also stronger in low mass
galaxies than in high mass galaxies. In order to explore whether a tidal
interaction is not only sufficient, but also necessary to trigger enhanced star
formation in a galaxy, we compute background subtracted neighbour counts for
the galaxies in our sample. The average number of close neighbours around
galaxies with low to average values of SFR/M* is close to zero. At the highest
specific star formation rates, however, more than 40% of the galaxies in our
sample have a companion within a projected radius of 100 kpc. Visual inspection
of the highest SFR/M* galaxies without companions reveals that more than 50% of
these are clear interacting or merging systems. We conclude that tidal
interactions are the dominant trigger of enhanced star formation in the most
strongly star-forming systems. Finally, we find clear evidence that tidal
interactions not only lead to enhanced star formation in galaxies, but also
cause structural changes such as an increase in concentration.

of the celebrated stochastic multi-armed bandit problem in decision theory. In
its ultimate generality, the restless bandit problem is known to be PSPACE-Hard
to approximate to any non-trivial factor, and little progress has been made
despite its importance in modeling activity allocation under uncertainty.
  We consider a special case that we call Feedback MAB, where the reward
obtained by playing each of n independent arms varies according to an
underlying on/off Markov process whose exact state is only revealed when the
arm is played. The goal is to design a policy for playing the arms in order to
maximize the infinite horizon time average expected reward. This problem is
also an instance of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and
is widely studied in wireless scheduling and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
routing. Unlike the stochastic MAB problem, the Feedback MAB problem does not
admit to greedy index-based optimal policies.
  We develop a novel and general duality-based algorithmic technique that
yields a surprisingly simple and intuitive 2+epsilon-approximate greedy policy
to this problem. We then define a general sub-class of restless bandit problems
that we term Monotone bandits, for which our policy is a 2-approximation. Our
technique is robust enough to handle generalizations of these problems to
incorporate various side-constraints such as blocking plays and switching
costs. This technique is also of independent interest for other restless bandit
problems. By presenting the first (and efficient) O(1) approximations for
non-trivial instances of restless bandits as well as of POMDPs, our work
initiates the study of approximation algorithms in both these contexts.

Assuming hydrostatic equilibrium we deduce a 3D mass profile that agrees
simultaneously with both the lensing and X-ray measurements. However, the
projected temperature profile predicted with this 3D mass profile exceeds the
observed temperature by ~30% at all radii, a level of discrepancy comparable to
the level found for other relaxed clusters. This result may support recent
suggestions from hydrodynamical simulations that denser, more X-ray luminous
small-scale structure can bias observed temperature measurements downward at
about the same (~30%) level. We determine the gas entropy at 0.1r_{vir} (where
r_{vir} is the virial radius) to be ~800 keV cm^2, as expected for a high
temperature cluster, but its profile at >0.1r_{vir} has a power-law form with

studies and simulations. Moreover, if a constant entropy ''floor'' exists at

the statistical instability of the wave energy density for different
configurations of the source terms and the domains over which the energy

state representation, we show that the quantum correlations in each SS state
are calculable as the finite temperature correlations of an associated

higher dimensions, the SS states can spontaneously break SU(N) and exhibit
N-sublattice long-ranged order, as a function of a discrete parameter which
fixes the local representation of SU(N). I analyze this transition using a

fractionalize at an edge, and the ground state entropy is proportional to the

How deep the winds penetrate unabated into each planet is unknown. Our
investigation favors shallow winds. It consists of two parts.
  The first part makes use of an Ohmic constraint; Ohmic dissipation associated
with the planet's magnetic field cannot exceed the planet's net luminosity.
Application to Jupiter (J) and Saturn (S) shows that the observed zonal winds
cannot penetrate below a depth at which the electrical conductivity is about
six orders of magnitude smaller than its value at the molecular-metallic
transition. Measured values of the electrical conductivity of molecular
hydrogen yield radii of maximum penetration of 0.96R_J and 0.86R_S, with
uncertainties of a few percent of R. At these radii, the magnetic Reynolds
number based on the zonal wind velocity and the scale height of the magnetic
diffusivity is of order unity. These limits are insensitive to difficulties in
modeling turbulent convection. They permit complete penetration along cylinders
of the equatorial jets observed in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn.
  The second part investigates how deep the observed zonal winds actually do
penetrate. Truncation of the winds in the planet's convective envelope would
involve breaking the Taylor-Proudman constraint on cylindrical flow. This would
require a suitable nonpotential acceleration which none of the obvious
candidates appears able to provide. Accelerations arising from entropy
gradients, magnetic stresses, and Reynolds stresses appear to be much too weak.
These considerations suggest that strong zonal winds are confined to shallow,
stably stratified layers, with equatorial jets being the possible exception.

Therianos and Thompson in the case of matrices, amounting to the existence of
projections having certain properties relative to arbitrary flags, which
guarantees that a given Horn inequality holds in all finite von Neumann

property P$_n$. Certain triples in $T^n_r$ can be reduced to triples in
$T^{n-1}_r$ by an operation we call {\em TT--reduction}. We show that property
P$_n$ holds for the original triple if property P$_{n-1}$ holds for the reduced
one. We then characterize the TT--irreducible Horn triples in $T^n_3$, for
arbitrary $n$, and for those LR--minimal ones (namely, those having
Littlewood--Richardson coefficient equal to 1), we perform a construction of
projections with respect to flags in arbitrary von Neumann algebras in order to
prove property P$_n$ for them. This shows that all LR--minimal triples in

tending to one. Depending on the case of applications, sparsity priori may
occur on the covariance matrix, its inverse or its Cholesky decomposition. We
study these three sparsity exploration problems under a unified framework with
a general penalty function. We show that the rates of convergence for these
problems under the Frobenius norm are of order $(s_n\log p_n/n)^{1/2}$, where
$s_n$ is the number of nonzero elements, $p_n$ is the size of the covariance
matrix and $n$ is the sample size. This explicitly spells out the contribution
of high-dimensionality is merely of a logarithmic factor. The conditions on the
rate with which the tuning parameter $\lambda_n$ goes to 0 have been made
explicit and compared under different penalties. As a result, for the
$L_1$-penalty, to guarantee the sparsistency and optimal rate of convergence,
the number of nonzero elements should be small: $s_n'=O(p_n)$ at most, among
$O(p_n^2)$ parameters, for estimating sparse covariance or correlation matrix,
sparse precision or inverse correlation matrix or sparse Cholesky factor, where
$s_n'$ is the number of the nonzero elements on the off-diagonal entries. On
the other hand, using the SCAD or hard-thresholding penalty functions, there is
no such a restriction.

The high-resolution, seeing-free images achieved by SOT revealed, for the first
time, the sub-arcsec fine structures of the ""white light"" flare. The G-band
flare ribbons on sunspot umbrae showed a sharp leading edge followed by a
diffuse inside, as well as previously known core-halo structure. The underlying
structures such as umbral dots, penumbral filaments and granules were visible
in the flare ribbons. Assuming that the sharp leading edge was directly heated
by particle beam and the diffuse parts were heated by radiative back-warming,
we estimate the depth of the diffuse flare emission using the intensity profile
of the flare ribbon. We found that the depth of the diffuse emission is about
100 km or less from the height of the source of radiative back-warming. The
flare ribbons were also visible in the Stokes-V images of FeI 6302A, as a
transient polarity reversal. This is probably related to ""magnetic transient""
reported in the literature. The intensity increase in Stokes-I images indicates
that the FeI 6302A line was significantly deformed by the flare, which may
cause such a magnetic transient.

clearly seen in observations recorded by the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging

filament, and it appears to be a standing oscillation rather than a propagating
wave. The period of oscillation was about two hours and did not change
significantly during the oscillation. We also identified the oscillation as a
""winking filament"" in the H-alpha images taken by the Flare Monitoring

triggered by magnetic reconnection between a filament barb and nearby emerging

was observed to be associated with the onset of the oscillation. We also
discuss possible implications of the oscillation as a diagnostic tool for the

this formulation the axion and photon are the symmetric and antisymmetric

The magnetic field interaction is seen to be equivalent to first order to the
interaction of the complex charged field with an external electric potential,
where this ficticious ""electric potential"" is proportional to the external

with simple algorithms ascribing one or more points to each tile, point
processes which are ""superhomogeneous'' (or ""hyperuniform''), i.e., for which
the structure factor S(k) vanishes when the wavenumber k tends to zero. The
exponent of the leading small-k behavior depends in a simple manner on the
nature of the correlation properties of the specific tiling and on the
conservation of the mass moments of the tiles. Assigning one point to the
center of mass of each tile gives the exponent \gamma=4 for any tiling in which
the shapes and orientations of the tiles are short-range correlated. Smaller
exponents, in the range 4-d<\gamma<4 (and thus always superhomogeneous for
d\leq 4), may be obtained in the case that the latter quantities have
long-range correlations. Assigning more than one point to each tile in an
appropriate way, we show that one can obtain arbitrarily higher exponents in
both cases. We illustrate our results with explicit constructions using known
deterministic tilings, as well as some simple stochastic tilings for which we
can calculate S(k) exactly. Our results provide, we believe, the first explicit

page with several outgoing links you could choose to follow. Which link should
you choose in such an online scenario? When you are not sure where the
information you require resides, you will initiate a navigation session. This
involves pruning some of the links and following one of the others, where more
pruning is likely to happen the deeper you navigate. In terms of decision
making, the utility of navigation diminishes with distance until finally the
utility drops to zero and the session is terminated. Under this model of
navigation, we call the number of nodes that are available after pruning, for
browsing within a session, the {\em potential gain} of the starting web page.
Thus the parameters that effect the potential gain are the local branching
factor with respect to the starting web page and the discount factor.
  We first consider the case when the discounting factor is geometric. We show
that the distribution of the effective number of links that the user can follow
at each navigation step after pruning, i.e. the number of nodes added to the
potential gain at that step, is given by the {\em erf} function. We derive an
approximation to the potential gain of a web page and show that this is
numerically a very accurate estimate. We then consider a harmonic discounting
factor and show that, in this case, the potential gain at each step is closely
related to the probability density function for the Poisson distribution.
  The potential gain has been applied to web navigation where it helps the user
to choose a good starting point for initiating a navigation session. Another
application is in social network analysis, where the potential gain could
provide a novel measure of centrality.

be summarized and the known (not yet decided) contradiction between Einstein
and Bohr will be newly analyzed. The given assumptions have been represented
basically by time-dependent Schroedinger equation, to which some further
assumptions have been added. Some critical comments have been raised against
the given mathematical model structure by Pauli (1933) and by Susskind and
Glogover (1964). They may be removed if only the Schroedinger equation is
conserved and the additional assumptions are abandoned, as shown recently. It
seems to be in contradiction to the numerous declarations that the Copenhagen
model has been approved by experimental results.
  However, in the most of these experiments only the agreement with the mere
Schroedinger equation has been tested. All mentioned assumptions have been
tested practically only in the EPR experiment (measurement of coincidence light
transmission through two polarizers) proposed originally by Einstein (1935).
Also these experimental results have been interpreted as supporting the
Copenhagen alternative, which has not been, however, true. In fact the
microscopic world may be described correspondingly only with the help of the
hidden-variable theory that is represented by the Schroedinger equation without
mentioned additional assumptions, which has the consequence that the earlier
interpretation gap between microscopic and macroscopic worlds has been removed.
The only difference concerns the existence of discrete states. The
possibilities of the human reason of getting to know the nature will be also
shortly discussed in the beginning of this contribution.

affected by theoretical uncertainties, which can be substantially reduced by
fixing the unknown strength parameter g_pp of the residual particle-particle
interaction through one experimental constraint - most notably through the
two-neutrino double beta decay (2nu2beta) lifetime. However, it has been noted
that the g_pp adjustment via 2\nu2\beta data may bring QRPA models in
disagreement with independent data on electron capture (EC) and single beta
decay (beta^-) lifetimes. Actually, in two nuclei of interest for 0nu2beta
decay (Mo-100 and Cd-116), for which all such data are available, we show that
the disagreement vanishes, provided that the axial vector coupling g_A is
treated as a free parameter, with allowance for g_A<1 (``strong quenching'').
Three independent lifetime data (2nu2beta, EC, \beta^-) are then accurately
reproduced by means of two free parameters (g_pp, g_A), resulting in an
overconstrained parameter space. In addition, the sign of the 2nu2beta matrix
element M^2nu is unambiguously selected (M^2nu>0) by the combination of all

phenomenological constraints and their consequences for QRPA estimates of the

the sense that the existence of a Hamiltonian for a given non-holonomic system
is considered to be equivalent to the existence of a non-degenerate Lagrangian
for the system in question. The possible existence of such a Lagrangian is
related to the inverse problem of constructing a Lagrangian from the
appropriate equations of motion. A simple example in three dimensions with one
non-holonomic constraint is analysed in detail, and it is shown that in this
case there is no Lagrangian reproducing the equations of motion in three

across the phase transition in hot gluonic matter using QCD sum rules. In the
QCD sum rule approach, the medium effect on heavy quarkonia is induced by the
change of both scalar and twist-2 gluon condensates, whose temperature
dependences are extracted from the lattice calculations of energy density and
pressure. Although the stability of the operator product expansion side seems
to break down at T > 1.06Tc for the vector channel and T>1.04Tc for the
pseudoscalar channel, we find a sudden change of the spectral property across
the critical temperature Tc, which originates from an equally rapid change of
the scalar gluon condensate characterized by e-3p. By parameterizing the ground
state of the spectral density by the Breit-Wigner form, we find that for both
J/psi and eta_c, the masses suddenly decrease maximally by a few hundreds of
MeV and the widths broaden to ~100 MeV slightly above Tc. Implications for
recent and future heavy ion experiments are discussed.
  We also carry out a similar analysis for charmonia in nuclear matter, which
could serve as a testing ground for observing the precursor phenomena of the
QCD phase transition. We finally discuss the possibility of observing the mass
shift at nuclear matter at the FAIR project at GSI.

detection of Type I X-ray outbursts from SXP46.6, combined with the fact that

we find that the equivalent width of the H_alpha emission line changes over

horizon and the stuff inside the horizon. By any interaction of the subsystems,
the horizon and the interior become entangled, raising thereby a possibility
that their quantum correlations be responsible for the almost purity of the

the same for both subsystems, being also of the same order as the thermal
(coarse grained) entropy of the interior or the horizon. In the context of

excited by gravitational waves from merging binary pulsars. We derive a wave
equation for strongly nonlinear and dispersive Alfven waves. Due to the weak
dispersion of the Alfven waves, significant wave steepening can occur, which in
turn implies strong harmonic generation. We find that the harmonic generation
is saturated due to dispersive effects, and use this to estimate the resulting
spectrum. Finally we discuss the possibility of observing the above process.

for formulation of the three-nucleon bound state is presented in this paper.
The three-nucleon Faddeev equations with two-nucleon interactions are
formulated as a function of vector Jacobi momenta, specifically the magnitudes
of the momenta and the angle between them with the inclusion of the
spin-isospin quantum numbers, without employing a partial wave decomposition.
As an application the spin-isospin dependent Faddeev integral equations are
solved with Bonn-B potential. Our result for the Triton binding energy with the
value of -8.152 MeV is in good agreement with the achievements of the other
partial wave based methods.

  decomposition and the distance scale","17 pages, MNRAS Accepted",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12760.x",,"astro-ph",,"  We report the results of CCD V and r photometry of the globular cluster NGC
5466. The difference image analysis technique adopted in this work has resulted
in accurate time series photometry even in crowded regions of the cluster
enabling us to discover five probably semi-regular variables. We present new
photometry of three previously known eclipsing binaries and six SX Phe stars.
The light curves of the RR Lyrae stars have been decomposed in their Fourier
harmonics and their fundamental physical parameters have been estimated using
semi-empirical calibrations. The zero points of the metallicity, luminosity and
temperature scales are discussed and our Fourier results are transformed
accordingly. The average iron abundance and distance to the Sun derived from
individual RR Lyrae stars, indicate values of [Fe/H]=-1.91 +- 0.19 and D = 16.0
+- 0.6 kpc, or a true distance modulus of 16.02 +- 0.09 mag, for the parent
cluster. These values are respectively in the Zinn & West metallicity scale and
in agreement with recent luminosity determinations for the RR Lyrae stars in
the LMC. The M_V-[Fe/H] relation has been recalibrated as
M_V=+(0.18+-0.03)[Fe/H]+(0.85+-0.05) using the mean values derived by the
Fourier technique on RR Lyrae stars in a family of clusters. This equation
predicts M_V=0.58 mag for [Fe/H]=-1.5, in agreement with the average absolute
magnitude of RR Lyrae stars calculated from several independent methods. The
M_V-[Fe/H] relationship and the value of [Fe/H] have implications on the age of
the globular clusters when determined from the magnitude difference between the
horizontal branch and the turn off point (HB-TO method). The above results
however would not imply a change in the age of NGC 5466, of 12.5+-0.9 Gyr,
estimated from recent isochrone fitting.

ability of scale-free networks to facilitate cooperative behavior deteriorates
continuously, eventually collapsing with the results obtained on regular
graphs. The strategy donations and adaptation probabilities of agents with
different connectivities are studied. Results reveal that strategies generally
spread from agents with larger towards agents with smaller degree. However,
this strategy adoption flow reverses sharply in the fully normalized payoff
limit. Surprisingly, cooperators occupy the hubs even if the averaged
cooperation level due to partly normalized payoffs is moderate.

effects of gamma- and beta-ray irradiation and of subsequent thermal treatment
on many types of a-SiO2 materials, differing in the production methods, OH- and
Al-content, and oxygen deficiencies. Our main objective is to gain further
insight on the microscopic structures of the E'_gamma, E'_delta, E'_alpha and
triplet paramagnetic centers, which are among the most important and studied
class of radiation induced intrinsic point defects in a-SiO2. To pursue this
objective, we use prevalently the EPR spectroscopy. In particular, our work is
focused on the properties of the unpaired electrons wave functions involved in
the defects, and this aspect is mainly investigated through the study of the
EPR signals originating from the interaction of the unpaired electrons with
29Si magnetic nuclei (with nuclear spin I=1/2 and natural abundance 4.7 %). In
addition, in some cases of interest, OA measurements are also performed with
the aim to further characterize the electronic properties of the defects.
Furthermore, due to its relevance for electronics application, the charge state
of the defects is investigated by looking at the processes responsible for the
generation of the defects of interest. Once these information were gained, the
possible sites that can serve as precursors for defects formation are deduced,
with the definitive purpose to obtain in the future more radiation resistant
a-SiO2 materials in which the deleterious effects connected with the point
defects are significantly reduced.

using unitary operations. Under this assumption, many nice properties have been
shown about quantum zero knowledge, including the fact that Honest-Verifier
Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge (HVQSZK) is equal to Cheating-Verifier
Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge (QSZK) (see [Wat02,Wat06]).
  In this paper, we study what happens when we allow an honest verifier to flip
some coins in addition to using unitary operations. Flipping a coin is a
non-unitary operation but doesn't seem at first to enhance the cheating
possibilities of the verifier since a classical honest verifier can flip coins.
In this setting, we show an unexpected result: any classical Interactive Proof
has an Honest-Verifier Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge proof with coins.
Note that in the classical case, honest verifier SZK is no more powerful than
SZK and hence it is not believed to contain even NP. On the other hand, in the
case of cheating verifiers, we show that Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge
where the verifier applies any non-unitary operation is equal to Quantum
Zero-Knowledge where the verifier uses only unitaries.
  One can think of our results in two complementary ways. If we would like to
use the honest verifier model as a means to study the general model by taking
advantage of their equivalence, then it is imperative to use the unitary
definition without coins, since with the general one this equivalence is most
probably not true. On the other hand, if we would like to use quantum zero
knowledge protocols in a cryptographic scenario where the honest-but-curious
model is sufficient, then adding the unitary constraint severely decreases the
power of quantum zero knowledge protocols.

four-level double-$\Lambda$-type systems are studied theoretically. We apply
three continous-wave driving fields and a pulsed probe field such that they
form a closed interaction loop. Due to the closed loop and the finite frequency
width of the probe pulses the multiphoton resonance condition cannot be
fulfilled, such that a time-dependent analysis is required. By identifying the
different underlying physical processes we determine the parts of the solution
relevant to calculate the linear and nonlinear response of the system. We find
that the system can exhibit a strong intensity dependent refractive index with
small absorption over a range of several natural linewidths. For a realistic
example we include Doppler and pressure broadening and calculate the nonlinear
selfphase modulation in a gas cell with Sodium vapor and Argon buffer gas. We
find that a selfphase modulation of $\pi$ is achieved after a propagation of
few centimeters through the medium while the absorption in the corresponding
spectral range is small.
