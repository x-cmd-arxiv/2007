sources--objects with intrinsic colors redder than normal stars--constitute
both signal (young stars) and noise (e.g. background galaxies). We hunt down
(identify) galaxies using near-infrared observations in the Perseus
star-forming region by combining structural information, colors, and number
density estimates. Galaxies at moderate redshifts (z = 0.1 - 0.5) have colors
similar to young stellar objects (YSOs) at both near- and mid-infrared (e.g.
Spitzer) wavelengths, which limits our ability to identify YSOs from colors
alone. Structural information from high-quality near-infrared observations
allows us to better separate YSOs from galaxies, rejecting 2/5 of the YSO
candidates identified from Spitzer observations of our regions and potentially
extending the YSO luminosity function below K of 15 magnitudes where galaxy
contamination dominates. Once they are identified we use galaxies as valuable
extra signal for making extinction maps of molecular clouds. Our new iterative
procedure: the Galaxies Near Infrared Color Excess method Revisited (GNICER),
uses the mean colors of galaxies as a function of magnitude to include them in
extinction maps in an unbiased way. GNICER increases the number of background
sources used to probe the structure of a cloud, decreasing the noise and
increasing the resolution of extinction maps made far from the galactic plane.

mixed finite-differencing/spectral simulation technique, with a transformation
to render trivial the implementation of Lees-Edwards sheared periodic boundary
conditions. For systems with inertia, we reproduce the nonequilibrium steady
states reported in a recent lattice Boltzmann study. The domain coarsening that
would occur in zero shear is arrested by the applied shear flow, which restores
a finite domain size set by the inverse shear rate. For inertialess systems, in
contrast, we find no evidence of nonequilibrium steady states free of finite
size effects: coarsening persists indefinitely until the typical domain size
attains the system size, as in zero shear. We present an analytical argument
that supports this observation, and that furthermore provides a possible
explanation for a hitherto puzzling property of the nonequilibrium steady

this GIT-compactification by Y. The equations of this variety in a suitable
projective embedding are known. This variety also can by identified with a
Baily-Borel compactified ball-quotient. We will describe these results in some

birational map between Y and X . In this paper we use the fact that there are
graded algebras (closely related to algebras of modular forms) A,B such that

comparable to (and, for $\alpha\geq 1$ already more restrictive than) the

the CCSN-GRB connection. Non-detection of a diffuse TeV--PeV neutrino
background by the up-coming IceCube detector in the South pole after three

term may be added to the usual Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of
magnetization motion and detail its physical meaning. After a brief description
of spin-torque driven dynamics in the macrospin approximation, we discuss the
validity of this approximation for various experimentally relevant geometries.
Next, we perform a detailed comparison between accurate experimental data
obtained from nanopillar devices and corresponding numerical modelling. We show
that, on the one hand, many qualitatively important features of the observed
magnetization dynamics (e.g., non-linear frequency shift and frequency jumps
with increasing current) can be satisfactory explained by sophisticated
micromagnetic models, but on the other hand, understanding of these experiments
is still far from being complete. We proceed with the numerical analysis of
point-contact experiments, where an even more complicated magnetization
dynamics is observed. Simulations reveal that such a rich behaviour is due to
the formation of several strongly non-linear oscillation modes. In the last
part of the paper we emphasize the importance of sample characterization and
conclude with some important remarks concerning the relation between
micromagnetic modelling and real experiments.

the flow of material onto and away from protostars during their initial mass
accretion phase. It is becoming increasingly accepted that bipolar outflows are
generated and collimated as material is driven along magnetic field lines and
centrifugally accelerated off a rotating accretion disk. However, the precise
role of the magnetic field is poorly understood and evidence for its shape and
structure has not been forthcoming. Here we report imaging circular polarimetry
in the near-infrared and Monte Carlo modelling showing that the magnetic field
along the bipolar outflow of the HH 135-136 young stellar object is helical.
The field retains this shape for large distances along the outflow, so the
field structure can also provide the necessary magnetic pressure for
collimation of the outflow. This result lends further weight to the hypothesis
- central to any theory of star formation - that the outflow is an important
instrument for the removal of high-angular-momentum material from the accretion
disk, thereby allowing the central protostar to increase its mass.

strong enhancement of the d-electron CDW susceptibility as the temperature
decreases, up to the ferromagnetic transition temperature. In addition, the DCA
captures the signal of a band gap opening due to Peierls instability.

symmetry, in turn, reduces to T-duality on the generic Hitchin fibers, which
are smooth tori. In this paper we study what happens when the Hitchin fibers on
the B-model side develop orbifold singularities. These singularities correspond
to local systems with finite groups of automorphisms. In the classical
Langlands Program local systems of this type are called endoscopic. They play
an important role in the theory of automorphic representations, in particular,
in the stabilization of the trace formula. Our goal is to use the mirror
symmetry of the Hitchin fibrations to expose the special role played by these
local systems in the geometric theory. The study of the categories of A-branes
on the dual Hitchin fibers allows us to uncover some interesting phenomena
associated with the endoscopy in the geometric Langlands correspondence. We
then follow our predictions back to the classical theory of automorphic
functions. This enables us to test and confirm them. The geometry we use is
similar to that which is exploited in recent work by B.-C. Ngo, a fact which
could be significant for understanding the trace formula.

superconducting state. It relies, however, on a knowledge of the single band
contribution from zero to infinite frequency. A number of experiments over the
past five years have used this sum rule; their data has been interpreted in
support of 'kinetic energy-driven superconductivity'. However, because of the
presence of unwanted interband optical spectral weight, they necessarily have
to truncate their sum at a finite frequency. This work examines theoretical
models where the impact of this truncation can be examined first in the normal
state, and then in the superconducting state. The latter case is particularly
important as previous considerations attributed the observed anomalous
temperature dependence as an artifact of a non-infinite cutoff frequency. We
find that this is in fact not the case, and that the sign of the corrections
from the use of a non-infinite cutoff is such that the observed temperature
dependence is even more anomalous when proper account is taken of the cutoff.
On the other hand, in these same models, we find that the strong observed
temperature dependence in the normal state can be attributed to the effect of a
non-infinite cutoff frequency.

corresponding jumps in 5-d masses of the bulk fields, related to different
anomalous dimensions of the corresponding operators. Inclusion of both weakly

inclusion of QCD hard processes.

which seems to show this transition experimentally. Then we propose a dynamical
mechanism for this jump related to instantons, which are point-like bulk
objects located at/near the domain wall. We further argue that in the limit of
large number of colors $N_c\to\infty$ the ""domain wall"" is becoming a true

topology and the algebras underlying it, for analyzing relations obeyed by the
chromatic polynomial \chi(Q) of planar graphs. Using it we give new proofs and
substantially extend a number of classical results concerning the combinatorics
of the chromatic polynomial. In particular, we show that Tutte's golden
identity is a consequence of level-rank duality for SO(N) topological quantum
field theories and Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras. This identity is a
remarkable feature of the chromatic polynomial relating \chi({\phi+2}) for any
triangulation of the sphere to (\chi({\phi+1}))^2 for the same graph, where
\phi denotes the golden ratio. The new viewpoint presented here explains that
Tutte's identity is special to these values of the parameter Q. A natural
context for analyzing such properties of the chromatic polynomial is provided
by the {\em chromatic algebra}, whose Markov trace is the chromatic polynomial
of an associated graph. We use it to show that another identity of Tutte's for
the chromatic polynomial at Q={\phi}+1 arises from a Jones-Wenzl projector in
the Temperley-Lieb algebra. We generalize this identity to each value Q=
2+2\cos(2\pi j/(n+1)) for j< n positive integers. When j=1, these Q are the
Beraha numbers, where the existence of such identities was conjectured by
Tutte. We present a recursive formula for this sequence of chromatic polynomial
relations.

statistically significant for only one Seyfert 1 source, contrasting with the

absorption in half or more of their Seyfert 1 samples at similar redshifts.
Additionally, the remaining sources (14/22) have more complex spectra, well-fit
by an absorbed power law at $E > 2.0$ keV. Five of the complex sources are
classified as Compton-thick candidates. Further, we find four more sources with
properties consistent with the hidden/buried AGN reported by Ueda {\it et al.}

  Ultraviolet Properties of Evolved Stellar Populations """,,,,"astro-ph",,"  A mayor problem that arises in the computation of stellar atmosphere models
is the self consistent determination of the temperature distribution via the
constraint of energy conservation. The energy balance includes the gains due to
the absorption of radiation and the losses due to emission. It is well known
that within each one of the two above integrals the part corresponding to
spectral ranges whose opacity X(nu) is huge can overcome by many orders of
magnitude the part that corresponds to the remaining frequencies. On the other
hand, at those frequencies where X(nu) is very large, the mean intensity J(nu)
of the radiation field shall be equal, up to many significant digits, to the
source function S(nu) and consequently to the Planck function B(nu,T). Then
their net share to the energy balance shall be null, albeit separately their
contributions to the gain and loss integrals are the most important
numerically. Thus the spectral range whose physical contribution to the overall
balance is null will dominate numerically both sides of the energy balance
equation, and consequently the errors on the determination of J(nu) and S(nu)
at these frequencies will falsify the balance.
  It is possible to circumvent the numerical problem brought about by the
foregoing circumstances by solving the radiative transfer equation for the
variable I(n,nu) - S(nu), instead of the customary intensity I(n,nu).
  We present here a novel iterative algorithm, based on iteration factors
already employed by us with success, which makes it possible a fast correction
of the temperature by computing directly the difference between the radiative
losses and gains at each step of the iterations.

determining how quantum states that cannot be prepared under the restriction
may be manipulated and used to circumvent the restriction. A superselection
rule is a restriction that arises through the lack of a classical reference
frame and the states that circumvent it (the resource) are quantum reference
frames. We consider the resource theories that arise from three types of
superselection rule, associated respectively with lacking: (i) a phase
reference, (ii) a frame for chirality, and (iii) a frame for spatial
orientation. Focussing on pure unipartite quantum states (and in some cases
restricting our attention even further to subsets of these), we explore
single-copy and asymptotic manipulations. In particular, we identify the
necessary and sufficient conditions for a deterministic transformation between
two resource states to be possible and, when these conditions are not met, the
maximum probability with which the transformation can be achieved. We also
determine when a particular transformation can be achieved reversibly in the
limit of arbitrarily many copies and find the maximum rate of conversion. A
comparison of the three resource theories demonstrates that the extent to which
resources can be interconverted decreases as the strength of the restriction
increases. Along the way, we introduce several measures of frameness and prove
that these are monotonically nonincreasing under various classes of operations
that are permitted by the superselection rule.

flounder when they are intended to succeed or finitely fail. For concurrent
logic programs this is normally called deadlock. Similarly, constraint logic
programs can fail to invoke certain constraint solvers because variables are
insufficiently instantiated or constrained. Diagnosing such faults has received
relatively little attention to date. Since delay primitives affect the
procedural but not the declarative view of programs, it may be expected that
debugging would have to consider the often complex details of interleaved
execution. However, recent work on semantics has suggested an alternative
approach. In this paper we show how the declarative debugging paradigm can be
used to diagnose unexpected floundering, insulating the user from the
complexities of the execution.

These measurements were intended to search for a recently predicted
antiferromagnetic giant magnetoresistance (AGMR) similar to GMR seen in
multilayers containing two ferromagnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic
layer. We report on MR measurements for current injected from point contacts
into sandwiches containing different combinations of layers of F = CoFe and AFM

initial results led us to examine also AFM/F/N/AFM, F/AFM, and single F- and
AFM-layer structures. At low currents, no MR was observed in any samples, and
no MR was observed at any current densities in samples containing only AFMs.
Together, these results indicate that no AGMR is present in these samples. In
samples containing F-layers, high current densities sometimes produced a small
positive MR - largest resistance at high fields. For a given contact
resistance, this MR was usually larger for thicker F-layers, and for a given
current, it was usually larger for larger contact resistances (smaller
contacts). We tentatively attribute this positive MR to suppression at high
currents of spin accumulation induced around and within the F-layers.

accelerating. This revolutionary advance in cosmological observations confronts
theoretical cosmology with a tremendous challenge, which it has so far failed
to meet. Explanations of cosmic acceleration within the framework of general
relativity are plagued by difficulties. General relativistic models are nearly
all based on a dark energy field with fine-tuned, unnatural properties. There
is a great variety of models, but all share one feature in common -- an
inability to account for the gravitational properties of the vacuum energy.
Speculative ideas from string theory may hold some promise, but it is fair to
say that no convincing model has yet been proposed. An alternative to dark
energy is that gravity itself may behave differently from general relativity on
the largest scales, in such a way as to produce acceleration. The alternative
approach of modified gravity (or dark gravity) provides a new angle on the
problem, but also faces serious difficulties, including in all known cases
severe fine-tuning and the problem of explaining why the vacuum energy does not
gravitate. The lack of an adequate theoretical framework for the late-time
acceleration of the universe represents a deep crisis for theory -- but also an
exciting challenge for theorists. It seems likely that an entirely new paradigm
is required to resolve this crisis.

control-qubit architecture for quantum information, where the effective
exchange coupling between two atoms is controlled by the electronic state of a
third. We use a combination of the effective-mass approximation and the quantum
defect method; our variational ansatz is particularly suited to cases where an
excited state of one of the donors (control) is partially delocalised over
several different centres, forming an analogue of an extended molecular
orbital. Our method allows calculations of the ""on/off"" ratios of exchange
interactions in such cases. We compare exchange interactions when the control
is in the ""on"" and ""off"" states, and find that both the magnitude and sign of
the exchange interactions may be changed. To rationalize the sign-change, we
carry out a simple Green's function perturbation-theory calculation. This
simple model qualitatively explains the sign change and illustrates its origins
both in ring-exchange processes and in the delocalization of the control
electron. We also compute probability distributions for the coupling strengths
over the ensemble of clusters, and show that excitation of the control causes
narrowing of the distributions along with shifts to larger magnitudes and from
anti-ferromagnetic to ferromagnetic coupling.

In this paper, we show that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are elements of $G$ such
that $\alpha^k=\beta^k$ for some nonzero integer $k$, then $\alpha$ and $\beta$
are conjugate in $G$. For the Artin group of type $\mathbf A_n$, this was
recently proved by J. Gonz\'alez-Meneses.
  In fact, we prove a stronger theorem, from which the above result follows
easily by using descriptions of those Artin groups as subgroups of the braid
group on $n+1$ strands. Let $P$ be a subset of $\{1,...,n\}$. An $n$-braid is
said to be \emph{$P$-pure} if its induced permutation fixes each $i\in P$, and
\emph{$P$-straight} if it is $P$-pure and it becomes trivial when we delete all
the $i$-th strands for $i\not\in P$. Exploiting the Nielsen-Thurston
classification of braids, we show that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are $P$-pure
$n$-braids such that $\alpha^k=\beta^k$ for some nonzero integer $k$, then
there exists a $P$-straight $n$-braid $\gamma$ with
$\beta=\gamma\alpha\gamma^{-1}$. Moreover, if $1\in P$, the conjugating element
$\gamma$ can be chosen to have the first strand algebraically unlinked with the
other strands. Especially in case of $P=\{1,...,n\}$, our result implies the
uniqueness of root of pure braids, which was known by V. G. Bardakov and by D.

many probes of underdoped cuprates clearly point to a non Fermi-liquid normal

explanation of the magneto-oscillations as emerging from the quantum
interference of the vortex lattice and checkerboard modulations of the electron
density of states revealed by STM with atomic resolution in some cuprate
superconductors. The checkerboard effectively pins the vortex lattice, when the
period of the latter is commensurate with the period of the checkerboard. This
condition yields 1/\sqrt{B} periodicity of the response functions versus
magnetic field B, rather than 1/B periodicity of conventional normal state
oscillations. Our solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii-type equation for composed
charged bosons accounting for the d-wave symmetry of the order-parameter and
its checkerboard modulations describes well changes in resonant frequency of
the tunnel-diode oscillator circuit with YBa2Cu4O8 and the oscillatory part of

established by recording time correlations in backward time. The beta half
lives of the nuclides and the detection efficiency of the set-up are determined
simultaneously from a least-squares fit of the ratio of the time-correlation
spectra recorded in forward and in backward time, using numerical functions.
The necessary numerical functions are calculated in a Monte-Carlo code using
the known operation parameters of the experiment and different values for the
two free parameters, half-life and detection efficiency, as input parameters.

interactions between supernova remnants (SNRs) and dense molecular clouds for
triggering star formation we have built a diagram of SNR radius versus cloud
density in which the constraints above delineate a shaded zone where star
formation is allowed. We have also performed fully 3-D radiatively cooling
numerical simulations of the impact between SNRs and clouds under different
initial conditions in order to follow the initial steps of these interactions.
We determine the conditions that may lead either to cloud collapse and star
formation or to complete cloud destruction and find that the numerical results
are consistent with those of the SNR-cloud density diagram. Finally, we have
applied the results above to the $\beta-$ Pictoris stellar association which is
composed of low mass Post-T Tauri stars with an age of 11 Myr. It has been
recently suggested that its formation could have been triggered by the shock
wave produced by a SN explosion localized at a distance of about 62 pc that may
have occurred either in the Lower Centaurus Crux (LCC) or in the Upper
Centaurus Lupus (UCL) which are both nearby older subgroups of that association
(Ortega and co-workers).Using the results of the analysis above we have shown
that the suggested origin for the young association at the proposed distance is
plausible only for a very restricted range of initial conditions for the parent
molecular cloud, i.e., a cloud with a radius of the order of 10 pc, a density
of the order of 10$-$20 cm$^{-3}$, and a temperature of the order of 10$-$100 K

components. This was long thought to be impossible, but our position
eigenvectors have a vortex structure like twisted light. Thus they are not
spherically symmetric and the position operator does not transform as a vector,
so that previous non-existence arguments do not apply. We find two classes of
position eigenvectors and obtain photon wave functions by projection onto the
bases of position eigenkets that they define, following the usual rules of
quantum mechanics. The hermitian position operator, r0, leads to a
Landau-Peierls wave function, while field-like eigenvectors of the nonhermitian
position operator and its adjoint lead to a biorthonormal basis. These two
bases are equivalent in the sense that they are related by a similarity
transformation. The eigenvectors of the nonhermitian position operators lead to
a field-potential wave function pair. These field-like positive frequency wave
functions satisfy Maxwell's equations, and thus justify the supposition that
MEs describe single photon wave mechanics. The expectation value of the number
operator is photon density with undetected photons integrated over, consistent
with Feynman's conclusion that the density of non-interacting particles can be
interpreted as probability density.

U(1) x SU(N) extensions of the Abelian-Higgs model in four dimensions. The
distinctive feature of a non-Abelian vortex is the presence of an internal
CP^{N-1} space of orientational degrees of freedom. For fine-tuned values of
the couplings, the vortices are BPS and there is no net force between two
static parallel vortices at arbitrary distance. On the other hand, for generic
values of the couplings the interactions between two vortices depend
non-trivially on their relative internal orientations. We discuss the problem
both with a numerical approach (valid for small deviations from the BPS limit)
and in a semi-analytical way (valid at large vortex separations). The
interactions can be classified with respect to their asymptotic property at
large vortex separation. In a simpler fine-tuned model, we find two regimes
which are quite similar to the usual type I/II Abelian superconductors. In the
generic model we find other two new regimes: type I*/II*. Unlike the type I
(type II) case, where the interaction is always attractive (repulsive), the
type I* and II* have both attractive and repulsive interactions depending on
the relative orientation. We have found a rich variety of interactions at small
vortex separations. For some values of the couplings, a bound state of two
static vortices at a non-zero distance exists.

electronic phase diagram of an aluminum arsenide quantum wire which is an
example of an interacting one dimensional electron liquid. Using one
dimensional field theoretic methods involving abelian bosonization and the
renormalization group we show the existence of a spin gapped quantum wire with
electronic ground states such as charge density wave and singlet
superconductivity. The superconducting state arises due to the unique umklapp
interaction present in the aluminum arsenide quantum wire bandstructure
discussed in this dissertation. It is characterized by Cooper pairs carrying a
finite pairing momentum. This is a realization of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-
Ovchinnikov state which is known to lead to inhomogeneous superconductivity.
The dissertation also presents a theoretical analysis of the finite temperature
single hole spectral function of the one dimensional electron liquid with
gapless spin and charge modes (Luttinger liquid). The hole spectral function is
measured in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. The results
predict a kink in the effective electronic dispersion of the Luttinger liquid.
A systematic study of the temperature and interaction dependence of the kink
provides an alternative way to detect spincharge separation in one dimensional
systems where the peak due to the spin part of the spectral function is

radial-velocity measurements present a variation with amplitude characteristic
of a planetary-mass companion and in-phase with the light-curve. Adaptive
optics imaging shows no evidence for nearby stellar companions, and
line-bisector analysis excludes faint, unresolved binarity and stellar activity
as the cause of the radial-velocity variations. We make a preliminary
spectroscopic analysis of the host star finding it to have Teff = 6400+-100 K

sequence star of spectral type F7-8V. Our simultaneous modelling of the transit

believed to behave like a long Josephson junction with alternating sections of
$0$ and $\pi$ symmetry. We calculate the field-dependent critical current of
such a junction, using a simple model. The calculation involves discretizing
the partial differential equation for the phase difference across a long
$0$-$\pi$ junction. In this form, the equations describe a hybrid ladder of
inductively coupled small $0$ and $\pi$ resistively and capacitively shunted
Josephson junctions (RCSJ's). The calculated critical critical current density
$J_c(H_a)$ is maximum at non-zero applied magnetic field $H_a$, and depends
strongly on the ratio of Josephson penetration depth $\lambda_J$ to facet
length $L_f$. If $\lambda_J/L_f \gg 1$ and the number of facets is large, there
is a broad range of $H_a$ where $J_c(H_a)$ is less than $2\%$ of the maximum
critical current density of a long $0$ junction. All of these features are in
qualitative agreement with recent experiments. In the limit $\lambda_J/L_f \to
\infty$, our model reduces to a previously-obtained analytical superposition
result for $J_c(H_a)$. In the same limit, we also obtain an analytical
expression for the effective field-dependent quality factor $Q_J(H_a)$, finding
that $Q_J(H_a) \propto \sqrt{J_c(H_a)}$. We suggest that measuring the
field-dependence of $Q_J(H_a)$ would provide further evidence that this RCSJ

error in my paper: [Phys. Lett. B \textbf{650}, 208 (2007), arXiv:0706.1872v2]
and that it is possible to escape its main conclusion, namely that the
unitarity of the time-evolution and observability of the Hamiltonian imply
time-independence of the metric operator. In this note I give a very short
calculation showing that the analysis given by M. Znojil also leads to the same
conclusion as of my above-mentioned paper. This is actually a reconfirmation of
the validity of the results of the latter paper.

  Other Discrete Systems","22 pages New version with dedication to Avner Friedman",,,,"math.DS",,"  Discrete dynamical systems defined on the state space {0,1,...,p-1}^n have
been used in multiple applications, most recently for the modeling of gene and
protein networks. In this paper we study to what extent well-known theorems by
Smale and Hirsch, which form part of the theory of (continuous) monotone
dynamical systems, generalize or fail to do so in the discrete case.
  We show that that arbitrary m-dimensional systems cannot necessarily be
embedded into n-dimensional cooperative systems for n=m+1, as in the Smale
theorem for the continuous case, but we show that this is possible for n=m+2 as
long as p is sufficiently large.
  We also prove that a natural discrete analogue of strong cooperativity
implies nontrivial bounds on the lengths of periodic orbits and imposes a
condition akin to Lyapunov stability on all attractors. Finally, we explore
several natural candidates for definitions of irreducibility of a discrete
system. While some of these notions imply the strong cooperativity of a given
cooperative system and impose even tighter bounds on the lengths of periodic
orbits than strong cooperativity alone, other plausible definitions allow the
existence of exponentially long periodic orbits.

  Stochastic Process. Appl",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a model for a polymer interacting with an attractive wall through
a random sequence of charges. We focus on the so-called diluted limit, when the
charges are very rare but have strong intensity. In this regime, we determine
the quenched critical point of the model, showing that it is different from the
annealed one. The proof is based on a rigorous renormalization procedure.
Applications of our results to the problem of a copolymer near a selective
interface are discussed.

to Higgs production via the process b bbar -> H as well as gg -> H through
next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO). The soft corrections are
complete while the collinear corrections include leading and some subleading
logarithms. Numerical results at the Tevatron and the LHC are presented,
primarily for b bbar -> H. It is shown that the collinear terms greatly improve
the soft and virtual approximation at next-to-leading order (NLO) and
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), especially when subleading terms are
included. The NNNLO collinear and soft corrections provide significant
enhancements to the total cross section. I also provide expressions for the
collinear and soft corrections through NNNLO for the related Drell-Yan process.

and their argument to be revealing, In our view, there are three missing

potential, and on adiabaticity.
