(2) Significant correlation in the total intensity of the individual pulses
between 303 and 610 MHz is reported from the simultaneous dual frequency
observations, which is indicative of the broadband nature of the emission. We
also report correlation between total energy in the main pulse and inter-pulse

(P2) evolves significantly between these two frequencies, and in a manner
opposite to the average profile evolution. In addition, we confirm the
dependence of P2 on pulse longitude at 303 MHz and find indications for the

along the c-axis have been made while changing the angular direction of the

Comparisons of the TiO bands to model and template spectra are fully consistent
with the temperatures previously derived for this system. In particular, the
reversal of temperatures with mass - in which the higher-mass primary is cooler
than its companion - is confirmed. We measure the projected rotation velocities
of the compononents; the primary is rotating at least twice as rapidly as the
secondary. At the two radial velocity maxima, Halpha emission lines of both
components stick out to either sides of the Halpha central wavelength, which is
dominated by nebula emission. This enables us to model the individual Halpha
lines of the primary and the secondary. We find that the Halpha emission from
the primary is at least 7 times stronger than the emission from the secondary.
We conclude that the temperature reversal is very likely due to strong magnetic
fields inhibiting convection on the primary.

results at sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV. The modification factor R_{AA} shows a rapid
increase with transverse momentum in the covered region. This indicates that
the Cronin effect is the dominating effect in our energy range. The
modification factor R_{CP}, in which the contribution of the Cronin effect is
reduced, shows a saturation well below unity in the pi^{+/-} channel. The
extracted R_{CP} values follow the 200 GeV RHIC results closely in the
available transverse momentum range, except for pi^{+/-} above 2.5 GeV/c
transverse momentum. There the measured suppression is smaller than that
observed at RHIC.

the beamforming and precoding codebooks from this base codebook, eliminating

strong interactions give rise to collisional hydrodynamics. Two-fluid

as $S_{SG_d}=\lim_{n \to \infty} \ln N_d(n)/v(n)$, is calculated to be
$\ln(2)/3$ exactly for $SG_2(n)$. The numbers of dimers on the generalized
Sierpinski gasket $SG_{d,b}(n)$ with $d=2$ and $b=3,4,5$ are also obtained
exactly. Their entropies are equal to $\ln(6)/7$, $\ln(28)/12$, $\ln(200)/18$,
respectively. The upper and lower bounds for the entropy are derived in terms
of the results at a certain stage for $SG_d(n)$ with $d=3,4,5$. As the
difference between these bounds converges quickly to zero as the calculated
stage increases, the numerical value of $S_{SG_d}$ with $d=3,4,5$ can be
evaluated with more than a hundred significant figures accurate.

description of the energetics of proton transfer and solvation in complex
molecular systems and can be efficiently used in molecular dynamics computer
simulations. Within such models, the location of the moving protonic charge can
be specified by the so called center of charge, defined as a weighted average
over the diabatic states of the EVB model. In this paper, we use first order
perturbation theory to calculate the molecular forces that arise if a bias
potential is applied to the center of charge. Such bias potentials are often
necessary when molecular dynamics simulations are used to determine free
energies related to proton transfer and not all relevant proton positions are
sampled with sufficient frequency during the available computing time. The
force expressions we derive are easy to evaluate and do not create any
significant computational cost compared with unbiased EVB-simulations. As an
illustration of the method, we study proton transfer in a small liquid water
droplet consisting of 128 water molecules plus an excess proton. Contrary to
predictions of continuum electrostatics but in agreement with previous computer
simulations of similar systems, we observe that the excess proton is
predominantly located at the surface of the droplet. Using the formalism
developed in this paper, we calculate the reversible work required to carry the
protonic charge from the droplet surface to its core finding a value of roughly
4 $k_{\rm B}T$.

When a path encloses such point, the accumulated geometrical phase is sensitive

can be used to characterize the eigenvector singularities through their Chern
indices, which are integers. They can be used to quantize a physical quantity
of interest. This quantity changes continuously during an adiabatic evolution

and may lead to erroneous reports of p modes in these data. Two methods are
used to illustrate the role of subtle instrumental effects in the photometry:
time-frequency analysis, and a search for regularly spaced peaks in a Fourier
spectrum based on the echelle diagramme approach. We find no convincing
evidence of a p-mode signal in the MOST Procyon data. We can account for an
apparent excess of power close to the p-mode frequency range and signs of
structure in an echelle diagramme in terms of instrumental effects.

the role of random walks in complex networks and show how they may be used to

key idea is that in many cases the process involves copying of properties of
near neighbours in the network and this is a type of short random walk which in
turn produce a natural preferential attachment mechanism. Applying this to
networks of fixed size I show that copying and innovation are processes with
special mathematical properties which include the ability to solve a simple

and documentation, the composition of a test suite needs to be well understood
in order to identify opportunities as well as weaknesses for further evolution.
In this paper, we argue that the visualization of structural characteristics is
a viable means to support the exploration of test suites. Thanks to general
agreement on a limited set of key test design principles, such visualizations
are relatively easy to interpret. In particular, we present visualizations that
support testers in (i) locating test cases; (ii) examining the relation between
test code and production code; and (iii) studying the composition of and
dependencies within test cases. By means of two case studies, we demonstrate
how visual patterns help to identify key test suite characteristics. This
approach forms the first step in assisting a developer to build up
understanding about test suites beyond code reading.

the mass assembly of galaxies. However, minor mergers are relatively difficult
to detect using imaging, especially at high redshift. While such events are
much less violent than major mergers, they can nevertheless leave several
features on the kinematical structures of remnant galaxies which could be
detected using 3D spectroscopy. We present the first direct detection of a
minor merger in a z~0.6 galaxy. Such events could indeed be good candidates to
explain the kinematics of perturbed rotating disks observed with GIRAFFE at
z~0.6. We present photometric and kinematical evidence of such an event in a
combined analysis of three-band HST/ACS imaging and VLT/GIRAFFE 2D-kinematics.
Using these data, we are able to demonstrate that a minor merger of a
relatively small satellite (mass ratio ~1:18) is occurring in this galaxy. We
also derive a total SFR ~21Mo/yr. Minor mergers could be one of the physical
processes explaining the kinematics of perturbed rotating disks, which
represent ~25% of emission line intermediate mass galaxies at z~0.6. 3D
spectroscopy appears to be a very good tool to identify minor mergers in
distant (and local) galaxies.

describing different two-site interactions which can be active only in the case
when the level will be occupied by the electrons. A typical feature is the
appearence of two generalized $t-J$ interactions ascribed to two different
energy levels which do not vanish even for $% U=J^{(1)}=J^{(2)}=V=0$ and their
coupling constants are equal to $\pm t$ in this case. The competition between
ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism and superconductivity (intrasite and
intersite pairings) is also a typical feature of the model because it persists
in the case $U=J^{(1)}=J^{(2)}=V=0$ and $t\neq 0$. The same types of the
electronic, competitive interactions are scattered between different energy
levels and therefore their thermodynamical activities are dependent on the
occupation of these levels. It qualitatively explains the origin of the phase

top of a square array of size-graded magnetic dots with a constant lattice

observed in AmFm stars. However, the detailed process has still not been
well-established. For instance, two possible scenarios for the diffusion theory
are presently envisaged. They differ mainly by the depth from which the
abundance anomalies emanate. The first scenario predicts that the abundances
are modified in the superficial regions of the star, just below the hydrogen
convection zone. The second scenario predicts that a much deeper extension of
the mixing zone exists due to the convection caused by Fe accumulation in
regions below the hydrogen convection zone. {\rm Aims.} We calculate much more
accurate radiative accelerations of Sc than previously, to better understand
the observed abundance anomalies of this element. We believe that it is a key
element to use as a diagnostic tool for understanding AmFm stars.
  {\rmMethods.} The method employed to obtain these radiative accelerations is
based on an interpolation from the parameters of the so-called SVP parametric
method.
  {\rm Results.} The radiative accelerations, shown here in a typical Am
stellar model, are discussed in light of the observed anomalies of Ca and Sc.
Our results suggest that the deeper mixing scenario is not entirely
satisfactory: the mixing zone should be deeper than what is predicted by recent
models to account for observed Sc underabundances. Our results seem more
compatible with the scenario where the abundances anomalies are created in the
superficial regions. However, only detailed evolutionary modelling with mass
loss and diffusion of all important species, including Ca and Sc, with accurate
radiative accelerations, will be able to give more insight into where the
source of these anomalies occur in AmFm stars.

by a power law having photon index of 1.8^{+0.4}_{-0.3} and a 20-100 keV flux
of 1.5E{-11} erg/cm^2/s. Analysis of archival Chandra data over different
energy bands rules out the supernova shell as the site of the soft gamma-ray
emission while broad band (1-200 keV) spectral analysis strongly indicates that
the INTEGRAL/IBIS photons originate in the central zone of the system which
contains both the pulsar and its nebula. The composite X-ray and soft gamma-ray
spectrum indicates that the pulsar provides around half of the emission seen in
the soft gamma-ray domain; its spectrum is hard with no sign of a cut off up to
at least 80 keV. The other half of the emission above 10 keV comes from the
PWN; with a power law slope of 1.7 its spectrum is softer than that of the

effect. First we write the Casimir energy as a sum over the modes of a real
cavity. We may identify two sorts of modes, two evanescent surface plasmon
modes and propagative modes. As one of the surface plasmon modes becomes
propagative for some choice of parameters we adopt an adiabatic mode definition
where we follow this mode into the propagative sector and count it together
with the surface plasmon contribution, calling this contribution ""plasmonic"".
The remaining modes are propagative cavity modes, which we call ""photonic"". The
Casimir energy contains two main contributions, one coming from the plasmonic,
the other from the photonic modes. Surprisingly we find that the plasmonic
contribution to the Casimir energy becomes repulsive for intermediate and large
mirror separations. Alternatively, we discuss the common surface plasmon
defintion, which includes only evanescent waves, where this effect is not
found. We show that, in contrast to an intuitive expectation, for both
definitions the Casimir energy is the sum of two very large contributions which
nearly cancel each other. The contribution of surface plasmons to the Casimir
energy plays a fundamental role not only at short but also at large distances.

  Letters","ApJ Letters, 680 (2008) 101","10.1086/589943",,"astro-ph",,"  NGC 5128 is a well-studied elliptical galaxy with an excellent kinematic data
set for planetary nebulae which has been modelled up till now only by solving
the Jeans equation for spherical systems. As a first approximation beyond
spherical symmetry we model the galaxy as an axisymmetric system flattened by
rotation with isotropic velocity distribution. We propose a new version of such
an isotropic rotator having cuspy density profile with NFW-like behavior. The
solutions of the Jeans equations for a single component of such form do not
reproduce the data well: the rotation curve rises too slowly with radius and
the velocity dispersion profile drops too fast. The data are well fitted
however by a system built with two components: a more compact, flattened, less
massive, fast-rotating and cold `bulge' and an extended, almost spherical, more
massive, slow-rotating and hot `halo'. This picture agrees well with the
results of recent N-body simulations of galaxy mergers which tend to produce
oblate rotating spheroids. The total mass of the system is estimated to be (9.1
+/- 3.5) x 10^11 solar masses and the mass-to-light ratio is only 26 +/- 17
solar units.

nonaxisymmetric field pattern. Nonlinear simulations in an infinite
Taylor-Couette system with current-free external field show, that not only the
linearly unstable mode m=1 appears, but also an inverse cascade transporting

of the flow and the Hartmann number for the magnetic field, we find that the
ratio between axisymmetric (m=0) and dominating nonaxisymmetric mode (m=1) can
be nearly free chosen. On the surface of the outer cylinder this mode
distribution appears similarly, but with weaker axisymmetric fields. We do not
find significant differences in the case that a constant current within the
flow is added.

abundances, mass loss rates and wind terminal velocities. We find that the
stars in our sample are either H-rich WN7-9 stars (WN7-9h) or O supergiants,
two being classified as OIf+. All stars are 2-4 Myr old. There is marginal
evidence for a younger age among the most massive stars. The WN7-9h stars reach
luminosities as large as 2 x 1e6 Lsun, consistent with initial masses of ~ 120
Msun. They are still quite H-rich, but show both N enhancement and C depletion.
They are thus identified as core H-burning objects showing products of the CNO
equilibrium at their surface. Their progenitors are most likely supergiants of
spectral types earlier than O4-6 and initial masses > 60 Msun. Their winds
follow a well defined modified wind momentum - luminosity relation (WLR): this
is a strong indication that they are radiatively driven. Stellar abundances
tend to favor a slightly super solar metallicity, at least for the lightest
metals. We note however that the evolutionary models seem to under-predict the
degree of N enrichment.

the effective potential is different from the low temperature case suggesting
that the theory is in the deconfined phase. At finite $N$, the Polyakov loop is
non-zero in the high temperature phase only in theories with no unbroken center
