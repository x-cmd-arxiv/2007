>10^10 M_Sun/h^2 at z~2 and dominate the star-formation rate density of the
Universe at this early epoch. It is thus critical to understand their origins,
evolution, and connection to the underlying dark matter distribution. To this
end, we identify the dark matter halos (including subhalos) that are likely to
contain star-forming galaxies at z~2 (z2SFGs) within a large dissipationless
cosmological simulation and then use halo merger histories to follow the
evolution of z2SFG descendants to z~1 and z~0. The evolved halos at these
epochs are then confronted with an array of observational data in order to
uncover the likely descendants of z2SFGs. Though the evolved halos have
clustering strengths comparable to red galaxies at z~1 and z~0, we find that
the bulk of z2SFGs do not evolve into red galaxies, at either epoch. This
conclusion is based primarily on the fact that the space density of z2SFGs is
much higher than that of lower redshift red galaxies, even when accounting for
the merging of z2SFG descendants, which decreases the number density of z2SFG
descendants by at most a factor of two by z~0. Of the ~50% of z2SFGs that
survive to z~0, ~70% reside at the center of z~0 dark matter halos with M>10^12
M_Sun/h. Halo occupation modeling of z~0 galaxies suggests that such halos are
occupied by galaxies with M_r<-20.5, implying that these z2SFGs evolve into
``typical'' ~ L* galaxies today, including our own Galaxy. The remaining ~30%
become satellite galaxies by z~0, and comparison to halo occupation modeling
suggests that they are rather faint, with M_r<-19.5. (ABRIDGED)

a mild excess of OVI arising from the Local Bubble, combining our new results
with earlier surveys of OVI, and eliminating stars that show conspicuous
localized X-ray emission, we find an average OVI mid-plane density n_0 = 1.3e-8
cm^-3. The density decreases away from the plane of the Galaxy in a way that is
consistent with an exponential scale height of 3.2 kpc at negative latitudes or
4.6 kpc at positive latitudes. Average volume densities of OVI along different
sight lines exhibit a dispersion of about 0.26 dex, irrespective of the
distances to the target stars. This indicates that OVI does not arise in
randomly situated clouds of a fixed size and density, but instead is
distributed in regions that have a very broad range of column densities, with
the more strongly absorbing clouds having a lower space density. Line widths
and centroid velocities are much larger than those expected from differential
Galactic rotation, but they are nevertheless correlated with distance and
N(OVI), which reinforces our picture of a diverse population of hot plasma
regions that are ubiquitous over the entire Galactic disk. The velocity
extremes of the OVI profiles show a loose correlation with those of very strong
lines of less ionized species, supporting a picture of a turbulent, multiphase
medium churned by shock-heated gas from multiple supernova explosions.

understanding of current cosmological experimental data provided e.g. by cosmic
microwave anisotropy probes. A key issue in that theory is to extract the gauge
invariant degrees of freedom which allow unambiguous comparison between theory
and experiment. When one goes beyond first (linear) order, the task of writing
the Einstein equations expanded to n'th order in terms of quantities that are
gauge invariant up to terms of higher orders becomes highly non-trivial and
cumbersome. This fact has prevented progress for instance on the issue of the
stability of linear perturbation theory and is a subject of current debate in
the literature. In this series of papers we circumvent these difficulties by
passing to a manifestly gauge invariant framework. In other words, we only
perturb gauge invariant, i.e. measurable quantities, rather than gauge variant
ones. Thus, gauge invariance is preserved non perturbatively while we construct
the perturbation theory for the equations of motion for the gauge invariant
observables to all orders. In this first paper we develop the general framework
which is based on a seminal paper due to Brown and Kuchar as well as the
realtional formalism due to Rovelli. In the second, companion, paper we apply
our general theory to FRW cosmologies and derive the deviations from the
standard treatment in linear order. As it turns out, these deviations are
negligible in the late universe, thus our theory is in agreement with the
standard treatment. However, the real strength of our formalism is that it
admits a straightforward and unambiguous, gauge invariant generalisation to
higher orders. This will also allow us to settle the stability issue in a
future publication.

gauge-invariant observables for general relativity. This was possible by
coupling the system of gravity and matter to pressureless dust which plays the
role of a dynamically coupled observer. The evolution of those observables is
governed by a physical Hamiltonian and we derived the corresponding equations
of motion. Linear perturbation theory of those equations of motion around a
general exact solution in terms of manifestly gauge invariant perturbations was
then developed. In this paper we specialise our previous results to an FRW
background which is also a solution of our modified equations of motion. We
then compare the resulting equations with those derived in standard
cosmological perturbation theory (SCPT). We exhibit the precise relation
between our manifestly gauge-invariant perturbations and the linearly
gauge-invariant variables in SCPT. We find that our equations of motion can be
cast into SCPT form plus corrections. These corrections are the trace that the
dust leaves on the system in terms of a conserved energy momentum current
density. It turns out that these corrections decay, in fact, in the late
universe they are negligible whatever the value of the conserved current. We
conclude that the addition of dust which serves as a test observer medium,
while implying modifications of Einstein's equations without dust, leads to
acceptable agreement with known results, while having the advantage that one
now talks about manifestly gauge-invariant, that is measurable, quantities,
which can be used even in perturbation theory at higher orders.

is the comparison of these predictions with direct numerical solutions for the

a coset space string sigma model in the conformal gauge and writing the
classical equations in terms of currents one can fix the residual conformal
diffeomorphism symmetry and kappa-symmetry and introduce a new set of variables
(related locally to currents but non-locally to the original string coordinate
fields) so that the Virasoro constraints are automatically satisfied. The
resulting gauge-fixed equations can be obtained from a Lagrangian of a
non-abelian Toda type: a gauged WZW model with an integrable potential coupled
also to a set of 2d fermionic fields. A gauge-fixed form of the
Pohlmeyer-reduced theory can be found by integrating out the 2d gauge field of
the gauged WZW model. Its small-fluctuation spectrum contains 8 bosonic and 8
fermionic degrees of freedom with equal masses. We conjecture that the reduced
model has world-sheet supersymmetry and is ultraviolet-finite. We show that in

Zhou & Wong have presented a new stochastic simulation method called the
equi-energy (EE) sampler. This technique is designed to simulate from a
probability measure $\pi$, perhaps only known up to a normalizing constant. The
authors demonstrate that the sampler performs well in quite challenging
problems but their convergence results (Theorem 2) appear incomplete. This was
pointed out, in the discussion of the paper, by Atchad\'e & Liu (2006) who
proposed an alternative convergence proof. However, this alternative proof,
whilst theoretically correct, does not correspond to the algorithm that is
implemented. In this note we provide a new proof of convergence of the
equi-energy sampler based on the Poisson equation and on the theory developed
in Andrieu et al. (2007) for \emph{Non-Linear} Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
The objective of this note is to provide a proof of correctness of the EE
sampler when there is only one feeding chain; the general case requires a much
more technical approach than is suitable for a short note. In addition, we also
seek to highlight the difficulties associated with the analysis of this type of
algorithm and present the main techniques that may be adopted to prove the
convergence of it.

Spectral synthesis modelling has been used to estimate the ages of the stellar
populations found in the diffuse light sampled by the spectra. The data show a
remarkable uniformity in the stellar populations across the full 65 arcsec
covered by our slit positions, sampling the measurable extent of the galaxy.
The results are consistent with a dominant intermediate-age stellar population
(ISP) with age 0.5 < t_{ISP} $\leq$ 0.9 Gyr that is present at all locations,
with varying contributions from a young ($\leq$ 0.1 Gyr) stellar population
(YSP) component. However, it is notable that while the flux contribution of the
YSP component in the extended regions is relatively small ($\leq$ 40%),
adequate fits in the nuclear region are only found for combinations with a
significant contribution of a YSP component (22 - 63%). Moreover, while a low
intrinsic reddening (E(B - V)$\lsim$ 0.3) is found for the ISPs in the extended
regions, intrinsic reddening values as high as E(B - V) ~ 1.0 are required in
the galactic center. This clearly reflects the presence of a reddening
gradient, with higher concentrations of gas and dust towards the nuclear
regions, coinciding with dust lanes in the HST images. Overall, our results are
consistent with models that predict an epoch of enhanced star formation
coinciding with the first pass of the merging nuclei (represented by the ISP),
with a further episode of star formation occurring as the nuclei finally merge
together (represented by the YSP and ULIRG).

essential molecular crossroads involved in major physiological and pathological
conditions. Within this system, the putative tumor suppressor insulin-degrading
enzyme (IDE) should be an important modulator. Perhaps most remarkably, the
abstraction of this encounter between insulin and RB, two growth-regulatory
giants acting either in concert or against each other depending on the
respective cellular requirements, reveals that Nature may compute in
controlling cell fate and we could follow in its footsteps towards developing
more efficient therapeutics as well as novel technical devices.

environment are dependent upon the charge acquired by the micron-sized dust
grains during the coagulation process. The manner in which the charge is
arranged on developing irregular structures can affect the fractal dimension of
aggregates formed during collisions, which in turn influences the coagulation
rate and size evolution of the dust within the plasma cloud. This paper
presents preliminary models for the charge and size evolution of fractal
aggregates immersed in a plasma environment calculated using a modification to
the orbital-motion-limited (OML) theory. Primary electron and ion currents
incident on points on the aggregate surface are determined using a
line-of-sight (LOS) approximation: only those electron or ion trajectories
which are not blocked by another grain within the aggregate contribute to the
charging current. Using a self-consistent iterative approach, the equilibrium
charge and dipole moment are calculated for the dust aggregate. The charges are
then used to develop a heuristic charging scheme which can be implemented in
coagulation models. While most coagulation theories assume that it is difficult
for like-charged grains to coagulate, the OML_LOS approximation indicates that
the electric potentials of aggregate structures are often reduced enough to
allow significant coagulation to occur.

with sharp edges in temperature, density, and metallicity within galaxy
clusters. Their presence poses a puzzle since these features are not expected
to be hydrodynamically stable, or to remain sharp in the presence of diffusion.
However, a moving core or bubble in even a very weakly magnetized plasma
necessarily sweeps up enough magnetic field to build up a dynamically important
sheath around the object; the layer's strength is set by a competition between
`plowing up' of field and field lines slipping around the core. We show that a
two-dimensional approach to the problem is quite generally not possible. In
three dimensions, we show with analytic arguments and in numerical experiments,
that this magnetic layer modifies the dynamics of a plunging core, greatly
modifies the effects of hydrodynamic instabilities on the core, modifies the
geometry of stripped material, and even slows the fall of the core through
magnetic tension. We derive an expression for the maximum magnetic field
strength, the thickness of the layer, and the opening angle of the magnetic
wake. The morphology of the magnetic draping layer implies the suppression of
thermal conduction across the layer, thus conserving strong temperature
gradients over the contact surface. The intermittent amplification of the
magnetic field as well as the injection of MHD turbulence in the wake of the
core is identified to be due to vorticity generation within the magnetic
draping layer. These results have important consequences for understanding the
physical properties and the complex gasdynamical processes of the intra-cluster
medium, and apply quite generally to motions through other magnetized
environments, e.g., the ISM.

the usual Neel phase, stable at small frustration t'/t, and the so-called
collinear (or super-antiferromagnet) phase with ordering wave-vector $(\pi,0)$

no detectable long-range magnetic order. We also find the d-wave

it is not too large. Intriguingly, there is a broad region of coexistence where
both AF and SC order parameters have non-zero values. In addition, the physics
of the metal-insulator transition in the normal state is analyzed. The results
obtained with the help of the VCA method are compared with the large-U

nuclei, are believed to have injected excess entropy into the intracluster gas,

their formation. Here we study a simple model for this so-called preheating
scenario, and ask (i) whether it can simultaneously explain both global X-ray
scaling relations and number counts of galaxy clusters, and (ii) whether the
amount of entropy required evolves with redshift. We adopt a baseline entropy
profile that fits recent hydrodynamic simulations, modify the hydrostatic
equilibrium condition for the gas by including approx. 20% non-thermal pressure
support, and add an entropy floor K_0 that is allowed to vary with redshift. We
find that the observed luminosity-temperature (L-T) relations of low-redshift
(z=0.05) HIFLUGCS clusters and high-redshift (z=0.8) WARPS clusters are best
simultaneously reproduced with an evolving entropy floor of
K_0(z)=341(1+z)^{-0.83}h^{-1/3} keV cm^2. If we restrict our analysis to the
subset of bright (kT > 3 keV) clusters, we find that the evolving entropy floor
can mimic a self-similar evolution in the L-T scaling relation. This degeneracy
with self-similar evolution is, however, broken when (0.5 < kT < 3 keV)
clusters are also included. The approx. 60% entropy increase we find from z=0.8
to z=0.05 is roughly consistent with that expected if the heating is provided
by the evolving global quasar population. Using the cosmological parameters
from the WMAP 3-year data with sigma_8=0.76, our best-fit model underpredicts
the number counts of the X-ray galaxy clusters compared to those derived from
the 158 deg^2 ROSAT PSPC survey. Treating sigma_8 as a free parameter, we find

complementary imaging modalities, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). MEG, which uses highly sensitive
superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) to directly measure
magnetic fields of neuronal currents, cannot be combined with conventional
high-field MRI in a single instrument. Indirect matching of MEG and MRI data
leads to significant co-registration errors. A recently proposed imaging method
- SQUID-based microtesla MRI - can be naturally combined with MEG in the same
system to directly provide structural maps for MEG-localized sources. It
enables easy and accurate integration of MEG and MRI/fMRI, because microtesla
MR images can be precisely matched to structural images provided by high-field
MRI and other techniques. Here we report the first images of the human brain by
microtesla MRI, together with auditory MEG (functional) data, recorded using
the same seven-channel SQUID system during the same imaging session. The images
were acquired at 46 microtesla measurement field with pre-polarization at 30
mT. We also estimated transverse relaxation times for different tissues at
microtesla fields. Our results demonstrate feasibility and potential of human
brain imaging by microtesla MRI. They also show that two new types of imaging
equipment - low-cost systems for anatomical MRI of the human brain at
microtesla fields, and more advanced instruments for combined functional (MEG)

polymer through a nanopore by utilizing discrete and continuous stochastic
models. As a simplified illustration of the effect of charge distribution on
translocation, we consider the translocation of a polymer with a single charged
site in the presence and absence of interactions between the charge and the
pore. We find that the position of the charge that minimizes the translocation
time in the absence of pore--polymer interactions is determined by the entropic
cost of translocation, with the optimum charge position being at the midpoint
of the chain for a rodlike polymer and close to the leading chain end for an
ideal chain. The presence of attractive or repulsive pore--charge interactions
yields a shift in the optimum charge position towards the trailing end and the
leading end of the chain, respectively. Moreover, our results show that strong
attractive or repulsive interactions between the charge and the pore lengthen
the translocation time relative to translocation through an inert pore. We
generalize our results to accommodate the presence of multiple charged sites on
the polymer. Our results provide insight into the effect of charge
inhomogeneity on protein translocation through biological membranes.

A whole point of the emergent gravity is essentially originated from the basic
property: A NC spacetime is a (NC) phase space. This fact leads to two
important consequences: (I) A NC field theory can basically be identified with
a matrix model or a large N field theory where NC fields can be regarded as
master fields of large N matrices. (II) NC fields essentially define vector
(tetrad) fields. So they define a gravitational metric of some manifold as an
emergent geometry from NC gauge fields. Of course, the pictures (I) and (II)
should refer to the same physics, which should be familiar with the large N
duality in string theory. The 1/N corrections in the picture (I) correspond to
the derivative corrections in terms of the noncommutativity \theta for the

now well-established trends for pure spheroidal galaxies. To this end, bulges
have been isolated for a sample of 137 spiral galaxies within the redshift
range 0.1<z<1.2 in the GOODS fields. Using proven photometric techniques we
determine the characteristic parameters (size, surface brightness, profile
shape) of both the disk and bulge components in our sample. In agreement with
earlier work which utilized aperture colors, distant bulges show a broader
range of optical colors than would be the case for passively-evolving
populations. To quantify the amount of recent star formation necessary to
explain this result, we used the DEIMOS spectrograph to secure stellar velocity
dispersions for a sizeable fraction of our sample. This has enabled us to
compare the Fundamental Plane of our distant bulges with that for spheroidal
galaxies in a similar redshift range. Bulges of spiral galaxies with a
bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T)>0.2 show very similar patterns of
evolution to those seen for pure spheroidals such that the stellar populations
of all spheroids with M>10^{11}Msun are homogeneously old, consistent with a
single major burst of star formation at high redshift (z_f<~2), while bulges
with M<10^{11}Msun must have had more recent stellar mass growth (~10% in mass
since z~1). Although further data spanning a wider range of redshift and mass
is desirable, the striking similarity between the assembly histories of bulges
and low mass spheroidals is difficult to reconcile with the picture whereby the
majority of large bulges form primarily via secular processes within spiral
galaxies.

distribution should increase rapidly because of increasing differential volume
sizes and strong evolution in the star formation rate. This feature is not
observed in the Swift redshift distribution and to account for this
discrepancy, a dominant bias, independent of the Swift sensitivity, is
required. Furthermore, despite rapid localization, about 40-50% of Swift and
pre-Swift GRBs do not have a measured redshift. We employ a heuristic technique
to extract this redshift bias using 66 GRBs localized by Swift with redshifts
determined from absorption or emission spectroscopy. For the Swift and
HETE+BeppoSAX redshift distributions, the best model fit to the bias in z < 1
implies that if GRB rate evolution follows the SFR, the bias cancels this rate
increase. We find that the same bias is affecting both Swift and HETE+BeppoSAX
measurements similarly in z < 1. Using a bias model constrained at a 98% KS
probability, we find that 72% of GRBs in z < 2 will not have measurable
redshifts and about 55% in z > 2. To achieve this high KS probability requires
increasing the GRB rate density in small z compared to the high-z rate. This
provides further evidence for a low-luminosity population of GRBs that are
observed in only a small volume because of their faintness.

the gravitational attraction and centrifugal repulsion, and hence a static

hydrodynamical model that explains the known properties of the H-alpha emission
and provides new insights on the lifetime of the Stream clouds. The upstream
clouds are gradually disrupted due to their interaction with the hot halo gas.
The clouds that follow plough into gas ablated from the upstream clouds,
leading to shock ionisation at the leading edges of the downstream clouds.
Since the following clouds also experience ablation, and weaker H-alpha
(100-200 mR) is quite extensive, a disruptive cascade must be operating along
much of the Stream. In our model, the clouds are evolving on timescales of
100-200 Myr, such that the Stream must be replenished by the Magellanic Clouds
at a fairly constant rate. The ablated material falls onto the Galaxy as a warm
drizzle which suggests that diffuse ionized gas at 10**4 K may be an important
constituent of galactic accretion. The observed HI emission provides a new
constraint on the rate of disruption of the Stream and, consequently, the
infall rate of metal-poor gas onto the Galaxy. When the ionized component of
the Stream is fully accounted for, the rate of gas accretion is 0.4 Msun/yr,
roughly twice the rate deduced from HI observations alone.

spectroscopy failed to solve the enigma of its nature. The properties of
extreme individual objects of the central stellar cluster contribute to our
knowledge of star and dust formation close to a supermassive black hole. We
initiated an interferometric experiment to understand IRS3 and investigate its
properties as spectroscopic and interferometric reference star at 10um. VISIR
imaging separates a compact source from diffuse, surrounding emission. The
VLTI/MIDI instrument was used to measure visibilities at 10mas resolution of
that compact 10um source, still unresolved by a single VLT. Photometry data
were added to enable simple SED- and full radiative transfer-models of the
data. The luminosity and size estimates show that IRS3 is probably a cool
carbon star enshrouded by a complex dust distribution. Dust temperatures were
derived. The coinciding interpretation of multiple datasets confirm dust
emission at several spatial scales. The IF data resolve the innermost area of
dust formation. Despite observed deep silicate absorption towards IRS3 we favor
a carbon rich chemistry of the circumstellar dust shell. The silicate
absorption most probably takes place in the outer diffuse dust, which is mostly
ignored by MIDI measurements. This indicates physically and chemically distinct
conditions of the local dust, changing with the distance to IRS3. We have
demonstrated that optical long baseline interferometry at infrared wavelengths
is an indispensable tool to investigate sources at the Galactic Center. Our
findings suggest further studies of the composition of interstellar dust and
the shape of the 10um silicate feature at this outstanding region.

high spatial resolution (FWHM ~ 0"".35) and deep imaging (K ~ 21 mag) with the
IRCS imager at the Subaru telescope, we detected cluster members with a mass
detection limit of < 0.1 M_{sun}, which is well into the substellar regime.
These high quality data enables a comparison of EOG to those in the solar
neighborhood on the same basis for the first time. Before interpreting the
photometric result, we have first constructed the NIR color-color diagram
(dwarf star track, classical T Tauri star (CTTS) locus, reddening law) in the
Mauna Kea Observatory filter system and also for the low metallicity
environment since the metallicity in EOG is much lower than those in the solar

star formation is ongoing in Cloud 2-N, while a ``cluster type'' star formation
is ongoing in Cloud 2-S. Despite the difference of the star formation mode,
other characteristics of the two clusters are found to be almost identical: (1)
K-band luminosity function (KLF) of the two clusters are quite similar, as is
the estimated IMF and ages (~ 0.5--1 Myr) from the KLF fitting, (2) the
estimated star formation efficiencies (SFEs) for both clusters are typical

similarity of two independent clusters with a large separation (~ 25 pc)

triggered by two inherent features of the sponsored search market, namely,
capacity constraints and collusion-vulnerability of current mechanisms. In the
first scenario, we present a comparative study of two models motivated by
capacity constraints - one where the additional capacity is provided by
for-profit agents, who compete for slots in the original auction, draw traffic,
and run their own sub-auctions, and the other, where the additional capacity is
provided by the auctioneer herself, by essentially acting as a mediator and
running a single combined auction. This study was initiated by us in
\cite{SRGR07}, where the mediator-based model was studied. In the present work,
we study the auctioneer-based model and show that this model seems inferior to
the mediator-based model in terms of revenue or efficiency guarantee due to
added capacity. In the second scenario, we initiate a game theoretic study of
current sponsored search auctions, involving incentive driven mediators who
exploit the fact that these mechanisms are not collusion-resistant. In
particular, we show that advertisers can improve their payoffs by using the
services of the mediator compared to directly participating in the auction, and
that the mediator can also obtain monetary benefit, without violating incentive
constraints from the advertisers who do not use its services. We also point out
that the auctioneer can not do very much via mechanism design to avoid such
for-profit mediation without losing badly in terms of revenue, and therefore,
the mediators are likely to prevail.

internetwork full of sub-kG structures that fill only 2 % of the resolution
element. A correlation is found between the magnetic field strength and the
continuum intensity: equipartition fields (B ~500 G) tend to be located in dark
intergranular lanes, whereas weaker field structures are found inside granules.
The most probable unsigned magnetic flux density is 10 Mx/cm2. The net magnetic
flux density in the whole field of view is nearly zero. This means that both
polarities cancel out almost exactly in our observed internetwork area.

the attempt to construct a nonperturbative theory of quantum gravity, valid on
all scales, with the technique of so-called Causal Dynamical Triangulations.
Despite its conceptual simplicity, the results obtained up to now are far from
trivial. Most remarkable at this stage is perhaps the fully dynamical emergence
of a classical background (and solution to the Einstein equations) from a
nonperturbative sum over geometries, without putting in any preferred geometric
background at the outset. In addition, there is concrete evidence for the
presence of a fractal spacetime foam on Planckian distance scales. The
availability of a computational framework provides built-in reality checks of
the approach, whose importance can hardly be overestimated.

design of a multiuser decentralized network. Given a total system bandwidth of
W Hz and a fixed data rate constraint of R bps for each transmission, how many
frequency slots N of size W/N should the band be partitioned into in order to
maximize the number of simultaneous links in the network? Dividing the
available spectrum results in two competing effects. On the positive side, a
larger N allows for more parallel, noninterfering communications to take place
in the same area. On the negative side, a larger N increases the SINR
requirement for each link because the same information rate must be achieved
over less bandwidth. Exploring this tradeoff and determining the optimum value
of N in terms of the system parameters is the focus of the paper. Using
stochastic geometry, the optimal SINR threshold - which directly corresponds to
the optimal spectral efficiency - is derived for both the low SNR
(power-limited) and high SNR (interference-limited) regimes. This leads to the
optimum choice of the number of frequency bands N in terms of the path loss
exponent, power and noise spectral density, desired rate, and total bandwidth.

experimentally important case of metallic surfaces with a roughness having a
spatial scale smaller than the skin depth. The theory is based on a simple
phenomenological model for a rough conductor, that explicitly takes account of
the fact that ohmic conduction in the immediate vicinity of the surface of a
conductor is much impeded by surface roughness, if the amplitude of roughness
is smaller than the skin depth. As a result of the new model, we find that
surface roughness strongly influences the magnitude of the thermal correction
to the Casimir force, independently of the plates separation. Our model, while
consistent with recent accurate measurements of the Casimir force in the
submicron range, leads to a new prediction for the not yet observed thermal
correction to the Casimir force at large plates separation. Besides the thermal
Casimir problem, our model is relevant for the correct theoretical
interpretation of current experiments probing other proximity effects between
conductors, like radiative heat transfer and quantum friction.

These models are becoming increasingly realistic with more detailed physics
included, but also more computationally demanding. The purpose of this study is
to clarify to what extent the applied numerical approach affects resulting
physical structures of modelled winds, and to discuss resulting changes.
Following the previously developed radiation hydrodynamic model - which
includes descriptions for time-dependent dust formation and gas-dust drift -
and using its physical assumptions and parameters, numerical improvements are
introduced. Impacts of the so-called adaptive grid equation and advection
schemes are assessed from models calculated with different numerical setups.
Results show that wind models are strongly influenced by numerical imprecision,
displaying differences in calculated physical properties of up to one hundred
per cent. Using a non-adaptive grid, models become periodic (in multiples of
stellar pulsation periods), instead of irregular, as obtained previously.
Furthermore, the numerical improvements reveal changes in physical structures.
The influence of gas-dust drift is confirmed to be highly important, in
particular for the dust component. Gas and dust are less tightly coupled than
previously, and drastically larger amounts of dust form assuming drift.

tissue derived from newborn rats was studied experimentally over extended

spontaneous rhythmic contraction and have been confirmed to consist of cardiac
muscle cells. Addition of a contraction inhibitor (2,3-butanedione-2-monoxime)
to the culture medium resulted in the inhibition of both the spontaneous
contractions exhibited by the cells as well as the formation of clusters.
Furthermore, the formation of clusters is suppressed when high concentrations
of collagen are used for coating the substratum to which the cells adhere. From
these experimental observations, it was deduced that the cells are mechanically
stressed by the tension associated with repeated contractions and that this
results in the cells becoming compact and attracting each other, finally
resulting in the formation of clusters. This process can be interpreted as
modulation of a cellular network by the activity associated with contraction,
which could be employed to control cellular networks by modifying the dynamics

Auxiliary variables may be treated pre-variationally as multiplier coordinates
or as the velocities corresponding to cyclic coordinates. The latter treatment
works through the physical meaninglessness of auxiliary variables' values
applying also to the end points (or end spatial hypersurfaces) of the
variation, so that these are free rather than fixed. [This is also known as
variation with natural boundary conditions.] Further principles of dynamics
workings such as Routhian reduction and the Dirac procedure are shown to have
parallel counterparts for this new formalism. One advantage of the new scheme
is that the corresponding actions are more manifestly relational. While the
electric potential is usually regarded as a multiplier coordinate and Arnowitt,
Deser and Misner have regarded the lapse and shift likewise, this paper's
scheme considers new {\it flux}, {\it instant} and {\it grid} variables whose

variables. This paper's way of thinking about gauge theory furthermore admits
interesting generalizations, which shall be provided in a second paper.

maxima strongly decrease to higher energies. Our exact theoretical analysis
shows that the ratio of emission and absorption is given by the population of
the globally defined states of the electromagnetic field, i.e. the polariton
distribution which is generated by the pump pulse. This distribution, being far
from thermal quasiequilibrium, shows pronounced peaks at the polariton modes
depending on the energy of the pump pulse.

laser-interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. In this paper we derive
equations for the coupling between alignment noise and phase noise at
diffraction gratings. In comparison to a standard reflective component (mirror
or beam splitter) the diffractive nature of the gratings causes an additional
coupling of geometry changes into alignment and phase noise. Expressions for
the change in angle and optical path length of each outgoing beam are provided
as functions of a translation or rotation of the incoming beam with respect to
the grating. The analysis is based entirely on the grating equation and the
geometry of the setup. We further analyse exemplary optical setups which have
been proposed for the use in future gravitational wave detectors. We find that
the use of diffraction gratings yields a strong coupling of alignment noise
into phase noise. By comparing the results with the specifications of current

However, further analysis reveals that the source of the modulation is more
likely due to superhumps caused by a precessing accretion disc. Doppler
tomography of a broad Halpha emission line reveals an emission ring, consistent
with that expected from an accretion disc. Using the velocity of the emission
ring as an estimate for the projected outer disc velocity, we constrain the
maximum projected velocity of the secondary to be 200 km/s, placing a lower
limit of 0.05 Msun on the secondary mass. For a 1.4 Msun primary, this implies
that the orbital inclination is low, < 20 degrees. Utilizing the observed
relationship between the secondary mass and orbital period in short period
cataclysmic variables, we estimate the secondary mass to be ~0.085 Msun, which

scientific data transfers and database backup. In this paper, we present two
new, on-line algorithms for advanced reservation, called BatchAll and BatchLim,
that are guaranteed to achieve optimal throughput performance, based on
multi-commodity flow arguments. Both algorithms are shown to have
polynomial-time complexity and provable bounds on the maximum delay for
1+epsilon bandwidth augmented networks. The BatchLim algorithm returns the
completion time of a connection immediately as a request is placed, but at the
expense of a slightly looser competitive ratio than that of BatchAll. We also
present a simple approach that limits the number of parallel paths used by the
algorithms while provably bounding the maximum reduction factor in the
transmission throughput. We show that, although the number of different paths
can be exponentially large, the actual number of paths needed to approximate
the flow is quite small and proportional to the number of edges in the network.
Simulations for a number of topologies show that, in practice, 3 to 5 parallel
paths are sufficient to achieve close to optimal performance. The performance
of the competitive algorithms are also compared to a greedy benchmark, both
through analysis and simulation.

The same values were found using BCD or EDBD. Contrary the EDBD, BCD allows one
to study the effect of bond rigidity and hydrodynamic interaction within the

relatively weak compared to systems with rigid bonds. $D$ increases first with
increasing attraction strength, and then decreases for stronger interaction.

is a highly desirable property of fundamental importance for the development of
spintronic devices such as spin-filters, spin-transistors and single-spin
memory as well as for solid-state qubits. An electrically gated quantum dot in
the Coulomb blockade regime can be tuned to hold a single unpaired spin-1/2,
which is routinely spin-polarized by an applied magnetic field. Using
ferromagnetic electrodes, however, the properties of the quantum dot become
directly spin-dependent and it has been demonstrated that the ferromagnetic
electrodes induce a local exchange-field which polarizes the localized spin in
the absence of any external fields. Here we report on the experimental
realization of this tunneling-induced spin-splitting in a carbon nanotube
quantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic nickel-electrodes. We study the
intermediate coupling regime in which single-electron states remain well
defined, but with sufficiently good tunnel-contacts to give rise to a sizable
exchange-field. Since charge transport in this regime is dominated by the
Kondo-effect, we can utilize this sharp many-body resonance to read off the
local spin-polarization from the measured bias-spectroscopy. We show that the
exchange-field can be compensated by an external magnetic field, thus restoring
a zero-bias Kondo-resonance, and we demonstrate that the exchange-field itself,
and hence the local spin-polarization, can be tuned and reversed merely by
tuning the gate-voltage. This demonstrates a very direct electrical control
over the spin-state of a quantum dot which, in contrast to an applied magnetic
field, allows for rapid spin-reversal with a very localized addressing.

strings, produced after the initial color exchange. Quark spin precession in
the color field is taken into account, which can be the reason for an
oscillation of the single spin observables as a function of Feynman $x_{F}$ and
its energy dependence. The model predictions are compared with the experimental
data, in particular with the heavy ion collision data. The data are consistent
with a large negative anomalous chromomagnetic moment of the constituent quarks
