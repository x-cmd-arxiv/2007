424 ms) and PSR J1852+0040 (P = 105 ms), leads us to conclude that a weak natal
magnetic field shaped their unique observational properties. In the dipole
spin-down formalism, the 2-sigma upper limits on their period derivatives, <
2E-16 for both pulsars, implies surface magnetic field strengths of B_s < 3E11
G and spin periods at birth equal to their present periods to three significant
digits. Their X-ray luminosities exceed their respective spin-down
luminosities, implying that their thermal spectra are derived from residual
cooling and perhaps partly from accretion of supernova debris. For sufficiently
weak magnetic fields an accretion disk can penetrate the light cylinder and
interact with the magnetosphere while resulting torques on the neutron star
remain within the observed limits. We propose the following as the origin of
radio-quiet CCOs: the magnetic field, derived from a turbulent dynamo, is
weaker if the NS is formed spinning slowly, which enables it to accrete SN
debris. Accretion excludes neutron stars born with both B_s < 1E11 G and P >
0.1 s from radio pulsar surveys, where such weak fields are not encountered
except among very old (> 40 Myr) or recycled pulsars. We predict that these
birth properties are common, and may be attributes of the youngest detected
neutron star, the CCO in Cassiopeia A, as well as an undetected infant neutron
star in the SN 1987A remnant. In view of the far-infrared light echo discovered
around Cas A and attributed to an SGR-like outburst, it is especially important
to determine via timing whether Cas A hosts a magnetar or not. If not a
magnetar, the Cas A NS may instead have undergone a one-time phase transition
(corequake) that powered the light echo.

the effects of node and edge removals on the connectivity structure of a static

world networks such as the world wide web, however, are not static and
experience a considerable amount of turnover, where nodes and edges are both
added and deleted. Considering degree-based node removals, we examine the
possibility of preserving networks from these types of disruptions. We recover
the original degree distribution by allowing the network to react to the attack
by introducing new nodes and attaching their edges via specially tailored
schemes. We focus particularly on the case of non-uniform failures, a subject
that has received little attention in the context of evolving networks. Using a
combination of analytical techniques and numerical simulations, we demonstrate
how to preserve the exact degree distribution of the studied networks from

a sufficiently low symmetry, the spontaneous polarization is proportional to
one of the biaxial vector order parameters of the smectic C phase. This order
parameter may be determined by intermolecular interactions which are not
sensitive to molecular chirality. At the same time, the polarization is also
proportional to a pseudoscalar parameter which vanishes if the molecules are
nonchiral. The general statistical theory of ferroelectric ordering is
illustrated by two particular models. The first model is based on electrostatic
quadrupole-quadrupole interactions, and it enables one to obtain explicit
analytical expressions for the spontaneous polarization. In the second model,
the molecular chirality and polarity are determined by a pair of off-center
nonparallel dipoles. For this case, the spontaneous polarization is calculated
numerically as a function of temperature. The theory provides a more general
interpretation of the previous approaches including the classical Boulder
model.

stars with masses between 10 and 32 Msun, and 0.15 for stars with masses in the
range 3 to 10 Msun. We derive the slope of the stellar mass function for stars
with masses between 3.4 and 27 Msun. In an annulus with radii between 0.75 and
1.5 pc from the cluster centre, we obtain a slope of Gamma = -1.3. Closer in,
the mass function of Westerlund 1 is shallower with Gamma = -0.6. The
extrapolation of the mass function for stars with masses from 0.08 to 120 Msun
yields an initial total stellar mass of ~52,000 Msun, and a present-day mass of
20,000 to 45,000 Msun (about 10 times the stellar mass of the Orion Nebula
Cluster, and 2 to 4 times the mass of the NGC 3603 young cluster), indicating
that Westerlund 1 is the most massive starburst cluster identified to date in
the Milky Way.

atoms filling exclusively grain boundary interstices. In copper bulk, B causes
significant distortion both in interstitial and regular lattice sites for which
boron atoms are either too big or too small. The distortion is compensated to
large extent when the interstitial and substitutional boron combine together to
form a strongly bound dumbell. Our prediction is that bound boron impurities
should appear in sizable proportion if not dominate in most experimental
conditions. A large discrepancy between calculated heats of solution and
experimental terminal solubility of B in Cu is found, indicating either a sound
failure of the local density approximation or, more likely, strongly

suspended nanostructure. Exact quantum dynamics calculations reveal that
electron and phonons (comprising a thermal bath) couple quantum mechanically to
perform coherent oscillations with periods in the range of tens of nanoseconds,
despite the finite temperature of the phonon bath. Mechanical energy
dissipation due to clamping loss is taken into account in the calculations.
Although the lifetime of the coupled el-ph states decreases with the
temperature, well defined Rabi oscillations are obtained for temperatures up to
100 mK. The dynamics of the coupled electron-phonon state is susceptible to
various forms of external control. For instance, a weak external magnetic field
can be used to control the dynamics of the system, by decoupling the electron
from the phonon bath. The results cast light upon the underlying physics of a

long-wavelength approximation are characterized by the linear dispersion law,
representing a unique example of the really two-dimensional ""ultrarelativistic""
fermionic system which in the presence of topological defects possesses rather
unusual properties. A disclination that rolls up a graphitic sheet into a
nanocone is described by a pointlike pseudomagnetic vortex at the apex of the
cone, and the flux of the vortex is related to the deficit angle of the conical
surface. A general theory of planar relativistic fermionic systems in the
singular vortex background is employed, and we derive the analytical expression
for the charge which is induced at finite temperature on some graphitic
nanocones.

atom successively couples to two high-Q optical cavities possessing
polarization degeneracy, assisted by a classical $\pi$-polarized pump field.
The stimulated Raman adiabatic passage process in the atom-cavity system is
used to produce the polarization-entangled photon pairs. The proposal is
particularly robust against atomic spontaneous decay, which should have
potential applications in quantum information processing.

the average density of cooperators in the stationary state for a fixed
interaction graph, while varying the number of edges in the learning graph.
According to the Monte Carlo simulations, the cooperation is modified
substantially in a way resembling a coherence-resonance-like behavior when the
number of learning edges is increased. This behavior is reproduced by the
analytical results.

with inhomogeneous activity teaching on a square lattice. It is shown that the
introduction of the inhomogeneous activity of teaching of the players can
remarkably promote cooperation. By investigating the effects of noise on
cooperative behavior in detail, we find that the variation of cooperator
density $\rho_C$ with the noise parameter $\kappa$ displays several different
behaviors: $\rho_C$ monotonically increases (decreases) with $\kappa$; $\rho_C$
firstly increases (decreases) with $\kappa$ and then it decreases (increases)
monotonically after reaching its maximum (minimum) value, which depends on the
amount of the multiplication factor $r$, on whether the system is homogeneous
or inhomogeneous, and on whether the adopted updating is synchronous or
asynchronous. These results imply that the noise plays an important and
nontrivial role in the evolution of cooperation.

that in the case of shortest path routing strategy the networks undergo a first
order phase transition i.e., from a free flow state to full congestion sate,
with the increasing of the packet generation rate. We also incorporate random
effect (namely random selection of a neighbor to deliver packets) as well as a
control method (namely the packet-dropping strategy of the congested nodes
after some delay time $T$) into the routing protocol to test the traffic
capacity of the heterogeneous networks. It is shown that there exists optimal
value of $T$ for the networks to achieve the best handling ability, and the
presence of appropriate random effect also attributes to the performance of the

recent string-theoretic ideas about cosmology are to be made to function. In
the string Landscape, the nucleation of baby universes is postulated to
""populate"" the multiverse. Here we argue that baby universes can only have an
Arrow if they \emph{inherit} one; the problem of explaining the Arrow is thus
reduced to explaining it in the case of the original universe. Motivated by the
Ooguri-Vafa-Verlinde formulation of ""creation from nothing"" in the context of
string theory, we propose that the original universe was created along a
spacelike surface with the topology of a torus. Using deep results in global
differential geometry, we are able to show that the geometry of this surface
had to be non-generic. This geometric ""specialness"" is communicated to matter
through the inflaton. Thus we have a theory of the Arrow which is intrinsically
geometric, which incorporates Inflation, and which allows universes in the
Landscape to begin with physically acceptable initial conditions.
