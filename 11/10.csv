at intermediate redshifts, 0.18<z<0.27. Three telescopes on the Canary Island
of La Palma, INT, NOT and JKT, were used for discovery and follow-up of type Ia
supernovae in the g' and r' filters. Supernova fluxes were measured by
simultaneously fitting a supernova and host galaxy model to the data, and then
calibrated using star catalogues from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The light
curve peak luminosities, corrected for light curve shape and colour, are
consistent with the expectations for a flat LambdaCDM universe at the 1.5-sigma
level. One supernova in the sample, SN1999dr, shows surprisingly large
reddening, considering that it is both located at a significant distance from
the core of its host (~4 times the fitted exponential radius) and that the
galaxy can be spectroscopically classified as early-type with no signs of
ongoing star formation.

  between groups of multivariate time series: frequency decomposition","KEY Institute - University of Zurich - Technical Report",,,,"stat.ME",,"  Measures of linear dependence (coherence) and nonlinear dependence (phase
synchronization) between any number of multivariate time series are defined.
The measures are expressed as the sum of lagged dependence and instantaneous
dependence. The measures are non-negative, and take the value zero only when
there is independence of the pertinent type. These measures are defined in the
frequency domain and are applicable to stationary and non-stationary time
series. These new results extend and refine significantly those presented in a
previous technical report (Pascual-Marqui 2007, arXiv:0706.1776 [stat.ME],
http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1776), and have been largely motivated by the seminal
paper on linear feedback by Geweke (1982 JASA 77:304-313). One important field
of application is neurophysiology, where the time series consist of electric
neuronal activity at several brain locations. Coherence and phase
synchronization are interpreted as ""connectivity"" between locations. However,
any measure of dependence is highly contaminated with an instantaneous,
non-physiological contribution due to volume conduction and low spatial
resolution. The new techniques remove this confounding factor considerably.
Moreover, the measures of dependence can be applied to any number of brain
areas jointly, i.e. distributed cortical networks, whose activity can be
estimated with eLORETA (Pascual-Marqui 2007, arXiv:0710.3341 [math-ph]).

mergers in the standard LCDM cosmology. Numerical simulations of mergers with
mass ratios less than or equal to 1:4, with reasonable assumptions for the
ages, metallicities and dust properties of the merger progenitors, produce good
agreement to the observed UV colours of the early-type population, if the
infalling satellites are assumed to have (cold) gas fractions greater than 20%.
Early-types that satisfy (NUV-r) < 3.8 are likely to have experienced mergers
with mass ratios between 1:4 and 1:6 within the last ~1.5 Gyrs, while those
that satisfy 3.8<(NUV-r)<5.5 are consistent with either recent mergers with

~1.5 Gyrs in the past. We demonstrate that the early-type colour-magnitude
relations and colour distributions in both the UV and optical spectral ranges
are consistent with the expected frequency of minor merging activity in the
standard LCDM cosmology at low redshift. We present a strong plausibility
argument for minor mergers to be the principal mechanism behind the large UV

a spectacular light echo appeared. A light echo provides the possibility of
direct geometric distance determination, because it should contain a ring of
highly linearly polarized light at a linear radius of ct, where t is the time
since the outburst. We present imaging polarimetry of the V838 Mon light echo,
obtained in 2002 and 2005 with the Advanced Camera for Surveys onboard the
Hubble Space Telescope, which confirms the presence of the highly polarized
ring. Based on detailed modeling that takes into account the outburst light
curve, the paraboloidal echo geometry, and the physics of dust scattering and
polarization, we find a distance of 6.1+-0.6 kpc. The error is dominated by the
systematic uncertainty in the scattering angle of maximum linear polarization,
taken to be theta_{max}=90^o +- 5^o. The polarimetric distance agrees
remarkably well with a distance of 6.2+-1.5 kpc obtained from the entirely
independent method of main-sequence fitting to a sparse star cluster associated
with V838 Mon. At this distance, V838 Mon at maximum light had M_V\simeq-9.8,
making it temporarily one of the most luminous stars in the Local Group. Our
validation of the polarimetric method offers promise for measurement of
extragalactic distances using supernova light echoes.

be subject to at least two types of instability: the convective instability and
the neutron-finger one. Both instabilities involve convective motions and hence
can trigger dynamo actions which may be responsible for the large magnetic
fields in neutron stars and magnetars. We have solved the mean-field induction
equation in a simplified one-dimensional model of both the convective and the
neutron-finger instability zones. Although very idealized, the model includes
the nonlinearities introduced by the feedback processes which tend to saturate
the growth of the magnetic field (alpha-quenching) and suppress its turbulent
diffusion (eta-quenching). The possibility of a dynamo action is studied within
a dynamical model of turbulent diffusivity where the boundary of the unstable
zone is allowed to move. We show that the dynamo action can be operative and
that the amplification of the magnetic field can still be very effective.
Furthermore, we confirm the existence of a critical spin-period, below which
the dynamo is always excited independently of the degree of differential
rotation, and whose value is related to the size of the neutron-finger
instability zone. Finally we provide a relation for the intensity of the final
field as a function of the spin of the star and of its differential rotation.
Although they were obtained by using a toy model, we expect that our results
are able to capture the qualitative and asymptotic behaviour of a mean-field
dynamo action developing in the neutron-finger instability zone. Overall, we
find that such a dynamo is very efficient in producing magnetic fields well
above equipartition and thus that it could represent a possible explanation for
the large surface magnetic fields observed in neutron stars.

fluorescence spectra of a two level atom placed as an impurity in a photonic

situation, the atomic emission occurs in the form of evanescent waves which are
detected with less efficiency the farther we place the detector. The

separation energy for the production of the lightest molybdenum isotopes in
proton-rich type II supernova ejecta. It has recently been shown that a novel
neutrino-induced process makes these ejecta a promising site for the production
of the light molybdenum isotopes and other ""p-nuclei"" with atomic mass near
100. The origin of these isotopes has long been uncertain. A distinguishing
feature of nucleosynthesis in neutrino-irradiated outflows is that the relative
production of Mo92 and Mo94 is set by a competition governed by the proton
separation energy of Rh93. We use detailed nuclear network calculations and the
recent experimental results for this proton separation energy to place
constraints on the outflow characteristics that produce the lightest molybdenum
isotopes in their solar proportions. It is found that for the conditions
calculated in recent two-dimensional supernova simulations, and also for a
large range of outflow characteristics around these conditions, the solar ratio
of Mo92 to Mo94 cannot be achieved. This suggests that either proton-rich winds
from type II supernova do not exclusively produce both isotopes, or that these
winds are qualitatively different than calculated in today's supernova models.

point, i.e. a Fourier spectral method. For Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, however,
we use a simple parametrisation of the tori in order to determine low-order
approximations, and then utilise the information contained therein to develop a
more general parametrisation suitable for computing higher-order
approximations. Different algorithms, applicable to either autonomous or
periodically-forced systems of differential equations, are obtained.

inhomogeneous coupling are investigated theoretically. Particles interact with
hard-core exclusion and move in the same direction on both lattices, while
transitions between the channels is allowed at one specific location in the
bulk of the system. An approximate theoretical approach that describes the
dynamics in the vertical link and horizontal lattice segments exactly but
neglects the correlation between the horizontal and vertical transport is
developed. It allows us to calculate stationary phase diagrams, particle
currents and densities for symmetric and asymmetric transitions between the
channels. It is shown that in the case of the symmetric coupling there are
three stationary phases, similarly to the case of single-channel totally
asymmetric exclusion processes with local inhomogeneity. However, the
asymmetric coupling between the lattices lead to a very complex phase diagram
with ten stationary-state regimes. Extensive Monte Carlo computer simulations
generally support theoretical predictions, although simulated stationary-state
properties slightly deviate from calculated in the mean-field approximation,
suggesting the importance of correlations in the system. Dynamic properties and
phase diagrams are discussed by analyzing constraints on the particle currents
across the channels.

total amount of interference can increase, while the efficiency of the quantum

is destroyed for small error probabilities, and converted into destructive
interference for error probabilities approaching one, leading to success
probabilities which can even drop below the classical value. Our results show
that in general interference is necessary in order for a quantum algorithm to

modulation in any source, although there is considerable variability on long

the optical 1161 day orbital period or a previously reported 304 day X-ray
period. For 4U 1700+24 we do not confirm the 404 day X-ray period previously
proposed for this source from a shorter duration ASM light curve. We conclude
that all three sources have substantial low-frequency noise in their power
spectra that may give the appearance of periodic modulation if this noise is
not properly accounted for, particularly if short duration light curves are
examined.

modifications induced in the presence of background magnetic fields, which
induces additional twists by magnetic translation operators and alters the
effective noncommutative geometry seen by the twisted quantum fields. When two
such field theories are dual to one another, we demonstrate that only our

have correspondingly very robust magnetic dynamos and strong coronal and
chromospheric X-ray - UV (XUV) emissions. However, these stars spin-down with
time as they lose angular momentum via magnetized winds and their magnetic
generated activity and emissions significantly decrease. Studies of dK-dM stars
over a wide range of ages and rotations show similar (but not identical)
behavior. Particular emphasis is given to discussing the effects that XUV
emissions have on the atmospheres and evolution of solar system planets as well
as the increasing number of extrasolar planets found hosted by dG-dM stars. The
results from modeling the early atmospheres of Venus, Earth and Mars using
recently determined XUV irradiances and inferred winds of the young Sun are
also briefly discussed. For example, the loss of water from juvenile Venus and
Mars can be explained by action of the strong XUV emissions and robust winds of
the young Sun. We also examine the effects of strong X-ray and UV coronal and
chromospheric emissions (and frequent flares) that dM stars have on possible
planets orbiting within their shrunken habitable zones (HZs) - located close to
the low luminosity host stars (HZ < ~0.4 AU). Dwarf M stars make interesting
targets for further study because of their deep outer convective zones (CZs),
efficient dynamos, frequent flares and strong XUV emissions. Furthermore, a
large fraction of dM stars are very old (>5 Gyr), which present intriguing
possibilities for the development of highly advanced modes of intelligent life
on planets that may orbit them.

notion of torsion emerges in differential geometry. In the context of a Cartan
circuit, torsion is related to translations similar as curvature to rotations.
Cartan's investigations started by analyzing Einsteins general relativity
theory and by taking recourse to the theory of Cosserat continua. In these
continua, the points of which carry independent translational and rotational
degrees of freedom, there occur, besides ordinary (force) stresses,
additionally spin moment stresses. In a 3-dimensional continuized crystal with
dislocation lines, a linear connection can be introduced that takes the crystal
lattice structure as a basis for parallelism. Such a continuum has similar
properties as a Cosserat continuum, and the dislocation density is equal to the
torsion of this connection. Subsequently, these ideas are applied to
4-dimensional spacetime. A translational gauge theory of gravity is displayed
(in a Weitzenboeck or teleparallel spacetime) as well as the viable
Einstein-Cartan theory (in a Riemann-Cartan spacetime). In both theories, the
notion of torsion is contained in an essential way. Cartan's spiral staircase
is described as a 3-dimensional Euclidean model for a space with torsion, and
eventually some controversial points are discussed regarding the meaning of
torsion.

liquid has quantum phase transitions to descendant confining states with Neel
or valence bond solid order, and the insulator can be on either side of one of

these states, and describe the route to metallic states with Fermi surfaces. We
argue that an excitonic condensate can form near this insulator-metal

charge -e fermions. This condensate breaks the lattice space group symmetry,
and we propose its onset as an explanation of a low temperature anomaly in

precisely, the output of BHDs provides information on the one- and two-point
functions of arbitrary states of quantum fields. We generalize the analysis of
the response of BHDs to the case of quantum fields under influence of static
external conditions such as cavities or polarizable media. By recalling the
expressions for two-point functions of quantum fields in Casimir geometries we
show, that a rich, position- and frequency-dependent pattern of BHD responses

complement the current global methods (Casimir forces), but also improve

ionized by z~3. The most recent measurements of the high-redshift quasar
luminosity function imply that these sources had produced ~2.5 ionizing photons
per helium atom by that time, consistent with a picture in which the known
quasar population drives HeII reionization. Here we describe the distribution
of ionized and neutral helium gas during this era. Because the sources were
rare and bright (with the photon budget dominated by quasars with luminosities
L>L_\star), random fluctuations in the quasar population determined the
morphology of ionized gas when the global ionized fraction x_i was small, with
the typical radius R_c of a HeIII bubble ~15-20 comoving Mpc. Only when x_i>0.5
did the large-scale clustering of the quasars drive the characteristic size of
ionized regions above this value. Still later, when x_i>0.75, most ionizing
photons were consumed by dense, recombining systems before they reached the
edge of their source's ionized surroundings, halting the bubble growth when
R_c~35-40 Mpc. These phases are qualitatively similar to those in hydrogen
reionization, but the rarity of the sources makes the early stochastic phase
much more important. Moreover, the well-known characteristics of the z=3

electron-phonon coupling in hcp Sc under pressure. The electron-phonon coupling
constant is found to increase steadily with pressure in the hcp phase, until
the pressure reaches a value where the hcp phase becomes unstable. Calculations
for the normal pressure $c/a$ ratio predict a phase change somewhere between
calculated pressures of 22 and 30 GPa. The calculated frequencies for the
equilibrium hcp lattice parameters are in good agreement with the inelastic
neutron scattering results. From the measured value of the electronic specific
heat constant and the calculated values of the Fermi level density of states
and electron-phonon coupling constant, we conclude that the electron-paramagnon

coupling constant. This indicates that the spin fluctuation effects are strong
enough to suppress superconductivity completely in hcp Sc. Based on estimates
of the electron-paramagnon coupling constants and the calculated or estimated

active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity to the mid-IR emission. In the high
signal-to-noise ratio composite spectrum of SMGs, we find that the hot dust
continuum from an AGN contributes at most 30% of the mid-IR luminosity. We find
that the mid-IR properties of SMGs are distinct from those of 24 micron
-selected ULIRGs at z~2; the former are predominantly dominated by star
formation while the latter are a more heterogeneous sample with many showing
significant AGN activity. We fit the IRS spectrum and the mid-IR to radio
photometry of SMGs with template spectral energy distributions to determine the
best estimate of the total infrared luminosity from star formation. While many
SMGs contain an AGN as evinced by their X-ray properties, our multi-wavelength
analysis shows that the total infrared luminosity, LIR, in SMGs, is dominated
by star formation and not AGN activity. We find that high redshift SMGs lie on
the relation between LIR and LPAH6.2 (or LPAH7.7 or LPAH11.3) that has been
established for local starburst galaxies. This suggests that PAH luminosity can
be used as a proxy for the star formation rate in SMGs. SMGs are consistent
with being a short lived cool phase in a massive merger. Although there appears
to be an AGN present in many SMGs, it does not appear to have become strong
enough to heat the dust and dominate the mid- or far-infrared emission.

mechanisms that takes the revenue or the efficiency as a yardstick. However,
scenarios where the {\it capacity}, which we define as \textit{``the number of
bidders the auctioneer wants to have a positive probability of getting the
item''}, is a fundamental concern are ubiquitous in the information economy.
For instance, in sponsored search auctions (SSA's) or in online ad-exchanges,
the true value of an ad-slot for an advertiser is inherently derived from the
conversion-rate, which in turn depends on whether the advertiser actually
obtained the ad-slot or not; thus, unless the capacity of the underlying
auction is large, key parameters, such as true valuations and
advertiser-specific conversion rates, will remain unknown or uncertain leading
to inherent inefficiencies in the system. In general, the same holds true for
all information goods/digital goods. We initiate a study of mechanisms, which
take capacity as a yardstick, in addition to revenue/efficiency. We show that
in the case of a single indivisible item one simple way to incorporate capacity
constraints is via designing mechanisms to sell probability distributions, and
that under certain conditions, such optimal probability distributions could be
identified using a Linear programming approach. We define a quantity called
{\it price of capacity} to capture the tradeoff between capacity and
revenue/efficiency. We also study the case of sponsored search auctions.

maps we are able to constrain the regular large-scale Galactic magnetic field
in the disk and the halo of the Galaxy. The local regular field is 2 microG and
the average random field is about 3 microG. The known local excess of
synchrotron emission originating either from enhanced CR electrons or random
magnetic fields is able to explain the observed high-latitude synchrotron
emission. The thermal electron model (NE2001) in conjunction with a proper
filling factor accounts for the observed optically thin thermal emission and
low frequency absorption by optically thick emission. A coupling factor between
thermal electrons and the random magnetic field component is proposed, which in
addition to the small filling factor of thermal electrons increases small-scale
RM fluctuations and thus accounts for the observed depolarization at 1.4 GHz.
We conclude that an axisymmetric magnetic disk field configuration with
reversals inside the solar circle fits available observations best. Out of the
plane a strong toroidal magnetic field with different signs above and below the
plane is needed to account for the observed high-latitude RMs. Our preferred
3D-model fits the observations better than other models over a wide frequency

incorporates only experimentally proven principles. It is based on a
generalized law for spinning and rotational motions, which is in fact the
conservation law of momentum vector direction, and can be successfully used for
the precision computation of planetary and lunar orbits. The most fundamental
principles of the remodeled relativity theory are the conservation laws of
energy and momentum. Based on experience of relativity experiments, we adopted
the principles that energy level is the underlying cause for relativistic
effects, and that mass is expressed by the relativistic energy equation from
Einstein. From space age ephemeris generation experience and following nature's
way to conserve energy and momentum, we found reason to replace the concept of
""relativity of all frames"" with that of ""nature's preferred frame"", which
helped us to escape Einstein's dilemma till 1912, when he concluded that 'there
is no way of escape from the consequence of non-Euclidean geometry, if all
frames are permissible'. Einstein formulated gtr as a law for all frames, but
physicists and astronomers have continued to adopt one or other 'ad-hoc'
approach not in full conformity with the basic tenets of gtr/str. Based on
above principles, a comprehensive remodeling led to this theory that uses
Euclidean space to consistently and successfully simulate numerically the
results of all the ""well-established"" tests of gtr (as in our earlier papers),
and for the precise calculation of relativistic effects observed in case of the
GPS applications, and other tests of str. It combined the essential essence of
gtr/str, and the experience of relativity experiments, and has been shown to
avoid the inadequacies of the former.

3741. This galaxy has a very extended gas disk (~8.8 times the Holmberg
radius), and a dark to luminous (i.e. stellar) mass ratio of ~149, which makes
it one of the ``darkest'' dwarf irregular galaxies known. However its ratio of
baryons (i.e. gas + stellar) mass to dark mass is typical of that in galaxies.
Our new high-resolution HI images of the galaxy show evidence for a large scale
(purely gaseous) spiral arm and central bar. Despite the gaseous spiral feature
and the on-going star formation, we find that the global gas density in NGC
3741 is significantly lower than the Toomre instability criterion. We also find
that the star formation rate is consistent with that expected from the observed
correlations between HI mass and SFR and the global Kennicutt-Schmidt law
respectively. We measure the oxygen abundance to be 12+ log(O/H)=7.66$\pm$0.10,
which is consistent with that expected from the metallicity-luminosity
relation, despite its extreme gas mass ratio. We also examine the issue of
chemical evolution of NGC 3741 in the context of closed-box model of chemical
evolution. The effective oxygen yield of NGC 3741 is consistent with recent
model estimates of closed-box yields, provided one assumes that the gas has
been efficiently mixed all the way to edge of the HI disk (i.e. >8 times the
optical radius). This seems a priori unlikely. On the other hand, using a
sample of galaxies with both interferometric HI maps and chemical abundance
measurements, we find that the effective yield is anti-correlated with the
total dynamical mass, as expected in leaky box models (slightly abridged).

particle shapes. We show that prolate-shaped metal nanoparticles can lead to
much higher quantum efficiency enhancements than corresponding spherical
nanoparticles. For properly engineered emitter-nanoparticle geometries, quantum
efficiency enhancements from an initial value of 1% (in absence of the
nanoparticle) to 70% are feasible. We describe the anisotropy-induced
enhancement effects in terms of large field enhancements near the metal tips
that cause strong coupling to the (radiative) dipolar modes. For increasing
particle anisotropy, a strong spectral separation between radiative dipolar and
dark higher-order modes occurs, which leads to higher radiative efficiencies
for anisotropic particles. In addition, we demonstrate that for large (> 100
nm) nanoparticles, the influence of Ohmic losses on plasmon-enhanced
luminescence is substantially reduced, which implies that, if prolate shaped,
even lossy metals such as Al and Cu are suitable materials for optical
nano-antennas.
