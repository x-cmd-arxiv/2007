  available at http://astro.berkeley.edu/~echiang/im/im.html",,"10.1086/527354",,"astro-ph",,"  Gravitational instability of a vertically thin, dusty sheet near the midplane
of a protoplanetary disk has long been proposed as a way of forming
planetesimals. Before Roche densities can be achieved, however, the dust-rich
layer, sandwiched from above and below by more slowly rotating dust-poor gas,
threatens to overturn and mix by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI).
Whether such a threat is real has never been demonstrated: the Richardson
criterion for the KHI is derived for 2-D Cartesian shear flow and does not
account for rotational forces. Here we present 3-D numerical simulations of
gas-dust mixtures in a shearing box, accounting for the full suite of
disk-related forces: the Coriolis and centrifugal forces, and radial tidal
gravity. Dust particles are assumed small enough to be perfectly entrained in
gas; the two fluids share the same velocity field but obey separate continuity
equations. We find that the Richardson number Ri does not alone determine
stability. The critical value of Ri below which the dust layer overturns and
mixes depends on the height-integrated metallicity Z (surface density ratio of
dust to gas). Nevertheless, for Z between one and five times solar, the
critical Ri is nearly constant at 0.1. Keplerian radial shear stabilizes those
modes that would otherwise disrupt the layer at large Ri. If Z is at least 5
times greater than the solar value of 0.01, then midplane dust densities can
approach Roche densities. Such an environment might be expected to produce gas
giant planets having similarly super-solar metallicities.

completeness, magnitude limit, and other survey parameters as a function of
direction on the sky becomes an increasingly challenging computational task.
For example, typical angular masks of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey contain
about N=300,000 distinct spherical polygons. Managing masks with such large
numbers of polygons becomes intractably slow, particularly for tasks that run
in time O(N^2) with a naive algorithm, such as finding which polygons overlap
each other. Here we present a ""divide-and-conquer"" solution to this challenge:
we first split the angular mask into predefined regions called ""pixels,"" such
that each polygon is in only one pixel, and then perform further computations,
such as checking for overlap, on the polygons within each pixel separately.
This reduces O(N^2) tasks to O(N), and also reduces the important task of
determining in which polygon(s) a point on the sky lies from O(N) to O(1),
resulting in significant computational speedup. Additionally, we present a
method to efficiently convert any angular mask to and from the popular HEALPix
format. This method can be generically applied to convert to and from any
desired spherical pixelization. We have implemented these techniques in a new
version of the mangle software package, which is freely available at
http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/mangle/, along with complete documentation
and example applications. These new methods should prove quite useful to the
astronomical community, and since mangle is a generic tool for managing angular
masks on a sphere, it has the potential to benefit terrestrial mapmaking
applications as well.

  figures",,,,"cs.CC cs.CV cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a uniform representation of general objects that captures the
regularities with respect to their structure. It allows a representation of a
general class of objects including geometric patterns and images in a sparse,
modular, hierarchical, and recursive manner. The representation can exploit any
computable regularity in objects to compactly describe them, while also being
capable of representing random objects as raw data. A set of rules uniformly
dictates the interpretation of the representation into raw signal, which makes
it possible to ask what pattern a given raw signal contains. Also, it allows
simple separation of the information that we wish to ignore from that which we
measure, by using a set of maps to delineate the a priori parts of the objects,
leaving only the information in the structure.
  Using the representation, we introduce a measure of information in general
objects relative to structures defined by the set of maps. We point out that
the common prescription of encoding objects by strings to use Kolmogorov
complexity is meaningless when, as often is the case, the encoding is not
specified in any way other than that it exists. Noting this, we define the
measure directly in terms of the structures of the spaces in which the objects
reside. As a result, the measure is defined relative to a set of maps that
characterize the structures. It turns out that the measure is equivalent to
Kolmogorov complexity when it is defined relative to the maps characterizing
the structure of natural numbers. Thus, the formulation gives the larger class
of objects a meaningful measure of information that generalizes Kolmogorov
complexity.

can have zero canonical angular momentum and in the presence of a gravitational

expressed semiclassically either in terms of pairs of scattering trajectories
that enter and leave the system or in terms of the periodic orbits trapped
inside the system. We show how these two pictures are related on the
semiclassical level. We start from the semiclassical formula with the
scattering trajectories and derive from it all terms in the periodic orbit
formula for the time delay. The main ingredient in this calculation is a new
type of correlation between scattering trajectories which is due to
trajectories that approach the trapped periodic orbits closely. The equivalence
between the two pictures is also demonstrated by considering correlation
functions of the time delay. A corresponding calculation for the conductance
gives no periodic orbit contributions in leading order.

his opinion, should make possible faster-than-light communication using the
collapse of the quantum wave function. Contrary to the many proposals which
have been presented in the past, he does not resort to an entangled state of
two systems but he works with a single particle in a superposition of two
states - corresponding to its propagation in opposite directions - one of which
goes through an appropriate interferometer. The possibility for an observer
near the interferometer to introduce or not, at his free will, a phase shifter
along one of the paths should allow to change instantaneously the probability
of finding the particle in the far-away region corresponding to the other state
of the superposition and, correspondingly, to change the intensity of a beam of
particles reaching a distant observer. In this paper we show a flaw in the
argument: once more, as it has been proved in full generality a long time ago,
the process of wave packet reduction cannot be used for superluminal
communication.

wideband slow-fading channel, modeled as an (asymptotically) large number of
independent identically distributed parallel channels, with the random channel
fading realizations remaining constant over the entire coding block. On the one
hand, in the wideband limit the minimum achievable energy per nat required for
reliable transmission, as a random variable, converges in probability to
certain deterministic quantity. On the other hand, the exponential decay rate
of the outage probability, termed as the wideband outage exponent,
characterizes how the number of parallel channels, {\it i.e.}, the
``bandwidth'', should asymptotically scale in order to achieve a target outage
probability at a target energy per nat. We examine two scenarios: when the
transmitter has no channel state information and adopts uniform transmit power
allocation among parallel channels; and when the transmitter is endowed with an
one-bit channel state feedback for each parallel channel and accordingly
allocates its transmit power. For both scenarios, we evaluate the wideband

a rotating black hole and a non self-gravitating torus with constant specific
angular momentum. We have found that the effect of the hydrodynamic drag
exerted by the torus on the satellite is much smaller than the corresponding
one due to radiation reaction, for systems such as those generically expected
in AGNs and at distances from the SMBH which can be probed with LISA. However,
given the uncertainty on the parameters of these systems, there exist
configurations in which the effect of the hydrodynamic drag can be comparable
to the radiation-reaction one in phases of the inspiral which are detectable by
LISA. This is the case, for instance, for a 10^6 M_sun SMBH surrounded by a
corotating torus of comparable mass and with radius of 10^3-10^4 gravitational
radii, or for a 10^5 M_sun SMBH surrounded by a corotating 10^4 M_sun torus
with radius of 10^5 gravitational radii. Should these conditions be met in
astrophysical systems, EMRI-gravitational waves could provide a characteristic
signature of the presence of the torus. In fact, while radiation reaction
always increases the inclination of the orbit with respect to the equatorial
plane, the hydrodynamic drag from a torus corotating with the SMBH always
decreases it. However, even when initially dominating over radiation reaction,
the influence of the hydrodynamic drag decays very rapidly as the satellite
moves into the very strong-field region of the SMBH (i.e., p <~ 5M). Although
our results have been obtained for a specific class of tori, we argue that they

AS-level paths and to provide better topological view of the Internet. An
inherent problem in current algorithms is their extensive use of heuristics.
Such heuristics incur unbounded errors which are spread over all inferred

inference problem. Our algorithm uses as input the Internet core, which is a
dense sub-graph of top-level ASes. We test several methods for creating such a
core and demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm to the core's size and
density, the inference period, and errors in the core.
  We evaluate our algorithm using AS-level paths collected from RouteViews BGP
paths and DIMES traceroute measurements. Our proposed algorithm
deterministically infers over 95% of the approximately 58,000 AS topology
links. The inference becomes stable when using a week worth of data and as
little as 20 ASes in the core. The algorithm infers 2-3 times more peer-to-peer
relationships in edges discovered only by DIMES than in RouteViews edges,
validating the DIMES promise to discover periphery AS edges.

confirm the MOJAVE detection of CP in 1633+382. It is generally believed that
the most likely mechanism for the generation of this CP is Faraday conversion
of linear polarization to CP. A helical jet magnetic-field (B-field) geometry
can facilitate this process - linearly polarized emission from the far side of
the jet is converted to CP as it passes through the magnetised plasma at the
front side of the jet on its way toward the observer. In this case, the sign of
the generated CP is essentially determined by the pitch angle and helicity of
the helical B field. We have determined the pitch-angle regimes and helicities
of the helical jet B fields in 8 AGN for which parsec-scale CP has been
detected, and used them to predict the expected CP signs for these AGN if the
CP is generated via conversion in these helical fields. We have obtained the
intriguing result that our predictions agree with the observed signs in all
eight cases, provided that the longitudinal B-field components in the jets
correspond to South magnetic poles. This clearly non-random pattern
demonstrates that the observed CP in AGN is directly associated with the
presence of helical jet B fields. These results suggest that helical B fields
are ubiquitous in AGN jets.

satellites (Nerem et al. 1993; Cazenave et al. 1995) which have to be taken
into account for modelling precession and nutation at a microarcsecond accuracy
in order to be in agreement with the accuracy of current VLBI determinations of
the Earth orientation parameters. However, the large uncertainties in the
theoretical models for these J2 variations (for example a recent change in the
observed secular trend) is one of the most important causes of why the accuracy
of the precession-nutation models is limited (Williams 1994; Capitaine et al.

observed by space geodetic techniques can influence the theoretical expressions
for precession and nutation. We have used time series of J2 obtained by the

determination of several artificial satellites from 1985 to 2002 to evaluate
the effect of the corresponding constant, secular and periodic parts of H and

We have concluded that, although a realistic estimation of the J2 rate must
rely not only on space geodetic observations over a limited period but also on
other kinds of observations, the monitoring of periodic variations in J2 could
be used for predicting the effects on the periodic part of the

particle thermodiffusion is positive, i.e. the nanoparticle tends to migrate
toward the cold area. The single particle thermal diffusion 2 coefficient is
shown to be independent of the size of the nanoparticle (diameter of 0.8 to 4

shown to be independent of the mass of the nanoparticle and to increase with

Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy in the calcium triplet region of over 3500 red giant
star candidates along the minor axis and in off-axis spheroid fields of M31.
Our data reach out to large radial distances of 160 kpc. The derived velocity
distributions show a kinematically cold substructure at 17 kpc that has been
reported before. We devise an improved method to measure accurate metallicities
from the calcium triplet in low signal-to-noise spectra using a coaddition of
the individual lines. The resulting distribution leads us to note an even
stronger gradient in the abundance distribution along M31's minor axis than
previously detected. The mean metallicity in the outer halo reaches below -2
dex, with individual values as low as -2.6 dex. In the inner spheroid, at 17-19
kpc, we find a sharp decline of ~0.5 dex in metallicity, which roughly
coincides with the edge of an extended disk, previously detected from star
count maps. A large fraction of red giants in the most distant fields are
likely members of M33's overlapping halo. A comparison of our velocities with
those predicted by new N-body simulations argues that the event responsible for
the giant Stream is most likely not responsible for the full population of the
inner halo; we show further that the abundance distribution of the Stream is
different from that of the inner halo, from which it becomes evident that the
merger event that formed the outer halo cannot have contributed any significant
material to the inner spheroid. All this evidence of severe structure changes
in the halo suggests a high degree of infall and stochastic abundance accretion
governing the build-up of M31's halo. (Abridged)

recent revisions of the solar heavy-element abundances. Heavy element
abundances determine the opacity of the stellar material and hence, are an
important input to stellar model calculations. The models with the new, low

heavy-element abundances affect solar models, how these models are tested with
helioseismology, and the impact of the new abundances on standard solar models.
We also discuss the attempts made to improve the agreement of the low-abundance
models with the Sun and discuss how helioseismology is being used to determine
the solar heavy-element abundance. A review of current literature shows that
attempts to improve agreement between solar models with low heavy-element
abundances and seismic inference have been unsuccessful so far. The
low-metallicity models that have the least disagreement with seismic data
require changing all input physics to stellar models beyond their acceptable
ranges. Seismic determinations of the solar heavy-element abundance yield
results that are consistent with the older, higher values of the solar
abundance, and hence, no major changes to the inputs to solar models are
required to make higher-metallicity solar models consistent with helioseismic

kinematic properties of the various emission line regions in narrow line
Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) by modelling their profiles using multiple component
fits. We interpret these results by comparison with velocity components
observed for different lines species covered in the same spectrum, and
equivalent components measured in the spectra of some broad line Seyfert 1s and
a representative Seyfert 2 galaxy. We find that the fits to the Halpha and
Hbeta line profiles in NLS1s require an additional broad (~3000km/s) component
that might correspond to a suppressed broad line region with similar kinematics
to those of typical broad line Seyfert 1s. From the profiles of the forbidden
high ionisation lines (FHILs) in NLS1s, we find evidence that they appear to
trace an `intermediate' velocity region with kinematics between the standard
broad and narrow line regions. Weaker evidence of this region is also present
in the profiles of the permitted Balmer lines. Finally, we note that despite
having similar ionisation potentials, the relative intensities of the highly
ionised lines of [Fe X]6374 and [FeXI]7892 show considerable dispersion from
one galaxy to another. The interpretation of this requires further modelling,
but suggests the possibility of using the ratio as a diagnostic to constrain
the physical conditions of the FHIL emitting region and possibly the shape of
the spectral energy distribution in the vicinity of 200eV. This spectral region
is very difficult to observe directly due to photoelectric absorption both in
our Galaxy and intrinsic to the source.

axisymmetric and asymptotically flat Einstein-Maxwell fields is known to be
g=2. In this paper, we continue our previous works of examination this result
for rotating charged spacetimes with asymptotic non-flat structure. We first
consider two instructive examples of these spacetimes: The spacetime of a
Kerr-Newman black hole with a straight cosmic string on its axis of symmetry
and the Kerr-Newman Taub-NUT spacetime. We show that for both spacetimes the
gyromagnetic ratio g=2 independent of their asymptotic structure. We also
extend this result to a general class of metrics which admit separation of
variables for the Hamilton-Jacobi and wave equations. We proceed with the study
of the gyromagnetic ratio in higher dimensions by considering the general
solution for rotating charged black holes in minimal five-dimensional gauged
supergravity. We obtain the analytic expressions for two distinct gyromagnetic
ratios of these black holes that are associated with their two independent
rotation parameters. These expressions reveal the dependence of the
gyromagnetic ratio on both the curvature radius of the AdS background and the
parameters of the black holes: The mass, electric charge and two rotation
parameters. We explore some special cases of interest and show that when the
two rotation parameters are equal to each other and the rotation occurs at the
maximum angular velocity, the gyromagnetic ratio g=4 regardless of the value of
the electric charge. This agrees precisely with our earlier result obtained for
general Kerr-AdS black holes with a test electric charge. We also show that in
the BPS limit the gyromagnetic ratio for a supersymmetric black hole with equal
rotation parameters ranges between 2 and 4.

mode toward a sample of 50 embedded low-mass stars in nearby star-forming
clouds, taken mostly from the ``Cores to Disks (c2d)'' Legacy program. The
average abundance of solid CO2 relative to water in low-mass protostellar
envelopes is 0.32 +/- 0.02, significantly higher than that found in quiescent
molecular clouds and in massive star forming regions. It is found that a
decomposition of all the observed CO2 bending mode profiles requires a minimum
of five unique components. Roughly 2/3 of the CO2 ice is found in a water-rich
environment, while most of the remaining 1/3 is found in a CO environment.
Ground-based observations of solid CO toward a large subset of the c2d sample
are used to further constrain the CO2:CO component and suggest a model in which
low-density clouds form the CO2:H2O component and higher density clouds form
the CO2:CO ice during and after the freeze-out of gas-phase CO. It is suggested
that the subsequent evolution of the CO2 and CO profiles toward low-mass
protostars, in particular the appearance of the splitting of the CO2 bending
mode due to pure, crystalline CO2, is first caused by distillation of the
CO2:CO component through evaporation of CO due to thermal processing to ~20-30
K in the inner regions of infalling envelopes. The formation of pure CO2 via
segregation from the H2O rich mantle may contribute to the band splitting at
higher levels of thermal processing (>50 K), but is harder to reconcile with
the physical structure of protostellar envelopes around low-luminosity objects.

their level of pre-enrichment, which is in turn determined by the rate of
primordial star formation prior to their assembly. In order for the first
galaxies to remain metal-free, star formation in minihaloes must be highly
suppressed, most likely by H2-dissociating Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation. We show
that the build-up of such a strong LW background is hindered by two effects.
Firstly, the level of the LW background is self-regulated, being produced by
the Population III (Pop III) star formation which it, in turn, suppresses.
Secondly, the high opacity to LW photons which is built up in the relic H II
regions left by the first stars acts to diminish the global LW background.
Accounting for a self-regulated LW background, we estimate a lower limit for
the rate of Pop III star formation in minihaloes at z > 15. Further, we
simulate the formation of a 'first galaxy' with virial temperature T > 10^4 K
and total mass > 10^8 M_Sun at z > 10, and find that complete suppression of
previous Pop III star formation is unlikely, with stars of > 100 M_Sun (Pop
III.1) and > 10 M_Sun (Pop III.2) likely forming. Finally, we discuss the
implications of these results for the nature of the first galaxies, which may

disk accretion in Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We show that the combined effects of
mass outflows and electron energization in the hot part of the accretion flow
can deflate the inflowing gas from a geometrically-thick structure. This allows
the gas to cool and even thermalize on an inflow timescale. As a result, a
compact, relatively cool disk may form at small radii. We show that magnetic
coupling between the relativistic disk and a steady-state jet results in a disk
that is less luminous than a standard relativistic disk accreting at the same
rate. This relaxes the observational constraints on thin-disk accretion in Sgr
A* (and by implication, other Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nulcei, LLAGN). We
find typical cold gas accretion rates of a few * 10^{-9} solar masses / yr. We
also find that the predicted modified disk emission is compatible with existing
near-infrared (NIR) observations of Sgr A* in its quiescent state provided that
the disk inclination angle is > 87 degrees and that the jet extracts more than
75% of the accretion power.

Decoherence, measured in terms of purity, is calculated in linear response
approximation, making use of the spectator configuration. The environment and
its interaction with the qubits are modelled by random matrices. For two
qubits, numerical studies reveal a simple one to one correspondence between its
decoherence and its internal entanglement decay. Using this relation we are
able to give a formula for concurrence decay. For large environments the
evolution induces a unital channel in the two qubits, providing a partial
explanation for the relation above. Using a kicked Ising spin network, we study
the exact evolution of two non-interacting qubits in the presence of a spin
bath. We find that the entanglement (as measured by concurrence) of the two
qubits has a close relation to the purity of the pair, and closely follows an
analytic relation derived for Werner states. As a collateral result we find
that an integrable environment causes quadratic decay of concurrence as well as
of purity, while a chaotic environment causes linear decay. Both quantities
display recurrences in some integrable environments. Good agreement with the
results found using random matrix theory is obtained. Finally, we analyze
decoherence of a quantum register in the absence of non-local operations. The
problem is solved in terms of a sum rule which implies linear scaling in the
number of qubits. Each term involves a single qubit and its entanglement with
the remaining ones. Two conditions are essential: decoherence must be small and
the coupling of different qubits must be uncorrelated in the interaction
picture. We apply the result to the random matrix model, and illustrate its
reach considering a GHZ state coupled to a spin bath.

black holes are simulated, using Teukolsky's black hole perturbation formalism,
for about ten thousand generic orbital configurations. Each binary radiates
power exclusively in modes with frequencies that are
integer-linear-combinations of the orbit's three fundamental frequencies. The
following general spectral properties are found with a survey of orbits: (i)
99% of the radiated power is typically carried by a few hundred modes, and at
most by about a thousand modes, (ii) the dominant frequencies can be grouped
into a small number of families defined by fixing two of the three integer
frequency multipliers, and (iii) the specifics of these trends can be

Detections using triperiodic analytic templates modeled on these general
properties would constitute a verification of radiation from an adiabatic
sequence of black hole orbits and would recover the evolution of the
fundamental orbital frequencies. In an analogy with ordinary spectroscopy, this
would compare to observing the Bohr model's atomic hydrogen spectrum without
being able to rule out alternative atomic theories or nuclei. The suitability
of such a detection technique is demonstrated using snapshots computed at
12-hour intervals throughout the last three years before merger of a kludged
inspiral. Because of circularization, the number of excited modes decreases as
the binary evolves. A hypothetical detection algorithm that tracks mode
families dominating the first 12 hours of the inspiral would capture 98% of the

disorder, introduced by B. Derrida, V. Hakim and J. Vannimenius in 1992, which
can be re-interpreted as an infinite dimensional dynamical system with random
initial condition (the disorder). It is defined through a recurrence relation
for the law of a random variable {R_n}_{n=1,2,...}, which in absence of
disorder (i.e., when the initial condition is degenerate) reduces to a
particular case of the well-known Logistic Map. The large-n limit of the
sequence of random variables 2^{-n} log R_n, a non-random quantity which is
naturally interpreted as a free energy, plays a central role in our analysis.
The model depends on a parameter alpha>0, related to the geometry of the
hierarchical lattice, and has a phase transition in the sense that the free
energy is positive if the expectation of R_0 is larger than a certain threshold
value, and it is zero otherwise. It was conjectured by Derrida et al. (1992)
that disorder is relevant (respectively, irrelevant or marginally relevant) if
1/2<alpha<1 (respectively, alpha<1/2 or alpha=1/2), in the sense that an
arbitrarily small amount of randomness in the initial condition modifies the
critical point with respect to that of the pure (i.e., non-disordered) model if
alpha is larger or equal to 1/2, but not if alpha is smaller than 1/2. Our main
result is a proof of these conjectures for the case alpha different from 1/2.
We emphasize that for alpha>1/2 we find the correct scaling form (for weak
disorder) of the critical point shift.

waves (KGWs) is reviewed and such structures are employed to interpret the
unstable dynamics of an example stratified plane parallel shear flow. This flow
has constant vertical shear, is infinite in the vertical extent, and
characterized by two density jumps of equal magnitude each decreasing
successively with height, in which the jumps are located symmetrically away
from the midplane of the system. We find that for a suitably defined
bulk-Richardson number there exists a band of horizontal wavenumbers which
exhibits normal-mode instability. The instability mechanism closely parallels
the mechanism responsible for the instability seen in the problem of
counter-propagating Rossby waves. In this problem the instability arises out of
the interaction of counter-propagating gravity waves. We argue that the
instability meets the Hayashi-Young criterion for wave instability. We also
argue that the instability is the simplest one that can arise in a stratified
atmosphere with constant shear flow. The counter propagating gravity waves
mechanism detailed here explains why the Rayleigh criteria for shear flow
instability in the unstratified case does not need to be satisfied in the
stratified case. This illustrates how the Miles-Howard theorem may support
destabilization through stratification. A normal mode analysis of a foamy layer
consisting of two density jumps of unequal magnitude is also analyzed. The
results are considered in terms of observations made of sea-hurricane

cylindrical hole in homogeneous dielectric medium is investigated. Prompted by
availability of materials with large dielectric permittivity $\epsilon $ and
small absorption, we discuss the features of this type of radiation for media
with $\epsilon \gg 1$. It is shown that there are high peaks in the angular
distribution of radiation intensity at well-defined harmonics. The conditions
are specified for the cavity-to-helix radii ratio, $\rho_{1}/\rho_{0}$, under
which the angle-integrated radiation intensity on some harmonics exceeds that
in the empty space. Though the amplification of radiation intensity increases
with increasing $\epsilon $, the corresponding ""resonant"" values of $\rho
_{1}/\rho_{0}$ ratio are practically independent of the dielectric permittivity
of surrounding medium. It is shown that an analogous amplification of radiation
takes place essentially for the same values of $\rho_{1}/\rho_{0}$ also for the
radiation in a cylindrical waveguide with conducting walls. An explanation of
this phenomenon is given.

1997 and 2007. Among kHz QPO sources, Aql X-1 is peculiar because so far only
one kHz QPO has been reported, whereas in most sources, two kHz QPOs are
usually detected (a lower and an upper kHz QPO). The identification of the QPOs
reported so far has therefore been ambiguous, although it has been proposed
that they were likely to be the lower QPO. Following up on previous work, we
confirm the identification of the QPOs previously reported as lower QPOs,
because of their high quality factors and the quality factor versus frequency
dependency, which are similar to those observed in other sources. Combining all
segments of data containing a lower QPO, we detect for the first time an upper
kHz QPO. As in other sources for which the neutron star spin frequency is
larger than 400 Hz (550.25 Hz in Aql X-1), the frequency difference between the
two kHz QPOs is close to half the spin frequency. Based on this result, we
re-examine the link between the neutron star spin and the frequency of the kHz
QPOs, to show that a model in which the separation of the lower and upper QPOs
relates to the neutron star spin frequency is still as good as any comparably
simple model.

ionic structures rapidly folding tailward, were recorded in the U band during
one night, January 12th. Data from the SOHO satellite that was extrapolated
corotationally to the position of the comet showed that the ion rays were
formed during a sudden change in the in-situ solar wind state. We were able to
succesfully correlate a high-speed solar wind stream with the appearance of
folding ion rays. To our knowledge, this is the first clear observational
evidence that folding ion rays in cometary comae are produced by a sudden

There is
""tracker solution"" in quintessence models, in which evolution of the field
$\phi$ at present times is not sensitive to its initial conditions. When the
energy density of dark energy is neglectable ($\Omega_\phi\ll1$), evolution of
the tracker solution can be well analysed from ""tracker equation"". In this
paper, we try to study evolution of the quintessence field from ""full tracker
equation"", which is valid for all spans of $\Omega_\phi$. We get stable fixed
points of $w_\phi$ and $\Omega_\phi$ (noted as $\hat w_\phi$ and
$\hat\Omega_\phi$) from the ""full tracker equation"", i.e., $w_\phi$ and
$\Omega_\phi$ will always approach $\hat w_\phi$ and $\hat\Omega_\phi$
respectively. Since $\hat w_\phi$ and $\hat\Omega_\phi$ are analytic functions
of $\phi$, analytic relation of $\hat w_\phi\sim\hat\Omega_\phi$ can be
obtained, which is a good approximation for the $w_\phi\sim\Omega_\phi$
relation and can be obtained for the most type of quintessence potentials. By
using this approximation, we find that inequalities $\hat w_\phi<w_\phi$ and
$\hat\Omega_\phi<\Omega_\phi$ are statisfied if the $w_\phi$ (or $\hat w_\phi$)
is decreasing with time. In this way, the potential $U(\phi)$ can be
constrained directly from observations, by no need of solving the equations of
motion numerically.

pressure is ~10% of the gas thermal pressure in the cores of NGC 1399 and M87,
although the uncertainties in our model assumptions (e.g., spherical symmetry)
are sufficiently large that the contribution could be consistent with zero. In
the absence of any other form of non-thermal pressure support, these upper
bounds translate into upper limits on the magnetic field of ~10-20 muG at a
distance of 1'-2' from the centers of NGC1399 and M87. We show that these
results are consistent with the current paradigm of cool cluster cores, based
on the assumption that AGN activity regulates the thermal state of the gas by
injecting energy into the intra-cluster medium. The limit of ~10-20% on the
energy density in the form of relativistic protons applies not only to the
current state of the gas, but essentially to the entire history of the
intra-cluster medium, provided that cosmic ray protons evolve adiabatically and

networked economic system. We first review the empirical results documenting
that in many economies the wealth distribution is described by a combination of
log--normal and power--law behaviours. We then focus on the Bouchaud--M\'ezard
model of wealth exchange, describing an economy of interacting agents connected
through an exchange network. We report analytical and numerical results showing
that the system self--organises towards a stationary state whose associated
wealth distribution depends crucially on the underlying interaction network. In
particular we show that if the network displays a homogeneous density of links,
the wealth distribution displays either the log--normal or the power--law form.
This means that the first--order topological properties alone (such as the
scale--free property) are not enough to explain the emergence of the
empirically observed \emph{mixed} form of the wealth distribution. In order to
reproduce this nontrivial pattern, the network has to be heterogeneously
divided into regions with variable density of links. We show new results
detailing how this effect is related to the higher--order correlation
properties of the underlying network. In particular, we analyse assortativity
by degree and the pairwise wealth correlations, and discuss the effects that
these properties have on each other.

distributed in the Asian tropics, rely mostly on nutrients derived from
arthropods trapped in their pitcher-shaped leaves and digested by their
enzymatic fluid. The genus exhibits a great diversity of prey and pitcher forms
and its mechanism of trapping has long intrigued scientists. The slippery inner
surfaces of the pitchers, which can be waxy or highly wettable, have so far
been considered as the key trapping devices. However, the occurrence of species
lacking such epidermal specializations but still effective at trapping insects
suggests the possible implication of other mechanisms. Methodology/Principal
Findings : Using a combination of insect bioassays, high-speed video and
rheological measurements, we show that the digestive fluid of Nepenthes
rafflesiana is highly viscoelastic and that this physical property is crucial
for the retention of insects in its traps. Trapping efficiency is shown to
remain strong even when the fluid is highly diluted by water, as long as the
elastic relaxation time of the fluid is higher than the typical time scale of
insect movements. Conclusions/Significance : This finding challenges the common
classification of Nepenthes pitchers as simple passive traps and is of great
adaptive significance for these tropical plants, which are often submitted to
high rainfalls and variations in fluid concentration. The viscoelastic trap
constitutes a cryptic but potentially widespread adaptation of Nepenthes
species and could be a homologous trait shared through common ancestry with the
sundew (Drosera) flypaper plants. Such large production of a highly
viscoelastic biopolymer fluid in permanent pools is nevertheless unique in the
plant kingdom and suggests novel applications for pest control.

large-scale shear using two different approaches: the spectral
tau-approximation and the second order correlation approximation (or
first-order smoothing approximation). These two approaches demonstrate that
homogeneous kinetic helicity fluctuations alone with zero mean value in a
sheared homogeneous turbulence cannot cause large-scale dynamo. Mean-field
dynamo can be possible when kinetic helicity fluctuations are inhomogeneous
which cause a nonzero mean alpha effect in a sheared turbulence. On the other
hand, shear-current effect can generate large-scale magnetic field even in a
homogeneous nonhelical turbulence with large-scale shear. This effect was
investigated previously for large hydrodynamic and magnetic Reynolds numbers.
In this study we examine the threshold required for the shear-current dynamo
versus Reynolds number. We demonstrate that there is no need for a developed
inertial range in order to maintain the shear-current dynamo (e.g., the
threshold in the Reynolds number is of the order of 1).

in the context of quantum computation, it is simple and versatile enough to be
implemented using any physical system that allows superposition of states, and
several proposals have been made in the literature. I study a mechanical
realisation of the algorithm using coupled simple harmonic oscillators, and
construct its physical model for the simplest case of four identical
oscillators. The identification oracle is implemented as an elastic reflection
of the desired oscillator, and the overrelaxation operation is realised as
evolution of the system by half an oscillation period. I derive the equations
of motion, and solve them both analytically and by computer simulation. I
extend the ideal case analysis and explore the sensitivity of the algorithm to
changes in the initial conditions, masses of springs and damping. The amplitude
amplification provided by the algorithm enhances the energy of the desired
oscillator, while running the algorithm backwards spreads out the energy of the
perturbed oscillator among its partners. The former (efficient focusing of
energy into a specific oscillator) can have interesting applications in
processes that need crossing of an energy threshold for completion, and can be
useful in nanotechnological devices and catalysis. The latter (efficient
redistribution of energy) can be useful in processes requiring rapid
dissipation of energy, such as shock-absorbers and vibrational shielding. I

dependence of the unit cell volume was found between T_{N}=38$ K and 100 K,
suggesting that a low-energy lattice excitation may be responsible for the
lattice expansion in this temperature range. Between T* ~ 65 K and T_{N}, all
lattice parameters showed incipient magnetoelastic effects, due to short-range
spin correlations. An anisotropic strain along the a-direction was also
observed below T*. Below T_{N}, a relatively large contraction of the
a-parameter following the square of the average sublattice magnetization of Mn
was found, indicating that a second-order spin hamiltonian accounts for the
magnetic interactions along this direction. On the other hand, the more complex
behaviors found for $b$ and $c$ suggest additional magnetic transitions below
T_{N} and perhaps higher-order terms in the spin hamiltonian. Polycrystalline
samples grown by distinct routes and with nearly homogeneous crystal structure
above T_{N} presented structural phase coexistence below T_{N}, indicating a
close competition amongst distinct magnetostructural states in this compound.

  future","6 pages",,,,"q-bio.BM q-bio.SC",,"  Miniaturization is a hallmark of modern technologies. Notably, this feature
has not spared molecular biology and its potential applications. Towards
developing more effective therapeutics against cancer, studies began to explore
more than a decade ago how natural tumor suppression could be translated into
antineoplastic drugs. To this end, investigators focused on major constituents
of a central pathway that protects cells against neoplastic transformation: the
nuclear retinoblastoma protein (RB) pathway. As such, peptide mimetics of RB,
p16 and p21 were developed. Likewise, the p53 and von Hippel-Lindau gene
products which affect indirectly the RB pathway provided additional templates
for the development of anti-proliferative peptides. Each of the peptides
derived from these distinct tumor suppressors was made cell-permeable by its
ligation to an amino acid sequence conferring cellular internalization. Details
reviewed here reveal that through the application of such anti-cancer peptide
therapeutics alone or in conjunction whenever synergy is to expect, the dark
era of chemotherapy will likely be overcome, at last.

planets of Jovian- to Super-Earth-mass planets at orbits of a few AU. Since
planetary signals are of very short duration, an intense and continuous
monitoring is required. This is achieved by ground-based networks of telescopes
(PLANET/RoboNET, microFUN) following up targets, which are identified as
microlensing events by single dedicated telescopes (OGLE, MOA). Microlensing
has led to four already published detections of extrasolar planets, one of them
being OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb, a planet of only ~5.5 M_earth orbiting its M-dwarf
host star at ~2.6 AU. Very recent observations (May--September 2007) provided
more planetary candidates, still under study, that will double the number of
detections. For non-planetary microlensing events observed from 1995 to 2006 we
compute detection efficiency diagrams, which can then be used to derive an
estimate of the Galactic abundance of cool planets in the mass regime from
Jupiters to Sub-Neptunes.

  (Aug. 2007), in press in Ann. Geophysicae",,"10.5194/angeo-26-3025-2008",,"astro-ph",,"  A close association between eruptive prominences and CMEs, both slow and fast
CMEs, was reported in many studies. Sometimes it is possible to follow the
material motion starting from the prominence (filament) activation to the CME
in the high corona. Remnants of the prominence were found in the bright core of
CMEs. However, detailed comparisons of the two phenomena reveal problems in
explaining CMEs as a continuation of filament eruptions in the upper corona.
For example, the heliolatitudes of the disappeared filaments and subsequent
coronal ejections sometimes differ by tens of degrees. In order to clear up the
problems of EP-CME association we tentatively analyse the more general question
of the dynamics of a magnetic flux rope. Prominences and filaments are the best
tracers of the flux ropes in the corona long before the beginning of the
eruption. A twisted flux rope is held by the tension of field lines of
photospheric sources until parameters of the system reach critical values and a
catastrophe happens. We suggest that the associated flux rope height above the
photosphere is one of these parameters and it is revealed by the height of the
filament. 80 filaments were analysed and we found that eruptive prominences
were near the so-called limit of stability a few days before their eruptions.
We suggest that a comparison of the real heights of prominences with the
calculated critical heights from magnetograms could be systematically used to
predict filament eruptions and the corresponding CMEs.

to investigate the population of cool luminous stars of the young massive
Galactic cluster RSGC1. Using the 2.293\micron CO-bandhead feature, we make
high-precision radial velocity measurements of 16 of the 17 candidate Red
Supergiants (RSGs) identified by Figer et al. We show that F16 and F17 are
foreground stars, while we confirm that the rest are indeed
physically-associated RSGs. We determine that Star F15, also associated with
the cluster, is a Yellow Hypergiant based on its luminosity and spectroscopic
similarity to $\rho$ Cas. Using the cluster's radial velocity, we have derived
the kinematic distance to the cluster and revisited the stars' temperatures and
luminosities. We find a larger spread of luminosities than in the discovery
paper, consistent with a cluster age 30% older than previously thought
(12$\pm$2Myr), and a total initial mass of $(3\pm1) \times 10^{4}$\msun. The
spatial coincidence of the OH maser with F13, combined with similar radial
velocities, is compelling evidence that the two are related. Combining our
results with recent SiO and H$_2$O maser observations, we find that those stars
with maser emission are the most luminous in the cluster. From this we suggest
that the maser-active phase is associated with the end of the RSG stage, when
the luminosity-mass ratios are at their highest.
