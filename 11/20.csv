class of such configurations in the matrix model, in terms of fermionic

several different time variables, some of which are infinite and some of which

different descriptions, and use those to calculate fermion correlators in the
time dependent background. Using the chiral formalism, we write the time

$n$). They showed that for small path-loss exponents $\alpha\in(2,3]$
cooperative communication is order optimal, and for large path-loss exponents
$\alpha > 3$ multi-hop communication is order optimal. However, their results
(both the communication scheme and the proof technique) are strongly dependent
on the regularity induced with high probability by the random node placement.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of characterizing the throughput
scaling in extended wireless networks with arbitrary node placement. As a main
result, we propose a more general novel cooperative communication scheme that
works for arbitrarily placed nodes. For small path-loss exponents $\alpha \in
(2,3]$, we show that our scheme is order optimal for all node placements, and
achieves exactly the same throughput scaling as in Ozgur et al. This shows that
the regularity of the node placement does not affect the scaling of the
achievable rates for $\alpha\in (2,3]$. The situation is, however, markedly
different for large path-loss exponents $\alpha >3$. We show that in this
regime the scaling of the achievable per-node rates depends crucially on the
regularity of the node placement. We then present a family of schemes that
smoothly ""interpolate"" between multi-hop and cooperative communication,
depending upon the level of regularity in the node placement. We establish
order optimality of these schemes under adversarial node placement for $\alpha

therefore analyze two broad band spectra for each orbit, before and after

including an iron emission line and a cyclotron resonance scattering feature.
While no strong spectral variations were detected, the second half of orbit 2
shows a tendency toward being softer and more strongly absorbed. In order to
follow the orbital phase-dependent evolution of the spectrum in greater detail,
we model spectra for shorter exposures, confirming that most spectral
parameters show either a gradual or sudden change for the second half of the
second orbit. A comparison with a simple wind model indicates the existence of
an accretion wake in this system. We also present and discuss high resolution
pulse profiles for several different energy bands, as well as their hardness
ratios. PCA and HEXTE spectra were created for 24 phase bins and fitted using
the same model as in the phase averaged case. Systematic pulse phase-dependent
variations of several continuum and cyclotron line parameters were detected,
most notably a significant increase of the cyclotron line energy during the

is given by stochastic integrals with uniformly continuous coeffcients. The
range of applicability includes also a broader class of processes of practical
relevance, such as the sup process and certain discrete time summations we
discuss. We discretize the space coordinate in uniform steps and assume that
time is either continuous or finely discretized as in a fully explicit Euler
method and the Courant condition is satisfied. We show that the Fourier
transform of the joint kernel of a diffusion and a stochastic integral
converges in a uniform graph norm associated to the Markov generator.
Convergence also implies smoothness properties for the Fourier transform of the
joint kernel. Stochastic integrals are straightforward to define for finite
triangulations and the convergence result gives a new and entirely constructive
way of defining stochastic integrals in the continuum. The method relies on a
reinterpretation and extension of the classic theorems by Feynman-Kac,
Girsanov, Ito and Cameron-Martin, which are also re-obtained. We make use of a
path-wise analysis without relying on a probabilistic interpretation. The
Fourier representation is needed to regularize the hypo-elliptic character of
the joint process of a diffusion and an adapted stochastic integral. The
argument extends as long as the Fourier analysis framework can be generalized.
This condition leads to the notion of non-resonant Abelian process.

functional theory (DFT) but takes the one-particle reduced density matrix

derived [PRB 12, 2111 (1975)] effective single-particle equations analogous to
the Kohn-Sham (KS) equations in DFT. The self-consistent solution of these
1MFT-KS equations reproduces not only the density of the original electron
system but also its 1-matrix. While in DFT it is usually possible to reproduce
the density using KS orbitals with integer (0 or 1) occupancy, in 1MFT
reproducing the 1-matrix requires in general fractional occupancies. The
variational principle implies that the KS eigenvalues of all fractionally
occupied orbitals must collapse at self-consistency to a single level, equal to
the chemical potential. We show that as a consequence of the degeneracy the
iteration of the KS equations is intrinsically divergent. Fortunately, the
level shifting method, commonly introduced in Hartree-Fock calculations, is
always able to force convergence. We introduce an alternative derivation of the
1MFT-KS equations that allows control of the eigenvalue collapse by
constraining the occupancies. As an explicit example, we apply the 1MFT-KS

recently been proposed [B. Galvan: Found. Phys. 37, 1540-1562 (2007)]. Roughly
speaking, this rule states that if the wave function of a particle is split
into non-overlapping wave packets, the particle stays approximately inside the
support of one of the wave packets, without jumping to the others.
  In this paper a formal definition of this rule is given in terms of {\it
imprecise probability}. An imprecise probability space is a measurable space
$(\Omega, {\cal A})$ endowed with a {\it set} of probability measures $\cal P$.
The quantum formalism and the quantum typicality rule allow us to define a set
of probabilities ${\cal P}_\Psi$ on $(X^T, {\cal F})$, where $X$ is the
configuration space of a quantum system, $T$ is a time interval and ${\cal F}$
is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the cylinder sets. Thus, it is proposed
that a quantum system can be represented as the {\it imprecise stochastic
process} $(X^T, {\cal F}, {\cal P}_\Psi)$, which is a canonical stochastic
process in which the single probability measure is replaced by a set of
measures. It is argued that this mathematical model, when used to represent
macroscopic systems, has sufficient predictive power to explain both the
results of the statistical experiments and the quasi-classical structure of the
macroscopic evolution.

the importance of electron-capture supernovae in globular clusters as the major
supplier of retained neutron stars.By comparing the observed millisecond pulsar
population and the results obtained from simulations, we discuss several
constraints on the evolution of mass-transferring systems.In particular, we
find that in our cluster model the following mass-gaining events create
populations of MSPs that do not match the observations (with respect to binary
periods and companion masses or the number of produced systems) and therefore
likely do not lead to NSs spun up to millisecond periods: (i) accretion during
a common envelope event with a NS formed through accretion-induced collapse,
and (ii) mass transfer from a WD donor. By restricting ourselves to the
evolutionary and dynamical paths that most likely lead to neutron star
recycling, we obtain good agreement between our models and the numbers and

prompt gamma ray emission, and interpret recent Swift satellite observations of
early X-ray afterglow plateaus followed by a sharp drop off or a shallow power
law decay. The three stages involves a neutron star phase, a quark star (QS)
and a black hole phase as described in Staff et al. (2007). We find that the QS
stage allows for more energy to be extracted from neutron star to QS conversion
as well as from ensuing accretion onto the QS. The QS accretion phase naturally
extends the engine activity and can account for both the prompt emission and
irregular early X-ray afterglow activity. Following the accretion phase, the QS
can spin-down by emission of a baryon-free outflow. The magnetar-like magnetic
field strengths resulting from the NS to QS transition provide enough spin-down
energy, for the correct amount of time, to account for the plateau in the X-ray
afterglow. In our model, a sharp drop-off following the plateau occurs when the
QS collapses to a BH during the spin-down, thus shutting-off the secondary
outflow. We applied our model to GRB 070110 and GRB 060607A and found that we
can consistently account for the energetics and duration during the prompt and
plateau phases.

Their existence is considered to be a challenge for the Lambda CDM cosmology,
because galaxy mergers isotropize stellar disks and trigger angular momentum
transport in gas disks, thus fostering the formation of central stellar
spheroids. Here, we postulate that the formation of stellar spheroids from
gas-rich disks is controlled by two parameters that characterize galaxy
mergers, the mass ratio of merging dark matter halos, and the virial velocity
of the larger merging halo. We utilize merger histories generated from
realizations of the cosmological density field to calculate the fraction of
dark matter halos that have avoided spheroid formation, and compare the derived
statistics with the spheroid occupation fractions in surveys of nearby
galaxies. We find, for example, that the survival rate of disk-dominated
galaxies in Lambda CDM is just high enough to explain the observed fractional
representation of disk-dominated galaxies in the universe if the only mergers
which lead to central spheroid formation are those with mass ratios M2/M1 > 0.3
and virial velocities Vvir,1 > 55 km/s. We discuss the physical origin of this
criterion.

new astrophysics. LIGO, a joint Caltech-MIT project supported by the National
Science Foundation, operates three multi-kilometer interferometers at two
widely separated sites in the United States. These detectors are the result of
decades of worldwide technology development, design, construction, and
commissioning. They are now operating at their design sensitivity, and are
sensitive to gravitational wave strains smaller than 1 part in 1E21. With this
unprecedented sensitivity, the data are being analyzed to detect or place
limits on gravitational waves from a variety of potential astrophysical

thoroughly in the last decade. Despite some efforts it remained an open
question whether proper generalized E(R)-algebras exist. These are R-algebras A
isomorphic to End_R A but not under the above canonical isomorphism, so not
E(R)-algebras. This question was raised about 30 years ago (for R=Z) by Phil
Schultz and we will answer it. For PIDs R of characteristic 0 that are neither
quotient fields nor complete discrete valuation rings - we will establish the
existence of generalized E(R)-algebras. It can be shown that E(R)-algebras over

(copies of R). The main tool is an interesting connection between
lambda-calculus (used in theoretical computer sciences) and algebra. It seems
reasonable to divide the work into two parts, in this paper we will work in V=L

decoding of convolutional codes. ML decoding can be modeled as finding the most
probable path taken through a Markov graph. Integrated with the Viterbi
algorithm (VA), complexity reduction methods such as the sphere decoder often
use the sum log likelihood (SLL) of a Markov path as a bound to disprove the
optimality of other Markov path sets and to consequently avoid exhaustive path
search. In this paper, it is shown that SLL-based optimality tests are
inefficient if one fixes the coding memory and takes the codeword length to
infinity. Alternatively, optimality of a source symbol at a given time index
can be testified using bounds derived from log likelihoods of the neighboring
symbols. It is demonstrated that such neighboring log likelihood (NLL)-based
optimality tests, whose efficiency does not depend on the codeword length, can
bring significant complexity reduction to ML decoding of convolutional codes.
The results are generalized to ML sequence detection in a class of
discrete-time hidden Markov systems.

operation frequency, so high relative resolution and an ability of this
technique to operate also in high magnetic fields the method has advantages
over others. They become crucial at non-destructive studies in thin flat HTSC
materials with small signals - especially near the normal-to-superconductive
(N/S) phase transition (at start of formation of electron-pairs). Just due to
such advantages a fine 'paramagnetic' peculiarity of the SC-transition was
detected by this method in YBaCuO film recently, which precedes well-known
Meissner expel. The method enabled to detect also a little absorption of a
power by the HTSC film upon its SC transition, with a peak located after the
onset of Meissner push-out - close to its center. Extracted from so complicated
fluctuation region these subtle effects (1-st is precursor, whereas the 2-nd -
posterior to the Meissner expel) indicate an existence of 3 distinctive
temperatures at N/S transition. Crucial role of these specific temperatures for
understanding of a real nature of the whole SC-phenomenon is discussed.
Possible relation between these temperatures and the 'singlet'/'triplet'
behavior of electron-pairs is pointed out and argued.

long-range interacting particles. The position of two arbitrary atoms is,
independent on their distance, coupled by the back-scattering of photons within
the cavity. This mutual coupling can lead to collective instability and
self-organization of a cloud of cold atoms interacting with the cavity fields.
This phenomenon (CARL, i.e. Collective Atomic Recoil Lasing) has been discussed
theoretically for years, but was observed only recently in our lab. The
CARL-effect is closely linked to superradiant Rayleigh Scattering, which has
been intensely studied with Bose-Einstein condensates in free space. By adding
a resonator the coherence time of the system, in which the instability occurs,
can be strongly enhanced. This enables us to observe cavity-enhanced
superradiance with both Bose-Eisntein condensed and thermal clouds and allows
us to close the discussion about the role of quantum statistics in superradiant
scattering.

manual tracking of isolated magnetic elements to obtain horizontal velocities
from magnetograms. We find that the measured flow fields obtained by the
different methods are well-correlated on large scales. The topology of the flow
field changed significantly during the filament eruptive phase, suggesting a
possible coupling between the surface flow field and the coronal magnetic
field. We measured an increase in the shear below the point where the eruption
starts and a decrease in shear after the eruption. We find a pattern in the
large-scale horizontal flows at the solar surface that interact with
differential rotation. We conclude that there is probably a link between
changes in surface flow and the disappearance of the eruptive filament.

been tackled with more or less success during the last decades. We present an
exact method for the study of four-quark systems based on the hyperspherical
harmonics formalism that allows us to solve it without resorting to further
approximations, like for instance the existence of diquark components. We apply
it to systems containing two heavy and two light quarks using different
quark-quark potentials. While $QQ\bar n \bar n$ states may be stable in nature,
the stability of $Q\bar Qn \bar n$ states would imply the existence of quark
correlations not taken into account by simple quark dynamical models.

period. It included narrow-band fluctuations and frequency-drifting features in
the metric wavelength range, type III burst groups at metric--hectometric
wavelengths, and an interplanetary type II radio burst, which was visible in
the dynamic radio spectrum below 14 MHz. To study the association of the
recorded solar energetic particle (SEP) populations with the propagating CME
and flaring, we perform a multi-wavelength analysis using radio spectral and
imaging observations combined with white-light, EUV, hard X-ray, and
magnetogram data. Velocity dispersion analysis of the particle distributions
(SOHO and Wind in situ observations) provides estimates for the release times
of electrons and protons. Our analysis indicates that proton acceleration was
delayed compared to the electrons. The dynamics of the interplanetary type II
burst identify the burst source as a bow shock created by the fast CME. The
type III burst groups, with start times close to the estimated electron release
times, trace electron beams travelling along open field lines into the
interplanetary space. The type III bursts seem to encounter a steep density
gradient as they overtake the type II shock front, resulting in an abrupt
change in the frequency drift rate of the type III burst emission. Our study
presents evidence in support of a scenario in which electrons are accelerated
low in the corona behind the CME shock front, while protons are accelerated
later, possibly at the CME bow shock high in the corona.

systems predominantly show single jets. During their formation, stars most
frequently produce energetic outflows and jets. However, binary jets have only
been observed in a very small number of systems. We model numerically 3D binary
jets for various outflow parameters. We also model the propagation of jets from
a specific source, namely L1551 IRS 5, known to have two jets, using recent
observations as constraints for simulations with a new MHD code. We examine
their morphology and dynamics, and produce synthetic emission maps. We find
that the two jets interfere up to the stage where one of them is almost
destroyed or engulfed into the second one. We are able to reproduce some of the
observational features of L1551 such as the bending of the secondary jet. While
the effects of orbital motion are negligible over the jets dynamical timeline,
their interaction has significant impact on their morphology. If the jets are
not strictly parallel, as in most observed cases, we show that the magnetic
field can help the collimation and refocusing of both of the two jets.

of quasinormal modes with complex frequencies \omega= \omega_R+i\omega_I. We
show that this behavior is the same as that of a collection of damped harmonic
oscillators whose real frequencies are (\omega_R^2+\omega_I^2)^{1/2}, rather
than simply \omega_R. Since, for highly excited modes, \omega_I >> \omega_R,
this observation changes drastically the physical understanding of the black
hole spectrum, and forces a reexamination of various results in the literature.
In particular, adapting a derivation by Hod, we find that the area of the
horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole is quantized in units \Delta
A=8\pi\lpl^2, where \lpl is the Planck length (in contrast with the original
result \Delta A=4\log(3) \lpl^2). The resulting area quantization does not
suffer from a number of difficulties of the original proposal; in particular,
it is an intrinsic property of the black hole, independent of the spin of the
perturbation.

dependence of the quark condensate $<\bar qq>$. The corrections beyond the

contributions to the energy per particle of isospin-symmetric nuclear matter
with respect to the pion mass. Our calculation treats systematically the
effects from one-pion exchange (with $m_\pi$-dependent vertex corrections),
iterated $1\pi$-exchange, and irreducible $2\pi$-exchange including
intermediate $\Delta(1232)$-isobar excitations, with Pauli-blocking corrections
up to three-loop order. We find a strong and non-linear dependence of the
``dropping'' in-medium condensate on the actual value of the pion (or light
quark) mass. In the chiral limit, $m_\pi=0$, chiral restoration appears to be
reached already at about 1.5 times normal nuclear matter density. By contrast,
for the physical pion mass, $m_\pi = 135 $MeV, the in-medium condensate
stabilizes at about 60% of its vacuum value above that same density. Effects
from $2\pi$-exchange with virtual $\Delta(1232)$-isobar excitations turn out to
be crucial in generating such pronounced deviations from the linear density
approximation above $\rho_0$. The hindered tendency towards chiral symmetry
restoration provides a justification for using pions and nucleons as effective
low-energy degrees of freedom at least up to twice nuclear matter density.

Chromodynamics (QCD), the established theory of the strong interactions,
becomes divergent. It is therefore highly intriguing to explore this theory in
the realm of its strong interaction regime. However, the quarks and gluons can
not be resolved at the GeV scale but have to be studied through their
manifestations in the bound many-body systems, for instance pions, nucleons and
their resonances. The review starts with a short overview of QCD at low
