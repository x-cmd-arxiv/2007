approximation, a standard, low-density methodology that assumes the ionization
balance is separable from a determination of the excited-state populations that
give rise to the spectra. GSM also allows for some states to be treated only as
contributions to effective rates. While these two approximations are known to
be valid at low densities, this work investigates using such methods to model
high-density, non-LTE emission spectra and determines at what point the
approximations break down by comparing to spectra produced by the LANL code
ATOMIC which makes no such approximations. As both approximations are used by
other astrophysical and low-density modeling codes, the results should be of
broad interest. He-like K$\alpha$ emission spectra are presented for Ni, Fe,
and Ca, in order to gauge the effect of both approximations employed in GSM.
This work confirms that at and above the temperature of maximum abundance of
the He-like ionization stage, the range of validity for both approximations is
sufficient for modeling the low- and moderate-density regimes one typically
finds in astrophysical and magnetically confined fusion plasmas. However, a
breakdown does occur for high densities; we obtain quantitative limits that are
significantly higher than previous works. This work demonstrates that, while
the range of validity for both approximations is sufficient to predict the
density-dependent quenching of the z line, the approximations break down at
higher densities. Thus these approximations should be used with greater care
when modeling high-density plasmas such as those found in inertial confinement
fusion and electromagnetic pinch devices.

following conjecture: due to the formation of voids and opaque structures, the
average matter density on the path of the light from the well-observed objects
changes from Omega_M ~ 1 in the homogeneous early universe to Omega_M ~ 0 in
the clumpy late universe, so that the average expansion rate increases along
our line of sight from EdS expansion Ht ~ 2/3 at high redshifts to free
expansion Ht ~ 1 at low redshifts. To calculate the modified observable
distance-redshift relations, we introduce a generalized Dyer-Roeder method that
allows for two crucial physical properties of the universe: inhomogeneities in
the expansion rate and the growth of the nonlinear structures. By treating the
transition redshift to the void-dominated era as a free parameter, we find a
phenomenological fit to the observations from the CMB anisotropy, the position
of the baryon oscillation peak, the magnitude-redshift relations of type Ia
supernovae, the local Hubble flow and the nucleosynthesis, resulting in a
concordant model of the universe with 90% dark matter, 10% baryons, no dark
energy, 15 Gyr as the age of the universe and a natural value for the
transition redshift z_0=0.35. Unlike a large local void, the model respects the
cosmological principle, further offering an explanation for the late onset of
the perceived acceleration as a consequence of the forming nonlinear
structures. Additional tests, such as quantitative predictions for angular
deviations due to an anisotropic void distribution and a theoretical derivation
of the model, can vindicate or falsify the interpretation that light
propagation in voids is responsible for the perceived acceleration.

but a combination of two components. The first, the 'slow variation' component,
is revealed by slow changes in the ionization level of circumstellar matter
across the whole cycle and is caused by gradual changes in the wind-wind
collision shock-cone orientation, angular opening and gaseous content. The
second, the 'collapse' component, is restricted to around the minimum, and is
due to a temporary global collapse of the wind-wind collision shock. High
energy photons (E > 16 eV) from the companion star are strongly shielded,
leaving the Weigelt objects at low ionization state for >6 months. High energy
phenomena are sensitive only to the 'collapse', low energy only to the 'slow
variation' and intermediate energies to both components. Simple eclipses and
mechanisms effective only near periastron (e.g., shell ejection or accretion
onto the secondary star) cannot account for the whole 5.5-yr cycle.

observations on the magnetic field strength at various astrophysical scales
and, at the same time, avoid a back-reaction problem. Then, we study whether
the required coupling functions can naturally emerge in well-motivated,
possibly string-inspired, models. We argue that this is non trivial and can be
realized only for a restricted class of scenarios. This includes power-law
inflation where the inflaton field is interpreted as a modulus. However, this
scenario seems to be consistent only if the energy scale of inflation is low
and the reheating stage prolonged. Another reasonable possibility appears to be
small field models since no back-reaction problem is present in this case but,
unfortunately, the corresponding scenario cannot be justified in a stringy

Hamilton-Jacobi theory, analogous to mechanics. Even though the thermodynamic
variables come in conjugate pairs such as pressure/volume or
temperature/entropy, the phase space is odd-dimensional. For a system with n
thermodynamic degrees of freedom it is (2n+1)-dimensional. The equations of
state of a substance pick out an n-dimensional submanifold. A family of
substances whose equations of state depend on n parameters define a
hypersurface of co-dimension one. This can be described by the vanishing of a
function which plays the role of a Hamiltonian. The ordinary differential
equations (characteristic equations) defined by this function describe a
dynamical system on the hypersurface. Its orbits can be used to reconstruct the
equations of state. The `time' variable associated to this dynamics is related
to, but is not identical to, entropy. After developing this formalism on
well-grounded systems such as the van der Waals gases and the Curie-Weiss
magnets, we derive a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for black hole thermodynamics in

radiation source should merge when the ratio of ionizing photon flux to gas
density is sufficiently low and the spectrum is sufficiently hard. This regime
is particularly relevant to the molecular knots that are commonly found in
evolved planetary nebulae, such as the Helix Nebula, where traditional models
of photodissociation regions have proved unable to explain the high observed
luminosity in H_2 lines. In this paper we present results for the structure and
steady-state dynamics of such advection-dominated merged fronts, calculated
using the Cloudy plasma/molecular physics code. We find that the principal
destruction processes for H_2 are photoionization by extreme ultraviolet
radiation and charge exchange reactions with protons, both of which form H_2^+,
which rapidly combines with free electrons to undergo dissociative
recombination. Advection moves the dissociation front to lower column densities
than in the static case, which vastly increases the heating in the partially
molecular gas due to photoionization of He^0, H_2, and H^0. This causes a
significant fraction of the incident bolometric flux to be re-radiated as
thermally excited infrared H_2 lines, with the lower excitation pure rotational
lines arising in 1000 K gas and higher excitation H_2 lines arising in 2000 K
gas, as is required to explain the H_2 spectrum of the Helix cometary knots.

model because only the s-wave part of the electronic wave-function is affected
by the Kondo coupling. Since only the spin degrees of freedom are involved in
the Kondo interaction, and due to spin-charge separation in 1D, the universal
low energy long distance physics of the Kondo model also arises when a magnetic
impurity is coupled to the end of a gap-less antiferromagnetic J_1-J_2 spin-1/2
chain, where J_1(J_2) is the (next-)nearest neighbor coupling. Experimental
realizations of such spin chain models are possible and using various
analytical and numerical techniques, we present a detailed and quantitative
comparison between the usual free electron Kondo model and such spin chain
versions of the Kondo problem. For the gap-less J_1-J_2 spin chain two cases
are studied, with zero next nearest neighbor coupling, J_2=0, and with a
critical second neighbor coupling, J_2=J_2c. We first focus on the spin chain
impurity model at J_2c~0.2412 where a bulk marginal coupling present in the
spin chain model for J_2<J_2c vanishes. At J_2c, the usual Kondo physics is
recovered in the spin chain model in the low energy regime. We then analyze the
nearest-neighbor model (J_2=0) where a new kind of Kondo effect occurs due to
the presence of the bulk marginal coupling. This marginal coupling leads to a
slower variation of the Kondo temperature T_K with the bare Kondo coupling. In
the exact Bethe ansatz solution of this spin chain impurity model (J_2=0) Frahm
and Zvyagin noted this relation as well as the connection to the Kondo problem.
Here, we provide further evidence for the connection to Kondo physics and
present low temperature QMC results for the impurity susceptibility that
further support this connection.

primary decay of the t' is into q+W, which is not the case for a substantial
region of parameter space. The bound of 268 GeV on the b' mass assumes that the
branching ratio for b' --> b+Z is very large, which is not only not true for
much of parameter space, but is {\em never} true for b' masses above 255 GeV.
In addition, it is assumed that the heavy quarks decay within the silicon
vertex detector, and for small mixing angles this will not be the case. The
experimental bounds, including all of these effects, are found as a function of
the other heavy quark mass and the mixing angle.

  Special Issue",,"10.1063/1.2889005",,"astro-ph",,"  The transfer of turbulent energy through an inertial range from the driving
scale to dissipative scales in a kinetic plasma followed by the conversion of
this energy into heat is a fundamental plasma physics process. A theoretical
foundation for the study of this process is constructed, but the details of the
kinetic cascade are not well understood. Several important properties are
identified: (a) the conservation of a generalized energy by the cascade; (b)
the need for collisions to increase entropy and realize irreversible plasma
heating; and (c) the key role played by the entropy cascade--a dual cascade of
energy to small scales in both physical and velocity space--to convert
ultimately the turbulent energy into heat. A strategy for nonlinear numerical
simulations of kinetic turbulence is outlined. Initial numerical results are
consistent with the operation of the entropy cascade. Inertial range turbulence
arises in a broad range of space and astrophysical plasmas and may play an
important role in the thermalization of fusion energy in burning plasmas.

anisotropic diffusion of adsorbed atoms (adatoms) on terraces separating steps;

sensitive to roughly a decade in scale (wavenumbers of k ~ 0.1 - 1 h Mpc^{-1}),
with foreground contamination precluding measurements on larger scales, and
thermal detector noise limiting the small scale sensitivity. This amounts
primarily to constraints on two numbers: the amplitude and slope of the 21 cm
power spectrum on the scales probed. We find, however, that the redshift
evolution in these quantities can yield important information about
reionization. Although the power spectrum differs substantially across
plausible models, a generic prediction is that the amplitude of the 21 cm power
spectrum on MWA scales peaks near the epoch when the intergalactic medium (IGM)
is ~ 50% ionized. Moreover, the slope of the 21 cm power spectrum on MWA scales
flattens as the ionization fraction increases and the sizes of the HII regions
grow. Considering detection sensitivity, we show that the optimal MWA antenna
configuration for power spectrum measurements would pack all 500 antenna tiles
as close as possible in a compact core. The MWA is sensitive enough in its
optimal configuration to measure redshift evolution in the slope and amplitude
of the 21 cm power spectrum. Detecting the characteristic redshift evolution of
our models will confirm that observed 21 cm fluctuations originate from the
IGM, and not from foregrounds, and provide an indirect constraint on the
volume-filling factor of HII regions during reionization. After two years of
observations under favorable conditions, the MWA can constrain the filling
factor at an epoch when <x_i> ~ 0.5 to within roughly +/- 0.1 at 2-sigma.

an ensemble of hexagonal unit structures in the xy plane when packing disks
with a Gaussian distribution of radii with mean (r) and standard deviation
$\Delta r$. During the course of this investigation an equivalency is
established between gaps arising in hexagonal unit structure packs and
nine-ball billiard rack patterns. An analytic expression is derived for the
probability distribution and location of interparticle gaps of magnitude
$\Gamma$. Due to the number of variables and large number of possible
arrangements, a Monte Carlo simulation has been conducted to complement and
probe the analytic form for three very different systems: i) billiard balls
with Billiard Congress of America (BCA) specifications, ii) US pennies with
specifications of the US Mint, and iii) a hypothetical system with $r = 1.0 m$
and $\Delta r = 1x10^{-10}$ m corresponding to the scale of one atomic radius.
In each case, probability density distributions of gap sizes have been
calculated for those $\Delta r$ above, and also for 2$\Delta r$ and 0.5$\Delta
r$, respectively. A general result is presented for the probability of a
nonzero normalized ($\frac{\Gamma}{\Delta r}$) gap size arising, $P(\Gamma \geq
\alpha \Delta r)= 1-0.124\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is a constant $\leq 5.0$. This
curious result reflects the phenomenon of geometric frustration; the inability
of the system to simultaneously satisfy all geometric constraints required by a
perfect-rack sans interparticle gaps.

cavities are inflated by these cosmic rays. At a later stage of its evolution,
when the cavity becomes buoyant, the converging flow of gas beneath the cavity
results in a filament of thermal gas, a cavity jet, that moves radially outward
at large subsonic velocities. As the cavity jet forms, the cosmic ray electrons
may diffuse through the cavity walls, filling a large volume surrounding the
cavity jet, as observed in M87/Virgo and elsewhere, sometimes referred to as
relic radio sources. We compute the combined evolution of cosmic rays, cavities
and cavity jets. The observed pattern in M87/Virgo can be reached in 100 Myrs,
matching the synchrotron age of the extended radio source. A 20-30 kpc long
cavity jet is surrounded by a quasi-spherical radio lobe 40 kpc in diameter,

strengthens the case for SNRs being the primary source of galactic cosmic ray
ions to the `knee' and beyond. However, the high magnetic field values in SNRs
are obtained exclusively from the interpretation of observations of radiation
from relativistic electrons and if MFA via nonlinear DSA produces these fields
the magnetic field that determines the maximum ion energy will be substantially
less than the field that determines the maximum electron energy. We use results

Previous studies at zero temperature showed that the gas stays in an exotic

state at the trap center; while moving to the edge, the system changes into
either a non-polarized Bardeen-Cooper-Schriffer superfluid ($P<P_c$) or a fully
polarized normal gas ($P>P_c$), depending on the smallness of the spin
polarization $P$, relative to a critical value $P_c$. In this work, we show how
these two phase-separation phases evolve with increasing temperature, and
thereby construct a finite temperature phase diagram. For typical interactions,
we find that the exotic FFLO phase survives below one-tenth of Fermi degeneracy
temperature, which seems to be accessible in the current experiment. The
density profile, equation of state, and specific heat of the polarized system
have been calculated and discussed in detail. Our results are useful for the

magnetic field in the centers, are investigated using two- and
three-dimensional MHD simulations. The central field can be built up to the
equipartition level and disrupts a nearly axisymmetric outer accretion disk
inside a magnetospheric radius, forming a magnetically arrested disk (MAD). In
the MAD, the mass accretes in a form of irregular dense spiral streams and the
vertical field, split into separate bundles, penetrates through the disk plane
in low-density magnetic islands. The accreting mass, when spiraling inward,
drags the field and twists it around the axis of rotation, resulting in
collimated Poynting jets in the polar directions. These jets are powered by the
accretion flow with the efficiency up to ~1.5% (in units \dot{M}c^2). The
spiral flow pattern in the MAD is dominated by modes with low azimuthal
wavenumbers m~1-5 and can be a source of quasi-periodic oscillations in the
outgoing radiation. The formation of MAD and Poynting jets can naturally
explain the observed changes of spectral states in Galactic black hole
binaries. Our study is focused on black hole accretion flows; however, the
results can also be applicable to accretion disks around nonrelativistic

cores within the groups may be at different evolutionary stages. In this
contribution we derive the column densities and temperatures of the cores from
the NH3 emission and investigate if this can be used as an indicator of the
relative evolutionary stages of cores in the sample.
  The majority of cores are well fit using single-temperature large velocity
gradient models, and exhibit a range of temperatures from ~10 K to >200 K.
Under the simple but reasonable assumption that molecular gas in the cores will
heat up and become less quiescent with age due to feedback from the powering
source(s), the molecular gas kinetic temperature combined with information of
the core kinematics seems a promising probe of relative core age in the
earliest evolutionary stages of massive star formation.

bounds on information rates of stationary and ergodic discrete-time channels
with memory. The channels we consider can have a finite number of states, such
as partial response channels, or they can have an infinite state-space, such as
time-varying fading channels. We optimize recently-proposed information rate
bounds for such channels, which make use of auxiliary finite-state machine
channels (FSMCs). Our main contribution in this paper is to provide iterative
expectation-maximization (EM) type algorithms to optimize the parameters of the
auxiliary FSMC to tighten these bounds. We provide an explicit, iterative
algorithm that improves the upper bound at each iteration. We also provide an
effective method for iteratively optimizing the lower bound. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithms, we provide several examples of partial
response and fading channels, where the proposed optimization techniques
significantly tighten the initial upper and lower bounds. Finally, we compare
our results with an improved variation of the \emph{simplex} local optimization
algorithm, called \emph{Soblex}. This comparison shows that our proposed
algorithms are superior to the Soblex method, both in terms of robustness in
finding the tightest bounds and in computational efficiency. Interestingly,
from a channel coding/decoding perspective, optimizing the lower bound is
related to increasing the achievable mismatched information rate, i.e., the
information rate of a communication system where the decoder at the receiver is
matched to the auxiliary channel, and not to the original channel.

the dust-rich gas in the midplane orbits at a rate closer to true Keplerian
than the slower-moving dust-depleted gas above and below. A classical analysis
(neglecting the Coriolis force and differential rotation) predicts that
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability occurs when the Richardson number of the
stratified shear flow is below roughly one-quarter. However, earlier numerical
studies showed that the Coriolis force makes layers more unstable, whereas
horizontal shear may stabilize the layers. Simulations with a 3D spectral code
were used to investigate these opposing influences on the instability in order
to resolve whether such layers can ever reach the dense enough conditions for
the onset of gravitational instability. I confirm that the Coriolis force, in
the absence of radial shear, does indeed make dust layers more unstable,
however the instability sets in at high spatial wavenumber for thicker layers.
When radial shear is introduced, the onset of instability depends on the
amplitude of perturbations: small amplitude perturbations are sheared to high
wavenumber where further growth is damped; whereas larger amplitude
perturbations grow to magnitudes that disrupt the dust layer. However, this
critical amplitude decreases sharply for thinner, more unstable layers. In 3D
simulations of unstable layers, turbulence mixes the dust and gas, creating
thicker, more stable layers. I find that layers with minimum Richardson numbers
in the approximate range 0.2 -- 0.4 are stable in simulations with horizontal
shear.

  Processing and Networking for Dynamic Spectrum Access",,"10.1109/JSTSP.2007.914894",,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  In cognitive radio (CR) networks, there are scenarios where the secondary
(lower priority) users intend to communicate with each other by
opportunistically utilizing the transmit spectrum originally allocated to the
existing primary (higher priority) users. For such a scenario, a secondary user
usually has to trade off between two conflicting goals at the same time: one is
to maximize its own transmit throughput; and the other is to minimize the
amount of interference it produces at each primary receiver. In this paper, we
study this fundamental tradeoff from an information-theoretic perspective by
characterizing the secondary user's channel capacity under both its own
transmit-power constraint as well as a set of interference-power constraints
each imposed at one of the primary receivers. In particular, this paper
exploits multi-antennas at the secondary transmitter to effectively balance
between spatial multiplexing for the secondary transmission and interference
avoidance at the primary receivers. Convex optimization techniques are used to
design algorithms for the optimal secondary transmit spatial spectrum that
achieves the capacity of the secondary transmission. Suboptimal solutions for
ease of implementation are also presented and their performances are compared
with the optimal solution. Furthermore, algorithms developed for the
single-channel transmission are also extended to the case of multi-channel
transmission whereby the secondary user is able to achieve opportunistic
spectrum sharing via transmit adaptations not only in space, but in time and
frequency domains as well.

has since 1996 revealed several distinct high-frequency phenomena. Among these
are oscillations during thermonuclear (type-I) bursts, which (in addition to
persistent X-ray pulsations) are thought to trace the neutron star spin. Recent
discoveries bring the total number of measured LMXB spin rates to 22. An open
question is why the majority of the ~100 known neutron stars in LMXBs show
neither pulsations nor burst oscillations.
  Recent observations suggest that persistent pulsations may be more common
than previously thought, although detectable intermittently, and in some cases
at very low duty cycles. For example, the 377.3 Hz pulsations in HETE
J1900.1-2455 were only present in the first few months of it's outburst, and
have been absent since (although X-ray activity continues). Intermittent
(persistent) pulsations have since been detected in a further two sources. In
two of these three systems the pulsations appear to be related to the
thermonuclear burst activity, but in the third (Aql X-1) they are not. This
phenomenon offers new opportunities for spin measurements in known systems.
  Such measurements can constrain the poorly-known neutron star equation of
state, and neutron stars in LMXBs offer observational advantages over
rotation-powered pulsars which make the detection of more rapidly-spinning
examples more likely. Even so, spin rates of at least 50% faster than the
present maximum appear necessary to give constraints stringent enough to
discriminate between the various models. Although the future prospects for such
rapidly-spinning objects do not appear optimistic, several additional
observational approaches are possible for LMXBs.

undergo elastic collision but experience the same amplitude dependent

co-exist shape changing collision of bright solitons and elastic collision of

groups of different masses, as well as that of groups with the same mass but
with different colors. In agreement with previous studies, we find that more
massive groups are more strongly clustered, and the inferred mass dependence of
the halo bias is in good agreement with predictions for the $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology. Regarding the color dependence, we find that groups with red
centrals are more strongly clustered than groups of the same mass but with blue
centrals. Similar results are obtained when the color of a group is defined to
be the total color of its member galaxies. The color dependence is more
prominent in less massive groups and becomes insignificant in groups with
masses $\gta 10^{14}\msunh$. We construct a mock galaxy redshift survey
constructed from the large Millenium simulation that is populated with galaxies
according to the semi-analytical model of Croton et al. Applying our group
finder to this mock survey, and analyzing the mock data in exactly the same way

color dependencies of the halo bias in the model. This suggests that our group
finding algorithm and our method of assigning group masses do not induce
spurious mass and/or color dependencies in the group-galaxy correlation
function. The semi-analytical model reveals the same color dependence of the
halo bias as we find in our group catalogue. In halos with $M\sim

the Lagrangian and the Eulerian descriptions but is crucial for numerous
problems concerned with the interaction between a compliant wall and a viscous
fluid. A second aim of this work is to model the ultrasonic waves used in the
assessment of aortic aneurysms, and here we find that for this purpose the
half-space idealization is justified at high frequencies. A third goal is to
shed some light on the stability behaviour in compression of the solid
half-space, as compared with the situation in the absence of fluid; we find
that the usual technique of seeking standing waves solutions is not appropriate
when the half-space is in contact with a fluid; in fact, a correct analysis
reveals that the presence of a viscous fluid makes a compressed neo-Hookean
half-space slightly more stable. For a wave travelling in a direction of
principal strain, we obtain results for the case of a general (incompressible
isotropic) strain-energy function. For a wave travelling parallel to the

specialize the analysis to the neo-Hookean strain-energy function.

review the progress made in understanding the origin of the important

stellar activity may be responsible for the mismatch between observations and
theory through two different channels: inhibition of convection or effects of a
significant starspot coverage. The activity hypothesis is put to a test with
observational diagnostics and some of the consequences of the large starspot
coverage are evaluated. We conclude that stellar activity likely plays a key

be properly taken into account when investigating young, active stars in

non-LTE line formation and analysis of high-resolution (R ~60000 and 90000)

presented. An effective temperature was obtained from the Balmer Halpha and
Hbeta line wing fits, the surface gravity from the Hipparcos parallax if
available and the non-LTE ionization balance between Ca I and Ca II. Based on
the hyperfine structure affecting the Ba II resonance line, the fractional
abundance of the odd isotopes of Ba was derived for HD 84937 and HD 122563 from
a requirement that Ba abundances from the resonance line and subordinate lines
of Ba II must be equal. For each star, non-LTE leads to a consistency of Teff
from two Balmer lines and to a higher temperature compared to the LTE case, by
up to 60 K. Non-LTE effects are important in spectroscopic determination of
surface gravity from Ca I/Ca II. For each star with a known trigonometric
gravity, non-LTE abundances from the lines of two ionization stages agree
within the error bars, while a difference in the LTE abundances consists of
0.23 dex to 0.40 dex for different stars. Departures from LTE are found to be
significant for the investigated atoms, and they strongly depend on stellar
parameters. For HD 84937, the Eu/Ba ratio is consistent with the relative solar
system r-process abundances, and the fraction of the odd isotopes of Ba, f_odd,
equals 0.43+-0.14. The latter can serve as a constraint on r-process models.
The lower Eu/Ba ratio and f_odd = 0.22+-0.15 found for HD 122563 suggest that
the s-process or the unknown process has contributed significantly to the Ba
abundance in this star.

the physical nature of this variability. Spectra are analysed differentially
with respect to a simultaneously observed reference source in order to remove
Earth-atmospheric variations. The variability amplitude detected is typically
2-10%, depending on the source and wavelength. I analyse the data for
correlated variations between spectral indices. This approach is more robust
than single band or chisq analyses, because it does not assume an amplitude for
the (often uncertain) noise level (although the significance test still assumes
a shape for the noise power spectrum). Three of the four targets show
significant evidence for correlated variability. Some of this can be associated
with specific features including Fe, FeH, VO and KI, and there is good evidence
for intrinsic variability in water and possibly also methan. Yet some of this
variability covers a broader spectral range which would be consistent with dust
opacity variations. The underlying common cause is plausibly localized
temperature or composition fluctuations caused by convection. Looking at the
high signal-to-noise ratio stacked spectra we see many previously identified
spectral features of L and T dwarfs, such as KI, NaI, FeH, water and methane.

for the first time, the chemical pattern of the star's atmosphere. For metals a
pure LTE synthesis (ATLAS9 and SYNTHE) has been used, while for helium a hybrid
approach has been preferred (ATLAS9 and SYNSPEC). The principal result of our
study is that HD 145792 belongs to He strong class contrary to the previous
classification. Moreover, helium seems to be vertically stratified in the
atmosphere, decreasing toward deepest layers.
  For what that concerns metals abundances, we found the following:
overabundance of oxygen, neon, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur and calcium; carbon,
nitrogen, magnesium, aluminum, titanium, chromium and nickel are normal, being
the discrepancies from the solar values within the experimental errors; iron
resulted to be slightly underabundant.

simulation method, of the switching dynamics and stability of two models of
genetic toggle switches, consisting of two mutually-repressing genes encoding
transcription factors (TFs); in one model (the exclusive switch), they mutually
exclude each other's binding, while in the other model (general switch) the two
transcription factors can bind simultaneously to the shared operator region. We
assess the role of two pairs of reactions that influence the stability of these
switches: TF-TF homodimerisation and TF-DNA association/dissociation. We
factorise the flipping rate k into the product of the probability rho(q*) of
finding the system at the dividing surface (separatrix) between the two stable
states, and a kinetic prefactor R. In the case of the exclusive switch, the
rate of TF-operator binding affects both rho(q*) and R, while the rate of TF
dimerisation affects only R. In the case of the general switch both TF-operator
binding and TF dimerisation affect k, R and rho(q*). To elucidate this, we
analyse the transition state ensemble (TSE). For the exclusive switch, varying
the rate of TF-operator binding can drastically change the pathway of
switching, while changing the rate of dimerisation changes the switching rate
without altering the mechanism. The switching pathways of the general switch
are highly robust to changes in the rate constants of both TF-operator and
TF-TF binding, even though these rate constants do affect the flipping rate;
this feature is unique for non-equilibrium systems.

cyclotron waves in the plasma with a transverse density inhomogeneity was
studied. It was proven that the minimal model required to reproduce the
previous kinetic simulation results of E_{||} generation [Tsiklauri et al 2005,
Genot et al 2004] is the two-fluid, cold plasma approximation in the linear
regime. By considering the numerical solutions it was also shown that the cause
of E_{||} generation is the electron and ion flow separation induced by the
transverse density inhomogeneity. We also investigate how E_{||} generation is
affected by the mass ratio and found that amplitude attained by E_{||}
decreases linearly as inverse of the mass ratio m_i/m_e. For realistic mass
ratio of m_i/m_e=1836, such empirical scaling law, within a time corresponding
to 3 periods of the driving ion cyclotron wave, is producing E_{||}=14 Vm^{-1}
for solar coronal parameters. Increase in mass ratio does not have any effect
on final parallel (magnetic field aligned) speed attained by electrons.
However, parallel ion velocity decreases linearly with inverse of the mass
ratio m_i/m_e. These results can be interpreted as following: (i) ion dynamics
plays no role in the E_{||} generation; (ii) E_{||} \propto 1/m_i scaling is
caused by the fact that omega_d = 0.3 omega_{ci} \propto 1/m_i is decreasing
with the increase of ion mass, and hence the electron fluid can effectively
""short-circuit"" (recombine with) the slowly oscillating ions, hence producing
smaller E_{||}.

form factor data in e+e- annihilations and in tau decays. For this purpose, we
work in the framework of the Hidden Local Symmetry (HLS) Lagrangian and modify
the vector meson mass term by including the pion and kaon loop contributions.
This leads us to define the physical rho, omega and phi fields as linear
combinations of their ideal partners, with coefficients being meromorphic
functions of s, the square of the 4--momentum flowing into the vector meson
lines. This allows us to define a dynamical, i.e. s-dependent, vector meson
mixing scheme. The model is overconstrained by extending the framework in order
to include the description of all meson radiative (V P gamma and P gamma gamma
couplings) and leptonic (Ve+e- couplings) decays and also the isospin breaking
(omega/ phi --> pi+ pi-) decay modes. The model provides a simultaneous,
consistent and good description of the e+e- and tau dipion spectra. The
expression for pion form factor in the latter case is derived from those in the
former case by switching off the isospin breaking effects specific to e+e- and
switching on those for tau decays. Besides, the model also provides a good
account of all decay modes of the form V P gamma, Pgamma gamma as well as the
isospin breaking decay modes. It leads us to propose new reference values for
the rho^0 --> e+ e- and omega --> pi+ pi- partial widths which are part of our
description of the pion form factor. Other topics (phi --> K anti K, the rho
meson mass and width parameters) are briefly discussed. Therefore, we confirm
the 3.3 sigma discrepancy between the theoretical estimate of a_mu based on
e+e- and its direct BNL measurement.

of moving block bootstrap for non-stationary time series with periodic and
almost periodic structure. The parameter of the study is the mean value of the
expectation function. Consistency holds in quite general situations: if all
joint distributions of the series are periodic, then it suffices to assume the
central limit theorem and strong mixing property, together with summability of
the autocovariance function. In the case where the mean function is almost
periodic, we additionally need uniform boundedness of the fourth moments of the
root statistics. It is shown that these theoretical results can be applied in
statistical inference concerning the Fourier coefficients of periodically (PC)
and almost periodically (APC) correlated time series. A simulation example
shows how to use a graphical diagnostic test for significant frequencies and
stationarity within these classes of time series.

by molecular motors show finite diffusion in sliding motion even in the long
filament limit [Y. Imafuku et al., Biophys. J. 70 (1996) 878-886; N. Noda et
al., Biophys. 1 (2005) 45-53]. This anomalous fluctuation can be an evidence
for cooperativity among the motors in action because fluctuation should be
averaged out for a long filament if the action of each motor is independent. In
order to understand the nature of the fluctuation in molecular motors, we
perform numerical simulations and analyse velocity correlation in three
existing models that are known to show some kind of cooperativity and/or large
diffusion coefficient, i.e. Sekimoto-Tawada model [K. Sekimoto and K. Tawada,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 75 (1995) 180], Prost model [J. Prost et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
72 (1994) 2652], and Duke model [T. Duke, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 96 (1999)
2770]. It is shown that Prost model and Duke model do not give a finite
diffusion in the long filament limit in spite of collective action of motors.
On the other hand, Sekimoto-Tawada model has been shown to give the diffusion
coefficient that is independent of filament length, but it comes from the long
time correlation whose time scale is proportional to filament length, and our
simulations show that such a long correlation time conflicts with the
experimental time scales. We conclude that none of the three models do not
represent experimental findings. In order to explain the observed anomalous
diffusion, we have to seek for the mechanism that should allow both the
amplitude and the time scale of the velocity correlation to be independent of
the filament length.

regulatory network that is particularly sensitive to dynamical fluctuations: a
bistable genetic switch. We remove protein-DNA and/or protein-protein
association-dissociation reactions from the reaction set, using various
coarse-graining strategies. We determine the effects on the steady-state
probability distribution function and on the rate of fluctuation-driven switch
flipping transitions. We find that protein-protein interactions may be safely
eliminated from the reaction set, but protein-DNA interactions may not. We also
find that it is important to use the chemical master equation rather than

theta_{12} = 1/3. In the second part of the paper, we discuss implications of
deviations of initial flavor ratios from the usually assumed, idealized flavor
compositions for pion, muon-damped, and neutron beam sources, viz., (1 : 2 :
0), (0 : 1 : 0), and (1 : 0 : 0), respectively. We show that even small
deviations have significant consequences for the observed flavor ratios at
Earth. If initial flavor deviations are not taken into account in analyses,
then false inferences for the values in the PMNS matrix elements (angles and
phase) may result.

the number of emitted fluorescence photons is assumed to be proportional to the

the fluorescence yield in atmospheric gases excited by electrons over energies
ranging from keV to hundreds of MeV in several accelerators. We found that
within the measured energy ranges the proportionality holds at the level of few

of a complete Riemannian manifold, hold without any curvature restriction.

  American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine 26, 11 (2007) 1611-6",,,"cs.OH",,"  OBJECTIVE: The TER system is a robot-based tele-echography system allowing
remote ultrasound examination. The specialist moves a mock-up of the ultrasound
probe at the master site, and the robot reproduces the movements of the real
probe, which sends back ultrasound images and force feedback. This tool could
be used to perform ultrasound examinations in small health care centers or from
isolated sites. The objective of this study was to prove, under real
conditions, the feasibility and reliability of the TER system in detecting
abdominal aortic and iliac aneurysms. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients were
included in 2 centers in Brest and Grenoble, France. The remote examination was
compared with the reference standard, the bedside examination, for aorta and
iliac artery diameter measurement, detection and description of aneurysms,
detection of atheromatosis, the duration of the examination, and acceptability.
RESULTS: All aneurysms (8) were detected by both techniques as intramural
thrombosis and extension to the iliac arteries. The interobserver correlation
coefficient was 0.982 (P < .0001) for aortic diameters. The rate of concordance
between 2 operators in evaluating atheromatosis was 84% +/- 11% (95% confidence
interval). CONCLUSIONS: Our study on 58 patients suggests that the TER system
could be a reliable, acceptable, and effective robot-based system for
performing remote abdominal aortic ultrasound examinations. Research is
continuing to improve the equipment for general abdominal use.

increasing with decreasing $T_c$ values. The coherence peaks are asymmetric
with the peaks at the filled states being larger than those at the empty ones.
The asymmetry increases with decreasing $T_c$. The observed asymmetry and its
$T_c$ dependence can be explained by considering the Mott insulating nature of
the material at the undoped state.
