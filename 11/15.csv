an important clue for their origin. Recent measurements of the elongation rates
by the Pierre Auger Observatory hint at the possible presence of heavy or
intermediate mass nuclei in the UHE cosmic rays. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and
hypernovae have been suggested as possible sources of the UHE cosmic rays. Here
we derive the constraints on the physical conditions under which UHE heavy
nuclei, if they are accelerated in these sources, can survive in their intense
photon fields. We find that in the GRB external shock and in the hypernova
scenarios, UHE nuclei can easily survive photo-disintegration. In the GRB
internal shock scenario, UHE nuclei can also survive, provided the dissipation
radius and/or the bulk Lorentz factor of the relativistic outflow are
relatively large, or if the low-energy self-absorption break in the photon
spectrum of the prompt emission occurs above several KeV. In internal shocks
and in the other scenarios, intermediate-mass UHE nuclei have a higher
probability of survival against photo-disintegration than UHE heavy nuclei such
as Fe.

address the question of what top-mass can be measured from reconstruction. The
production process is characterized by well separated scales: the
center-of-mass energy, Q, the top mass, m, the top decay width, Gamma_t, and
also LambdaQCD; scales which can be disentangled with effective theory methods.
In particular we show how the mass measurement depends on the way in which soft
radiation is treated, and that this can shift the mass peak by an amount of
order Q LambdaQCD/m. We sum large logs for Q >> m >> Gamma_t > LambdaQCD and
demonstrate that the renormalization group ties together the jet and soft
interactions below the scale m. Necessary conditions for the invariant mass
spectrum to be protected from large logs are formulated. Results for the
cross-section are presented at next-to-leading order with next-to-leading-log
resummation, for invariant masses in the peak region and the tail region. Using
our results we also predict the thrust distribution for massive quark jets at
NLL order for large thrust. We demonstrate that soft radiation can be precisely
controlled using data on massless jet production, and that in principle, a
short distance mass parameter can be measured using jets with precision better
than LambdaQCD.

high values of the utility derived from the system's controlled state but
penalises any expenditure of control effort. This problem has been motivated by
applications such as the so-called goodwill problem in which the system's state

expenditure is associated with raising the product's image, e.g., through
advertising. We obtain the solution to the optimisation problem that we
consider in a closed analytic form under rather general assumptions. Also, our
analysis establishes a number of results that are concerned with analytic as
well as probabilistic expressions for the first derivative of the solution to a
second order linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation. These
results have independent interest and can potentially be of use to the solution
of other one-dimensional stochastic control problems.

number of events required to reject isotropy and detect a WIMP signal using a

correctly, 3-d read-out and zero background, we find that as the probability is
decreased from 1.0 to 0.75 the number of events required to reject isotropy
using the mean angle statistic is increased by a factor of a few. As the
probability is decreased further the number of events required using this
statistic increases sharply, and in fact isotropy can be rejected more easily
by discarding the sense information and using axial statistics. This however
requires an order of magnitude more events than vectorial data with perfect
sense determination. We also consider energy dependent probabilities of
correctly measuring the sense, 2-d read-out and non-zero background. Our main
conclusion regarding the sense determination is that correctly determining the
sense of the abundant, but less anisotropic, low energy recoils is most
important for minimising the number of events required.

M_{kl}]=[M_{kj}, M_{il}]$ (e.g. $[M_{11}, M_{22}]=[M_{21}, M_{12}]$). We claim
that such matrices behave almost as well as matrices with commutative elements.
Namely theorems of linear algebra (e.g., a natural definition of the
determinant, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, the Newton identities and so on and
so forth) holds true for them.
  On the other hand, we remark that such matrices are somewhat ubiquitous in
the theory of quantum integrability. For instance, Manin matrices (and their
q-analogs) include matrices satisfying the Yang-Baxter relation ""RTT=TTR"" and
the so--called Cartier-Foata matrices. Also, they enter Talalaev's

have various applications to quantum integrable systems and Lie algebras, e.g
in the construction of new generators in $Z(U(\hat{gl_n}))$ (and, in general,

Previous studies of PG 1159-035 photometric data obtained with the Whole Earth
Telescope (WET) showed a rich frequency spectrum allowing the identification of
122 pulsation modes. In this work, we used all available WET photometric data
from 1983, 1985, 1989, 1993 and 2002 to identify the pulsation periods and
identified 76 additional pulsation modes, increasing to 198 the number of known
pulsation modes in PG 1159-035, the largest number of modes detected in any
star besides the Sun. From the period spacing we estimated a mass M = 0.59 +/-
0.02 solar masses for PG 1159-035, with the uncertainty dominated by the
models, not the observation. Deviations in the regular period spacing suggest
that some of the pulsation modes are trapped, even though the star is a
pre-white dwarf and the gravitational settling is ongoing. The position of the
transition zone that causes the mode trapping was calculated at r_c = 0.83 +/-
0.05 stellar radius. From the multiplet splitting, we calculated the rotational
period P_rot = 1.3920 +/- 0.0008 days and an upper limit for the magnetic
field, B < 2000 G. The total power of the pulsation modes at the stellar
surface changed less than 30% for l=1 modes and less than 50% for l=2 modes. We
find no evidence of linear combinations between the 198 pulsation mode
frequencies. PG 1159-035 models have not significative convection zones,
supporting the hypothesis that nonlinearity arises in the convection zones in

Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. AIMS: The discovery of a second PN candidate,
associated with one of the 5 globular clusters in the Fornax dwarf, is
reported. METHODS: Spectra of the globular cluster H5, obtained with the UVES
echelle spectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope, show [O III] line
emission at a radial velocity consistent with membership of the Fornax dwarf. A
possible counterpart of the [O III] emission is identified in archival images
from the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on board the Hubble Space Telescope. The
source of the emission is located about 1.5"" (less than one core radius)
southwest of the centre of the cluster. RESULTS: The emission line source is
identified as a likely PN, albeit with several peculiar properties. No Hbeta,
He I, or He II line emission is detected and the [O III]/Hbeta ratio is >25 (2
sigma). The expansion velocity inferred from the [O III] 5007 AA line is about
55 km/s, which is large for a PN. The diameter measured on the HST images is
about 0.23"" or 0.15 pc at the distance of the Fornax dSph. CONCLUSIONS: This
object doubles the number of known PNe in Fornax, and is only the 5th PN
associated with an old GC for which direct imaging is available. It may be a
member of the rare class of extremely H-deficient PNe, the second such case
found in a GC.

linear stochastic model with additive Gaussian white noise is studied.
Fluctuation theorems for nonequilibrium steady-states provide a constraint on
the character of these fluctuations. The properties of the fluctuations which
are unconstrained by the fluctuation theorem are investigated and related to
the model parameters. The irreversibility of trajectory segments, which
satisfies a fluctuation theorem, is used as a measure of nonequilibrium
fluctuations. The moments of the irreversibility probability density function
(pdf) are found and the pdf is seen to be non-Gaussian. The average
irreversibility goes to zero for short and long trajectory segments and has a
maximum for some finite segment length, which defines a characteristic
timescale of the fluctuations. The initial average irreversibility growth rate
is equal to the average entropy production and is related to
noise-amplification. For systems with a separation of deterministic timescales,
modes with timescales much shorter than the trajectory timespan and whose noise
amplitudes are not asymptotically large, do not, to first order, contribute to
the irreversibility statistics, providing a potential basis for dimensional
reduction.

hydrogen burning occurs later than currently predicted. We also show that the
large number of the luminous blue supergiants observed in the fields are
unlikely to have directly evolved from main-sequence massive O-type stars as
neither their low rotational velocities or position on the H-R diagram are
predicted. We suggest that blue-loops or mass-transfer binary systems may
populate the blue supergiant regime. By comparing the rotational velocity
distributions of the Magellanic Cloud stars to a similar Galactic sample we
find that (at 3sigma confidence level) massive stars (above 8Msun) in the SMC
rotate faster than those in the solar neighbourhood. However there appears to
be no significant difference between the rotational velocity distributions in
the Galaxy and the LMC. We find that the vsini distributions in the SMC and LMC
can modelled with an intrinsic rotational velocity distribution which is a
Gaussian peaking at 175km/s (SMC) and 100km/s (LMC). We find that in NGC346 in
the SMC, the 10-25Msun main-sequence stars appear to rotate faster than their
higher mass counterparts. Recently Yoon et al. (2006) have determined rates of
GRBs by modelling rapidly rotating massive star progenitors. Our measured
rotational velocity distribution for the 10-25Msun stars is peaked at slightly
higher velocities than they assume, supporting the idea that GRBs could come
from rapid rotators with initial masses as low as 14Msun at low metallicities.

rotational mixing, have been generated attempting to reproduce these
observations by adjusting the overshooting and rotational mixing parameters and
produce reasonable agreement with 60% of our core hydrogen burning sample. We
find (excluding known binaries) a significant population of highly nitrogen
enriched intrinsic slow rotators vsini less than 50km/s incompatible with our

since Michell and Laplace's proposal that a gravitating object could exist from

their structure would be far richer than originally imagined. Today,
astronomical observations strongly suggest that either black holes, or objects
with similar properties, not only exist but may well be abundant in our
universe. In light of this, black hole research is now not only motivated by
the fascinating theoretical properties such objects must possess but also as an
attempt to better understand the universe around us. We review here some
selected developments in black hole research, from a review of its early
history to current topics in black hole physics research. Black holes have been

arena to test predictions of candidate theories of quantum gravity. We will

analysis shows that OH and H_2O are radiatively pumped by the far-infrared
continuum emission of the galaxy. The absorptions in the high-excitation lines
require high far-infrared radiation densities, allowing us to constrain the
properties of the underlying continuum source. The bulk of the far-infrared
continuum arises from a warm (T_dust=70-100 K), optically thick
(tau_100micron=1-2) medium of effective diameter 200-400 pc. In our best-fit
model of total luminosity L_IR, the observed OH and H2O high-lying lines arise
from a luminous (L/L_IR~0.56) region with radius ~100 pc. The high surface
brightness of this component suggests that its infrared emission is dominated
by the AGN. The derived column densities N(OH)>~10^{17} cm^{-2} and
N(H_2O)>~6x10^{16} cm^{-2} may indicate XDR chemistry, although significant
starburst chemistry cannot be ruled out. The lower-lying OH, [C II] 158 micron,
and [O I] 63 micron lines arise from a more extended (~350 pc) starburst
region. We show that the [C II] deficit in Mkn 231 is compatible with a high
average abundance of C+ because of an extreme overall luminosity to gas mass
ratio. Therefore, a [C II] deficit may indicate a significant contribution to
the luminosity by an AGN, and/or by extremely efficient star formation.

formation of antihydrogens at CERN and Fermilab have raised basic questions
about possible coexistence of matter and antimatter in nature. In the present
work, previous mathematical considerations are revisited which support the
possible coexistence of Antihydrogen with Hydrogen, Deuterium and Tritium
atoms. In particular, the main objective of the present work is to present
computational treatments which confirm the possible formation of these quasi
molecules in laboratory. These treatments are based on a nonadiabatic picture
of the system in which generalized basis functions are adjusted within the
framework of Rayleigh-Ritz' variational method. Thus, it is ruled out in the
present work the Born-Oppenheimer adiabatic picture of the system, which
demands the existence of bound states composed of fixed quasi heavy atoms
(containing at least two baryons, e.g. protonium (Pn), with mean lifetime
1.0x10^^-6 s) and quasi light atoms (composed of two leptons, e.g. positronium
(Ps), with mean lifetime 125x10^^-12 s for para-Ps and 142.05x10^^-9 s for
ortho-Ps). Our calculations of the binding energies and internal structure of
Antihydrogen-Hydrogen, Antihydrogen-Deuterium and Antihydrogen-Tritium show
that these quasi molecules are bound and could be formed in nature. On the
other hand, having in mind the adiabatic picture of the systems, our results
suggest the possible formation of these molecules as resonant states in
Antihydrogen-Atom interaction. Nevertheless, several arguments are accumulated
in the conclusion as consequences of the proposed bound states.

star formation in order to reproduce the observed shape of the luminosity
function of bright galaxies. To accomplish this, current models invoke heating
from supernovae, and energy injection from active galactic nuclei. However,
observations of radio-loud active galactic nuclei suggest that their feedback
is likely to not be as efficient as required, signaling the need for additional
heating processes. We propose the self-annihilation of weakly interacting
massive particles that constitute dark matter as a steady source of heating. In
this paper, we explore the circumstances under which this process may provide
the required energy input. To do so, dark matter annihilations are incorporated
into a galaxy formation model within the Millennium cosmological simulation.
Energy input from self-annihilation can compensate for all the required gas
cooling and reproduce the observed galaxy luminosity function only for what
appear to be extreme values of the relevant key parameters. The key parameters
are: the slope of the inner density profile of dark matter haloes and the outer
spike radius. The inner density profile needs to be steepened to slopes of -1.5
or more and the outer spike radius needs to extend to a few tens of parsecs on
galaxy scales and a kpc or so on cluster scales. If neutralinos or any thermal
relic WIMP with s-wave annihilation constitute dark matter, their
self-annihilation is inevitable and could provide enough power to modulate
galaxy formation. Energy from self-annihilating WIMPs could be yet another
piece of the feedback puzzle along with supernovae and active galactic nuclei.

  Planets with Application to HD 209458b","8 pages, 4 figures; Submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present a new technique for detecting scattered starlight from transiting,
close-orbiting extrasolar giant planets (CEGPs) that has the virtues of
simplicity, robustness, linearity, and model-independence. Given a series of
stellar spectra obtained over various phases of the planetary orbit, the goal
is to measure the strength of the component scattered by the planet relative to
the component coming directly from the star. We use two complementary
strategies, both of which rely on the predictable Doppler shifts of both
components and on combining the results from many spectral lines and many
exposures. In the first strategy, we identify segments of the stellar spectrum
that are free of direct absorption lines and add them after Doppler-shifting
into the planetary frame. In the second strategy, we compare the distribution
of equivalent-width ratios of the scattered and direct components. Both
strategies are calibrated with a ``null test'' in which scrambled Doppler
shifts are applied to the spectral segments. As an illustrative test case, we
apply our technique to spectra of HD 209458 taken when the planet was near
opposition (with orbital phases ranging from 11 to 34$\arcdeg$, where
0$\arcdeg$ is at opposition), finding that the planet-to-star flux ratio is
$(1.4 \pm 2.9)\times10^{-4}$ in the wavelength range 554$-$681 nm. This
corresponds to a geometric albedo of $0.8 \pm 1.6$, assuming the phase function
of a Lambert sphere. Although the result is not statistically significant, the
achieved sensitivity and relatively small volume of data upon which it is based
are very encouraging for future ground-based spectroscopic studies of scattered
light from transiting CEGP systems.

cosmic variance. Taking into account all galaxies -with or without emission

anomalous kinematics, i.e., they are not dynamically relaxed. This includes
26+/-7% of distant galaxies with complex kinematics, i.e., they are not simply

infinitely large networks that selects for canalizing Boolean functions is
broken in the evolutionary dynamics of finite size networks. In finite size
networks there is an additional selection for input inverting Boolean functions
that output a value opposite to the majority of input values. These results are
revealed through an empirical study of the model that calculates the frequency
of occurrence of the different possible Boolean functions. Classes of functions
are found to occur with the same frequency. Those classes depend on the
symmetry of the evolutionary dynamics and correspond to orbits of the relevant
symmetry group. The empirical results match analytic results, determined by
utilizing Polya's theorem, for the number of orbits expected in both finite
size and infinitely large networks. The reason for the symmetry breaking in the
evolutionary dynamics is found to be due to the need for nodes in finite size
networks to behave differently in order to cooperate so that the system
collectively performs as well as possible. The results suggest that both finite
size effects and symmetry are important for understanding the evolution of
real-world complex networks, including genetic regulatory networks.

suggested as possible evidence for a violation of statistical isotropy on large
scales. In any physical model for broken isotropy, there are testable
consequences for the CMB polarization field. We develop simulation tools for
predicting the polarization field in models that break statistical isotropy
locally through a modulation field. We study two different models: dipolar
modulation, invoked to explain the asymmetry in power between northern and
southern ecliptic hemispheres, and quadrupolar modulation, posited to explain
the alignments between the quadrupole and octopole. For the dipolar case, we
show that predictions for the correlation between the first 10 multipoles of
the temperature and polarization fields can typically be tested at better than
the 98% CL. For the quadrupolar case, we show that the polarization quadrupole
and octopole should be moderately aligned. Such an alignment is a generic
prediction of explanations which involve the temperature field at recombination
and thus discriminate against explanations involving foregrounds or local
secondary anisotropy. Predicted correlations between temperature and
polarization multipoles out to l = 5 provide tests at the ~ 99% CL or stronger
for quadrupolar models that make the temperature alignment more than a few
percent likely. As predictions of anomaly models, polarization statistics move
beyond the a posteriori inferences that currently dominate the field.

  Vol. 119, No.4",,"10.1143/PTP.119.515",,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  Physical and chemical stochastic processes described by the master equation
are investigated. In this paper, we examine the entropy production both for the
master equation and for the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. For the
master equation, the exact expression of the entropy production was recently
derived by Gaspard using the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy ({\em J.Stat.Phys.},
\textbf{117} (2004), 599; [Errata; \textbf{126} (2006), 1109 ]). Although
Gaspard's expression is derived from a stochastic consideration, it should be
noted that Gaspard's expression conincides with the thermodynamical expression.
For the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, by using the detailed imbalance
relation which appears in the derivation process of the fluctuation theorem
through the Onsger-Machlup theory, the entropy production is expressed in terms
of the {\em irreversible circulation of fluctuation}, which was proposed by
Tomita and Tomita ({\em Prog.Theor.Phys.}, \textbf{51} (1974), 1731). However,
this expression for the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation differs from that
of the entropy production for the master equation. This discrepancy is due to
the difference between the master equation and the corresponding Fokker-Planck
equation, namely the former treats discrete events, but the latter equation is
an approximation of the former one. In fact, in the latter equation, the
original discrete events are smoothed out. To overcome this difficulty, we
propose the {\em path weight principle}. By using this principle, the modified
expression of the entropy production for the corresponding Fokker-Planck
equation coincides with that of the master equation (i.e., the thermodynamical
expression) for a simple chemical reaction system and a diffusion system.

investigate a few basic features of galaxy structure using this image. These
include: (1) The agreement of visual eye-ball classifications and
non-parametric quantitative (CAS, Gini/M_20) methods; (2) How distant galaxy
quantitative structures can vary as a function of rest-frame wavelength; and
(3) The evolution of distant galaxy structures up to z~3. One of our major
conclusions is that the majority of galaxies with z_850 < 27 are peculiar in
appearance, and that galaxy assembly is rapidly occurring at these magnitudes,
even up to the present time. We find a general agreement between galaxy
classification by eye and through quantitative methods, as well as a general
agreement between the CAS and the Gini/M_20 parameters. We find that the
Gini/M_20 method appears to find a larger number of galaxy mergers than the CAS
system, but contains a larger contamination from non-mergers. We furthermore
calculate the merger rate of galaxies in the UDF up to z~3, finding an increase
with redshift as well as stellar mass, confirming previous work in the Hubble

formation is the loss of the cores into the star by Type-I migration, due to
the tidal interactions with the gas disk. It has been shown that a steep
surface-density gradient in the disk, such as the one expected at the boundary
between an active and a dead zone, acts as a planet trap and prevents isolated
cores from migrating down to the central star. We study the relevance of the
planet trap concept for the accretion and evolution of systems of multiple
planetary embryos/cores. We performed hydrodynamical simulations of the
evolution of systems of multiple massive objects in the vicinity of a planet
trap. The planetary embryos evolve in 3 dimensions, whereas the disk is modeled
with a 2D grid. Synthetic forces are applied onto the embryos to mimic the
damping effect that the disk has on their inclinations. Systems with two
embryos tend to acquire stable, separated and non-migrating orbits, with the
more massive embryo placed at the planet trap and the lighter one farther out
in the disk. Systems of multiple embryos are intrinsically unstable.
Consequently, a long phase of mutual scattering can lead to accreting
collisions among embryos; some embryos are injected into the inner part of the
disk, where they can be evacuated into the star by Type I migration. The system
can resume a stable, non-migrating configuration only when the number of
surviving embryos decreases to a small value (~2-4). This can explain the
limited number of giant planets in our solar system. These results should apply
in general to any case in which the Type-I migration of the inner embryo is
prevented by some mechanism, and not solely to the planet trap scenario.

effects on spatial damping of small-amplitude non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic
waves in a homogeneous, isothermal, and unbounded prominence plasma. Methods.
We model the typical feature of observed damped oscillatory motion in
prominences, removing the adiabaticity assumption through thermal conduction,
radiation and heating. Invoking steady flow in MHD equations, we linearise them
under small-amplitude approximation and obtain a new general dispersion
relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves in prominences Results.
The presence of steady flow breaks the symmetry of forward and backward
propagating MHD wave modes in prominences. The steady flow has dramatic
influence on the propagation and damping of magnetoacoustic and thermal waves.
Depending upon the direction and strength of flow the magnetoacoustic and
thermal modes can show both the features of wave amplification and damping. At
the wave period of 5 min where the photospheric power is maximum, the slow mode
shows wave amplification. However, in the absence of steady flow the slow mode
wave shows damping. Conclusions. For the wave period between 5 min and 15 min,
the amplification length for slow mode, in the case of prominence regime 1.1,
varies between 3.4*10^11 m to 2*10^12 m. Dramatic influence of steady flow on
small-amplitude prominence oscillations is likely to play an important role in
both wave detection and prominence seismology.

samples in two fields are restricted with bright and unit absolute magnitude
intervals, (4,5], and (5,6], whereas for the third field a larger absolute
magnitude interval is adopted, (4,10]. The limiting apparent magnitudes of star
samples are g=15 and g=22.5 mag which provide space densities within distances
in the line of sight 0.9 and 25 kpc. The Galactic model parameters for the thin
disc are not volume dependent. However, the ones for thick disc and halo do
show spectacular trends in their variations with volume, except for the
scalelength of the thick disc. The local space density of the thick disc
increases, whereas the scaleheight of the same Galactic component decreases
monotonically. However, both model parameters approach asymptotic values at
large distances. The axial ratio of the halo increases abruptly for the volumes
where thick disc is dominant, whereas it approaches an asymptotic value
gradually for larger volumes, indicating a continuous transition from disclike
structure to a spherical one at the outermost region of the Galaxy. The
variation of the Galactic model parameters with absolute magnitude can be
explained by their dependence on the stellar luminosity, whereas the variation
with volume and Galactic longitude at short distances is a bias in analysis.

properties like the evolution of concurrence, entanglement entropy, nonanalytic
behaviours and the scaling close to the quantum critical point of the model.
Both the concurrence and the entanglement entropy develop two saturated values
after enough iterations of the renormalization of coupling constants. This
values are associated with the two different phases, i.e Neel and spin liquid
phases. The nonanalytic behaviour comes from the divergence of the first
derivative of both measures of entanglement as the size of system becomes
large. The renormalization scheme demonstrates how the minimum value of the
first derivative and its position scales with an exponent of the system size.
It is shown that this exponent is directly related to the critical properties
of the model, i.e. the exponent governing the divergence of the correlation
length close to the quantum critical point. We also use a renormalization
method based on the quantum group concept in order to get more insight about
the critical properties of the model and the renormalization of entanglement.

obtained, taking two line indices (Hbeta and [MgFe]) and two colours (e.g., u-R
and R-K), respectively. Some relations for linking the stellar-population
parameters obtained by ssSSPs to those obtained by binary-star stellar
populations (bsSSPs) are presented in the work. This can help us to get some
absolute values for stellar-population parameters and is useful for absolute
studies. However, it is found that the relative luminosity-weighted stellar
ages and metallicities obtained via ssSSPs and bsSSPs are similar. This
suggests that ssSSPs can be used for most stellar population studies, except in
some special cases.

and its spatial variations in the local ISM from CH+ absorption lines in the
optical towards early-type stars. The aim is to determine the average value for
the local ISM and study possible spatial variations. We observed a large number
of early-type stars with Feros to extend the sample of suitable target stars
for CH+ isotope studies. The best suited targets were observed with Uves with
higher signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution to determine the isotope
ratio from the interstellar CH+ lines. This study significantly expands the
number of 13CH+ detections. We find an average ratio of <R> = 76.27 +- 1.94 or,
for f = 1/R, <f> = (120.46 +- 3.02) 10^{-4}. The scatter in f is 6.3

the local ISM, with important implications for the mixing in the ISM. Given the
large scatter, the present-day value in the ISM is not significantly larger
than the solar value, which corresponds to the local value 4.5 Gyr ago.

interest in electronic signal transmission or in some astrophysical
applications, the dynamics of the electrons is certainly affected by the
quantum effects. Thus, the dispersion relation for the surface wave on a
quantum electron plasma half-space is derived by employing the quantum
hydrodynamical (QHD) and Maxwell-Poison equations. The QHD include quantum
forces involving the Fermi electron temperature and the quantum Bohm potential.

by internal shocks within a relativistic unsteady outflow. The recent detection
of prompt optical emission accompanying the prompt gamma-ray emission appears
to be inconsistent with this model since the out flowing plasma is expected to
be highly optically thick to optical photons. We show here that fluctuations in
flow properties on short, ~ 1 ms, time scale, which drive the gamma-ray
producing collisions at small radii, are expected to lead to ""residual""
collisions at much larger radii, where the optical depth to optical photons is
low. The late residual collisions naturally account for the relatively bright
optical emission. The apparent simultaneity of gamma-ray and optical emission
is due to the highly relativistic speed with which the plasma expands. Residual
collisions may also account for the X-ray emission during the early ""steep
decline"" phase, where the radius is inferred to be larger than the gamma-ray
emission radius. Finally, we point out that inverse-Compton emission from
residual collisions at large radii is expected to contribute significantly to
the emission at high energy, and may therefore ""smear"" the pair production
spectral cut-off.

chain. We obtain a bound on the error between the distribution of the number of
occurrences of a word in a sequence (under a Markov model) and its Poisson
approximation. A global bound is already given by a Chen-Stein method. Our
approach, the psi-mixing method, gives local bounds. Since we only need the
error in the tails of distribution, the global uniform bound of Chen-Stein is
too large and it is a better way to consider local bounds. We search for two
thresholds on the number of occurrences from which we can regard the studied
word as an over-represented or an under-represented one. A biological role is
suggested for these over- or under-represented words. Our method gives such
thresholds for a panel of words much broader than the Chen-Stein method.

there are directions with the deflection angle below $1^{\circ}$. One of these
directions is toward Centaurus A, the nearest radio-loud active galactic nuclei

protons arriving from the direction of the anti-Galactic center are less

correlation with sources. The dependence on model parameters is also
investigated. The deflection angles of UHE protons are dependent on the pitch
angle of the spiral field. We also investigate distortion of the supergalactic

an exponentially-sized space of TSP tours, each of which approximates the

discrete weights full synchronization is achieved in a finite number of steps.
Additional networks can be trained by using the inputs and outputs generated
during this process as examples. Several learning rules for both tasks are
presented and analyzed. In the case of Tree Parity Machines synchronization is
much faster than learning. Scaling laws for the number of steps needed for full
synchronization and successful learning are derived using analytical models.
They indicate that the difference between both processes can be controlled by
changing the synaptic depth. In the case of bidirectional interaction the
synchronization time increases proportional to the square of this parameter,
but it grows exponentially, if information is transmitted in one direction
only. Because of this effect neural synchronization can be used to construct a
cryptographic key-exchange protocol. Here the partners benefit from mutual
interaction, so that a passive attacker is usually unable to learn the
generated key in time. The success probabilities of different attack methods
are determined by numerical simulations and scaling laws are derived from the
data. They show that the partners can reach any desired level of security by
just increasing the synaptic depth. Then the complexity of a successful attack
grows exponentially, but there is only a polynomial increase of the effort
needed to generate a key. Further improvements of security are possible by
replacing the random inputs with queries generated by the partners.

passage through small capillary vessels. The human monocytic THP-1 cell line
was used to explore the metabolic dependence of these shape changes. Cells were
aspirated into micropipettes for determination of the rate of protrusion
formation. They were then released and the kinetics of morphological recovery
was studied. Results were consistent with Evans' model (Blood, 64 : 1028, 1984)
of a viscous liquid droplet surrounded by a tensile membrane. The estimated
values of cytoplasmic viscosity and membrane tension were 162 Pa.s and 0.0142
millinewton/m respectively. The influence of metabolic inhibitors on cell
mechanical behaviour was then studied : results strongly suggested that
deformation involved two sequential phases. The cell elongation rate measured
during the first 30 seconds following the onset of aspiration was unaffected by
azide, an inhibitor of energy production, and it was about doubled by
cytochalasin D, a microfilament inhibitor, and colchicine, a microtubule
inhibitor. However, during the following two minutes, deformation was almost
abolished in cells treated with azide and cytochalasin D, whereas the
protrusion of control cells exhibited about threefold length increase. It is
concluded that, although cells seemed to deform as passive objects, active
metabolic processes were required to allow extensive morphological changes
triggered by external forces.

by observations. Little is known about their emission mechanism. Large vacuum
gaps probably exist, and a non-neutral plasma partially fills the neutron star
surroundings to form an electrosphere. We showed that the differentially
rotating equatorial disk in the pulsar's electrosphere is diocotron unstable
and that it tends to stabilise when relativistic effects are included. However,
when approaching the light cylinder, particle inertia becomes significant and
the electric drift approximation is violated. In this paper, we study the most
general instability, i.e. by including particle inertia effects, as well as
relativistic motions. This general non-neutral plasma instability is called the
magnetron instability. We linearise the coupled relativistic cold-fluid and
Maxwell equations. The non-linear eigenvalue problem for the perturbed
azimuthal electric field component is solved numerically. The spectrum of the
magnetron instability in a non-neutral plasma column confined between two
cylindrically conducting walls is computed for several cylindrical
configurations. For a pulsar electrosphere, no outer wall exists. In this case,
we allow for electromagnetic wave emission propagating to infinity. When the
self-field induced by the plasma becomes significant, it can first increase the
growth rate of the magnetron instability. However, equilibrium solutions are
only possible when the self-electric field, measured by the parameter $s_{\rm
e}$ and tending to disrupt the plasma configuration, is bounded to an upper
limit, $s_{\rm e,max}$. For $s_{\rm e}$ close to but smaller than this value
$s_{\rm e,max}$, the instability becomes weaker or can be suppressed as was the
case in the diocotron regime.

  G. Chabrier edited by Cambridge University Press, 2008",,,,"astro-ph",,"  (Abridged) The formation of molecular clouds (MCs) from the diffuse
interstellar gas appears to be a necessary step for star formation, as young
stars invariably occur within them. However, the mechanisms controlling the
formation of MCs remain controversial. In this contribution, we focus on their
formation in compressive flows driven by interstellar turbulence and
large-scale gravitational instability. Turbulent compression driven by
supernovae appears insufficient to explain the bulk of cloud and star
formation. Rather, gravity must be important at all scales, driving the
compressive flows that form both clouds and cores. Cooling and thermal
instability allow the formation of dense gas out of moderate, transonic
compressions in the warm diffuse gas, and drive turbulence into the dense
clouds. MCs may be produced by an overshoot beyond the thermal-pressure
equilibrium between the cold and warm phases of atomic gas, caused by some
combination of the ram pressure of compression and the self-gravity of the
compressed gas. In this case, properties of the clouds such as their mass,
mass-to-magnetic flux ratio, and total kinetic and gravitational energies are
in general time-variable quantities. MCs may never enter a quasi-equilibrium or
virial equilibrium state but rather continuously collapse to stars.

measuring the alignment of the angular momentum of subhalos in a group. We find
that this signal is visible even for objects accreted up to $z \sim 1$, i.e. 8

the host tidal field. This group infall may well explain the ghostly streams

non-random assignment of satellites to subhalos implies an environmental
dependence on whether these low-mass objects are able to form stars, possibly

charge states (mimicking a particle-hole pair) where the coupling between the
states is determined by the non-Abelian parameter, namely the difference
between the two components of the ""magnetic flux."" A key feature of the
non-Abelian system is a splitting of the Landau energy levels, which broaden
into bands, as the spectrum depends explicitly on the transverse momentum.
These Landau bands result in a coarse-grained ""moth,"" a continuum version of
the generalized Hofstadter butterfly. Furthermore, the bands overlap, leading
to effective relativistic effects. Importantly, similar features also
characterize the corresponding two-dimensional lattice problem when at least

possibility of inducing localization by varying the quasimomentum, and the
absence of localization of certain zero-energy states exhibiting a linear

means that if $f=(f_1,..., f_m)$ defines a complete intersection, then the
classical Coleff-Herrera product associated to $f$ is the unique Coleff-Herrera
current that is cohomologous to 1 with respect to the operator
$\delta_f-\dbar$, where $\delta_f$ is interior multiplication with $f$. From
the uniqueness result we deduce that any Coleff-Herrera current on a variety
$Z$ is a finite sum of products of residue currents with support on $Z$ and
holomorphic forms.

edge distribution of its associated graph is investigated. First, it is shown
that adding one edge to a cycle definitely decreases the network
sychronizability. Then, since sometimes the synchronizability can be enhanced
by changing the network structure, the question of whether the networks with
more edges are easier to synchronize is addressed. It is shown by examples that
the answer is negative. This reveals that generally there are redundant edges
in a network, which not only make no contributions to synchronization but
actually may reduce the synchronizability. Moreover, an example shows that the
node betweenness centrality is not always a good indicator for the network
synchronizability. Finally, some more examples are presented to illustrate how
the network synchronizability varies following the addition of edges, where all
the examples show that the network synchronizability globally increases but
locally fluctuates as the number of added edges increases.

and abelian schemes. The main result shows that the polylogarithm on the
abelian scheme can be obtained as the push-forward of the polylogarithm on a
suitable sub-curve. If the abelian scheme is the Jacobian of a smooth
projective curve, this push-forward can also be written as a cup-product with
the fundamental class of the curve.

presenting an embedding of lexicalized tree adjoining grammars into the

paper will remain useful for all lecturers or Ph.D. students who face the task
of introducing (resp. learning) some basic concepts in quantum gravity in a
relatively short time. In the second part, we outline selected topics such as
the braneworld picture with the same covariant formalism of the first part, and
spectral asymptotics of Euclidean quantum gravity with diffeomorphism-invariant
boundary conditions. The latter might have implications for singularity
avoidance in quantum cosmology.

is expressed in the conjugate variable representation and solved numerically by
wave packet propagation. Both cases are then cast into systems of two coupled
harmonic oscillators, reminiscent of coupled bound electronic potential curves
of diatomic molecules. Using the knowledge of such models, this approach of the
problem gives new insight of the dynamics. The effect of the rotating wave
approximation is discussed. The collapse-revival phenomenon is especially
analyzed in a non-standard manner. Extensions of the method is briefly
mentioned in terms of a three-level atom and the Dicke model.
