peculiar negative weight transients, up to milligrams (mass fraction around
10^-5), which is followed by various types of relaxation processes. These
relaxations have significantly different dynamics compared to transients
observed during cooling after stationary external heating. Interestingly, a
USB-1 MP3 player has also developed comparable transient mass loss during
playing music. A classical interpretation of the negative weight transients
could be absorbed water in hygroscopic components however comparison of
relaxation time constants with air humidity data does not support an obvious
explanation. Another classical interpretation with certain contribution is the
lifting Bernoulli force caused by the circulation due to convection of the warm
air. However, in this case all observed time constants with a device should
have been the same unless some hidden parameter causes the observed variations.
Further studies are warranted to clarify if there is indeed a new force, which
is showing up as negative mass at weight measurement when high-density
structural information is changed or read out (measured).

supposedly created fluid compensating for the possible quenching effect of
viscosity. A distinctive signature of the vorticity in the plasma is the
generation of an average polarization of the emitted hadrons, for which we
provide analytical expressions. These phenomena might be better observed at

Second, the dependence of nuclear halo properties on the characteristics of the
energy density functional used in self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov
calculations is studied. It is found that (a) the low-density behavior of the
pairing functional and the regularization/renormalization scheme must be chosen
coherently and with care to provide meaningful predictions, (b) the impact of
pairing correlations on halo properties is significant and is the result of two
competing effects, (c) the detailed characteristics of the pairing functional
has however only little importance, (d) halo properties depend significantly on
any ingredient of the energy density functional that influences the location of
single-particle levels; i.e. the effective mass, the tensor terms and the
saturation density of nuclear matter. The latter dependencies give insights to
how experimental data on medium-mass drip-line nuclei can be used in the
distant future to constrain some characteristics of the nuclear energy density
functional. Last but not least, large scale predictions of halos among all
spherical even-even nuclei are performed using specific sets of particle-hole
and particle-particle energy functionals. It is shown that halos in the ground
state of medium-mass nuclei will only be found at the very limit of neutron
stability and for a limited number of elements.

initial mass function (IMF) from the integrated light properties of galaxies.
The large size, uniform high quality data set from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
DR4 is combined with more in depth modeling and quantitative statistical
analysis to search for systematic IMF variations as a function of galaxy
luminosity. Galaxy H alpha equivalent widths are compared to a broadband color
index to constrain the IMF. This parameter space is useful for breaking
degeneracies which are traditionally problematic. Age and dust corrections are
largely orthogonal to IMF variations. In addition the effects of metallicity
and smooth star formation history e-folding times are small compared to IMF
variations. We find that for the sample as a whole the best fitting IMF slope
above 0.5 M_sun is Gamma = 1.4535 with a negligible random error of +/- 0.0004
and a systematic error of +/- 0.1. Galaxies brighter than around M_r,0.1 = -20
(including galaxies like the Milky Way which has M_r,0.1 ~ -21) are well fit by
a universal Gamma ~ 1.4 IMF, similar to Salpeter, and smooth, exponential star
formation histories (SFH). Fainter galaxies prefer steeper IMFs and the quality
of the fits reveal that for these galaxies a universal IMF with smooth SFHs is
actually a poor assumption. Several sources of sample bias are ruled out as the
cause of these luminosity dependent IMF variations. Analysis of bursting SFH
models shows that an implausible coordination of burst times is required to fit
a universal IMF to the M_r,0.1 = -17 galaxies. This leads to the conclusions
that the IMF in low luminosity galaxies has fewer massive stars, either by
steeper slope or lower upper mass cutoff, and is not universal.

conditions where quasi one-dimensional step flow is stable against island
formation or step meandering, and analyse in detail the statistics of the
impurity concentration profile. The sign and strength of the impurity-induced
step interactions is determined by monitoring the motion of pairs of steps.
Assemblies containing up to 20 steps turn out to be unstable towards the
emission of single steps. This behavior is traced back to the small value of
the effective, impurity-induced attachment asymmetry for adatoms. An analytic

efficiency of task execution in systems underlain by geographical complex
networks where the probability of connection decreases with the distance
between the nodes. The investigation considers several configurations of the
parameters defining the network connectivity, and the Barabasi-Albert network
model is also considered for comparisons. The results show that the effect of
connectivity is significant only for shorter tasks, that the locality of
connections implied by the spatial constraints reduces efficency, and that the
addition of edges can improve the efficiency of the execution, although with
increasing locality of the connections the improvement is small.

shunts the junction. We develop a self-consistent renormalization group
treatment of interacting phase-slips and their dual counterparts, correlated
cooper pair tunneling, beyond the dilute approximation. This analysis leads to
a very sharp transition with a critical resistance of $R_Q$. The addition of
the quasi-particles' resistance at finite temperature leads to a quantitative
agreement with the experimental results. This self-consistent renormalization

mapped onto similar sine-Gordon models, in the previously inaccessible

coefficients $\sqrt{\bar {v_n^2}} \equiv v_n^{rms}$, calculated in a lab fixed
coordinate system, for a large range of $n$, from 1 to about 30, can give
non-trivial information about the initial stages of the system and its
evolution. We also argue that for all wavelengths $\lambda$ of the anisotropy
(at the surface of the plasma region) much larger than the acoustic horizon
size $H_s^{fr}$ at the freezeout stage, the resulting values of $v_n^{rms}$
should be suppressed by a factor of order $2H_s^{fr}/\lambda$. With initial
flow being zero, we discuss the possibility that the resulting flow could show
imprints of coherent oscillations in the plot of $v_n^{rms}$ for sub-horizon
modes. For gold-gold collision at 200 GeV, these features are expected to occur
for n $\ge$ 5, with $n < 4$ modes showing supression. This has strong
similarities with the physics of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave
background radiation (CMBR) resulting from inflationary density fluctuations in
the universe. It seems possible that the statistical fluctuations due to finite
multiplicity may not be able to mask such features in the flow data, or, at
least a non-trivial overall shape of the plot of $v_n^{rms}$ may be inferred.
In that case, the successes of analysis of CMBR anisotropy power spectrum to
get cosmological parameters can be applied for relativistic heavy-ion
collisions to learn about various relevant parameters at the early stages of
the evolving system.

\ge 2$) one-dimensional quantum wires. We include the effectofelectron-electron
interaction within the one-dimensional quantum wire using a weak interaction
renormalization group procedure. Due to the proximity effect, transport across
the junction occurs via direct tunneling as well as via the crossed Andreev
channel. We find that the fixed point structure of this system is far more rich
than the fixed point structure of a normal metal$-$superconductor junction ($N
= 1$), where we only have two fixed points - the fully insulating fixed point
or the Andreev fixed point. Even a two wire (N=2)system with a superconducting
junction i.e. a normalmetal$-$superconductor$-$normal metal structure, has
non-trivialfixed points with intermediate transmissions and reflections. We
also include electron-electron interaction induced back-scattering in the
quantum wires in our study and hence obtain non-Luttinger liquid behaviour. It
is interesting to note that {\textsl{(a)}} effects due to inclusion of
electron-electron interaction induced back-scattering in the wire, and
{\textsl{(b)}} competition between the charge transport via the electron and
hole channels across the junction, give rise to a non-monotonic behavior of
conductance as a functionof temperature. We also find that transport across the
junction depends on two independent interaction parameters. The first one is
due to the usual correlations coming from Friedel oscillations for spin-full
electrons giving rise to the well-known interaction parameter (${{\alpha =
(g_2-2g_1)/2 \pi \hbar v_F}}$). The second one arises due to the scattering
induced by the proximity of the superconductor and is given by(${{\alpha^\prime

of stellar systems containing a super-massive black hole (SMBH), splitting the
forces on a particle between a dominant central force and perturbations. We
used this method to perform fully collisional N-body simulations of
inspiralling intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in the centre of the Milky
Way. We considered stellar cusps of different power-law indices and analysed
the effects of IMBHs of different masses, all starting from circular orbits at
an initial distance of 0.1 pc.
  Our simulations show how IMBHs deplete the central cusp of stars, leaving
behind a flatter cusp with slope consistent with what has recently been
observed. If an additional IMBH spirals into such a flat cusp, it can take 50
Myr or longer to merge with the central SMBH, thus allowing for direct
observation in the near future. The final merger of the two black holes
involves gravitational wave radiation which may be observable with planned
gravitational wave detectors.
  Furthermore, our simulations reveal detailed properties of the hypervelocity
stars (HVSs) created, and how generations of HVSs can be used to trace IMBHs in
the Galactic Centre. We find that significant rotation of HVSs (which would be
evidence for an IMBH) can only be expected among very fast stars (v > 1000
km/s). Also, the probability of creating a hypervelocity binary star is found
to be very small.

analytically by means of a field-theoretical effective-medium theory
(self-consistent Born approximation) and numerically on a square lattice. As in
the uncorrelated case the theory predicts an enhancement of the density of
states over Debye's $\omega^{d-1}$ law (``boson peak'') as a result of
disorder. This anomay becomes reinforced for increasing correlation length
$\xi$. The theory predicts that $\xi$ times the width of the Brillouin line
should be a universal function of $\xi$ times the wavenumber. Such a scaling is
found in the 2d simulation data, so that they can be represented in a universal
plot. In the low-wavenumber regime, where the lattice structure is irrelevant
there is excellent agreement between the simulation at small disorder. At
larger disorder the continuum theory deviates from the lattice simulation data.
It is argued that this is due to an instability of the model with stronger
disorder.

detected in all four IRAC bands and, for the first time, is shown to
continuously extend over the entire length of the red outflow lobe traced by CO
observations. The redshifted jet also extends to a deeply embedded Class 0
source, VLA 2, confirming previous suggestions that it is the driving source of
the outflow (Gomez et al. 1994). The images show that the easternmost part of
the redshifted jet exhibits what appear to be multiple changes of direction. To
understand the redshifted jet morphology we explore several mechanisms that
could generate such apparent changes of direction. From this analysis, we
conclude that the redshifted jet structure and morphology visible in the IRAC
images can be largely, although not entirely, explained by a slowly precessing
jet (period ~8000 yr) that lies mostly on the plane of the sky. It appears that
the observed changes in the redshifted jet direction may be sufficient to
account for a significant fraction of the broadening of the outflow lobe
observed in the CO emission.

domination begins as late as 1 MeV, and is preceded by significant entropy
generation. Thermal axion relic abundances are then suppressed, and
cosmological limits to axions are loosened. For reheating temperatures less
than 35 MeV, the large-scale structure limit to the axion mass is lifted. The
remaining constraint from the total density of matter is significantly relaxed.
Constraints are also relaxed for higher reheating temperatures. In a kination
scenario, a more modest change to cosmological axion constraints is obtained.
Future possible constraints to axions and low-temperature reheating from the

quantitative description of the parameter space of synthesis models and the
evaluation of their associated uncertainties and dispersion. First, we need to
understand what synthesis models actually compute: we show that a synthetic
stellar population with fixed physical parameters (age, metallicity, star
formation history, initial mass function and size of the system) can only be
described in terms of probability distributions (i.e. there is an intrinsic
dispersion in any model). Second, we need to identify and characterize the
coverage in the parameter space of the models (i.e. the combinations of input
parameters that yield meaningful models) and the different sources of
systematic errors. Third, we need a way to describe quantitatively the
intrinsic dispersion, the systematic error and the parameter space coverage of
the models.
  Up to now, the parameter space coverage and uncertainties have been described
qualitatively in the models' reference papers, with potential
misinterpretations by models' users. We show how Virtual Observatory
developments enable a correct use of synthesis models to obtain accurate (and
not simply precise) results.

the CMB sky lies in the precision with which we can calculate the cosmological
recombination process. Uncertainty in the details of hydrogen and helium
recombination could effectively increase the errors or bias the values of the
cosmological parameters derived from the Planck satellite, for example. Here we
modify the cosmological recombination code RECFAST by introducing one more
parameter to reproduce the recent numerical results for the speed-up of the
helium recombination. Together with the existing hydrogen fudge factor, we vary
these two parameters to account for the remaining dominant uncertainties in
cosmological recombination. By using the CosmoMC code with Planck forecast
data, we find that we need to determine the parameters to better than ten per
cent for He I and one per cent for H, in order to obtain negligible effects on
the cosmological parameters. For helium recombination, if the existing studies
have calculated the ionization fraction to the 0.1 per cent level by properly
including the relevant physical processes, then we already have numerical
calculations which are accurate enough for Planck. For hydrogen, setting the
fudge factor to speed up low redshift recombination by 14 per cent appears to
be sufficient for Planck. However, more work still needs to be done to carry
out comprehensive numerical calculations of all the relevant effects for
hydrogen, as well as to check for effects which couple hydrogen and helium
recombinaton through the radiation field.

Virgo and Fornax Clusters. Sersic models provide accurate descriptions of the
global profiles with a notable exception: the observed profiles deviate
systematically inside a characteristic ""break"" radius of R_b ~ 0.02R_e where
R_e is the effective radius of the galaxy. The sense of the deviation is such
that bright galaxies (M_B < -20) typically show central light deficits with
respect to the inward extrapolation of the Sersic model, while the great
majority of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies (-19.5 < M_B < -15) show
central light excesses; galaxies occupying a narrow range of intermediate
luminosities (-20 < M_B < -19.5) are usually well fitted by Sersic models over
all radii. The slopes of the central surface brightness profiles, when measured
at fixed fractions of R_e, vary smoothly as a function of galaxy luminosity in
a manner that depends sensitively on the choice of measurement radius. We show
that a recent claim of strong bimodality in slope is likely an artifact of the
galaxy selection function used in that study. To provide a more robust
characterization of the inner regions of galaxies, we introduce a parameter
that describes the central luminosity deficit or excess relative to the inward
extrapolation of the outer Sersic model. We find that this parameter varies
smoothly over the range of ~ 720 in blue luminosity spanned by the Virgo and

  clarified with Referee's comments",,"10.1086/588720",,"astro-ph",,"  We derive a physical model for the observed relations between star formation
rate (SFR) and molecular line (CO and HCN) emission in galaxies, and show how
these observed relations are reflective of the underlying star formation law.
We do this by combining 3D non-LTE radiative transfer calculations with
hydrodynamic simulations of isolated disk galaxies and galaxy mergers. We
demonstrate that the observed SFR-molecular line relations are driven by the
relationship between molecular line emission and gas density, and anchored by
the index of the underlying Schmidt law controlling the SFR in the galaxy.
Lines with low critical densities (e.g. CO J=1-0) are typically thermalized and
trace the gas density faithfully. In these cases, the SFR will be related to
line luminosity with an index similar to the Schmidt law index. Lines with high
critical densities greater than the mean density of most of the emitting clouds
in a galaxy (e.g. CO J=3-2, HCN J=1-0) will have only a small amount of
thermalized gas, and consequently a superlinear relationship between molecular
line luminosity and mean gas density. This results in a SFR-line luminosity
index less than the Schmidt index for high critical density tracers. One
observational consequence of this is a significant redistribution of light from
the small pockets of dense, thermalized gas to diffuse gas along the line of
sight, and prodigious emission from subthermally excited gas. At the highest
star formation rates, the SFR-Lmol slope tends to the Schmidt index, regardless
of the molecular transition. The fundamental relation is the Kennicutt-Schmidt
law, rather than the relation between SFR and molecular line luminosity. We use
these results to make imminently testable predictions for the SFR-molecular
line relations of unobserved transitions.

extrapolation from vector magnetograms, based on the Principle of Minimum
Dissipation Rate (MDR). The MDR system was derived from a variational problem
that is more suitable for an open and externally driven system, like the solar
corona. The resulting magnetic field equation is more general than force-free.
Its solution can be expressed as the superposition of two linear
(constant-$\alpha$) force-free fields (LFFFs) with distinct $\alpha$
parameters, and one potential field. Thus the original extrapolation problem is
decomposed into three LFFF extrapolations, utilizing boundary data. The full
MDR-based approach requires two layers of vector magnetograph measurements on
solar surface, while a slightly modified practical approach only requires one.
We test both approaches against 3D MHD simulation data in a finite volume. Both
yield quantitatively good results. The errors in the magnetic energy estimate
are within a few percents. In particular, the main features of relatively
strong perpendicular current density structures, representative of the
non-force freeness of the solution, are well recovered.

radiation pressure, formation and expansion of an HII region, and disk
photoevaporation. These processes may inhibit continued accretion once the
stellar mass has reached a critical value, and we evaluate this mass separately
for each process. Photodissociation of H_2 in the local dark matter minihalo
occurs relatively early in the growth of the protostar, but we argue this does
not affect subsequent accretion since by this time the depth of the potential
is large enough for accretion to be mediated by atomic cooling. However,
neighboring starless minihalos can be affected. Ionization creates an HII
region in the infalling envelope above and below the accretion disk. Ly-alpha
radiation pressure acting at the boundary of the HII region is effective at
reversing infall from narrow polar directions when the star reaches ~20-30Msun,
but cannot prevent infall from other directions. Expansion of the HII region
beyond the gravitational escape radius for ionized gas occurs at masses
~50-100Msun, depending on the accretion rate and angular momentum of the
inflow. However, again, accretion from the equatorial regions can continue
since the neutral accretion disk has a finite thickness and shields a
substantial fraction of the accretion envelope from direct ionizing flux. At
higher stellar masses, ~140Msun in the fiducial case, the combination of
declining accretion rates and increasing photoevaporation-driven mass loss from
the disk act to effectively halt the increase in the protostellar mass. We
identify this process as the mechanism that terminates the growth of Population
III stars... (abridged)

X-ray emission of a compact object is compelling evidence that the object is an
accreting neutron star. In many neutron stars, the stellar spin rate is equal
or roughly equal to Delta-nu, the frequency separation of the QPO pair, or to
2Delta-nu. Hence, if the mechanism that produces the kilohertz QPOs is similar
in all stars, measurement of Delta-nu can provide an estimate of the star's
spin rate. The involvement of the stellar spin in producing Delta-nu indicates
that the magnetic fields of these stars are dynamically important.
  We focus here on the implications of the paired kHz QPOs recently discovered
in the low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) system Cir X-1 (Boutloukos et al. 2006).
The kHz QPOs discovered in Cir X-1 are generally similar to those seen in other
stars, establishing that the compact object in the Cir X-1 system is a neutron
star. However, the frequency nu-u of its upper kHz QPO is up to a factor of
three smaller than is typical, and Delta-nu varies by about a factor 2 (167 Hz,
the largest variation so far observed). Periodic oscillations have not yet been
detected from Cir X-1, so its spin rate has not yet been measured directly. The
low values of nu-u and the large variation of Delta-nu challenge current models
of the generation of kHz QPOs. Improving our understanding of Cir X-1 will
improve our knowledge of the spin rates and magnetic fields of all neutron

coupling to fermions, only to the $Z^0$ gauge boson, this can be reconciled
with failure to detect low-mass Higgs bosons. This argument eliminates many
undetermined parameters of the standard model, but requires an {\it ad hoc}
Lagrangian term to account for neutral current asymmetries. The proposed
algebraic formalism is consistent with fermion generations defined by distinct
eigenvalues of a self-interaction mass operator.

  figures",,"10.1109/TIT.2009.2023718",,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  A tree decomposition of the coordinates of a code is a mapping from the
coordinate set to the set of vertices of a tree. A tree decomposition can be
extended to a tree realization, i.e., a cycle-free realization of the code on
the underlying tree, by specifying a state space at each edge of the tree, and
a local constraint code at each vertex of the tree. The constraint complexity
of a tree realization is the maximum dimension of any of its local constraint
codes. A measure of the complexity of maximum-likelihood decoding for a code is
its treewidth, which is the least constraint complexity of any of its tree
realizations.
  It is known that among all tree realizations of a code that extends a given
tree decomposition, there exists a unique minimal realization that minimizes
the state space dimension at each vertex of the underlying tree. In this paper,
we give two new constructions of these minimal realizations. As a by-product of
the first construction, a generalization of the state-merging procedure for
trellis realizations, we obtain the fact that the minimal tree realization also
minimizes the local constraint code dimension at each vertex of the underlying
tree. The second construction relies on certain code decomposition techniques
that we develop. We further observe that the treewidth of a code is related to
a measure of graph complexity, also called treewidth. We exploit this
connection to resolve a conjecture of Forney's regarding the gap between the
minimum trellis constraint complexity and the treewidth of a code. We present a
family of codes for which this gap can be arbitrarily large.

as a tracer of the specific star formation rate, we analyze the distribution of
galaxies in the M_B-EW and rotational velocity (V_{max})-EW planes.
Star-forming galaxies show two characteristic transitions in these planes. A
narrowing of the galaxy locus occurs at M_B~-15 and V_{max}~50 km/s, where the
scatter in the logarithmic EWs drops by a factor of two as the
luminosities/masses increase, and galaxy morphologies shift from predominately
irregular to late-type spiral. Another transition occurs at M_B~-19 and
V_{max}~120 km/s, above which the sequence turns off toward lower EWs and
becomes mostly populated by intermediate and early-type bulge-prominent
spirals. Between these two transitions, the mean logarithmic EW appears to
remain constant at 30 A. We comment on how these features reflect established
empirical relationships, and provide clues for identifying the large-scale
physical processes that both drive and regulate star formation, with emphasis

reduced at low frequencies due to the smaller Hawking temperature and are
enhanced at high frequencies due to superradiance. The angular momentum spectra
are enhanced over the whole frequency range as the rotation parameter
increases. The spectra and the amounts of energy and angular momentum radiated

(BH-NS) binaries in full general relativity, focusing on the case that the NS

initial condition in which the BH is modeled by a nonspinning moving puncture.
For modeling the NS, we adopt the $\Gamma$-law equation of state with
$\Gamma=2$ and the irrotational velocity field. We change the BH mass in the
range $M_{\rm BH} \approx 3.3$--$4.6M_{\odot}$, while the rest mass of the NS
is fixed to be $M_{*}=1.4 M_{\odot}$ (i.e., the NS mass $M_{\rm NS} \approx
1.3M_{\odot}$). The radius of the corresponding spherical NS is set in the
range $R_{\rm NS} \approx 12$--15 km (i.e., the compactness $GM_{\rm NS}/R_{\rm
NS}c^2 \approx 0.13$--0.16). We find for all the chosen initial conditions that
the NS is tidally disrupted near the innermost stable circular orbit. For the
model of $R_{\rm NS}=12$ km, more than 97 % of the rest mass is quickly
swallowed into the BH and the resultant torus mass surrounding the BH is less
than $0.04M_{\odot}$. For the model of $R_{\rm NS} \approx 14.7$ km, by
contrast, the torus mass is about $0.16M_{\odot}$ for the BH mass $\approx
4M_{\odot}$. The thermal energy of the material in the torus increases by the

the temperature $10^{10}$--$10^{11}$ K. (.. omission ..) We also present

new data collected in 2005 September and 2006 August. From the rotational
modulation of unpolarised line profiles, we conclude that starspots are present
at the surface of the star, but their contrast and fractional coverage are much
lower than those of non-fully convective active stars with similar rotation
rate. Applying tomographic imaging on each set of circularly polarised profiles
separately, we find that the large-scale magnetic topology is remarkably stable
on a timescale of 1 yr; repeating the analysis on the complete data set
suggests that the magnetic configuration is sheared by very weak differential
rotation (about 1/10th of the solar surface shear) and only slightly distorted
by intrinsic variability. This result is at odds with various theoretical
predictions, suggesting that dynamo fields of fully-convective stars should be
mostly non-axisymmetric unless they succeed at triggering significant
differential rotation.

with its holomorphic dependence on the closed string moduli. The microscopic
mechanism ensuring this continuity involves novel contributions to the
superpotential: As an instanton becomes unstable against decay to several
instantons, the latter provide a multi-instanton contribution which
reconstructs that of the single-instanton before decay. The process can be
understood as a non-perturbative lifting of additional fermion zero modes of an
instanton by interactions induced by other instantons. These effects provide
mechanisms via which instantons with U(1) symmetry can contribute to the
superpotential. We provide explicit examples of these effects for non-gauge
D-brane instantons, and for D-brane gauge instantons (where the motions in
moduli space can be interpreted as Higgsing, or Seiberg dualities).

joint evolution of QSO and their hosts. However, these observations are
challenging because the low space densities of these objects necessitate
surveying of large areas, in order to obtain statistically meaningful samples,
while at the same time cosmological redshifting and dimming means that rather
deep Near Infrared (NIR) imaging must be carried out. Several upcoming and
proposed facilities with wide-field NIR imaging capabilities will open up this
new region of parameter space. In this paper we present predictions for the
expected number counts of z>5 QSOs, based on simple empirical and
semi-empirical models of QSO evolution, as a function of redshift, depth and
surveyed area. We compute the evolution of observed-frame QSO magnitudes and
colors in a representative photometric system covering the wavelength range
550nm<lambda<1800nm, and combine this information with different estimates for
the evolution of the QSO luminosity function. We conclude that planned
ground-based surveys such as Pan-STARRS and VISTA should be able to detect a
large number of luminous QSOs up to z<7.5, but that space-based missions such
as EUCLID (formerly SPACE/DUNE) or SNAP are probably required in order to
obtain substantial samples at higher redshift. We also use our models to
predict the expected number counts for future X-ray space missions (such as
XEUS and Constellation-X), and show that because of their small field-of-view,
these telescopes are unlikely to discover significant numbers of AGN at very
high redshift. However, X-ray follow-up of objects detected at longer
wavelength will be an important means of confirming their identity as AGN and
constraining obscuration.

precise solution : quantum gravity predicts that Omega should be just a little
greater than 1, which fits perfectly with the observed 1.02. The cosmological
constant problem finds also its solution since we prove that the Lambda term
does not come from any dark energy, but comes from nonperturbative quantum
corrections to classical relativity, and has the exact tiny but strictly
positive value needed. Furthermore, the quantum equation of gravity possesses,
with no further efforts, features of unification. Indeed, our equation governs
at the same time the large scale of the universe, as did general relativity,

ordering, we exploit the fact that atoms with closely related site symmetries
but with small charge differences exhibit resonances at slightly different

the charge disproportion. Opposite to fluorescence or absorption measurements,
the power of diffraction relies on the capability of detecting differences that

non-perturbative effects. On one hand, no conventional quark confinement via a
linearly rising potential is present. On the other hand, its thermodynamic
properties are similar to ordinary SU(N) Yang--Mills theory. Finally, it has
been conjectured that gluons are removed from the physical spectrum in the same
way as in SU(N) Yang--Mills theory. The last claim will be explored by
determining the Landau-gauge ghost and gluon propagators, as well as the
Faddeev--Popov operator eigenspectrum, in G_2 lattice gauge theory in two and
three dimensions. The results are found to agree qualitatively with the SU(2)

multivariate data, such transitions have been observed frequently, but always
as a function of the number of data points provided, i.e. given a large enough
data set, two point clouds can always be recognized as different clusters, as
long as their separation is non-zero. In contrast, for the sparse networks
studied here, a cluster structure remains undetectable even in an infinitely
large network if a critical separation is not exceeded. We give analytic
formulas for this critical separation as a function of the degree distribution
of the network and calculate the shape of the recoverability-transition. Our
findings have implications for unsupervised learning and data-mining in

``high-abundance arc'' at $\sim 2'$ southwest from the center, however Suzaku
data did not confirm it. We suspect that it is a misidentification of an excess
hot component in this region as the Fe line. Careful background study showed no
positive detection of the extended hard X-rays previously reported with ASCA,
in 5--12 keV with XIS and 12--40 keV with HXD-PIN, although our upper limit did
not exclude the ASCA result. There is an indication that the X-ray intensity in
$r<3.3'$ region is $70\pm 19$% higher than the nominal CXB level (5--12 keV),
and Chandra and Suzaku data suggest that most of this excess could be due to
concentration of hard X-ray sources with an average photon index of
$\Gamma=1.38\pm 0.06$. Cumulative mass of O, Fe and Mg in the group gas and the

weak intermolecular interaction which is characteristic of organic
semiconductors. Pentacene thin-film transistors were fabricated and
characterized by in situ gated four-terminal measurements. Under high vacuum
conditions (base pressure of order 10E-8 mbar), the device performance is found
to improve with time. The effective field-effect mobility increases by as much
as a factor of two and mobilities up to 0.45 cm2/Vs were achieved. In addition,
the contact resistance decreases by more than an order of magnitude and there
is a significant reduction in current hysteresis. Oxygen/nitrogen exposure and
annealing experiments show the improvement of the electronic parameters to be
driven by a thermally promoted process and not by chemical doping. In order to
extract the spectral density of trap states from the transistor
characteristics, we have implemented a powerful scheme which allows for a
calculation of the trap densities with high accuracy in a straightforward
fashion. We show the performance improvement to be due to a reduction in the
density of shallow traps <0.15 eV from the valence band edge, while the
energetically deeper traps are essentially unaffected. This work contributes to
an understanding of the shallow traps in organic semiconductors and identifies
structural point defects within the grains of the polycrystalline thin films as

spintronics is an emerging research field of electronics: spintronics devices
are based on a spin control of electronics, or on an electrical and optical
control of spin or magnetism. This review presents selected themes of
semiconductor spintronics, introducing important concepts in spin transport,
spin injection, Silsbee-Johnson spin-charge coupling, and spindependent
tunneling, as well as spin relaxation and spin dynamics. The most fundamental
spin-dependent nteraction in nonmagnetic semiconductors is spin-orbit coupling.
Depending on the crystal symmetries of the material, as well as on the
structural properties of semiconductor based heterostructures, the spin-orbit
coupling takes on different functional forms, giving a nice playground of
effective spin-orbit Hamiltonians. The effective Hamiltonians for the most
relevant classes of materials and heterostructures are derived here from
realistic electronic band structure descriptions. Most semiconductor device
systems are still theoretical concepts, waiting for experimental
demonstrations. A review of selected proposed, and a few demonstrated devices
is presented, with detailed description of two important classes: magnetic
resonant tunnel structures and bipolar magnetic diodes and transistors. In most
cases the presentation is of tutorial style, introducing the essential
theoretical formalism at an accessible level, with case-study-like
illustrations of actual experimental results, as well as with brief reviews of
relevant recent achievements in the field.

quantum wire channel sandwiched between half-metallic ferromagnetic contacts,
can have Fano resonances in the transmission spectrum. These resonances appear
because the ferromagnets are half-metallic, so that the Fermi level can be
placed above the majority but below the minority spin band. In that case, the
majority spins will be propagating, but the minority spins will be evanescent.
At low temperatures, the Fano resonances can be exploited to implement a
digital binary switch that can be turned on or off with a very small gate
voltage swing of few tens of microvolts, leading to extremely small dynamic
power dissipation during switching. An array of 500,000 x 500,000 such
transistors can detect ultrasmall changes in a magnetic field with a
sensitivity of 1 femto-Tesla/sqrt{Hz}, if each transistor is biased near a Fano
resonance.

satisfy the Birkhoff theorem) for a large class of systems, having computable

capillary interactions requires a controlled force field to independently
manipulate small objects while avoiding any physical contact with the

measurement of capillary interactions between two micron sized spheres in a
free standing liquid film. The force falls off as an inverse power law in
particles separation. We derive and validate an explicit expression for this
