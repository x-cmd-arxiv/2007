limited number of simulations by employing a novel statistical technique known
as shrinkage estimation. The shrinkage technique optimally combines an
empirical estimate of the covariance with a model (the target) to minimize the
total mean squared error compared to the true underlying covariance. We test
this technique on N-body simulations and evaluate its performance by estimating
cosmological parameters. Using a simple diagonal target, we show that the
shrinkage estimator significantly outperforms both the empirical covariance and
the target individually when using a small number of simulations. We find that
reducing noise in the covariance estimate is essential for properly estimating
the values of cosmological parameters as well as their confidence intervals. We
extend our method to the jackknife covariance estimator and again find
significant improvement, though simulations give better results. Even for
thousands of simulations we still find evidence that our method improves
estimation of the covariance matrix. Because our method is simple, requires
negligible additional numerical effort, and produces superior results, we
always advocate shrinkage estimation for the covariance of the power spectrum
and other large-scale structure measurements when purely theoretical modeling
of the covariance is insufficient.

inflation (including brane/anti-brane inflation) and de Sitter vacua in this

the volume and dilaton moduli in the presence of fluxes and branes. We also
describe broader classes of IIA models which may include cosmologies with
inflation and/or de Sitter vacua. The inclusion of extra ingredients, such as
NS 5-branes and geometric or non-geometric NS-NS fluxes, evades the assumptions
used in deriving the no-go theorem. We focus on NS 5-branes and outline how
such ingredients may prove fruitful for cosmology, but we do not provide an
explicit model. We contrast the results of our IIA analysis with the rather

probability is enhanced by adiabatic contraction. If no adiabatic contraction
is assumed, naked cusp configurations become dominant at approximately 2.5'',
which is inconsistent with the data. We also show that at small-to-moderate

the shapes of the luminous and dark matter projected density profiles. In
constrast to other properties that affect these ratios, the degree of alignment
does not have a significant effect on the total lensing probability. These
correlations may therefore be constrained by comparing the theoretical image
separation distribution to a sufficiently large lens sample from future wide

of their polarization, based on optical-pumping, that has the potential to
provide direct measurements of the circumstellar gas properties.

\hat{\rho} \ln \hat{\rho}$) can conform, for an anomalous value of q (i.e., q
not equal to 1), to the classical thermodynamical requirement for the entropy
to be extensive. Moreover, we find that the entropic index q provides a tool to
characterize both universal and nonuniversal aspects in quantum phase
transitions (e.g., for a L-sized block of the Ising ferromagnetic chain at its
T=0 critical transverse field, we obtain
$\lim_{L\to\infty}S_{\sqrt{37}-6}(L)/L=3.56 \pm 0.03$). The present results
suggest a new and powerful approach to measure entanglement in quantum
many-body systems. At the light of these results, and similar ones for a d=2
Bosonic system discussed by us elsewhere, we conjecture that, for blocks of
linear size L of a large class of Fermionic and Bosonic d-dimensional many-body
Hamiltonians with short-range interaction at T=0, we have that the additive
entropy $S_1(L) \propto [L^{d-1}-1]/(d-1)$ (i.e., $ \ln L$ for $d=1$, and $
L^{d-1}$ for d>1), hence it is not extensive, whereas, for anomalous values of
the index q, we have that the nonadditive entropy $S_q(L)\propto L^d$ ($\forall
d$), i.e., it is extensive. The present discussion neatly illustrates that
entropic additivity and entropic extensivity are quite different properties,
even if they essentially coincide in the presence of short-range correlations.

Unquantized (analog) and quantized (digital) channel state feedback schemes are
analyzed and compared under various assumptions. Digital feedback is shown to
be potentially superior when the feedback channel uses per channel state
coefficient is larger than 1. Also, we show that by proper design of the
digital feedback link, errors in the feedback have a minor effect even if
simple uncoded modulation is used on the feedback channel. We discuss first the
case of an unfaded AWGN feedback channel with orthogonal access and then the
case of fading MIMO multi-access (MIMO-MAC). We show that by exploiting the
MIMO-MAC nature of the uplink channel, a much better scaling of the feedback
channel resource with the number of base station antennas can be achieved.
Finally, for the case of delayed feedback, we show that in the realistic case
where the fading process has (normalized) maximum Doppler frequency shift 0 < F
< 1/2, a fraction 1 - 2F of the optimal multiplexing gain is achievable. The
general conclusion of this work is that very significant downlink throughput is

  force-clamp technique","37 pages, 1 table, 11 figures, accepted for publication in JCP",,"10.1063/1.2822272",,"q-bio.BM",,"  We have developed a new extended replica exchange method to study
thermodynamics of a system in the presence of external force. Our idea is based
on the exchange between different force replicas to accelerate the equilibrium
process. We have shown that the refolding pathways of single ubiquitin depend
on which terminus is fixed. If the N-end is fixed then the folding pathways are
different compared to the case when both termini are free, but fixing the
C-terminal does not change them. Surprisingly, we have found that the anchoring
terminal does not affect the pathways of individual secondary structures of
three-domain ubiquitin, indicating the important role of the multi-domain
construction. Therefore, force-clamp experiments, in which one end of a protein
is kept fixed, can probe the refolding pathways of a single free-end ubiquitin
if one uses either the poly-ubiquitin or a single domain with the C-terminus
anchored. However, it is shown that anchoring one end does not affect refolding
pathways of the titin domain I27, and the force-clamp spectroscopy is always
capable to predict folding sequencing of this protein. We have obtained the
reasonable estimate for unfolding barrier of ubiqutin. The linkage between
residue Lys48 and the C-terminal of ubiquitin is found to have the dramatic
effect on the location of the transition state along the end-to-end distance
reaction coordinate, but the multi-domain construction leaves the transition
state almost unchanged. We have found that the maximum force in the
force-extension profile from constant velocity force pulling simulations
depends on temperature nonlinearly. However, for some narrow temperature
interval this dependence becomes linear, as have been observed in recent
experiments.

redshift shells up to $z\sim 11$, producing continuous all-sky maps with
arcminute angular resolution. A randomization scheme avoids repetition of

are added to supply the missing contribution of large-scale (LS) structures to
the lensing signal. The angular power spectra of the projected lensing
potential and the deflection-angle modulus agree quite well with semi-analytic
estimates on scales down to a few arcminutes, while we find a slight excess of
power on small scales, which we interpret as being due to non-linear clustering
in the MS. Our map-making procedure, combined with the LS adding technique, is
ideally suited for studying lensing of CMB anisotropies, for analyzing
cross-correlations with foreground structures, or other secondary CMB
anisotropies such as the Rees-Sciama effect.

$Q$. The compression performance is determined by the ``generalized asymptotic
equipartition property'' (AEP), which states that the probability of finding a
$D$-close match between $X_1^n$ and any given codeword $Y_1^n$, is
approximately $2^{-n R(P,Q,D)}$, where the rate function $R(P,Q,D)$ can be

remove various restrictive assumptions on the validity of this result that have

Ratio \vs Period diagram (Petersen diagram) puts constraints on its metallicity
Z. But these bounds are sensitive to the mixture of elements that are lumped
into the parameter $Z$. In this short paper we update the previous results that
were based on the Grevesse-Noels solar mixture to the recent, revised Asplund,
Grevesse & Sauval (2005) (AGS) solar mixture.
  We also examine the effect of the envelope depth on the accuracy of the
computed pulsation periods. We find that for low period Cepheids with high Z
the customary approximation of envelope pulsation breaks down. It is necessary
to compute stellar models that extend to the center and to include burning and
composition inhomogeneities in the modeling. Fortunately, however, most Beat
Cepheids that have been observed so far seem to avoid that regime.

population with a similar spatial distribution and a metallicity Z~0.004. We
suggest that the old stellar population was formed in the stellar disk of M82
and/or M81 and ejected into the intergalactic medium during a tidal passage (~
200-300 Myr ago), whereas the young UV-bright stars have formed in the tidal
debris. The UV luminosities of the eight objects are modest and typical of
small clusters or OB associations. The tidal bridge between M81-M82 therefore
appears to be intermediate between the very low levels of star formation seen

very difficult to estimate the influence of parameters on stability. Finding
parameters which result in a change in stability is a key step for a meaningful
bifurcation analysis. We describe a method based on well known approaches from
control theory, which can locate parameters leading to a change in stability.
The method considers a feedback circuit in the biochemical network and relates
stability properties to the control system obtained by loop--breaking. The
method is applied to a model of a MAPK cascade as an illustrative example.

component associated with the stellar body shows evidence for a small amount of
rotational support aligned with the major axis, in agreement with optically
measured kinematics and consistent with the small galaxian mass. Approximately
20-30% of the HI emission is associated with a second component, an HI ""plume""
extending along the optical minor axis to the southeast. We consider outflow,
inflow, and tidal origins for this feature. Outflow appears improbable, inflow
is a possibility, and tidal debris is most consistent with the observations.
These observations also reveal a filamentary third component that includes an
800 pc diameter HI shell or bubble to the west of the nucleus, coinciding with
an Halpha shell. The mass of HI in the shell may be as large as ~4x10^6 Msun.
This large mass, coupled with the lack of expansion signatures in the neutral
and ionized gas (v<30 km/s), suggests that this feature may be an example of a
starburst-blown bubble stalled by interaction with a massive neutral envelope.
Many other HI kinematic features closely resemble those seen in Halpha emission
from the ionized gas, supporting the interpretation of neutral and ionized gas
outflow at velocities of ~30 km/s. Comparison between extinction estimates from
the Balmer emission-line decrement and the HI column densities suggest a
gas-to-dust ratio 2-3 times the Galactic value in this low-metallicity (Z=1/4

Devil's Staircase associated with the Circle Map is a function that transforms
horizontal unit interval I onto vertical I, and is endowed with the
Farey-Brocot (F-B) structure in the vertical axis via the rational heights of
stability intervals. The underlying Cantor-dust fractal set Omega in the
horizontal axis --Omega contained in I, with fractal dimension d(Omega) approx.
0.87-- has a natural covering with segments that also follow the F-B hierarchy:
therefore, the staircase associates vertical I (of unit dimension) with
horizontal Omega in I (of dimension approx. 0.87), i.e. it selects a certain
subset Omega of I, both sets F- B structured, the selected Omega with smaller
dimension than that of I. Hence, the structure of the staircase mirrors the F-
B hierarchy. In this paper we consider the subset Omega-F-B of I that
concentrates the measure induced by the F-B partition and calculate its
Hausdorff dimension, i.e. the entropic or information dimension of the F-B
measure, and show that it coincides with d(Omega) approx. 0.87. Hence, this
dimensional value stems from the F-B structure, and we draw conclusions and
conjectures from this fact. Finally, we calculate the statistical ""Euclidean""
dimension (based on the ordinary Lebesgue measure) of the F-B partition, and we
show that it is the same as d(Omega-F-B), which permits conjecturing on the
universality of the dimensional value d approximately equal to 0.87.

  We derive an expansion for the vacuum energy in terms of periodic paths on
the graph and prove its convergence and smooth dependence on the bond lengths
of the graph. For an important special case of graphs with equal bond lengths,
we derive a simpler explicit formula.
  The main results are derived using the trace formula. We also discuss an
alternative approach using the method of images and prove that the results are
consistent. This may have important consequences for other systems, since the
method of images, unlike the trace formula, includes a sum over special
``bounce paths''. We succeed in showing that in our model bounce paths do not
contribute to the vacuum energy. Finally, we discuss the proposed possible link
between the magnitude of the vacuum energy and the type (chaotic vs.
integrable) of the underlying classical dynamics. Within a random matrix model
we calculate the variance of the vacuum energy over several ensembles and find
evidence that the level repulsion leads to suppression of the vacuum energy.

protocol improves the previously known achievable rate of the
decode-and-forward (DF) strategy for multirelay networks by allowing relays to
decode only a selection of messages from relays with strong links to it. Hence,
each relay may have several choices as to which messages to decode, and for a
given network many different parity forwarding protocols may exist. A tree
structure is devised to characterize a class of parity forwarding protocols for
an arbitrary multirelay network. Based on this tree structure, closed-form
expressions for the achievable rates of these DF schemes are derived. It is
shown that parity forwarding is capacity achieving for new forms of degraded

Suzaku, in October 2005 and October 2006 with exposures of 53.1 and 42.4 ks,
respectively. In addition to clear spin modulation in the 0.5--10 keV band of
the XIS data at the barycentric period of 33.0769 \pm 0.0001 s, the 10--30 keV
HXD data in the second half of the 2005 observation also showed statistically
significant periodic signals at a consistent period. On that occasion, the
spin-folded HXD light curve exhibited two sharp spikes separated by about 0.2
cycles in phase, in contrast to approximately sinusoidal profiles observed in
energies below about 4 keV. The folded 4--10 keV XIS light curves are
understood as a superposition of those two types of pulse profiles. The phase
averaged 1.5--10 keV spectra can be reproduced by two thermal components with
temperatures of $2.90_{-0.16}^{+0.20}$ keV and $0.53_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$ keV, but
the 12-25 keV HXD data show a significant excess above the extrapolated model.
This excess can be explained by either a power-law model with photon index of
$1.12_{-0.62}^{+0.63}$ or a third thermal component with a temperature of
$54_{-47}^{+26}$ keV. At a distance of 102 pc, the 4--30 keV luminosities of
the thermal and the additional components become $1.7_{-0.6}^{+1.3}$ and
$5.3_{-0.3}^{+15.3} \times 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively. The latter
corresponds to 0.09% of the spin down energy of the object. Possible emission
mechanisms of the hard pulsations are discussed, including in particular
non-thermal ones.

which is one of the discrete dynamical models for transcriptional regulatory
networks. After comparing the dynamical behaviors of network embedded feedback
and feedforward loops, we found that feedforward loops can provide higher
temporal order (coherence) with lower entropy (randomness) in a temporal
program of gene expression. In addition, complexity of the state space that
increases with longer length of attractors and greater number of attractors is
also reduced for networks with more feedforward loops. Feedback loops show
opposite effects on dynamics of the networks. These results suggest that
feedforward loops are one of the favorable local structures in biomolecular and
neuronal networks.

investigated for a complete set of light-polarization configurations for a
ferroelectric magnet DyMnO$_3$ by using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. We
identify the pronounced absorption continuum (1--8 meV) with a peak feature
around 2 meV, which is electric-dipole active only for the light $E$-vector
along the a-axis. This absorption band grows in intensity with lowering
temperature from the spin-collinear paraelectric phase above the ferroelectric
transition, but is independent of the orientation of spiral spin plane ($bc$ or
$ab$), as shown on the original $P_{\rm s}$ (ferroelectric polarization)
$\parallel c$ phase as well as the magnetic field induced $P_{\rm s}\parallel

terms of the large fluctuations of spins and spin-current.

  suggestions welcomed",,,,"physics.soc-ph cond-mat.dis-nn physics.comp-ph",,"  To a considerable extent, the continuing importance and popularity of complex
networks as models of real-world structures has been motivated by scale free
degree distributions as well as the respectively implied hubs. Being related to
sequential connections of edges in networks, paths represent another important,
dual pattern of connectivity (or motif) in complex networks (e.g., paths are
related to important concepts such as betweeness centrality). The present work
proposes a new supercategory of complex networks which are organized and/or
constructed in terms of paths. Two specific network classes are proposed and
characterized: (i) PA networks, obtained by star-path transforming
Barabasi-Albert networks; and (ii) PN networks, built by performing progressive
paths involving all nodes without repetition. Such new networks are important
not only from their potential to provide theoretical insights, but also as
putative models of real-world structures. The connectivity structure of these
two models is investigated comparatively to four traditional complex networks
models (Erdos-Renyi, Barabasi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz and a geographical model).
A series of interesting results are described, including the corroboration of
the distinct nature of the two proposed models and the importance of
considering a comprehensive set of measurements and multivariated statistical
methods for the characterization of complex networks.

non-universal soft supersymmetry-breaking contributions to the Higgs masses
(the NUHM) that would be required for the relic neutralino density to lie
within the range favoured by WMAP and other astrophysical and cosmological
observations. Such dark matter fine-tuning is analogous to the commonly studied
electroweak fine-tuning associated with satisfying the electroweak symmetry
breaking conditions, which we also study for completeness. We identify several
distinct regions of the NUHM parameter space: a bulk region, a $\stau-\neut$
coannihilation region, a pseudoscalar Higgs funnel region, a focus-point
bino/higgsino region and a $\sneut-\neut$ coannihilation region. Within each
region, we analyse specific representative points for which we provide
breakdowns of the contributions to the dark matter fine-tuning associated with
the different NUHM parameters. In general, the NUHM offers points with both
both smaller and larger amounts of dark matter fine-tuning than points in the
corresponding regions of the CMSSM. Lower amounts of dark matter fine-tuning
typically arise at points where several different (co)annihilation processes
contribute, e.g., at junctions between regions with different dominant
processes. We comment on the prospects for using collider measurements to
estimate the likely dark matter density within the NUHM framework.
