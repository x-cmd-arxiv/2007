around isolated parent galaxies. Samples of potential satellites selected from
large galaxy redshift surveys are significantly contaminated by interlopers --
objects not bound to the parent galaxy. We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to
estimate the interloper fraction in samples of candidate satellite galaxies. We
show that samples of red and blue satellites have different interloper
populations: a larger fraction of blue galaxies are likely to be interlopers
compared to red galaxies. Both with and without interloper subtraction, the
radial profile of blue satellites is significantly shallower than that of red
satellites. In addition, while red and blue primaries have different interloper
fractions, the slope of the corrected radial profiles are consistent after
interloper correction. We discuss the implications of these results for galaxy
formation models.

in-depth analysis of several individual events. Each event analyzed in detail
is associated with an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) and an IP
shock driven by the ICME. Immediately prior to the arrival of each shock,
electron beams along the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and associated
Langmuir waves are detected, implying magnetic connection to a
quasiperpendicular shock front acceleration site. These observations are
analogous to those made in the terrestrial foreshock region, indicating that a
similar foreshock region exists on IP shock fronts. The analogy suggests that
the electron acceleration process is a fast Fermi process, and this suggestion
is borne out by loss cone features in the electron distribution functions. The
presence of a foreshock region requires nonplanar structure on the shock front.
Using Wind burst mode data, the foreshock electrons are analyzed to estimate
the dimensions of the curved region. We present the first measurement of the
lateral, shock-parallel scale size of IP foreshock regions. The presence of
these regions on IP shock fronts can explain the fine structure often seen in

randomness in the connections. Two entropies, Sq and Sc, are defined to measure
the quality of the node classification and to what extent the connectivity of a
given network is content-based. Sq and Sc are also useful in determining the

the results obtained with the current dielectronic recombination rate

nebular-to-auroral transition ratio gives a temperature of 20800 K, while the
ratio of the [N II] nebular and auroral lines give Te=15200 K. The helium line
ratios 5876/4471 and 6678/4471 imply temperatures of 350 K and 550 K
respectively. Weakly temperature-sensitive O II recombination line ratios imply
similarly low electron temperatures. Abundances derived from recombination
lines are vastly higher than those found from collisionally excited lines, with
the abundance discrepancy factor (adf) for O2+ reaching 89 -- the second
highest known value after that found for the hydrogen deficient knots in Abell
30. The observed temperature diagnostics and abundances support the idea that,
like Abell 30, the knot of Abell 58 contains some very cold ionised material.
Although the central star is carbon-rich (C/O>1), the knot is found to be
oxygen-rich, a situation not predicted by the single-star `born again' theory
of its formation. We argue that the abundances in the ejecta observed in A 30

Rayleigh fading $M_t \times M_r$ MIMO channel when the channel state
information is only available at the receiver. Since the channel is not
ergodic, Shannon's source-channel separation theorem becomes obsolete and the
optimal performance requires a joint source -channel approach. Our goal is to
minimize the expected end-to-end distortion, particularly in the high SNR
regime. The figure of merit is the distortion exponent, defined as the
exponential decay rate of the expected distortion with increasing SNR. We
provide an upper bound and lower bounds for the distortion exponent with
respect to the bandwidth ratio among the channel and source bandwidths. For the
lower bounds, we analyze three different strategies based on layered source
coding concatenated with progressive, superposition or hybrid digital/analog
transmission. In each case, by adjusting the system parameters we optimize the
distortion exponent as a function of the bandwidth ratio. We prove that the
distortion exponent upper bound can be achieved when the channel has only one
degree of freedom, that is L=1, and $\min\{M_t,M_r\}=1$. When we have more
degrees of freedom, our achievable distortion exponents meet the upper bound
for only certain ranges of the bandwidth ratio. We demonstrate that our
results, which were derived for a complex Gaussian source, can be extended to
more general source distributions as well.

suggesting a high dark matter content and a steep spatial distribution within

high-resolution N-body / smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations designed
to elucidate two possible formation mechanisms for these systems: the merging
of globular clusters in the centre of a dark matter halo, or the massively
stripped remnant of a nucleated galaxy. Both models produce density profiles as
well as the half light radii that can fit the observational constraints.
However, we show that the first scenario results to UCDs that are underluminous
and contain no dark matter. This is because the sinking process ejects most of
the dark matter particles from the halo centre. Stripped nuclei give a more
promising explanation, especially if the nuclei form via the sinking of gas,
funneled down inner galactic bars, since this process enhances the central dark
matter content. Even when the entire disk is tidally stripped away, the nucleus
stays intact and can remain dark matter dominated even after severe stripping.
Total galaxy disruption beyond the nuclei only occurs on certain orbits and
depends on the amount of dissipation during nuclei formation. By comparing the
total disruption of CDM subhaloes in a cluster potential we demonstrate that
this model also leads to the observed spatial distribution of UCDs which can be
tested in more detail with larger data sets.

environments for studying the role of massive stars in the formation and

Gyr old, dust could have only condensed in the explosive ejecta of Type II
supernovae (SNe), since most of the progenitors of the AGB stars, the major
alternative source of interstellar dust, did not have time to evolve off the
main sequence. We present analytical models for the evolution of the gas, dust,
and metals in high redshift galaxies, with a special application to SDSS
J1148+5251, a hyperluminous quasar at z = 6.4. We show that an average SN must
condense at least 1 Msun of dust to account for the mass of dust in this
object, when grain destruction by supernova remnants (SNRs) is taken into
account. This required yield is in excess of ~0.05 Msun, the largest mass of
dust inferred from infrared observations of Cas A. If the yield of Cas A is
typical, then other processes, such as accretion onto preexisting grains in
molecular clouds is needed to produce the mass of dust in J1148+5251. For such
process to be effective, SNR must significantly increase, presumably by
non-evaporative grain-grain collisions during the late stages of their

stellar population synthesis models with photometric redshift template fitting
on the scale of individual pixels in galaxy images. Spectral energy
distributions are constructed, sampling a wide range of properties such as age,
star formation rate (SFR), dust obscuration and metallicity. By summing the
SFRs in the pixels, we demonstrate that the distribution of total galaxy SFR
shifts to lower values as the local density of surrounding galaxies increases,
as found in other studies. The effect is most prominent in the galaxies with
the highest star formation, and we see the break in the SFR-density relation at
a local galaxy density of $\approx 0.05 $(Mpc/h)$^{-3}$. Since our method
allows us to spatially resolve the SF distribution within galaxies, we can
calculate the mean SFR of each galaxy as a function of radius. We find that on
average the mean SFR is dominated by SF in the central regions of galaxies, and
that the trend for suppression of SFR in high density environments is driven by
a reduction in this nuclear SF. We also find that the mean SFR in the outskirts
is largely independent of environmental effects. This trend in the mean SFR is
shared by galaxies which are highly star forming, while those which are weakly
star forming show no statistically significant correlation between their

the dot's coupling to the leads is decreased, with the dot entering the Coulomb

temperature jumps at first order phase transitions, broken ergodicity. Here, we
mainly restrict our analysis to mean-field models, where particles globally
interact with the same strength. We show that relaxation to equilibrium
proceeds through quasi-stationary states whose duration increases with system
size. We propose a theoretical explanation, based on Lynden-Bell's entropy, of
this intriguing relaxation process. This allows to address problems related to
nonequilibrium using an extension of standard equilibrium statistical
mechanics. We discuss in some detail the example of the dynamics of the free
electron laser, where the existence and features of quasi-stationary states is
likely to be tested experimentally in the future. We conclude with some
perspectives to study open problems and to find applications of these ideas to

subgraphs in G that are pairwise disjoint and pairwise adjacent. The ""Hadwiger
number"" h(G) is the maximum cardinality of a clique minor in G. This paper
studies clique minors in the Cartesian product G*H.
  Our main result is a rough structural characterisation theorem for Cartesian
products with bounded Hadwiger number. It implies that if the product of two
sufficiently large graphs has bounded Hadwiger number then it is one of the
following graphs:
  - a planar grid with a vortex of bounded width in the outerface,
  - a cylindrical grid with a vortex of bounded width in each of the two `big'
faces, or
  - a toroidal grid.
  Motivation for studying the Hadwiger number of a graph includes Hadwiger's
Conjecture, which states that the chromatic number chi(G) <= h(G). It is open
whether Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for every Cartesian product. We prove that
if |V(H)|-1 >= chi(G) >= chi(H) then Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for G*H. On
the other hand, we prove that Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for all Cartesian
products if and only if it holds for all G * K_2. We then show that h(G * K_2)
is tied to the treewidth of G.
  We also develop connections with pseudoachromatic colourings and connected
dominating sets that imply near-tight bounds on the Hadwiger number of grid
graphs (Cartesian products of paths) and Hamming graphs (Cartesian products of
cliques).

analysis, such as biosynthetic prediction and flux optimization. The linear

recently a non-linear constraint based on the second thermodynamic law, known
as ""loop law"", has emerged and challenged the existing algorithms. Proven to be
unfeasible with linear solutions, this non-linear constraint has been
successfully imposed on the sampling process. In this place, Monte - Carlo
sampling with Metropolis criterion and Simulated Annealing has been introduced
to optimize the Biomass synthesis of genome scale metabolic network of
Helicobacter pylori (iIT341 GSM / GPR) under mass conservation constraint,
biological capacity constraint, and thermodynamic constraints including

optimize a non-linear objective function, the Biomass synthetic rate, which is
unified by the total income number of reducible electrons. To verify whether a
sample contains internal loops, an automatic solution has been developed based
on solving a set of inequalities. In addition, a new type of pathway has been
proposed here, the Futile Pathway, which has three properties: 1) its mass flow
could be self-balanced; 2) it has exchange reactions; 3) it is independent to
the biomass synthesis. To eliminate the fluxes of the Futile Pathways in the
sampling results, a linear programming based method has been suggested and the
results have showed improved correlations among the reaction fluxes in the
pathways related to Biomass synthesis.

rate. This comparison provides further evidence for solar metallicity in the
accreted material in this source, and constrains the distance to the source.
The main difference is that the observed lightcurves do not show the distinct
two-stage rise of the models. This may reflect the time for burning to spread
over the stellar surface, or may indicate that our treatment of heat transport
or nuclear physics needs to be revised. The trends in burst properties with
accretion rate are well-reproduced by our spherically symmetric models which
include chemical and thermal inertia from the ashes of previous bursts. Changes
in the covering fraction of the accreted fuel are not required.

this A1-type dwarf or subgiant star with a flux of 1.4x10^{-12} erg s^{-1}
cm^{-2} (0.5--10 keV) and a decay time scale of 0.5 hr. The spectrum is hard
with a prominent Fe XXV K alpha emission line at 6.7 keV, which is explained by
a 5 keV thin-thermal plasma model attenuated by a 1.4x10^{21} cm^{-2}
extinction. The low extinction, which is consistent with the optical reddening,
indicates that the source is a foreground star toward the Galactic Center
region. Based on the spectroscopic parallax distance of 530 pc, the peak X-ray
luminosity amounts to 1x10^{32} erg s^{-1} (0.5--10 keV). This is much larger
than the X-ray luminosity of ordinary late-type main-sequence stars, and the
X-ray emission is unattributable to a hidden late-type companion that comprises
a wide binary system with the A-star. We discuss possible natures of HD 161084

point transformations in the case of a square sytem of two second-order ODEs.
Necessary and sufficient conditions for linearization by means of point

model system of bilayer membranes embedded by nanosized inclusions, and explain
experimental findings. Here, the hydrophobic inclusions are simple models of
intrinsic membrane proteins, cholesterol embedded in the membrane, hydrophobic
drugs, or other nanoparticles for bio-medical applications. It is found that
lipid/inclusion-rich raft domains are formed at moderate inclusion
concentrations, and disappear with the increase of inclusions. At high
inclusion content, chaining of inclusions occurs due to the effective
attraction between inclusions mediated by lipids. Meanwhile, increasing
inclusions can also cause thickening of the membrane, and the distribution of
inclusions undergoes a layering transition from one-layer located in the
bilayer midplane to two-layer structure arranged into the two leaflets of a
bilayer. Our theoretical predictions address the complex interactions between
membranes and inclusions, suggesting a unifying mechanism which reflects the
competition between the conformational entropy of lipids favoring the formation
of lipid-rich rafts and the steric repulsion of inclusions leading to the
uniform dispersion.

maps in different spectral channels are to be observed and then processed by
the Difference method. Simulation of the experiment is made for MSRT (Tuorla

chopping flat and frequency multiplexer providing up to 7 spectral channels in
each beam (88-100 GHz). Expected $\Delta $T/T limit in the experiment is 2x10

on cognitive, dynamic aspects of real design, i.e., the actual cognitive
activity implemented by designers during their work on professional design
projects. Rather than conceiving de-signing as problem solving - Simon's
symbolic information processing (SIP) approach - or as a reflective practice or
some other form of situated activity - the situativity (SIT) approach - we
consider that, from a cognitive viewpoint, designing is most appropriately
characterised as a construction of representations. After a critical discussion
of the SIP and SIT approaches to design, we present our view-point. This
presentation concerns the evolving nature of representations regarding levels
of abstraction and degrees of precision, the function of external
representations, and specific qualities of representation in collective design.
Designing is described at three levels: the organisation of the activity, its
strategies, and its design-representation construction activities (different
ways to generate, trans-form, and evaluate representations). Even if we adopt a
""generic design"" stance, we claim that design can take different forms
depending on the nature of the artefact, and we propose some candidates for
dimensions that allow a distinction to be made between these forms of design.
We discuss the potential specificity of HCI design, and the lack of cognitive
design research occupied with the quality of design. We close our discussion of
representational structures and activities by an outline of some directions
regarding their functional linkages.

Using the photometric and spectroscopic database of 504 GCs, we have
investigated the kinematics of the M31 GC system. We find that the all GC
system shows strong rotation, with rotation amplitude of v_rot~190km/s, and
that a weak rotation persists even for the outermost samples at |Y|>5kpc. The
rotation-corrected velocity dispersion for the GC system is estimated to be
sigma_{p,r}~130km/s, and it increases from sigma_{p,r}~120km/s at |Y|<1kpc to
sigma_{p,r}~150km/s at |Y|>5kpc. These results are very similar to those for
the metal-poor GCs. This shows that there is a dynamically hot halo in M31 that
is rotating but primarily pressure-supported. We have identified 50
""friendless"" GCs, and they appear to rotate around the major axis of M31. For
the subsamples of metal-poor and metal-rich GCs, we have found that the
metal-rich GCs are more centrally concentrated than the metal-poor GCs, and
both subsamples show strong rotation. For the subsamples of bright and faint
GCs, it is found that the rotation for the faint GCs is stronger than that for
the bright GCs. We have identified 56 GCs and GC candidates with X-ray
detection. It is found that the majority of X-ray emitting GCs follow the disk
rotation, and that the redder, more metal-rich, and brighter GCs are more
likely to be detected as X-ray emitting GCs. We have derived a rotation curve
of M31 using the GCs at |Y|<0.6kpc. We have estimated the dynamical mass of M31
using `Projected Mass Estimator(PME)' and `Tracer Mass Estimator(TME)'. We
finally discuss the implication of these results and compare the kinematics of

little more than one in excess of what has been seen at considerably smaller

associated with the incommensurate magnetic order was found to be in good
agreement with neutron scattering data. XRS experiments were performed in the
vicinity of the Mn $K$ and Tb $L_3$ edges in the high-temperature collinear
phase, the intermediate temperature cycloidal/ferroelectric phase, and the
low-temperature phase. In the collinear phase resonant $E1-E1$ satellites were
found at the Mn $K$ edge associated with $A$-type but also $F$-type peaks. The
azimuthal dependence of the $F$-type satellites (and their absence in the NRXMS
experiments) indicates that they are most likely non-magnetic in origin. We
suggest instead that they may be associated with an induced charge multipole.
At the Tb $L_3$ edge resonant $A$- and $F$-type satellites ($E1-E1$) were
observed in the collinear phase. These we attribute to a polarisation of the Tb
5$d$ states by the ordering of the Mn sublattice. In the

corresponding to $C$-type order. These appear at the Tb $L_3$ edge only. In
addition to a dominant $E1-E1$ component in the $\sigma-\pi^\prime$ channel, a

  chapter 7, conflicting with the current gravitational wave discovery",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The first clue, in the theory of relativity, the 4-vector force acting on a
particle is orthogonal to the 4-vector velocity of the particle, this
orthogonality means that there is some difference between the orthogonality and
the usual statement: the Coulomb's force (or gravitational force) acts along
the line joining a couple of particles (in usual 3D space), so the direction of
4-vector Coulomb's force is carefully investigated, it is found that Maxwell's
equations can be derived from classical Coulomb's force and the orthogonality.
The second clue, a 4-vector force has 4 components, because of the
orthogonality of 4-vector force and 4-vector velocity, the number of
independent components of the 4-vector force reduces to 3, however we prove
that 4-vector Coulomb's force can merely provide 2 independent components, this
situation means that there is an undefined component accompanying the 4-vector
Coulomb's force, hinting that this missing undefined component is a hidden
variable. The third clue, the best way to study the hidden variable is to
establish a new concept: Z-space, in which the undefined component of 4-vector
Coulomb's force can be clearly defined as the hidden variable for the quantum
mechanics. At the last, the undefined component is regarded as a fluctuating
source that contributes to Lorentz force, so that the quantum wave equation can
be derived out in the ensemble space of particle motion from the relativistic
Newton's second law.

Derrida's Random Energy Model (REM) and Generalized Random Energy Model (GREM)
and a nonhierarchical version (BK-GREM) by Bolthausen and Kistler. The limiting
free energy in all these models along with Word GREM, a model proposed by us,
turn out to be a cute consequence of large deviation principle (LDP). This LDP
argument allows us to consider non-Gaussian driving distributions as well as
external field. We could also consider random trees as the underlying tree
structure in GREM. In all these models, as expected, limiting free energy is
not 'universal' unlike the SK model. However it is 'rate specific'.
Consideration of non-Gaussian driving distribution as well as different driving
distributions for the different levels of the underlying trees in GREM leads to
interesting phenomena. For example in REM, if the Hamiltonian is Binomial with
parameter $N$ and $p$ then the existence of phase transition depends on the
parameter $p$. More precisely, phase transition takes place only when
$p>{1/2}$. For another example, consider a 2 level GREM with exponential
driving distribution at the first level and Gaussian in the second with equal
weights at both the levels. Then even if the limiting ratio for the second
level particles, $p_2$ is 0.00001 (very small), the system reduces to a
Gaussian REM. On the other hand, if we consider a 2 level GREM with Gaussian
driving distribution at the first level and exponential in the second, the
system will never reduce to a Gaussian REM. In either case, the system will
never reduce to that of an exponential REM. etc.

analysis. In each metal, the obtained intrinsic SHC is independent of
resistivity in the low resistive regime ($\rho < 50 \mu\Omega\text{cm}$)
whereas it decreases in proportion to $\rho^{-2}$ in the high resistive regime.
In the low resistive regime, the SHC takes a large positive value in Pt and Pd,

conductivity in ferromagnetic metals. Furthermore, each transition metal shows
huge and positive $d$-orbital Hall conductivity (OHC), independently of the

for the ionized gas and magnetic field patterns of different azimuthal symmetry
(axisymmetric, bisymmetric and quadrisymmetric spiral, and superpositions) plus
a halo magnetic field. $\RM$ fluctuations with a Kolmogorov spectrum due to
turbulent fields and/or fluctuations in ionized gas density are superimposed.
Assuming extrapolated number density counts of polarized sources, we generate a
sample of $\RM$ values within the solid angle of the galaxy. Applying various
templates, we derive the minimum number of background sources and the minimum
quality of the observations. For a large number of sources, reconstruction of
the field structure without precognition becomes possible. Any large-scale
regular component of the magnetic field can be clearly recognized from $\RM$

instigated by the recent proposal from the PAX (Polarized Antiproton

by repeated interaction with a polarized internal target in a storage ring. The
method of polarization buildup by spin filtering requires many of the beam
particles to remain within the ring after scattering off the polarized internal
target via electromagnetic and hadronic interactions. Sets of differential
equations which describe the buildup of polarization by spin filtering in many
different scenarios have recently been presented and solved. In this paper we
add to this literature by investigating a scenario where unpolarized particles
are input into the beam at a linearly increasing rate, i.e. the input rate is

A working manuscript, comments welcomed",,,,"physics.soc-ph cond-mat.dis-nn physics.comp-ph",,"  A good deal of the connectivity of complex networks can be characterized in
terms of their constituent paths and hubs. For instance, the Barab\'asi-Albert
model is known to incorporate a significative number of hubs and relatively
short paths. On the other hand, the Watts-Strogatz model is underlain by a long
path and almost complete absence of hubs. The present work investigates how the
topology of complex networks changes when a path is transformed into a star
(or, for long paths, a hub). Such a transformation keeps the number of nodes
and does not increase the number of edges in the network, but has potential for
greatly changing the network topology. Several interesting results are reported
with respect to Erdos-R\'enyi, Barab\'asi-Albert and Watts-Strogats models,
including the unexpected finding that the diameter and average shortest path
length of the former type of networks are little affected by the path-star
transformation. In addition to providing insight about the organization of
complex networks, such transformations are also potentially useful for
improving specific aspects of the network connectivity, e.g. average shortest
path length as required for expedite communication between nodes.

between states, and uses a previous identification in the black hole low hard
state as a starting point. It is supported by correlations between the
frequencies in agreement with those previously found to hold for black hole and
neutron stars. Similar variability components are observed in neutron stars and
black holes (only the component observed at the highest frequencies is
different) which therefore cannot depend on source-specific characteristics
such as the magnetic field or surface of the neutron star or spin of the black
hole. As the same variability components are also observed across the jet-line
the X-ray variability cannot originate from the outer-jet but is most likely
produced in either the disk or the corona. We use the identification to
directly compare the difference in strength of the black hole and neutron star
variability and find these can be attributed to differences in frequency and
strength of high frequency features, and do not require the absence of any
components. Black holes attain their highest frequencies (in the
hard-intermediate and very-high states) at a level a factor ~6 below the
highest frequencies attained by the corresponding neutron star components,
which can be related to the mass difference between the compact objects in

AGNs in clusters were higher in the past, then the filling factor could
correspondingly be significant, with implications for the cluster scaling

engine. Our model consists of a equilibrium thermal bath and a non-equilibrium
bath; latter generated by driving with an external stationary, Gaussian noise.
The engine we develop, can be considered as a device to extract work by
modifying internal fluctuations. Our theoretical analysis focusses on finding
the essential ingredients necessary for generating fluctuation induced
transport under non-equilibrium condition. An important outcome of our model is
that the net motion occurs when the non-linear bath is modulated by the
external noise, creating the non-zero effective temperature even when the
temperature of both the baths are same.

  and solutions, and appendix B added",,,,"hep-th",,"  We present a new gauge/gravity duality construction of the Klebanov-Strassler
throat which takes corrections to the anomalous mass dimension proposed in [1]
into account on the gauge theory side and both the dilaton and the axion run on
the gravity side. The corresponding supergravity solutions are found using
equations for type IIB flows with N=1 supersymmetry obtained in [2]. We find
that magnetic couplings of the axion to D7-branes filling 4-d spacetime and
wrapping 4-cycles at locations of duality transitions and invisible Dirac
8-branes whose worldvolume emanates from the worldvolume of the D7-branes are
the sources for the runnings of the dilaton and the axion. Our construction
provides the first explicit example of a gauge/gravity duality mapping with a
running dilaton or a running axion which is an important component towards
finding gravity duals to gauge theories with physically more interesting
renormalization group flows such as pure confining gauge theories in four
dimensions. The D7-branes also serve as gravitational source for Seiberg
duality transitions. The supergravity background has distinct features which
could be useful for constructing cosmological models and studying possibilities
for probing stringy signatures from the early universe.

  four dimensional space-time concept)","23 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The model of the Universe in this paper uses equations of the unperturbed
Keplerian motion. They have been updated, complementied and generalized when
the solution of these equations is the characteristic function of a random
value from the theory of probabilities. Argument of the differential equation
in this case is any more time, an interval of time between sections of a random
stationary prosess. In this paper this time interval is referred to as flexible
(elastic) time due to its many non-trivial properties. It is proved flexible
time does not depend on the space which makes invalid the four dimensional
space-time concept. The Universe becomes stationary and Eucledian. It is
proved: 1. the advavce of Mercury's perihelion versus the predictions in
accordance with the universal gravity law results inequality of the
coefficients in the correlation equations of Keplerian moution along axes x, y
and z; 2. the velocity of propagation of harmonic oscillation in the Uneverse
is not constant; 3. long-range interaction, i.e. instantaneous communication
between any two points of space in tne Universe is possible; 4. the Universe is
a closed-loop informatiom-energy system which revives the nature and acts as a
barrier to the second law of thermodynamics where stars are treated as machines
which accumulate energy by moving. Physics in the Universe is conceptually
different from that of the Earth and, respectively, needs methods of
investigation different from the ones which are used today. Numerous
astronomical supervision and the researches lead by known astrophysicist
N.A.Kozyrev personally or under his management confirm adequacy of the model in
the present paper.

resonance and heat- capacity studies of Co[Al_1-xCo_x]_2O_4 for Co
concentrations 0<x<1. In this spinel system only the A-site Co^2+ cation is
magnetic, while the non-magnetic B-site Al^3+ is substituted by the low-spin
non-magnetic Co^3+, and it is possible to investigate the complete phase
diagram from Co^2+Al^3+_2O_4 to Co^2+Co^3+_2O_4. All samples reveal large
negative Curie-Weiss temperatures Theta_CW of the order of -110 K independent
of concentration, which is attributed to a high multiplicity of the
superexchange interactions between the A-site Co^2+ cations. A pure
antiferromagnetic state is found for x = 1.0 and 0.9 with Neel temperatures T_N
= 29.5 K and 21.2 K, respectively, as evidenced by lambda-like anomalies in the
specific heat. Compositions with 0.3<x<0.75 show smeared out strongly reduced
magnetic ordering temperatures. At low temperatures, a T^2.5 dependence of the
specific heat is indicative of a spin-liquid state. For x < 0.2 a T^2
dependence of the specific heat and a spin-glass like behavior of the
susceptibility below T_f = 4.7 K are observed. The high value of the
frustration parameter f = |Theta_CW|/T_f > 10 indicates the presence of strong
spin frustration at least for x < 0.6. The frustration mechanism is attributed
to competing nearest neighbor and next-nearest neighbor superexchange
interactions between the A-site Co^2+ ions.

carrier dynamics in graphene. We find that the quasiparticle spectrum acquires
a finite broadening due to the long-range interaction with the polar modes at
the interface between graphene and the substrate. This mechanism results in a
density dependent electrical resistivity, that exhibits a sharp increase around
room temperature, where it can become the dominant limiting factor of electron
transport. The effects are weaker in doped bilayer graphene, due to the more
conventional parabolic band dispersion.
