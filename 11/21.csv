there is a tight corellation between the dynamics of the electroweak phase
transition and the cubic self-coupling of the Higgs boson: Models which exhibit
a strong first-order EWPT predict a large deviation of the Higgs self-coupling
from the Standard Model prediction, as long as no accidental cancellations
occur. Order-one deviations are typical. This shift would be observable at the
Large Hadron Collider if the proposed luminosity or energy upgrades are
realized, as well as at a future electron-positron collider such as the
proposed International Linear Collider. These measurements would provide a
laboratory test of the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition.

GeV has more than doubled. I study 17 blazars currently known to emit E>100 GeV
gamma rays. Their intrinsic energy spectra are reconstructed by removing
extragalactic background light attenuation effects. Luminosity and spectral
slope in the E>100 GeV region are then compared and correlated among each
other, with X-ray, optical and radio data, and with the estimated black hole
(BH) masses of the respective host galaxies.
  According to expectations from synchrotron self-Compton emission models, a
correlation on the 3.6-sigma significance level between gamma-ray and X-ray
fluxes is found, while correlations between gamma-ray and optical/radio fluxes
are less pronounced. Further, a general hardening of the E>100 GeV spectra with
increasing gamma-ray luminosity is observed. This goes in line with a
correlation of the gamma-ray luminosity and the synchrotron peak frequency,
which is also seen. Tests for possible selection effects reveal a hardening of
the spectra with increasing redshift. The gamma-ray emission might depend on
the mass of the central BH. The studied blazars show no correlation of the BH
masses with the spectral index and the luminosity in the E>100 GeV region.
  Also temporal properties of the X-ray and E>100 GeV gamma-ray flux are
considered. No general trends are found, except that the blazars with the most
massive BHs do not show particularly high duty cycles. In general, VHE flare
time-scales are not found to scale with the BH mass.
  As a specific application of the luminosity study, a constraint for the still
undetermined redshift of the blazar PG 1553+113 is discussed.

astrophysical open issues. Here, the ATNF Catalog is scrutinized searching for
pulsar distances and proper motions. For a sample of 212 run away pulsars
(RAPs), which currently run across the Galaxy at very high speed and undergo
large displacements, some gravitational-wave (GW) signals produced by such
present accelerations appear to be detectable after calibration against the
Advanced LIGO (LIGO II). Motivated by this insight, we address the issue of the
pulsar kick at birth. We show that during the short rise fling each run away
pulsar (RAP) generates a GW signal with characteristic amplitude and frequency
that makes it detectable by current GW interferometers. For a realistic
analysis, an efficiency parameter is introduced to quantify the expenditure of
the rise fling kinetic energy, which is estimated from the linear momentum
conservation law applied to the supernova explosion that kicks out the pulsar.
The remaining energy is supposed to be used to make the star to spin. Thus, a
comparison with the spin of ATNF pulsars having velocity in the interval
400-500 km s$^{-1}$ is performed. The resulting difference suggests that other
mechanisms should dissipate part of that energy to produce the observed pulsar
spin periods. Meanwhile, the kick phenomenon may also occur in globular and
open star clusters at the formation or disruption of very short period compact
binary systems wherein abrupt velocity and acceleration similar to those given
to RAPs during the short rise fling can be imparted to each orbital partner.
Thus pulsar astrometry from micro- to nano-arsec scales might be of much help.
In case of a supernova, the RAP GW signal could be a benchmark for the GW
signal from the core collapse.

the Chandra public archive and builds on the findings of Paper I, which
demonstrated that hydrostatic equilibrium in elliptical galaxies holds, at
best, only approximately and that the shape of the X-ray isophotes is unrelated
to the shape of the gravitational potential. Instead, the gas is almost always
asymmetrically disturbed. In this paper, we quantify the amount of asymmetry
and study its correlation with other galaxy properties. We also determine radio
powers and derive X-ray AGN luminosities for our galaxy sample. We find that
the amount of asymmetry in the gas is correlated with both measures of AGN
activity, in the sense that the hot gas is more disturbed in galaxies with
higher radio and X-ray AGN luminosities. We find no evidence that galaxy
density has significant effects on gas morphology. We do however find evidence
for a correlation between gas asymmetry and the presence of hot ambient gas,
which we interpret as a signature of hydrodynamic interactions with an external
ambient medium. Surprisingly, the AGN-morphology connection persists all the
way down to the weakest AGN luminosities in rather X-ray faint galaxies. This
is strong morphological evidence that supports the general importance of AGN
feedback, even in normal elliptical galaxies.

difficult to assess the transmission potential of a probable future pandemic,
historical epidemiologic data is readily available from previous pandemics, and
as a reference quantity for future pandemic planning, mathematical and
statistical analyses of historical data are crucial. In particular, because
many historical records tend to document only the temporal distribution of
cases or deaths (i.e. epidemic curve), our review focuses on methods to
maximize the utility of time-evolution data and to clarify the detailed
mechanisms of the spread of influenza. First, we highlight structured epidemic
models and their parameter estimation method which can quantify the detailed
disease dynamics including those we cannot observe directly.
Duration-structured epidemic systems are subsequently presented, offering firm
understanding of the definition of the basic and effective reproduction
numbers. When the initial growth phase of an epidemic is investigated, the
distribution of the generation time is key statistical information to
appropriately estimate the transmission potential using the intrinsic growth
rate. Applications of stochastic processes are also highlighted to estimate the
transmission potential using the similar data. Critically important
characteristics of influenza data are subsequently summarized, followed by our
conclusions to suggest potential future methodological improvements.

$\Lambda$CDM to a precision not see before in cosmology. Such is not the case
on galactic length scales, however, where the `cuspy-core' problem has
demonstrated our lack of understanding of structure formation. Here, we propose
a solution to the 'cuspy-core' problem based on the observation that with the
discovery of Dark Energy, $\Lambda_{DE}$, there is now a universal length
scale, $\lambda_{DE}=c/(\Lambda_{DE} G)^{1/2}$, associated with the universe.
This length scale allows for an extension of the geodesic equations of motion
that affects only the motion of massive test particles; the motion of massless
test particles are not affected, and such phenomenon as gravitational lensing
remain unchanged. An evolution equation for the density profile is derived, and
an effective free energy density functional for it is constructed. We
conjecture that the pseudoisothermal profile is preferred over the cusp-like
profile because it has a lower effective free energy. A cosmological check of
the theory is made using the observed rotational velocities and core sizes of
1393 spiral galaxies. We calculate $\sigma_8$ to be $0.68_{\pm0.11}$; this is
within experimental error of the WMAP value $0.761_{-0.048}^{+0.049}$. We then
calculate $R_{200}=270_{\pm 130}$ kpc, which is in agreement with observations.
We estimate the fractional density of matter that cannot be determined through
gravity to be $0.197_{\pm 0.017}$; this is nearly equal to the WMAP value for
the fractional density of nonbaryonic matter $0.196^{+0.025}_{-0.026}$. The
fractional density of matter that can be determined through gravity is then
calculated to be $0.041_{-0.031}^{+0.030}$; this is nearly equal to

signal incurs interference from a finite number of users (interfering users)
that use single codebooks for transmitting their own messages. The receiver,
however, is allowed to decode interfering users' messages. This means the
signal transmitted from any interfering user is either decoded or considered as
noise at the receiver side. We propose the following method to obtain an
achievable rate for this channel. Assuming its own data is decoded
successfully, the receiver partitions the set of interfering users into two
disjoint subsets, namely the set of decodable users and the set of
non-decodable users. Then the transmitter's rate is chosen such that the
intended signal can be jointly decoded with the set of decodable users. To show
the strength of this method, we prove that for the additive Gaussian channel
with Gaussian interfering users, the Gaussian distribution is optimal and the
achievable rate is the capacity of this channel. To obtain the maximum
achievable rate, one needs to find the maximum decodable subset of interfering
users. Due to the large number of possible choices, having efficient algorithms
that find the set of decodable users with maximum cardinality is desired. To
this end, we propose an algorithm that enables the receiver to accomplish this
task in polynomial time.

vignetting corrected images from the EPIC pn data, and we developed a procedure
that allows a correct background treatment for low surface brightness spectra,
using a local background, together with closed filter observations. Results:
Most of the emission from the halo is at energies below 1 keV. In the disc,
also emission at higher energies is present. The extent of the diffuse emission
along the major axis of the disc is 13.6 kpc. The halo resembles a horn
structure and reaches out to ~9 kpc perpendicular to the disc. Disc regions
that cover star forming regions, like spiral arms, show harder spectra than
regions with lower star forming activity. Models for spectral fits of the disc
regions need at least three components: two thermal plasmas with solar
abundances plus a power law and galactic foreground absorption. Temperatures
are between 0.1 and 0.3 keV and between 0.3 and 0.9 keV for the soft and the
hard component, respectively. The power law component may indicate an
unresolved contribution from X-ray binaries in the disc. The halo emission is
not uniform, neither spatially nor spectrally. The southeastern halo is softer
than the northwestern halo. To model the spectra in the halo, we needed two
thermal plasmas with solar abundances plus galactic foreground absorption.
Temperatures are around 0.1 and 0.3 keV. A comparison between X-ray and UV
emission shows that both originate from the same regions.

coherent spin-orbit dynamics in quantum chromodynamics. The origin of these
effects can be traced to the interplay of chiral dynamics and confinement in
the theory. The most elegant display of the relevant mechanisms occurs in the
Collins functions and the polarizing fragmentation functions and fracture
functions for particles with spin. In the nucleon, these same dynamical
mechanisms generate virtual quantum structures leading to the Boer-Mulders
functions and orbital distributions. Two complementary formalisms for these
distributions appear. The familiar gauge-link formalism incorporates oll
nonperturbative dynamics into nonlocal correlators. The constructive formalism
introduced by the author describes distributions normalized to an intrinsic
property of the nucleon, namely, the currents specified in the
Bakker-Leader-Trueman sum rule. The connection between these two approaches can
be explored in the process dependence of single-spin asymmetries in various
hard-scattering processes. The study of the SU(2) Weyl-Dirac equation in
spherical coordinates allows typical Wilson operators that determine this
process dependence to be evaluated in the coordinate gauge.

one-neutron pickup. The hindrance of the fusion data that is observed at
energies far below the Coulomb barrier cannot be explained by a conventional
ion-ion potential and defining the fusion in terms of ingoing-wave boundary
conditions (IWBC). We show that the hindrance can be explained fairly well by
applying the M3Y double-folding potential which has been corrected with a
calibrated, repulsive term that simulates the effect of nuclear
incompressibility.
  We show that the coupling to one-neutron transfer channels plays a crucial
role in improving the fit to the data. The best fit is achieved by increasing
the transfer strength by 25% relative to the strength that is required to
reproduce the one-neutron transfer data. The larger strength is not unrealistic
because the calculated inelastic plus transfer cross section is in good
agreement with the measured quasielastic cross section. We finally discuss the
problem of reproducing the fusion data at energies far above the Coulomb
barrier. Here we do not account for the data when we apply the IWBC but the
discrepancy is essentially eliminated by applying the M3Y+repulsion potential
and a weak, short-ranged imaginary potential.

prime order. Our main result is that a polynomial P : F^n -> F is
poorly-distributed only if P is determined by the values of a few polynomials
of lower degree, in which case we say that P has small rank.
  We give several applications of this result, paying particular attention to
consequences for the theory of the so-called Gowers norms. We establish an
inverse result for the Gowers U^{d+1}-norm of functions of the form f(x)=
e_F(P(x)), where P : F^n -> F is a polynomial of degree less than F, showing
that this norm can only be large if f correlates with e_F(Q(x)) for some
polynomial Q : F^n -> F of degree at most d.
  The requirement deg(P) < |F| cannot be dropped entirely. Indeed, we show the
above claim fails in characteristic 2 when d = 3 and deg(P)=4, showing that the
quartic symmetric polynomial S_4 in F_2^n has large Gowers U^4-norm but does
not correlate strongly with any cubic polynomial. This shows that the theory of
Gowers norms in low characteristic is not as simple as previously supposed.
This counterexample has also been discovered independently by Lovett, Meshulam,
and Samorodnitsky.

limits. The average exposure for each of the 14 VHE-candidate AGN is ~7 h live
time, and the observations have an average energy threshold between 230 GeV and
590 GeV. Upper limits for these 14 AGN range from <0.9% to <4.9% of the Crab
Nebula flux, and eight of these are the most constraining ever reported for the
object. The brief (<2.2 h each) large-zenith-angle observations yield upper
limits for Mkn 501 (<20% Crab above 2.5 TeV) and 1ES 1218+304 (<17% Crab above
1.0 TeV), and a marginal detection (3.5 sigma) of Mkn 421 (50% Crab above 2.1
TeV). 1ES 1101-232 was marginally detected (3.6 sigma, 1.7% Crab above 260 GeV)
during the 2006 (13.7 h live time) observations, but not in the 2007 (4.6 h
live time) data. The upper limit in 2007 (<1.9% Crab above 260 GeV) is below
the average flux measured by HESS from 2004-2006.

aligned by an intense optical laser. Initially, the density matrix of the
system is composed of the electronic ground state of the molecules and a
thermal ensemble of rigid-rotor eigenstates. We formulate equations of motion
of the two-color (laser plus x rays) rotational-electronic problem. The
interaction with the laser is assumed to be nonresonant; it is described by an
electric dipole polarizability tensor. X-ray absorption is approximated as a
one-photon process. It is shown that the equations can be separated such that
the interaction with the laser can be treated independently of the x rays. The
laser-only density matrix is propagated numerically. After each time step, the
x-ray absorption is calculated. We apply our theory to study adiabatic
alignment of bromine molecules (Br2). The required dynamic polarizabilities are
determined using the ab initio linear response methods coupled-cluster singles
(CCS), second-order approximate coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CC2), and
coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD). For the description of x-ray
absorption on the sigma_g 1s --> sigma_u 4p resonance, a parameter-free
two-level model is used for the electronic structure of the molecules. Our
theory opens up novel perspectives for the quantum control of x-ray radiation.

wireless network to act as relays in aiding the communication between the
source-destination pair. Optimal relay subset selection with the objective of
maximizing the overall throughput is a difficult problem that depends on
multiple factors including node locations, queue lengths and power consumption.
A partial decode-and-forward strategy is applied in this paper to improve the
tractability of the relay selection problem and performance of the overall
network.
  Note that the number of relays selected ultimately determines the performance
of the network. This paper benchmarks this performance by determining the net
diversity achieved using the relays selected and the partial decode-and-forward
strategy. This framework is subsequently used to further transform relay
selection into a simpler relay placement problem, and two proximity-based
approximation algorithms are developed to determine the appropriate set of
relays to be selected in the network. Other selection strategies such as random
relay selection and a greedy algorithm that relies on channel state information
are also presented. This paper concludes by showing that the proposed
proximity-based relay selection strategies yield near-optimal expected rates
for a small number of selected relays.

The AGN is assumed to reside in a group of galaxies, and an outburst excites a
shock wave in the hot gas in the group. We calculate the impact of the shock
wave on the galaxies. We find that if the energy of the outburst is extremely
large (E_AGN ~6x10^61 erg) as the one recently observed in clusters, the impact
is strong enough to strip the cold interstellar medium in the disc of the
galaxies in the inner region of the group. Moreover, even in the outer region
of the group, the warm gas in the halo of the galaxies would be stripped, even
if the energy of the outburst is ~6x10^60 erg. These would decrease star
formation activity of the galaxies. If these galaxies fall into the group
centre through dynamical friction and their interstellar medium is the fuel of
the supermassive black hole in the AGN, the outburst would serve as feedback.
While this mechanism works only when E_AGN is extremely large, such outbursts
have not been observed in groups at low redshift; it would work at high
redshift rather than at low redshift.

for near-critical tensions branes live inside very deep throats which
efficiently compactify the angular dimension. In there, 4D gravity first
changes to 5D, and only later to 6D. The crossover from 4D to 5D is independent
of the tension, but the crossover from 5D to 6D is not. This shows how the
vacuum energy problem manifests in BIG: instead of tuning vacuum energy to
adjust the 4D curvature, generically one must tune it to get the desired
crossover scales and the hierarchy between the scales governing the 4D \to 5D
\to 6D transitions. In the near-critical limit, linearized perturbation theory
remains under control below the crossover scale, and we find that linearized
gravity around the vacuum looks like a scalar-tensor theory.

Experiments can be used to determine four independent combinations of the

number of special spectral features (such as the presence of low-lying singlets
below the first triplet and the existence of localized magnons) we focus on two
major issues. The first concerns the nature of the excitations above the
plateau phase at 1/3 of the saturation magnetization Ms. Our exact
diagonalizations for the s=1/2 icosidodecahedron reveal that the low-lying
plateau states are adiabatically connected to the degenerate collinear
``up-up-down'' ground states of the Ising point, at the same time being well
isolated from higher excitations. A complementary physical picture emerges from
the derivation of an effective quantum dimer model which reveals the central
role of the topology and the intrinsic spin s. We also give a prediction for
the low energy excitations and thermodynamic properties of the spin s=5/2
icosidodecahedron Mo72Fe30. In the second part we focus on the low-energy
spectra of the s>1/2 Heisenberg model in view of interpreting the broad
inelastic neutron scattering response reported for Mo72Fe30. To this end we
demonstrate the simultaneous presence of several broadened low-energy ``towers
of states'' or ``rotational bands'' which arise from the large discrete spatial
degeneracy of the classical ground states, a generic feature of highly
frustrated clusters. This semiclassical interpretation is further corroborated
by their striking symmetry pattern which is shown, by an independent group
theoretical analysis, to be a characteristic fingerprint of the classical
coplanar ground states.

""inverse"" morphological transformation: a bulge dominated galaxy accretes a gas
disk, dramatically reducing the system's bulge-to-disk mass ratio. During their
formation, present day galaxies may execute many such cycles across the Hubble
diagram. A good candidate for such a ""hermaphrodite"" galaxy is NGC 3108: a
dust-lane early-type galaxy which has a large amount of HI gas distributed in a
large scale disk. We present narrow band H_alpha and R-band imaging, and
compare the results with the HI distribution. The emission is in two
components: a nuclear bar and an extended disk component which coincides with
the HI distribution. This suggests that a stellar disk is currently being
formed out of the HI gas. The spatial distributions of the H_alpha and HI
emission and the HII regions are consistent with a barred spiral structure,
extending some 20 kpc in radius. We measure an extinction- corrected SFR of
0.42 Msun/yr. The luminosity function of the HII regions is similar to other
spiral galaxies, with a power law index of -2.1, suggesting that the star
formation mechanism is similar to other spiral galaxies. We measured the
current disk mass and find that it is too massive to have been formed by the
current SFR over the last few Gyr. It is likely that the SFR in NGC 3108 was
higher in the past. With the current SFR, the disk in NGC 3108 will grow to be
~6.2x10^9 Msun in stellar mass within the next 5.5 Gyr. While this is
substantial, the disk will be insignificant compared with the large bulge mass:
the final stellar mass disk-to-bulge ratio will be ~0.02. NGC 3108 will fail to
transform into anything resembling a spiral without a boost in the SFR and
additional supply of gas.

no energy gap, the slow relaxation still takes place. Thus, we call this
phenomenon ``entropic slowing down''. Here, we study the mechanism of entropic
slowing down quantitatively in an Ising spin model with the so-called decorated

data show that there is a significant deletion component in the underlying web

introduce a new mechanism of preferential survival (PS), where nodes are
removed according to a degree-dependent deletion kernel. We use the mean-field

Attachment (PA), Double PA (DPA), and a tunable PS, where c nodes (c<1) are

large-scale simulations. One of our results shows that, unlike in the case of
uniform deletion, the PS kernel when coupled with the standard PA mechanism,
can lead to heavy-tailed power law networks even in the presence of extreme
turnover in the network. Moreover, a weak DPA mechanism, coupled with PS, can
help make the network even more heavy-tailed, especially in the limit when
deletion and insertion rates are almost equal, and the overall network growth

treating the major issues associated with the validation process: quantifying
multiple sources of error and uncertainty in computer models; combining
multiple sources of information; and being able to adapt to different, but
related scenarios. Two complications that frequently arise in practice are the
need to deal with highly irregular functional data and the need to acknowledge

both complications. A key part of the approach utilizes a wavelet

to ultimately compare computer model output with field output. The generality
of the methodology is only limited by the capability of a combination of

between two liquids is mainly obtained by natural diffusion which may take a

modifying the channel geometry or by creating an external perturbation of the

oscillating transverse flow is generated by heating the liquid. Depending on

controlled the transverse flow amplitude. A chaotic like mixing is then induced
under particular conditions depending on volume expansion, liquid velocity,

the 11.3um PAH feature and the H_2 S(1) line correlate closely, and we conclude
that shocks in the outflow regions have no measurable influence on the H_2
emission. The [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio is on average low at ~0.18, and shows little
variations across the plane, indicating that the dominant stellar population is
evolved (5 - 6 Myr) and well distributed. There is a slight increase of the
ratio with distance from the galactic plane of M82 which we attribute to a
decrease in gas density. Our observations indicate that the star formation rate
has decreased significantly in the last 5 Myr. The quantities of dust and
molecular gas in the central area of the galaxy argue against starvation and
for negative feedback processes, observable through the strong extra-planar
outflows.

were derived from a spot model applied to the contemporaneous light and

different gravity and the higher activity level of the former. Moreover, we
find a clear anti-correlation between the H-alpha emission and the photospheric
diagnostics. We have also detected a modulation of the intensity of the HeI D_3
line with the star rotation. A rough reconstruction of the 3D structure of
their atmospheres has been also performed by applying a spot/plage model to the

also suggested. In addition, a strong flare affecting the H-alpha, the HeI D_3,

derived from conventional hot embossing technology to fabricate the

involve the metal deposition, photolithography, electroplating, hot embossing
and hot embed techniques. The fundamental concept of the hot embed technology
is that the temperature should be increased above Tg of polymer, and the
polymer becomes plastic and viscous and could be molded. According to the
fundamental concept, the metal layer on the silicon/glass substrate could be
embedded into polymer material during the hot embossing process. Afterward, the
metal layer is bonded together with the polymer after removing the substrate in
the de-embossing step. Finally, the electrostatic switch is fabricated on
polymethylmethacrylate(PMMA) material to demonstrate the novel method.

field, in which the effect of fringing field is modeled as a serial capacitor.
Numerical simulation demonstrates the suitability of this formulation. Based on
this model, a robust control scheme is constructed using the theory of

stability and the performance of the system using this control scheme are

focused on ion tracks projected onto the axis of the initial direction of

  formation in colour screening scenario","18 pages, 6 figures, revised version",,,,"hep-ph",,"  In order to study the properties of $J/\psi$ (1S) in the deconfining medium,
we extend our previous formalism [Phys. Lett. B {\bf 656}, 45 (2007)] on
$J/\psi$ suppression at mid-rapidity using the colour screening framework. Our
formalism is more general as the complete rapidity, transverse momentum and
centrality dependence including $J/\psi$ suppression at forward as well as
mid-rapidity can be computed directly from it. Careful attention is paid to the
role of the medium's proper time in determining the locus of the screening
region where $J/\psi$ gets suppressed. Other important ingredients in the
calculation are bag model equation of state for QGP, the longitudinal expansion
of the QGP fluid obeying Bjorken's boost invariant scaling law and
non-sequential/sequential melting of $\chi_c$ (1P) as well as $\psi^{'}$ (2S)
higher resonances. Upon comparison with the recent data of PHENIX collaboration
on $J/\psi$ suppression at forward and mid-rapidity regions, we find that our
model shows a reasonable agreement with the data without incorporating any
sequential decay mechanism of higher charmonia states. Furthermore, we observe
a larger suppression at forward rapidity in our model which is again well
supported by the PHENIX data and also gives a hint that a scenario based on
directly produced $J/\psi$'s is preferable.

symmetry that is non-native to hexagonal crystals.
  Eight-band k.p calculations reveal a mechanism that can explain the observed
polarizations: The character of the hole(s) in an excitonic complex determines
the polarization direction of the respective emission if the QD is slightly
elongated. Transitions involving A-band holes are polarized parallel to the
elongation; transitions involving B-type holes are polarized in the orthogonal
direction. The energetic separation of both hole states is smaller than 10 meV.
The mechanism leading to the linear polarizations is not restricted to InGaN
QDs, but should occur in other wurtzite-nitride QDs and in materials with
similar valence band structure.

produced in multifragmentation reactions may have lower nucleon density than
the equilibrium density of cold nuclei. In terms of liquid-drop model this
effect can be taken into account by reducing the bulk energy of fragments. We
study the influence of this change on fragment yields and isotope distributions
within the framework of the statistical multifragmentation model. Similarities
and differences with previously discussed modifications of symmetry and surface
energies of nuclei are analyzed.

Conjecture for the Gowers norm' states that if the ""$d$-th Gowers norm"" of a
function $f:\F_p^N \to \F_p$ is non-negligible, that is larger than a constant
independent of $N$, then $f$ can be non-trivially approximated by a degree
$d-1$ polynomial. The conjecture is known to hold for $d=2,3$ and for any prime
$p$. In this paper we show the conjecture to be false for $p=2$ and for $d =
4$, by presenting an explicit function whose 4-th Gowers norm is
non-negligible, but whose correlation any polynomial of degree 3 is
exponentially small.
  Essentially the same result (with different correlation bounds) was
independently obtained by Green and Tao \cite{gt07}. Their analysis uses a
modification of a Ramsey-type argument of Alon and Beigel \cite{ab} to show
inapproximability of certain functions by low-degree polynomials. We observe
that a combination of our results with the argument of Alon and Beigel implies
the inverse conjecture to be false for any prime $p$, for $d = p^2$.

of nuclei in the inner crust of neutron stars can be approximated by the energy
that binds the vortex to a single nucleus. Indeed, although the pinning energy
is the quantity relevant to the theory of pulsar glitches, so far full quantum
calculations have been possible only for the binding energy. Physically, the
presence of nearby nuclei can be neglected if the lattice is dilute, namely
with nuclei sufficiently distant from each other. We find that the dilute limit
is reached only for quite large Wigner-Seitz cells, with radii > 55 fm; these
are found only in the outermost low-density regions of the inner crust. We
conclude that present quantum calculations do not correspond to the pinning
energies in almost the entire inner crust and thus their results are not
predictive for the theory of glitches.

values of 3He in a couple of planetary nebulae, we propose that thermohaline
mixing is inhibited by a fossil magnetic field in red giant stars that are
descendants of Ap stars. We examine the effect of a magnetic field on the
salt-finger instability, using a local analysis. We obtain a threshold for the
magnetic field of 10^4 - 10^5 Gauss, above which it inhibits thermohaline
mixing in red giant stars located at or above the bump. Fields of that order
are expected in the descendants of the Ap stars, taking into account the
contraction of their core. We conclude that in a large fraction of the
descendants of Ap stars thermohaline mixing does not occur. As a consequence
these objects must produce 3He as predicted by the standard theory of stellar
evolution and as observed in the planetary nebulae NGC3242 and J320. The
relative number of such stars with respect to non-magnetic objects that undergo
thermohaline mixing is consistent with the statistical constraint coming from
observations of the carbon isotopic ratio in red giant stars. It also satisfies
the Galactic requirements for the evolution of the 3He abundance.
