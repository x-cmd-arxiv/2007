Three of the stars have H_2 velocity profiles that are centered at the stellar

Each of the stars studied here show observed excitation temperatures, spatial
extents, and kinematics of the H_2 that are most consistent with shock excited

$\sim$1000 times larger than that predicted by standard big bang
nucleosynthesis for the baryon-to-photon ratio inferred from the WMAP data.
Also, the inferred $^7$Li primordial abundance is 3 times smaller than the big
bang prediction. We here describe in detail a possible simultaneous solution to
both the problems of underproduction of $^6$Li and overproduction of $^7$Li in
big bang nucleosynthesis. This solution involves a hypothetical massive,
negatively-charged leptonic particle that would bind to the light nuclei
produced in big bang nucleosynthesis, but would decay long before it could be
detected. We consider only the $X$-nuclear reactions and assume that the effect
of decay products is negligible, as would be the case if lifetime were large or
the mass difference between the charged particle and its daughter were small.
An interesting feature of this paradigm is that, because the particle remains
bound to the existing nuclei after the cessation of the usual big bang nuclear
reactions, a second longer epoch of nucleosynthesis can occur among $X$-nuclei.
We confirm that reactions in which the hypothetical particle is transferred can
occur that greatly enhance the production of $^6$Li while depleting $^7$Li. We
also identify a new reaction that destroys large amounts of $^7$Be, and hence
reduces the ultimate $^7$Li abundance. Thus, big-bang nucleosynthesis in the
presence of these hypothetical particles, together with or without an event of
stellar processing, can simultaneously solve the two Li abundance problems.

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code [Rosenberg, Fournier, Fischer, Pouquet, J. Comp.
Phys. 215, 59-80 (2006)] is applied to simulate the problem of MHD island
coalescence instability (MICI) in two dimensions. MICI is a fundamental MHD
process that can produce sharp current layers and subsequent reconnection and
heating in a high-Lundquist number plasma such as the solar corona [Ng and
Bhattacharjee, Phys. Plasmas, 5, 4028 (1998)]. Due to the formation of thin
current layers, it is highly desirable to use adaptively or statically refined
grids to resolve them, and to maintain accuracy at the same time. The output of
the spectral-element static adaptive refinement simulations are compared with
simulations using a finite difference method on the same refinement grids, and
both methods are compared to pseudo-spectral simulations with uniform grids as
baselines. It is shown that with the statically refined grids roughly scaling
linearly with effective resolution, spectral element runs can maintain accuracy
significantly higher than that of the finite difference runs, in some cases
achieving close to full spectral accuracy.

  of Bit Error Rate and a Lower Bound of Asymptotic Multiuser Efficiency","To appear in IEEE Trans. on Communications",,"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.06.060400",,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  In this paper, the bit error performance of a family of likelihood ascent
search (LAS) multiuser detectors is analyzed. An upper bound on the BER of any
LAS detector is obtained by bounding the fixed point region with the worst
initial detector. The concept of indecomposable errors developed by Verdu is
applied to tighten the upper bound. In a special instance, the upper bound is
reduced to that for all the local maximum likelihood detectors. The upper bound
is comparable with that of the optimum detector obtained by Verdu. A lower
bound on the asymptotic multiuser efficiency (AME) is then obtained. It is
shown that there are nontrivial CDMA channels such that a LAS detector can
achieve unit AME regardless of user number. The AME lower bound provides a
means for further seeking a good set of spreading sequences and power
distribution for spectral and power efficient CDMA.

appears as small patches of traveling waves which eventually spread to the
entire circumference. The ripples drift slowly in the driving direction.
Interesting secondary dynamics of the saturated ripples were observed, as well
as various ripple creation and destruction events. All of these effects are
captured qualitatively by 2D soft particle simulations in which a disk rolls
over a bed of poly-disperse particles in a periodic box. These simulations show
that compaction and segregation are inessential to the ripple phenomenon. We
also discuss a simplified scaling model which gives some insight into the

rope-coiling effect, in which the thread buckles to form loops. If the surface
is replaced by a belt moving with speed $U$, the rotational symmetry of the
buckling instability is broken and a wealth of interesting states are observed
[See S. Chiu-Webster and J. R. Lister, J. Fluid Mech., {\bf 569}, 89 (2006)].
We experimentally studied this ""fluid mechanical sewing machine"" in a new, more
precise apparatus. As $U$ is reduced, the steady catenary thread bifurcates
into a meandering state in which the thread displacements are only transverse
to the motion of the belt. We measured the amplitude and frequency $\omega$ of
the meandering close to the bifurcation. For smaller $U$, single-frequency
meandering bifurcates to a two-frequency ""figure eight"" state, which contains a
significant $2\omega$ component and parallel as well as transverse
displacements. This eventually reverts to single-frequency coiling at still
smaller $U$. More complex, highly hysteretic states with additional frequencies
are observed for larger nozzle heights. We propose to understand this zoology
in terms of the generic amplitude equations appropriate for resonant
interactions between two oscillatory modes with frequencies $\omega$ and
$2\omega$. The form of the amplitude equations captures both the axisymmetry of
the U=0 coiling state and the symmetry-breaking effects induced by the moving
belt.

described in terms of skyrmion matter changing into half-skyrmion matter. The
intermediate phase between the density $n_p$ at which a skyrmion turns into two
half skyrmions and the chiral transition density $n_c^{\chi SR}$ at which
hadronic matter changes over to quark matter corresponds to a chiral symmetry
restored phase characterized by a vanishing quark condensate and a {\em
non-vanishing} pion decay constant. When hidden local fields are incorporated,
the vector manifestation of Harada-Yamawaki HLS theory implies that as density
approaches $n_c^{\chi SR}$, the gauge coupling $g$ goes to zero (in the chiral
limit) and the symmetry ""swells"" to $SU(N_f)^4$ as proposed by Georgi for the
""vector limit."" This enhanced symmetry, not present in QCD, can be interpreted
as ""emergent"" in medium due to collective excitations. The fractionization of
skyrmions into half-skyrmions resembles closely the magnetic N\'eel--to-valence
bond solid (VBS) paramagnet transition where ""baby"" half-skyrmions enter as
relevant degrees of freedom in the intermediate phase. It is suggested that the
half-skyrmion phase in dense matter corresponds to the ""hadronic freedom""
regime that plays a singularly important role in inducing kaon condensation
that leads to the collapse of massive compact stars into black holes..

necessary part of Landau's criterion, adequate for non-translationally
invariant systems, d oes not hold for trapped Bose gases in the GP limit. As a
consequence, if the compressibility is detected to be very large (infinite by

in case the system is a tranlational superfluid, while the Landau criterion is
the relevant one if translational superfluidity is absent.

The amplification of such uncertainties through upward or downward transitions
by a homogenisation model is emphasized and exemplified with the Mori-Tanaka
model. In particular, the sensitivity to data uncertainty in the inverse
determination of constituent parameters based on downward transitions is
stressed on an example. Then a database improvement method, which exploits
simultaneously the available information on constitutive uncertainties at all
scales instead of just propagating those associated with one scale, is
presented and shown to yield substantial reductions in uncertainty for both the
constitutive parameters and the response of structures. The latter finding is
demonstrated on two examples of structures, with significant gains in
confidence obtained on both.

an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero in two different ways. One
is defined as a quotient stack via a hypersurface singularity for a regular
system of weights and the other is defined via the signature of the same
regular system of weights.
  The main result in this paper is that if a regular system of weights is of
dual type then these two weighted projective lines have equivalent abelian
categories of coherent sheaves. As a corollary, we can show that the
triangulated categories of the graded singularity associated to a regular
system of weights has a full exceptional collection, which is expected from
homological mirror symmetries.
  Main theorem of this paper will be generalized to more general one, to the
case when a regular system of weights is of genus zero, which will be given in
the joint paper with Kajiura and Saito. Since we need more detailed study of
regular systems of weights and some knowledge of algebraic geometry of
Deligne--Mumford stacks there, the author write a part of the result in this

to its quark model interpretation in terms of a pentaquark combination

effect on the pentaquark mass of (a) deviations from the flavour symmetric
limit and (b) different strengths of the doublet and triplet hyperfine
interactions. Reference values of these parameters yield a $\Theta^+$ mass
prediction of 1601 MeV but it can comfortably accommodate 1540 MeV for
