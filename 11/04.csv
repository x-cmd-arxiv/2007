This model is used to extract the T=0 pairing gap in the fully paired
superfluid state. The recently measured particle density profiles are in good
agreement with the theoretical predictions obtained from the universal
parameters from previous Quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We find that the T=0
pairing gap is greater than 0.4 times the Fermi energy $E_F$, with a preferred
value of $0.45 \pm 0.05$ $E_F$. The ratio of the pairing gap $\Delta$ to the

fermions in which individual pairs are unbound.

the core is the allowance for a possible primordial phase space density limit

this model has a constant density core and falls off rapidly beyond. The new
model is shown to improve the fits to the observations of LSB galaxy rotation

lengthened dynamical friction time scale for the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy

galaxy clusters. A constant gas entropy floor is predicted whose adiabatic
constant provides a lower limit in accord with observed galaxy cluster values.

probability of forming other galaxies is also strongly enhanced. Given an
observed flux of a galaxy, the inferred mass of its host halo tends to be
larger as its inferred redshift increases. As the mass and redshift of a galaxy
halo increase, the expected clustering of other galaxies around it gets
stronger. It is therefore possible to verify the high-redshift identity of a
galaxy (prior to an unambiguous spectral identification) from the clustering of
other galaxies around it. We illustrate this method for the massive galaxy
suggested by Mobasher et al. (2005) to be at redshift z~6.5. If this galaxy
were to exist at z~6.5, there should have been a mean of ~10 galaxies larger
than a hundredth of its mass and having z-band magnitudes less than ~25
detected as i-dropouts in the HUDF. We calculate an approximate probability
distribution for neighbor galaxies and determine that there is less than a
~0.3% chance of detecting no massive neighbor galaxies. The lack of other
massive z~6.5 galaxies in the HUDF image argues that the Mobasher et al. (2005)
galaxy is instead a low redshift interloper. We generalize our results to other
galaxy masses and redshifts.

carbon-rich evolved stars. PAHs could form from acetylene addition to the
phenyl radical (C6H5), which is closely chemically related to benzene (C6H6)
and ortho-benzyne (o-C6H4). To date, circumstellar chemical models have been
limited to only a partial treatment of benzene-related chemistry, and so the
expected abundances of these species are unclear. A detection of benzene has
been reported in the envelope of the proto-planetary nebula (PPN) CRL 618, but
no other benzene-related species has been detected in this or any other source.
The spectrum of o-C6H4 is significantly simpler and stronger than that of C6H5,

Bank Telescope. No transitions were detected, but an upper limit on the column

coexistence of two distinct gaps in hole doped cuprates, where the gap near the
nodal direction scales with the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$,
while that in the antinodal direction scales with the pseudogap temperature. We
present model calculations which show that most of the characteristic features
observed in the recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) as
well as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) two-gap studies are consistent with
a scenario in which the pseudogap has a non-superconducting origin in a
competing phase. Our analysis indicates that, near optimal doping,
superconductivity can quench the competing order at low temperatures, and that
some of the key differences observed between the STM and ARPES results can give
insight into the superlattice symmetry of the competing order.

sunspots has been demonstrated over recent years using a number of modelling
techniques, including ray theory, perturbation theory, differential eigensystem
analysis, and direct numerical simulation. These show that significant energy
may be transferred between the fast and slow modes in the neighbourhood of the
equipartition layer where the Alfven and sound speeds coincide. However, most
of the models so far have been two dimensional. In three dimensions the Alfven
wave may couple to the magneto-acoustic waves with important implications for
energy loss from helioseismic modes and for oscillations in the atmosphere
above the spot. In this paper, we carry out a numerical ``scattering
experiment'', placing an acoustic driver 4 Mm below the solar surface and
monitoring the acoustic and Alfvenic wave energy flux high in an isothermal
atmosphere placed above it. These calculations indeed show that energy
conversion to upward travelling Alfven waves can be substantial, in many cases
exceeding loss to slow (acoustic) waves. Typically, at penumbral magnetic field
strengths, the strongest Alfven fluxes are produced when the field is inclined
30-40 degrees from the vertical, with the vertical plane of wave propagation
offset from the vertical plane containing field lines by some 60-80 degrees.

year. We investigated whether these radically differently sampled data can also
be used to search for transiting extrasolar planets, in particular in the light
of future projects such as PanSTARRS and SkyMapper, which will monitor large
fields, but mostly not at a cadence typical for transit studies. We selected
data for ~15700 stars with 13.0<I<16.0 in three OGLE-II fields towards the
galactic disc in the constellation Carina, each with 500-600 epochs of I-band
photometry. These light curves were first detrended using Sys-Rem, after which
they were searched for low amplitude transits using the Box Least Squares
algorithm. The detrending algorithm significantly decreased the scatter in the
light curves, from an average of 0.5% down to 0.2-0.3% for stars with I<15.
Several dozens of eclipsing binaries and low amplitude transits were found, of
which 13 candidates exhibit transits with such depth and duration that they are
possibly caused by an object with a radius less than twice that of Jupiter.
Eleven out of these thirteen candidates show significant ellipsoidal light
variations and are unlikely to host a transiting extrasolar planet. However,
OGLE2-TR-L9 (CAR_SC2_75679), is an excellent planet candidate comparable to the
known OGLE-III transiting planets, and deserves further follow-up observations.

there are indications that a low close binary fraction among extreme horizontal
branch (EHB) stars is a common feature in globular star clusters. On the other
hand, the field EHB population shows evidence of a remarkably high binary
fraction. Such a difference among globular cluster and field populations,
although not yet explained in detail on the basis of theoretical models, must
necessarily be related to different formation histories for EHB stars in the
field and in clusters. In this framework, preliminary results indicate that
close systems could be relatively common in the peculiar globular cluster NGC
2808, although the sample of studied stars is still small. This would imply
that not all clusters share the same behavior, as far as EHB star formation is
concerned. We briefly explore possible explanations for these results.

there is a finite number of spherical cloaks located in different points in
space. We prove that for any incident plane wave, at any frequency, the
scattered wave is identically zero. We also consider the scattering of finite
energy wave packets. We prove that the scattering matrix is the identity, i.e.,
that for any incoming wave packet the outgoing wave packet is the same as the
incoming one. This proves that the invisibility cloaks can not be detected in
any scattering experiment with electromagnetic waves in high order
transformation media, and in particular in the first order transformation media
of Pendry et al. We also prove that the high order invisibility cloaks, as well
as the first order ones, cloak passive and active devices. The cloaked objects
completely decouple from the exterior. Actually, the cloaking outside is
independent of what is inside the cloaked objects. The electromagnetic waves
inside the cloaked objects can not leave the concealed regions and viceversa,
the electromagnetic waves outside the cloaked objects can not go inside the
concealed regions. As we prove our results for media that are obtained by
transformation from general anisotropic materials, we prove that it is possible
to cloak objects inside general crystals.

Indeed, this relation is satisfied by the overlap, domain wall and perfect
action fermion kernel.
  In a recent work we have shown that it is possible to take a direct RG
approach for fermions in the presence of gauge fields. This is due to an
algebraically implicit blocking technique which yields a Schur-complementary
coarse Dirac operator. Using a Schur complement approximation which is stable
and regular, the scheme can be iterated to the fixed point.
  In this talk, we elaborate more on the direct RG approach and show how to get
highly improved chiral fermions on the coarse lattice with the gauge fields
remaining on the fine lattice. We give numerical examples in the case of
lattice QCD using QCDLAB {\tt http://phys.fshn.edu.al/qcdlab.html}

supernova remnant Kes 27 with Chandra. The X-ray spectrum of Kes 27 is
characterized by K lines from Mg, Si, S, Ar, and Ca. The X-ray emitting gas is
found to be enriched in sulphur and calcium. The broadband and tri-color images
show two incomplete shell-like features in the northeastern half and brightness
fading with increasing radius in the southwest. There are over 30 unresolved
sources within the remnant. None show characteristics typical of young neutron
stars. The maximum diffuse X-ray intensity coincides with a radio bright region
along the eastern border. In general, gas in the inner region is at higher
temperature and emission is brighter than from the outer region. The gas in the
remnant appears to approach ionization equilibrium. The overall morphology can
be explained by the evolution of the remnant in an ambient medium with a
density enhancement from west to east. We suggest that the remnant was born in
a pre-existing cavity and that the inner bright emission is due to the
reflection of the initial shock from the dense cavity wall. This scenario may
provide a new candidate mechanism for the X-ray morphology of other thermal
composite supernova remnants.

an interface property but stems from all LaTiO_3 planes.
