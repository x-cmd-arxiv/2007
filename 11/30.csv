(NUSUGRA), and in D brane models are analyzed. The analysis exhibits the
existence of Higgs Mass Patterns (HPs) (for $\mu>0$) where the CP odd Higgs
could be the next heavier particle beyond the LSP and sometimes even lighter
than the LSP. It is shown that the Higgs production cross sections from the HPs
are typically the largest enhancing the prospects for their detection at the
LHC. Indeed it is seen that the recent Higgs production limits from CDF/D\O\
are beginning to put constraints on the HPs. It is also seen that the $B_s\to
\mu^+\mu^-$ limits constrain the HPs more stringently. Predictions of the Higgs
production cross sections for these patterns at the LHC are made. We compute
the neutralino-proton cross sections $\sigma (\chi p)$ for dark matter
experiments and show that the largest $\sigma (\chi p)$ also arise from the HPs
and further that the HPs and some of the other patterns are beginning to be
constrained by the most recent data from CDMS and from Xenon10 experiments.
Finally, it is shown that the prospects are bright for the discovery of dark
matter with $\sigma(\chi p)$ in the range $10^{-44\pm .5}$cm$^2$ due to a
""Wall"" consisting of a copious number of parameter points in the Chargino
Patterns (CPs) where the chargino is the NLSP. The Wall, which appears in all
models considered (mSUGRA, NUSUGRA and D branes) and runs up to about a TeV in
LSP mass, significantly enhances the chances for the observation of dark matter
by SuperCDMS, ZEPLIN-MAX, or LUX experiments which are expected to achieve a
sensitivity of $10^{-45}$ cm$^2$ or more.

  theory and quantum gravity","70 pages, actualization, addition of references",,,,"hep-th gr-qc nucl-th quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that there are significant conceptual differences between QM and QFT
which make it difficult to view the latter as just a relativistic extension of
the principles of QM. At the root of this is a fundamental distinction between
Born-localization in QM (which in the relativistic context changes its name to
Newton-Wigner localization) and modular localization which is the localization
underlying QFT, after one liberates it from its standard presentation in terms
of field coordinates. The first comes with a probability notion and projection
operators, whereas the latter describes causal propagation in QFT and leads to
thermal aspects of locally reduced finite energy states. The Born-Newton-Wigner
localization in QFT is only applicable asymptotically and the covariant
correlation between asymptotic in and out localization projectors is the basis
of the existence of an invariant scattering matrix. Taking these significant
differences serious has not only repercussions for the philosophy of science,
but also leads to a new structural properties as a consequence of vacuum
polarization: the area law for localization entropy near the the causal
localization horizon and a more realistic cutoff independent setting for the
cosmological vacuum energy density which is compatible with local covariance.
The article presents some observations about the interface between QFT in CST
and QG.

an ensemble of randomly generated spots. The influence of general relativistic
effects near a black hole is taken into account and it is shown that typical
features of power spectral density can be reproduced. Connection among spots is
also discussed in terms of Hawkes' process, which produces more power at low
frequencies. We derive a semi-analytical way to approximate the resulting
power-spectral density.

4 LINERs hosted by radio galaxies, namely NGC1692, PKS0625-35, 3C88, 3C444,

time-averaged spectral analysis with model-independent information from X-ray
temporal and spectral variability analyses, and with additional broadband
information (UV and radio). Results: The values of the Eddington ratios of our
sample span 2 orders of magnitude. The 4 AGN are adequately fitted by the same
continuum model that comprises at least one thermal component and a partially
absorbed power law, whose relative contribution and photon index vary
substantially from source to source. NGC1692 and PKS0625-35 have fairly steep
power-law components, perhaps indicative of synchrotron emission from a jet.
Conversely, the flat photon index derived for 3C88 may be indicative of a
heavily absorbed object. Finally, the time-averaged spectral properties of
3C444 (Gamma~1.9 and an apparent line-like excess around 6.7 keV) are more in
line with Seyfert galaxies. The temporal analysis reveals that PKS0625-35 and
3C88 are significantly variable in the soft energy band. PKS0625-35 also shows
suggestive evidence of spectral variability on timescales of months. The main
findings from the broadband analysis can be summarized as follows: 1) 3C444,
PKS0625-35, and NGC1692 have alpha_OX values consistent with the well known
alpha_OX -l_UV correlation. 2) No positive correlation is found between L_X and
the inclination angle, suggesting that the X-ray emission is not beamed. 3) The
values of the radio-loudness are inversely proportional to the Eddington ratio
and locate our objects in between the ``radio-loud'' and ``radio-quiet''
branches in the R- l_UV plane.

calculate the evolution of the progenitor star, hydrodynamics and
nucleosynthesis of the SN explosion, and the SN bolometric light curve (LC).
The synthetic bolometric LC is compared with the observed bolometric LC
constructed by integrating the UV, optical, near-infrared (NIR), and
mid-infrared (MIR) fluxes. The progenitor is assumed to be as massive as
$40M_\odot$ on the zero-age main-sequence. The star undergoes extensive mass
loss to reduce its mass down to as small as $6.9M_\odot$, thus becoming a WCO
Wolf-Rayet star. The WCO star model has a thick carbon-rich layer, in which
amorphous carbon grains can be formed. This could explain the NIR brightening
and the dust feature seen in the MIR spectrum. We suggest that the progenitor
of SN 2006jc is a WCO Wolf-Rayet star having undergone strong mass loss and
such massive stars are the important sites of dust formation. We derive the
parameters of the explosion model in order to reproduce the bolometric LC of SN
2006jc by the radioactive decays: the ejecta mass $4.9M_\odot$, hypernova-like
explosion energy $10^{52}$ ergs, and ejected $^{56}$Ni mass $0.22M_\odot$. We
also calculate the circumstellar interaction and find that a CSM with a flat
density structure is required to reproduce the X-ray LC of SN 2006jc. This
suggests a drastic change of the mass-loss rate and/or the wind velocity that
is consistent with the past luminous blue variable (LBV)-like event.

dynamics of a feedback flashing ratchet when the asymmetry of the ratchet
potential and of the feedback protocol favor transport in opposite directions.
The introduction of a time delay in the control strategy allows one to
nontrivially tune the relative relevance of the competing asymmetries leading
to an interesting dynamics. We show that the competition between the
asymmetries leads to a current reversal for large delays. For small ensembles
of particles current reversal appears as the consequence of the emergence of an
open-loop like dynamical regime, while for large ensembles of particles it can
be understood as a consequence of the stabilization of quasiperiodic solutions.

a more efficient manner. This paper focuses on the fundamental limits of
operation of a MIMO cognitive radio network with a single licensed user and a
single cognitive user. The channel setting is equivalent to an interference
channel with degraded message sets (with the cognitive user having access to
the licensed user's message). An achievable region and an outer bound is
derived for such a network setting. It is shown that under certain conditions,
the achievable region is optimal for a portion of the capacity region that
includes sum capacity.

electron acceleration by magnetized turbulence, and show that the simplest
stochastic particle acceleration model with energy independent acceleration and
escape timescales can overcome most of these difficulties. We use the bright
core of the western hotspot of Pictor A as an example to demonstrate the model
characteristics, which may be tested with high energy observations.

for the first time and is found to be well interpreted in terms of the thermal
emission from amorphous carbon of 800$\pm 10$K with the mass of $6.9\pm 0.5
\times 10^{-5}M_{\odot}$ that was formed in the supernova ejecta. This dust
mass newly formed in the ejecta of SN 2006jc is in a range similar to those
obtained for other several dust forming core collapse supernovae based on
recent observations (i.e., $10^{-3}$--$10^{-5}$$M_{\odot}$). Mid-infrared
photometric data with {\it{AKARI}}/IRC MIR-S/S7, S9W, and S11 bands have shown
excess emission over the thermal emission by hot amorphous carbon of 800K. This
mid-infrared excess emission is likely to be accounted for by the emission from
warm amorphous carbon dust of 320$\pm 10$K with the mass of 2.7$^{+0.7}_{-0.5}
\times 10^{-3}M_{\odot}$ rather than by the band emission of astronomical
silicate and/or silica grains. This warm amorphous carbon dust is expected to
have been formed in the mass loss wind associated with the Wolf-Rayet stellar
activity before the SN explosion. Our result suggests that a significant amount
of dust is condensed in the mass loss wind prior to the SN explosion. A
possible contribution of emission bands by precursory SiO molecules in
7.5--9.5$\mu$m is also suggested.

considered to be progenitors of long gamma-ray bursts. We present numerical
simulations of the evolution of the circumstellar medium around a rapidly
rotating 20 Msol star at a metallicity of Z=0.001. Its rotation is fast enough
to produce quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution. While conventionally, a star
of 20 Msol would not evolve into a Wolf-Rayet stage, the considered model
evolves from the main sequence directly to the helium main sequence. We use the
time-dependent wind parameters, such as mass loss rate, wind velocity and
rotation-induced wind anisotropy from the evolution model as input for a 2D
hydrodynamical simulation. While the outer edge of the pressure-driven
circumstellar bubble is spherical, the circumstellar medium close to the star
shows strong non-spherical features during and after the periods of
near-critical rotation. We conclude that the circumstellar medium around
rapidly rotating massive stars differs considerably from the surrounding
material of non-rotating stars of similar mass. Multiple blue-shifted high
velocity absorption components in gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra are
predicted. As a consequence of near critical rotation and short stellar
evolution time scales during the last few thousand years of the star's life, we
find a strong deviation of the circumstellar density profile in the polar
direction from the 1/R^2 density profile normally associated with stellar winds

with the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based facilities, it is now
generally believed that the Universe's expansion is accelerating. Within the
context of standard cosmology, the Universe must therefore contain a third
`dark' component of energy, beyond matter and radiation. However, the current
data are still deemed insufficient to distinguish between an evolving dark
energy component and the simplest model of a time-independent cosmological
constant. In this paper, we examine the role played by our cosmic horizon R0 in
our interrogation of the data, and reach the rather firm conclusion that the
existence of a cosmological constant is untenable. The observations are telling
us that R0=c t0, where t0 is the perceived current age of the Universe, yet a
cosmological constant would drive R0 towards ct (where t is the cosmic time)
only once, and that would have to occur right now. In contrast, scaling
solutions simultaneously eliminate several conundrums in the standard model,
including the `coincidence' and `flatness' problems, and account very well for
the fact that R0=c t0. We show here that for such dynamical dark energy models,
either R0=ct for all time (thus eliminating the apparent coincidence
altogether), or that what we believe to be the current age of the universe is
actually the horizon time th=R0/c, which is always shorter than t0. Our best
fit to the Type Ia supernova data indicates that t0 would then have to be ~16.9
billion years. Though surprising at first, an older universe such as this would
actually eliminate several other long-standing problems in cosmology, including
the (too) early appearance of supermassive black holes (at a redshift > 6) and
the glaring deficit of dwarf halos in the local group.

explain the experimentally observed flow reversal of planar ACEO pumps at high
frequency (above the peak, typically 10-100 kHz), low salt concentration
(1-1000 $\mu$M), and moderate voltage (2-6 V), even if taking into account
Faradaic surface reactions, nonlinear double-layer capacitance and bulk
electrothermal flows. We attribute this failure to the breakdown of the
classical Poisson-Boltzmann model of the diffuse double layer, which assumes a
dilute solution of point-like ions. In spite of low bulk salt concentration,
the large voltage induced across the double layer leads to crowding of the ions
and a related decrease in surface capacitance. Using several mean-field models
for finite-sized ions, we show that steric effects generally lead to high
frequency flow reversal of ACEO pumps, similar to experiments. For quantitative
agreement, however, an unrealistically large effective ion size (several nm)
must be used, which we attribute to neglected correlation effects.

by demanding the existence of merely one conserved local charge. Although the
latter is not a sufficient integrability condition in general, the models often

correlation. We find that the correlation lengthscales of fluctuations in
density and magnetic field magnitude vary strongly with the solar cycle,
whereas correlation lengths of fluctuations in B field components do not. We
find the correlation length of |B| ~ 120 Re at solar minimum and ~ 270 Re at
maximum and the correlation length of density ~ 75 Re at minimum and ~ 170 Re
at minimum. The components of the B field have correlation lengths ~

however, the high-entropy environment is realized in the jet-induced explosion

graph (directed or undirected), two nodes s,t and a time limit T, find an s-t
walk of total length at most T that maximizes the number of distinct nodes
visited by the walk. One obtains a generalization, namely orienteering with
time-windows (also referred to as TSP with time-windows), if each node v has a
specified time-window [R(v), D(v)] and a node v is counted as visited by the
walk only if v is visited during its time-window. For the time-window problem,
an O(\log \opt) approximation can be achieved even for directed graphs if the
algorithm is allowed quasi-polynomial time. However, the best known polynomial
time approximation ratios are O(\log^2 \opt) for undirected graphs and O(\log^4
\opt) in directed graphs. In this paper we make some progress towards closing
this discrepancy, and in the process obtain improved approximation ratios in
several natural settings. Let L(v) = D(v) - R(v) denote the length of the
time-window for v and let \lmax = \max_v L(v) and \lmin = \min_v L(v). Our
results are given below with \alpha denoting the known approximation ratio for
orienteering (without time-windows). Currently \alpha = (2+\eps) for undirected
graphs and \alpha = O(\log^2 \opt) in directed graphs.
  1. An O(\alpha \log \lmax) approximation when R(v) and D(v) are integer
valued for each v.
  2. An O(\alpha \max{\log \opt, \log \frac{\lmax}{\lmin}}) approximation.
  3. An O(\alpha \log \frac{\lmax}{\lmin}) approximation when no start and end
points are specified.
  In particular, if \frac{\lmax}{\lmin} is poly-bounded, we obtain an O(\log n)

complex. All of the theorems in this paper remain true exactly as stated if the
more usual definition of $d_i$ is taken.

fibrations with fibre the classifying space of a cyclic group is stated for

functional theory usually provides a good description of low-lying excitations
of molecules. In the present work, the capability of the adiabatic nonempirical
meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) of Tao, Perdew, Staroverov,
and Scuseria (TPSS) to describe atomic and molecular excitations is tested. The
adiabatic (one-parameter) hybrid version of the TPSS meta-GGA and the adiabatic
GGA of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) are also included in the test. The
results are compared to experiments and to two well-established hybrid
functionals PBE0 and B3LYP. Calculations show that both adiabatic TPSS and
TPSSh functionals produce excitation energies in fairly good agreement with
experiments, and improve upon the adiabatic local spin density approximation
and, in particular, the adiabatic PBE GGA. This further confirms that TPSS is
indeed a reliable nonhybrid universal functional which can serve as the
starting point from which higher-level approximations can be constructed. The
systematic underestimate of the low-lying vertical excitation energies of
molecules with time-dependent density functionals within the adiabatic
approximation suggests that further improvement can be made with nonadiabatic

2500 of these quasars are in the redshift range such that the CIV emission line
is visible in the SDSS spectrum. Utilising the width of these CIV lines and the
luminosity of the nearby continuum, we estimate black hole masses for these

on the photometric variability of our dataset, we create several subsamples by
binning in these two physical parameters. By comparing the ensemble structure
functions of the quasars in these bins, we are able to reproduce the well-known
anticorrelation between luminosity and variability, now showing that this
anticorrelation is independent of the black hole mass. In addition, we find a
correlation between variability and the mass of the central black hole. By
combining these two relations, we identify the Eddington ratio as a possible
driver of quasar variability, most likely due to differences in accretion
efficiency.

z~6. The surface density of i-dropouts thus derived, however, is an order of
magnitude higher than those subsequent studies found in other deep ACS fields,
including the HUDF. Here we revisit this problem, using both the existing and
the new data. We confirm that the large overdensity of i-dropouts does exist in
this field, and that their optical-to-IR colors are similar to those in the
HUDF. However, we have discovered that the i-dropout overdensity is accompanied
with an even larger excess of faint field objects in this region and its
vicinity. This large excess of field objects is most likely caused by the tidal
``debris'' and/or halo stars related to an interacting galaxy pair in the Virgo
Cluster, M60/NGC4647, which lies several arcminutes away from the region where
the excess is found. This excess population is also red in color, and the red
wing of its color distribution continuously extends to the regime where the
i-dropouts reside. While we still cannot completely rule out the possibility
that the overdensity of i-dropouts might be a genuine large-scale structure of
galaxies at z~6, we prefer the interpretation that most of them are part of the
excess stellar population related to M60/NGC4647. Future spectroscopic work

the corotation resonance. A small amount of viscosity adds a small imaginary
part to the eigenfrequency which has been shown to induce a secular instability

divergence disappears, but the mode magnitude can remain largest at the place
of the corotation resonance. For the known g-modes with moderate values of the
radial mode number and axial mode number (and any vertical mode number), the
corotation resonance lies well outside their trapping region (and inside the
innermost stable circular orbit), so the observationally relevant modes are
unaffected by the resonance. The axisymmetric g-mode has been seen by Reynolds

issues addressing cluster formation and cosmology. In this paper we present new
high-resolution HST/ACS and Chandra X-ray data. The high resolution and
sensitivity of ACS enabled us to detect and quantify several new multiply
imaged sources, we now use a total of eight for the strong lensing analysis.
Combining this information with shape measurements of weak lensing sources in
the central regions of the cluster, we derive a high-resolution,
absolutely-calibrated mass map. This map provides the best available
quantification of the total mass of the central part of the cluster to date. We
compare the reconstructed mass with that inferred from the new Chandra X-ray
data, and conclude that both mass estimates agree extremely well in the
observed region, namely within 400 / h_70 kpc of the cluster center. In
addition we study the major baryonic components (gas and stars) and hence
derive the dark matter distribution in the center of the cluster. We find that
the dark matter and baryons are both centered on the BCG within the
uncertainties (alignment is better than <10 kpc). We measure the corresponding
1-D profiles and find that dark matter distribution is consistent with both NFW
and cored profiles, indicating that a more extended radial analysis is needed
to pinpoint the concentration parameter, and hence the inner slope of the dark
matter profile.

that the metal-rich clusters appear as a centrally concentrated spatial
distribution; however, the metal-poor clusters tend to be less spatially
concentrated. There is no correlation between luminosity and metallicity among
the M31 sample clusters, which indicates that self-enrichment is indeed
unimportant for cluster formation in M31. The reddening distribution shows that
slightly more than half of the GCs are affected by a reddening of $E(B-V) \la

possibility to observe ``negative dimensions'' in random multifractals. For
that purpose, we define a new way to study scaling where the observation scale
$\tau$ and the total sample length $L$ are respectively going to zero and to
infinity. This ``mixed'' asymptotic regime is parametrized by an exponent
$\chi$ that corresponds to Mandelbrot ``supersampling exponent''. In order to
study the scaling exponents in the mixed regime, we use a formalism introduced
in the context of the physics of disordered systems relying upon traveling wave
solutions of some non-linear iteration equation. Within our approach, we show
that for random multiplicative cascade models, the parameter $\chi$ can be
interpreted as a negative dimension and, as anticipated by Mandelbrot, allows
one to uncover the ``hidden'' negative part of the singularity spectrum,
corresponding to ``latent'' singularities. We illustrate our purpose on
synthetic cascade models. When applied to turbulence data, this formalism
allows us to distinguish two popular phenomenological models of dissipation
intermittency: We show that the mixed scaling exponents agree with a log-normal
model and not with log-Poisson statistics.

cooperative wireless networks, some specific terminals can be equipped with
cognition capabilities, i.e, the relay in our model. In the discrete memoryless
(DM) case, we derive lower and upper bounds on channel capacity. The lower
bound is obtained by a coding scheme at the relay that consists in a
combination of codeword splitting, Gel'fand-Pinsker binning, and a
decode-and-forward scheme. The upper bound is better than that obtained by
assuming that the channel state is available at the source and the destination
as well. For the Gaussian case, we also derive lower and upper bounds on
channel capacity. The lower bound is obtained by a coding scheme which is based
on a combination of codeword splitting and Generalized dirty paper coding. The
upper bound is also better than that obtained by assuming that the channel
state is available at the source, the relay, and the destination. The two
bounds meet, and so give the capacity, in some special cases for the degraded

Parameters of the model corresponds to doping by holes. Using the low doping
effective action we demonstrate that the system can 1) preserve the long range
collinear antiferromagnetic order, 2) lead to a spin spiral state (static or
dynamic), 3) lead to the phase separation instability. We show that at
parameters of the effective action corresponding to the single layer cuprate
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ the spin spiral ground state is realized. We derive
properties of magnetic excitations and calculate quantum fluctuations. Quantum
fluctuations destroy the static spin spiral at the critical doping $x_c\approx
0.11$. This is the point of the quantum phase transition to the spin-liquid
state (dynamic spin spiral). The state is still double degenerate with respect
to the direction of the dynamic spiral, so this is a ``directional nematic''.
The superconducting pairing exists throughout the phase diagram and is not
sensitive to the quantum phase transition. We also compare the calculated
neutron scattering spectra with experimental data.

main challenges for cosmic shear analyses. In this context, we study the
fundamental limitations on shear accuracy due to the measurement of the Point
Spread Function (PSF) from the finite number of stars. In order to do that, we
translate the accuracy required for cosmological parameter estimation to the
minimum number of stars over which the PSF must be calibrated. We first derive
our results analytically in the case of infinitely small pixels (i.e.
infinitely high resolution). Then image simulations are used to validate these
results and investigate the effect of finite pixel size in the case of an
elliptical gaussian PSF. Our results are expressed in terms of the minimum
number of stars required to calibrate the PSF in order to ensure that
systematic errors are smaller than statistical errors when estimating the
cosmological parameters. On scales smaller than the area containing this
minimum number of stars, there is not enough information to model the PSF. In
the case of an elliptical gaussian PSF and in the absence of dithering, 2
pixels per PSF Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) implies a 20% increase of the
minimum number of stars compared to the ideal case of infinitely small pixels;
0.9 pixels per PSF FWHM implies a factor 100 increase. In the case of a good
resolution and a typical Signal-to-Noise Ratio distribution of stars, we find
that current surveys need the PSF to be calibrated over a few stars, which may
explain residual systematics on scales smaller than a few arcmins. Future
all-sky cosmic shear surveys require the PSF to be calibrated over a region
containing about 50 stars.

a class of nonlinear oscillating systems in which two or more subsystems are
coupled to each other by interactions having a specific phase-dependent

studies of the MQE, carried out up to the present time, suggest the possibility
of a new conceptual framework for physics, which would provide a bridge between

for the identification of regulatory motifs. Regulatory motifs are groups of
nodes with the same connectivity structure, capable of processing information.
The bifan motif, made of two source nodes directly cross-regulating two target
nodes, is an over-represented motif in a mammalian cell signaling network and
in transcriptional networks. One example of a bifan is the two MAP-kinases, p38
and JNK that phosphorylate and activate the two transcription factors ATF2 and
Elk-1. We have used a system of coupled ordinary differential equations to
analyze the regulatory capability of this bifan motif by itself, and when it
interacts with other motifs such as positive and negative feedback loops. Our
results indicate that bifans provide temporal regulation of signal propagation
and act as signal sorters, filters, and synchronizers. Bifans that have OR gate
configurations show rapid responses while AND gate bifans can introduce delays
and allow prolongation of signal outputs. Bifans that are AND gates can filter
noisy signal inputs. The p38/JNK-ATF2/Elk-1bifan synchronizes the output of
activated transcription factors. Synchronization is a robust property of bifans
and is exhibited even when the bifan is adjacent to a positive feedback loop.
The presence of the bifan promotes the transcription and translation of the
dual specificity protein phosphatase MKP-1 that inhibits p38 and JNK thus
enabling a negative feedback loop. These results indicate that bifan motifs in
cell signaling networks can contribute to signal processing capability both
intrinsically and by enabling the functions of other regulatory motifs.

observations, extracted via the standard reduction package, are significantly
biased when faint targets are concerned. The visibility biases derive from a
time variable fringing effect (correlated noise) appearing on the detector.
METHODS: We have developed a method to correct this bias that consists in a
subtraction of the extra power due to such correlated noise, so that the real
power spectrum at the spatial frequencies of the fringing artifact can be
restored. RESULTS: This pre-processing procedure is implemented in a software,
called AMDC and available to the community, to be run before the standard
reduction package. Results obtained on simulated and real observations are

endoscope holder for laparoscopic surgery that is small and low cost. MATERIALS
AND METHODS: A compact light endoscope robot (LER) that is placed on the
patient's skin and can be used with the patient in the lateral or dorsal supine
position was tested on cadavers and laboratory pigs in order to allow
successive modifications. The current control system is based on voice
recognition. The range of vision is 360 degrees with an angle of 160 degrees .
Twenty-three procedures were performed. RESULTS: The tests made it possible to
advance the prototype on a variety of aspects, including reliability,
steadiness, ergonomics, and dimensions. The ease of installation of the robot,
which takes only 5 minutes, and the easy handling made it possible for 21 of
the 23 procedures to be performed without an assistant. CONCLUSION: The LER is
a camera holder guided by the surgeon's voice that can eliminate the need for
an assistant during laparoscopic surgery. The ease of installation and
manufacture should make it an effective and inexpensive system for use on
patients in the lateral and dorsal supine positions. Randomized clinical trials
will soon validate a new version of this robot prior to marketing.

Corrections to the potential-of-mean-force exponential (PMFEX) approximation
recently proposed for MFD in a strongly coupled TCP [Phys. Rev. E 72, 036403

the standard Baranger-Mozer and renormalized cluster expansion techniques
originally developed for the one-component plasmas to the TCPs. The results
obtained for a neutral point are compared with those from molecular dynamics
simulations. It is shown that the corrections do not help to improve the PMFEX
approximation for a TCP with low ionic charge Z. But starting with Z > 5 the
PMFEX model is substantially improved and the agreement with numerical
simulations is excellent. We have also found that with increasing coupling the
PMFEX approximation becomes invalid to predict the MFD at a neutral point while
its corrected version agrees satisfactory with the simulations.
