function R(v) for d-dimensional elastic manifolds pinned by a random potential
in the limit of infinite embedding space dimension N. It measures the
equilibrium response of the manifold in a quadratic potential well as the
center of the well is varied from 0 to v. We find two distinct scaling regimes:
(i) a ""single shock"" regime, v^2 ~ 1/L^d where L^d is the system volume and
(ii) a ""thermodynamic"" regime, v^2 ~ N. In regime (i) all the equivalent
replica symmetry breaking (RSB) saddle points within the Gaussian variational
approximation contribute, while in regime (ii) the effect of RSB enters only
through a single anomaly. When the RSB is continuous (e.g., for short-range
disorder, in dimension 2 <= d <= 4), we prove that regime (ii) yields the
large-N FRG function obtained previously. In that case, the disorder correlator
exhibits a cusp in both regimes, though with different amplitudes and of
different physical origin. When the RSB solution is 1-step and non- marginal
(e.g., d < 2 for SR disorder), the correlator R(v) in regime (ii) is
considerably reduced, and exhibits no cusp. Solutions of the FRG flow
corresponding to non-equilibrium states are discussed as well. In all cases the
regime (i) exhibits a cusp non-analyticity at T=0, whose form and thermal
rounding at finite T is obtained exactly and interpreted in terms of shocks.

from the Suzaku X-ray telescope. This system involves an early B star embedded
in an optically and geometrically thick disk that is siphoning atmospheric
gases from a less massive late B II companion. Motivated by an unpublished
X-ray spectrum from the Einstein X-ray telescope suggesting unusually hard
emission, we obtained time with Suzaku for pointings at three different phases
within a single orbit. From the XIS detectors, the softer X-ray emission
appears typical of an early-type star. What is surprising is the remarkably
unchanging character of this emission, both in luminosity and in spectral
shape, despite the highly asymmetric geometry of the system. We see no eclipse
effect below 10 keV. The constancy of the soft emission is plausibly related to
the wind of the embedded B star and Thomson scattering of X-rays in the system,
although it might be due to extended shock structures arising near the
accretion disk as a result of the unusually high mass-transfer rate. There is
some evidence from the PIN instrument for hard emission in the 10-60 keV range.
Follow-up observations with the RXTE satellite will confirm this preliminary
detection.

centre and a cloud in the western part of the nearby southern supernova remnant
(SNR) RX J1713.7-3946 is calculated in the ``hadronic scenario'' that aims to
explain the intense VHE radiation from this remnant with the decay of \pi_0
pions produced in nuclear collisions. The expected flux from its centre is
found to fall short by about factor 40 from the one observed by the HESS
collaboration. This discrepancy presents a serious obstacle to the ``hadronic
scenario''. The theoretically expected flux from the molecular cloud exceeds
the one observed by HESS by at least a factor 3. While the size of this
discrepancy might still seem acceptable in the face of various theoretical
uncertainties, the result strongly suggests a strict spatial correlation of the
cloud with an excess of TeV \gamma radiation. The observational lack of such
correlations in the remnant reported by HESS is another counter argument
against the hadronic scenario. In combination these arguments cannot be refuted
by choosing certain parameters for the total energy or acceleration efficiency

absorbtion widths. The life times of these states are small as compared with
the collision time and mean time between subsequent collisions, therefore the
close-coupling approach has to be modified for the similar problems.
  In this paper we propose a generalization of the close-coupling method with
annihilating states included in the basis. The correct asymptotic behaviour of
the wave function in the annihilating channels suppose that the annihilating
states can not be presented in the incoming channels whereas the corresponding
components of the wave function of relative motion in outgoing channels have to
damp out at large distances. The S-matrix of the transitions in the subspace of
all other (non-annihilating) states is not unitary, because the hamiltonian of
the problem is non-hermitian. The unitary defect gives the cross section of
induced annihilation. The scheme of the numerical solving of the generalized
close-coupling equations is proposed. It includes the calculations of two types
of solution, from the origin to an intermediate sewing point R=a and from a
large R to the point a.

These include the notion of space and time regarded as the containers of

unrepeatability of events. We thereof argue that the ideas of an empty space,
portions of empty space and a homogenous space are misleading when they are
applied to realized space, and that they are therefore not suitable for space
as a condition of corporeal world (as it is often assumed). We also show that
smallest (indivisible) and ""final"" (""ultimate"") parts of space and bodies have,
at most, a conventional character, and not a ""fundamental"" one (as it is
usually claimed). With respect to time and events, analogous conclusions
follow. However, we claim that between space and time there exist rather big
qualitative differences, which make time's nature much more difficult to grasp
than that of space. In this sense, we discuss the impossibility of repetition
of events and some of its applications in modern science, notably,
probabilistic and statistical science. Some other implications of this study in
conceptual (""philosophical"") aspects of modern physics are briefly discussed,
such as the ""timeless"" interpretation of general relativity, the notion of
space-time, among others. Finally, some considerations about the usual
conception and the scope of modern science in general, and modern physics in

  mistake in estimate of change in relaxation time due to gas expulsion (Sec 4)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In young star clusters, the density can be high enough and the velocity
dispersion low enough for stars to collide and merge with a significant
probability. This has been suggested as a possible way to build up the
high-mass portion of the stellar mass function and as a mechanism leading to
the formation of one or two very massive stars (M > 150 Msun) through a
collisional runaway. I quickly review the standard theory of stellar
collisions, covering both the stellar dynamics of dense clusters and the
hydrodynamics of encounters between stars. The conditions for collisions to
take place at a significant rate are relatively well understood for idealised
spherical cluster models without initial mass segregation, devoid of gas and
composed of main-sequence (MS) stars. In this simplified situation, 2-body
relaxation drives core collapse through mass segregation and a collisional
phase ensues if the core collapse time is shorter than the MS lifetime of the
most massive stars initially present. The outcome of this phase is still highly
uncertain. A more realistic situation is that of a cluster still containing
large amounts of interstellar gas from which stars are accreting. As stellar
masses increase, the central regions of the cluster contracts. This
little-explored mechanism can potentially lead to very high stellar densities
but it is likely that, except for very rich systems, the contraction is halted
by few-body interactions before collisions set in. A complete picture,
combining both scenarios, will need to address many uncertainties, including
the role of cluster sub-structure, the dynamical effect of interstellar gas,
non-MS stars and the structure and evolution of merged stars.

two brightest candidates support their planetary nature. These results suggest
that planets are as abundant in the Galactic bulge as they are in the solar
neighborhood, and they are equally abundant around low-mass stars (within a
factor 2). The planet frequency increases with metallicity even for the stars
in the Galactic bulge. All the USPP hosts are low-mass stars, suggesting either
that close-in planets around higher-mass stars are irradiatively evaporated, or
that the planets can migrate to close-in orbits only around such old and

percolation problem is fundamentally different from conventional percolation
problems, e.g. it does not exhibit transitivity, hence no simple definition of

regime at the same time. Furthermore, to study this percolation problem
numerically, one has to perform a non-trivial transformation of the original

of declarative specification for the tracers. The trace model introduced here
is only one example to illustrate general problems relating to tracers and
observing processes. Observing processes know, from observed processes, only
their traces. The issue is then to be able to reconstitute, by the sole

highlights qualities of the Prolog resolution box model which made its success,

detailed look at this last step, starting from a discussion of the symmetry
properties and spectral structure of the correlator matrix. We continue by
motivating and describing the variational method, before discussing some
conceptual and practical challenges concerning the light baryon sector. We
conclude by mentioning some alternate spectrum extraction methods currently

base consists of 656 radial velocities of globular clusters obtained with
MXU/VLT and GMOS/Gemini, which is the largest sample so far for any galaxy. We
performed a Jeans analysis for a non-rotating isotropic model. An NFW halo with
the parameters r_s = 50 kpc and rho_s = 0.0065 M_sun/pc^3 provides a good
description of our data, fitting well to the X-ray mass. More massive halos are
also permitted that agree with the mass of the Fornax cluster as derived from
galaxy velocities. We compare this halo with the expected MOND models under
isotropy and find that additional dark matter on the order of the stellar mass
is needed to get agreement. A fully radial infinite globular cluster system
would be needed to change this conclusion. Regarding CDM, we cannot draw firm
conclusions. To really constrain a cluster wide halo, more data covering a
larger radius are necessary. The MOND result appears as a small-scale variant
of the finding that MOND in galaxy clusters still needs dark matter.

the Eddington limit for the black hole mass alone, leading to rapid growth of
the black hole. We use analytic models and numerical stellar structure

analytically the scaling of the photospheric temperature with the black hole

mass increases. Once the photospheric temperature becomes lower than 10,000 K,
the photospheric opacity drops precipitously and the photospheric temperature
hits a limiting value, analogous to the Hayashi track for red giants and
protostars, below which no hydrostatic solution for the convective envelope
exists. For metal-free (Population III) opacities this limiting temperature is
approximately 4000 K. After a quasistar reaches this limiting temperature, the
envelope is rapidly dispersed by radiation pressure. We find that black hole

as a model construct for the hydrophobic species. In the present study, an
extension is pursued for seven independent target temperatures, ranging from
close to the freezing point almost up to the boiling point of liquid water

curves motivates independent measurements of the jet aperture. Serendipitous
searches of afterglows, especially at radio wavelengths, have long been the
classic alternative. These survey data have been interpreted assuming a
uniformly emitting jet with sharp edges (``top-hat'' jet), in which case the
ratio of weakly relativistically beamed afterglows to GRBs scales with the jet
solid angle. In this paper, we consider, instead, a very wide outflow with a
luminosity that decreases across the emitting surface. In particular, we adopt
the universal structured jet (USJ) model, that is an alternative to the top-hat
model for the structure of the jet. However, the interpretation of the survey
data is very different: in the USJ model we only observe the emission within
the jet aperture and the observed ratio of prompt emission rate to afterglow
rate should solely depend on selection effects. We compute the number and rate
of afterglows expected in all-sky snapshot observations as a function of the
survey sensitivity. We find that the current (negative) results for OA searches
are in agreement with our expectations. In radio and X-ray bands this was
mainly due to the low sensitivity of the surveys, while in the optical band the
sky-coverage was not sufficient. In general we find that X-ray surveys are poor
tools for OA searches, if the jet is structured. On the other hand, the FIRST
radio survey and future instruments like the Allen Telescope Array (in the
radio band) and especially GAIA, Pan-Starrs and LSST (in the optical band) will
have chances to detect afterglows.

the pattern speed to vary arbitrarily with radius. Here, we perform tests of
the TWR method with regularization on several simulated galaxy data sets. The
regularization is employed as a means of smoothing intrinsically noisy
solutions, as well as for testing model solutions of different radial
dependence (e.g. constant, linear or quadratic). We test these facilities in
studies of individual simulations, and demonstrate successful measurement of
both bar and spiral pattern speeds in a single disk, secondary bar pattern
speeds, and spiral winding (in the first application of a TW calculation to a
spiral simulation). We also explore the major sources of error in the
calculation and find uncertainty in the major axis position angle most
dominant. In all cases, the method is able to extract pattern speed solutions

that the TWR method should be a valuable tool in the area of galactic dynamics.

the highest HI absorption velocity is at 95 km/s and no absorption is

The blazars under study have an often dominant high energy component, which, if

magnetic field within the emission region. As a consequence, the corresponding
Poynting flux cannot be energetically dominant. Also the bulk kinetic power in
relativistic leptons is often smaller than the dissipated luminosity. This
suggests that the typical jet should comprise an energetically dominant proton

Keck/HIRES observations of the QSO triplet KP76, KP77 and KP78 at z ~2.5, with
separations of 2-3 arcmin on the plane of the sky. Using accurate systemic
redshifts of the QSOs from near-IR spectroscopy, we quantify the state of the
IGM gas in the proximity regions where the expected ionizing flux from the
foreground QSOs exceeds that of the metagalactic background by factors of
10-200, assuming constant and isotropic emission. Based on the unusual
ionization properties of the absorption systems with detected HI, CIV, and OVI,
we conclude that the gas has been significantly affected by the UV radiation
from the nearby QSOs. Aided by observations of the galaxy density near the
foreground QSOs, we discuss several effects that may explain why the transverse

Universe, focusing on the very first generations of stars. We then discuss how
the star formation process may change as the effects of metallicity, external
radiative feedback, and magnetic and turbulent support of the gas become more
important. The very first stars (Pop III.1) have relatively simple initial
conditions set by cosmology and the cooling properties of primordial gas. We
describe the evolution of these stars as they grow in mass by accretion from
their surrounding gas cores and how the accretion process is affected and
eventually terminated by radiative feedback processes, especially HII region
expansion and disk photoevaporation. The ability of the protostar and its disk
to generate dynamically important magnetic fields is reviewed and their effects
discussed. Pop III.1 star formation is likely to produce massive (~100-200Msun)
stars that then influence their surroundings via ionization, stellar winds, and
supernovae. These processes heat, ionize and metal-enrich the gas, thus
altering the initial conditions for the next generation of star formation.
Stars formed from gas that has been altered significantly by radiative and/or
mechanical feedback, but not by metal enrichment (Pop III.2) are expected to
have significantly smaller masses than Pop III.1 stars because of more
efficient cooling from enhanced HD production. Stars formed from gas that is
metal-enriched to levels that affect the dynamics of the collapse (the first
Pop II stars) are also expected to have relatively low masses. We briefly
compare the above star formation scenarios to what is known about present-day
star formation.

peaks and dips in the CMB temperature power spectrum. These encode information
on the ratio of the distance to the last scattering surface to the sound
horizon at decoupling. However pre-recombination processes can contaminate this
distance information. In order to assess the amplitude of these effects we use
the WMAP data and evaluate the relative differences of the CMB peaks and dips
multipoles. We find that the position of the first peak is largely displaced
with the respect to the expected position of the sound horizon scale at
decoupling. In contrast the relative spacings of the higher extrema are
statistically consistent with those expected from perfect harmonic
oscillations. This provides evidence for a scale dependent phase shift of the
CMB oscillations which is caused by gravitational driving forces affecting the
propagation of sound waves before recombination. By accounting for these
effects we have performed a MCMC likelihood analysis to constrain in
combination with recent BAO data a constant dark energy equation w. For a flat
universe we find at 95% upper limit w<-1.10, and including the HST prior
w<-1.14, which are only marginally consistent with limits derived from the
supernova SNLS sample. Larger limits are obtained for non-flat cosmologies.
  From the full CMB likelihood analysis we also estimate the values of the
shift parameter R and the multipole l_a of the acoustic horizon at decoupling
for several cosmologies to test their dependence on model assumptions. Although
the analysis of the full CMB spectra should be always preferred, using the
position of the CMB peaks and dips provide a simple and consistent method for
combining CMB constraints with other datasets.

which is broad (sigma = 176 \pm 15 km/s), has a mean prograde velocity of 86
\pm 30 km/s, and contains ~55% of the satellites, while the other is slightly
retrograde with a mean velocity of -21 \pm 22 km/s and sigma = 74 \pm 18 km/s

all projected radii and found in the sample regardless of cuts on primary
inclination or satellite disc angle. The double-Gaussian shape, however,
becomes more pronounced among satellites of more luminous primaries. We remove
the potential dependence of satellite velocity on primary luminosity using the
Tully-Fisher relation and still find the velocity distribution to be asymmetric
and even more significantly non-Gaussian. The asymmetric velocity distribution
demonstrates a connection between the inner, visible disc galaxy and the
kinematics of the outer, dark halo. The reach of this connection, extending
even beyond the virial radii, suggests that it is imprinted by the satellite
infall pattern and large-scale effects, rather than by higher-level dynamical
processes in the formation of the central galaxy or late-term evolution of the

the CMB, single-field models with changing sound speed can have strongly
scale-dependent non-Gaussianity. Such models could evade the CMB constraints

cosmological objects such as clusters and galaxies. We compute the effect of
scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianity on cluster number counts as a
function of redshift, using a simple ansatz to model scale-dependent features.
We forecast constraints on these models achievable with forthcoming data sets.

relevant for the Dirac-Born-Infeld model of brane inflation, where the
scale-dependence of the non-Gaussianity is directly related to the geometry of

focused on isolated pulsar evolution. Those that have incorporated pulsar
evolution within binary systems have tended to either treat binary evolution
poorly of evolve the pulsar population in an ad-hoc manner. Here we present the
first model of the Galactic field pulsar population that includes a
comprehensive treatment of both binary and pulsar evolution. Synthetic
observational surveys mimicking a variety of radio telescopes are then
performed on this population. As such, a complete and direct comparison of
model data with observations of the pulsar population within the Galactic disk
is now possible. The tool used for completing this work is a code comprised of
three components: stellar/binary evolution, Galactic kinematics and survey
selection effects. Here we give a brief overview of the method and assumptions
involved with each component. Some preliminary results are also presented as
well as plans for future applications of the code.

addition to the usual vortices that are possible in both s-wave and p-wave
materials. In strongly type-II superconductors in a magnetic field, a skyrmion
flux lattice yields a lower free energy than the Abrikosov flux lattice of
vortices, and should thus be realized in p-wave superconductors. We
analytically calculate the energy per skyrmion, which agrees very well with
numerical results. From this, we obtain the magnetic induction B as a function
of the external magnetic field H, and the elastic constants of the skyrmion
lattice, near the lower critical field H_c1. Together with the Lindemann
criterion, these results suffice to predict the melting curve of the skyrmion
lattice. We find a striking difference in the melting curves of vortex lattices
and skyrmion lattices: while the former is separated at all temperatures from
the Meissner phase by a vortex liquid phase, the skyrmion lattice phase shares
a direct boundary with the Meissner phase. That is, skyrmions lattices never
melt near Hc1, while vortex lattices always melt sufficiently close to Hc1.
This allows for a very simple test for the existence of a skyrmion lattice.
Possible muSR experiments to detect skyrmion lattices are also discussed.

disks to diagnose the spin of the black hole. Using a high-resolution
3-dimensional MHD simulation of a geometrically-thin accretion disk in a
Pseudo-Newtonian potential, we show that both the midplane density and the
vertical column density of the accretion flow drop dramatically over a narrow
range of radii close to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). We argue
that this drop of density is accompanied by a sharp increase in the ionization
parameter of the X-ray photosphere, and that the resulting imprint of the ISCO
on the X-ray reflection spectrum can be used to constrain spin. Motivated by
this simulation, we construct a simplified toy-model of the accretion flow
within the ISCO of a Kerr black hole, and use this model to estimate the
systematic error on inferred black hole spin that may result from slight
bleeding of the iron line emission to the region inside of the ISCO. We find
that these systematic errors can be significant for slowly spinning black holes

free parameters, here denoted by \xi and g. The first one defines the
electric-dipole and the magnetic-quadrupole moments of the vector particle,

Compton scattering off a vector target and requires the cross section to
respect the unitarity bounds in the high energy limit. In result, we obtain the
universal g=2, and \xi=0 values which completely characterize the

into the dense outer envelope surrounding very young pre-main sequence stars.
These young stellar objects (YSOs) characterized by an outflow represent the
earliest stages of star formation. Mid-infrared photons thermally created by
the central protostar/disk are scattered by dust particles within the outflow
cavity itself into the line of sight. We observed this scattered light from 27
nearby, cavity-resolved YSOs, and quantified the shape of the outflow cavities.
Using the grid models of Robitaille et al. (2006), we matched model spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) to the observed SEDs of the 27 cataloged YSOs using
photometry from IRAC, MIPS, and IRAS. This allows for the estimation of
geometric and physical properties such as inclination angle, cavity density,
and accretion rate. By using the relative parameter estimates determined by the
models, we are able to deduce an evolutionary picture for outflows. Our work
supports the concept that cavities widen with time, beginning as a thin
jet-like outflow that widens to reveal the central protostar and disk until the
protostellar envelope is completely dispersed by outflow and accretion.

emerging from the pulsar. In addition, we detect a tail extending up to at

the 15'-long tail detected in ROSAT and XMM-Newton observations. The overall
morphology of the nebula suggests that the shocked pulsar wind is confined by
the ram pressure due to the pulsar's supersonic speed. The shape of the compact
nebula in the immediate vicinity of the pulsar seems to be consistent with the
current MHD models. However, since these models do not account yet for the
change of the flow velocity at larger distances from the pulsar, they are not
able to constrain the extent of the long pulsar tail. The luminosity of the

time-dependent non-thermal spectra of both primary electrons and protons as

numerically by taking into account the evolution of the secondary $e^{\pm}$
pairs produced from proton-proton (p-p) interactions due to the accelerated
protons collide with the ambient matter in an SNR. The multi-wavelength photon
spectrum for a given SNR can be produced through leptonic processes such as
electron/positron synchrotron radiation, bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton
scattering as well as hadronic interaction. Our results indicate that the
non-thermal emission of the secondary $e^{\pm}$ pairs is becoming more and more
prominent when the SNR ages in the radiative phase because the source of the
primary electrons has been cut off and the electron synchrotron energy loss is
significant for a radiative SNR, whereas the secondary $e^{\pm}$ pairs can be
produced continuously for a long time in the phase due to the large energy loss
time for the p-p interaction. We apply the model to two old SNRs, G8.7$-$0.1

field value Hirr for the pristine sample is 7.5 Tesla at 4 K and the same is
increased to 13.5 Tesla for 3-wt% nD added sample at the same temperature. The
Jc(H) plots at all temperatures show that Jc value is lowest at all applied
fields for pristine MgB2 and the sample doped with 3-wt% nD gives the best Jc
values at all fields. For the pure sample the value of Jc is of the order of
105 A/cm2 at lower fields but it decreases very fast as the magnetic field is
applied and becomes negligible above 7 Tesla. The Jc is 40 times higher than
pure MgB2 at 10 K at 6 Tesla field in case of 3%nD doped sample and its value
is still of the order of 103 A/cm2 at 10 Tesla for the same sample. On the

These results are discussed in terms of extrinsic pinning due to dispersed

possible substitution of C at Boron site and increased inter-band scattering
for highly doped samples resulting in extraordinary performance of the doped

in terms of comoving coordinates, from which physical distances may be derived
using a time-dependent expansion factor. These coordinates, however, do not
explicitly reveal properties of the cosmic spacetime manifested in Birkhoff's
theorem and its corollary. In this paper, we compare two forms of the
metric--written in (the traditional) comoving coordinates, and a set of
observer-dependent coordinates--first for the well-known de Sitter universe
containing only dark energy, and then for a newly derived form of the RW
metric, for a universe with dark energy and matter. We show that Rindler's
event horizon--evident in the co-moving system--coincides with what one might
call the ""curvature horizon"" appearing in the observer-dependent frame. The
advantage of this dual prescription of the cosmic spacetime is that with the
latest WMAP results, we now have a much better determination of the universe's
mass-energy content, which permits us to calculate this curvature with
unprecedented accuracy. We use it here to demonstrate that our observations
have probed the limit beyond which the cosmic curvature prevents any signal
from having ever reached us. In the case of de Sitter, where the mass-energy
density is a constant, this limit is fixed for all time. For a universe with a
changing density, this horizon expands until de Sitter is reached
asymptotically, and then it too ceases to change.

observed source flux in 1-10 keV energy range is calculated to be 2.6 x
10^{-11} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} with significant contribution from the soft
blackbody component (kT = 0.61 keV). Pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of XIS
data shows that the flux of the soft blackbody component consists of three
narrow peaks, whereas the flux of the other component shows a single peak over
the pulse period of the AXP. The blackbody radii changes between 2.2-2.7 km and
0.28-0.38 km (assuming the source distance to be 5 kpc) over pulse phases for
the soft and hard components, respectively. The details of the results obtained
from the timing and spectral analysis is presented.

comoving correlation length for all galaxies decreases steadily from z~0.3 to
z~1. 2. At all redshifts and luminosities, galaxies with redder rest-frame

invariant with redshift. 4. At z~0.5, less luminous galaxies have higher

fainter absolute magnitudes. One of the principal implications of these results
is that although the full galaxy population traces the underlying dark matter

neutron star system with the All-Sky Monitor (ASM) on the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer. The superburst occurred 55 days after the onset of an accretion
outburst in 4U 1608-522. During that time interval, the accretion rate was at
least 7% of the Eddington limit. The peak flux of the superburst is 22 to 45%
of the Eddington limit, and its radiation energy output is between 4e41 and
9e41 erg for a distance of 3.2 kpc. Fits of cooling models to the superburst
light curve indicate an ignition column depth between 1.5e12 and 4.1e12 g/cm2.
Extrapolating the accretion history observed by the ASM, we derive that this
column was accreted over a period of 26 to 72 years. The superburst
characteristics are consistent with those seen in other superbursting low-mass
X-ray binaries. However, the transient nature of the hosting binary presents
significant challenges for superburst theory, requiring additional ingredients
for the models. The carbon that fuels the superburst is thought to be produced
mostly during the accretion outbursts and destroyed in the frequent type-I
X-ray bursts. Mixing and sedimentation of the elements in the neutron star
envelope may significantly influence the balance between the creation and
destruction of carbon. Furthermore, predictions for the temperature of the
neutron star crust fail to reach the values required for the ignition of carbon
at the inferred column depth.

  Overlap",,,,,"q-bio.QM",,"  A multitude of measures have been proposed to quantify the similarity between
protein 3-D structure. Among these measures, contact map overlap (CMO)
maximization deserved sustained attention during past decade because it offers
a fine estimation of the natural homology relation between proteins. Despite
this large involvement of the bioinformatics and computer science community,
the performance of known algorithms remains modest. Due to the complexity of
the problem, they got stuck on relatively small instances and are not
applicable for large scale comparison. This paper offers a clear improvement
over past methods in this respect. We present a new integer programming model
for CMO and propose an exact B &B algorithm with bounds computed by solving
Lagrangian relaxation. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on a
popular small benchmark (Skolnick set, 40 domains). On this set our algorithm
significantly outperforms the best existing exact algorithms, and yet provides
lower and upper bounds of better quality. Some hard CMO instances have been
solved for the first time and within reasonable time limits. From the values of
the running time and the relative gap (relative difference between upper and
lower bounds), we obtained the right classification for this test. These
encouraging result led us to design a harder benchmark to better assess the
classification capability of our approach. We constructed a large scale set of
300 protein domains (a subset of ASTRAL database) that we have called Proteus
300. Using the relative gap of any of the 44850 couples as a similarity
measure, we obtained a classification in very good agreement with SCOP. Our
algorithm provides thus a powerful classification tool for large structure
databases.

  Nova Science Publishers, Inc",,,,"gr-qc",,"  The possible extensions of GR for description of fermions on a curved space,
for supergravity and for loop quantum gravity require a richer set of 16
independent variables. These variables can be assembled in a coframe field,
i.e., a local set of four linearly independent 1-forms. In the ordinary
formulation, the coframe gravity does not have any connection to a specific
geometry even being constructed from the geometrical meaningful objects. A
geometrization of the coframe gravity is an aim of this paper. We construct a
complete class of the coframe connections which are linear in the first order
derivatives of the coframe field on an $n$ dimensional manifolds with and
without a metric. The subclasses of the torsion-free, metric-compatible and
flat connections are derived. We also study the behavior of the geometrical
structures under local transformations of the coframe. The remarkable fact is
an existence of a subclass of connections which are invariant when the
infinitesimal transformations satisfy the Maxwell-like system of equations. In
the framework of the coframe geometry construction, we propose a geometrical
action for the coframe gravity. It is similar to the Einstein-Hilbert action of
GR, but the scalar curvature is constructed from the general coframe
connection. We show that this geometric Lagrangian is equivalent to the coframe
Lagrangian up to a total derivative term. Moreover there is a family of coframe
connections which Lagrangian does not include the higher order terms at all. In
this case, the equivalence is complete.

from macroscopic Maxwell equations, and gives the relation between the

It is shown that electromagnetic and magnetoinductive waves propagating in the

three new Curved Spacetime Dirac Equations have been derived mainly to try and
account in a natural way for the observed anomalous gyromagnetic ratio of
fermions and the suggestions is that particles including the Electron, which is
thought to be a point particle, do have a finite spatial size and this is one
of the reasons for the observed anomalous gyromagnetic ratio. Combining the
idea in Nyambuya (2008) which lead to the derivation of the three new Curved
Spacetime Dirac Equations, and the proposed Unified Field Theory (Nyambuya
2007), a total of 12 equations each with 16 sub-components are generated thus
leading to a total of 192 equations for the Curved Spacetime Dirac Equation.
Some symmetries of these equations are investigated, i.e., the Lorentz
symmetry, charge conjugation symmetry (C), time reversal symmetry (T), Space
reversal (P) and a combination of the C, P and T - symmetries. It is shown that
these equations are Lorentz invariant, obey C-symmetry and that some violate T
and P-symmetry while others do not and that they all obey PT-symmetry. These
symmetries show (or modestly said -- seem to suggest) that anti-particles have
positive mass and energy but a negative rest-mass and the opposite sign in
electronic charge. Through the inspection of these symmetries, a suggestion is
(here) made to the effect that the rest-mass of a particle must be related to
the electronic charge of that particle thus leading us to a possible resolution
of whether or not Neutrinos do have a none-zero rest-mass. Additionally, we

second one we add a baryon component to it. We extend our analysis also into
the parameter range $\alpha > 1$, where the generalized Chaplygin gas sound
velocity can be larger than that of light. In the first model we find that the
matter power spectrum is compatible with the observed one only for $\alpha <
10^{-5}$, which makes the generalized Chaplygin gas practically
indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM. In the second model we study the evolution
of inhomogeneities of the baryon component. The theoretical power spectrum is
in good agreement with the observed one for almost all values of $\alpha$.
However, the growth of inhomogeneities seems to be particularly favoured either
for sufficiently small values of $\alpha$ or for $\alpha \gtrsim 3$. Thus, it
appears that the viability of the generalized Chaplygin gas as a cosmological
model is stronger when its sound velocity is superluminal. We show that in this
case the generalized Chaplygin gas equation of state can be changed in an
unobservable region in such a way that its equivalent $k$-essence microscopical
model has no problems with causality.

models of stress transmission in granular solids. The elasto-plastic models
traditionally used by engineers have been challenged by theoretical and
experimental results which suggest a wave-like (hyperbolic) propagation of the
stress, as opposed to the elliptic equations of static elasticity. Numerical
simulations of two-dimensional granular systems subject to a localized external
force are employed to examine the nature of stress transmission in these
systems as a function of the magnitude of the applied force, the frictional
parameters and the disorder (polydispersity). The results indicate that in
large systems (typically considered by engineers), the response is close to
that predicted by isotropic elasticity whereas the response of small systems
(or when sufficiently large forces are applied) is strongly anisotropic. In the
latter case the applied force induces changes in the contact network
accompanied by frictional sliding. The larger the coefficient of static
friction, the more extended is the range of forces for which the response is
elastic and the smaller the anisotropy. Increasing the degree of polydispersity
(for the range studied, up to 25%) decreases the range of elastic response.

provided satisfactory estimates for interstellar extinction. The ANN based
classification scheme has been successfully tested on the simulated TAUVEX data
pipeline. It is expected that the same technique can be employed for data
validation in the ultraviolet from the virtual observatories. Finally, the

particular, it is conjectured that a certain solution $f_0$ defines a universal

generic blow up initial data approaches $f_0$. Thus, singularity formation is
closely related to stability properties of self--similar solutions.
  In this work, the problem of linear stability is studied by functional
analytic methods. In particular, a complete spectral analysis of the
perturbation operators is given and well--posedness of the linearized Cauchy
problem is proved by means of semigroup theory and, alternatively, the
functional calculus for self--adjoint operators. These results lead to growth
estimates which provide information on the stability of self--similar wave
maps. Finally, convergence properties of $f_n$ for large $n$ and the spectra of
the corresponding perturbation operators are investigated.

way to probe the dust extinction curves of distant galaxies. Interesting
objects for this study are found in strong gravitational lensing systems, where

  Aims. The reddening law of lensing galaxies is investigated by studying the
colours of gravitationally-lensed quasars, and a handful of other quasars where
a foreground galaxy is detected.
  Methods. We compare the observed colours of quasars reported in the
literature, with spectral templates reddened by different extinction laws and
dust properties. The data consists of 21 quasar-galaxy systems, with a total of
48 images. The galaxies, which are both early- and late-type, have redshifts in
the interval z=0.04-1.51.
  Results. We measure a difference in rest-frame B-V between the quasar images
we study, and quasars without resolved foreground galaxies. This difference in
colour is indicative of significant dust extinction in the intervening galaxy.
Good fits to standard extinction laws were found for 22 of the images,
corresponding to 13 different galaxies. Our fits imply a wide range of possible
values for the total-to-selective extinction ratio, Rv. The distribution was
found to be broad with a weighted mode of Rv=2.4 and a FWHM of 2.7 (sigma =
1.1). Thus the bulk of the galaxies for which good reddening fits could be
derived, have dust properties compatible with the Milky Way value (Rv=3.1).

thermodynamic and dynamic properties of the low-temperature liquid and
crystalline phases of the modified Stillinger-Weber (mSW) model. We have found
an approximately linear increase of the effective Gaussian width of the
distribution of inherent structures. This effect comes from non-Gaussianity of
the landscape and is consistent with the predictions of the Gaussian
excitations model representing the thermodynamics of the configurational
manifold as an ensemble of excitations, each carrying an excitation entropy.
The mSW model provides us with both the configurational and excess entropies,
with the difference mostly attributed to vibrational anharmonicity. We
therefore can address the distinction between the excess thermodynamic
quantities often used in the Adam-Gibbs (AG) equation. We find a new break in
the slope of the constant pressure AG plot when the excess entropy is used in
the AG equation. The simulation diffusivity data are equally well fitted by
applying a new equation, derived within the Gaussian excitations model, that
emphasizes enthalpy over entropy as the thermodynamic control variable for
transport in viscous liquids.

equivalent to that of embedding a simplex of points whose distances are maximal

lower bounds for the trace distance and for the fidelity between two quantum
states, which imply bounds for the Bures distance between the unitary orbits of
both states. We thus show that when analysing minimal and maximal distances
between states of fixed spectra it is sufficient to consider diagonal states
only. Hence considering optimal discrimination, given freedom up to unitary
orbits, it is sufficient to consider diagonal states. This is illustrated
geometrically in terms of Weyl chambers.

fluid parcels move radially, expanding or contracting with respect to the
background density stratification. Thermal convection in rotating 2D equatorial
simulations demonstrates this mechanism. The convergence of the vorticity into
zonal flow structures as a function of radius depends on the shape of the
density profile, with the prograde jet forming in the region of the disk where
the greatest number of density scale heights occurs. The number of stable jets
that form in the fluid increases with decreasing Ekman number and decreases
with increasing thermal driving. This local form of vorticity generation via
the density stratification is likely to be of great importance in bodies that
are quickly rotating, highly turbulent, and have large density changes, such as
Jovian planets. However, it is likely to be of lesser importance in the
interiors of planets such as the Earth, which have smaller density
stratifications and are less turbulent.
