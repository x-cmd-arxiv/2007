to shortening the probability of particle loci as predictable patterns of

bodies onto recordable observation points of a MMMCV system. It even
suppresses/predicts superposition phenomena coming from a human subject and/or
other bio-subjects for any decision making event, e.g., brainwave quantum

known as 2M1207 b) in orbit around a self-luminous object different from our
own Sun (the young brown dwarf 2MASSW J1207334-393254, hereafter 2M1207 A).
2M1207 b probably formed via fragmentation and gravitational collapse, offering
proof that such a mechanism can form bodies in the planetary mass regime.
However, the predicted mass, luminosity, and radius of 2M1207 b depend on its
age, distance, and other observables such as effective temperature. To refine
our knowledge of the physical properties of 2M1207 b and its nature, we
obtained an accurate determination of the distance to the 2M1207 A and b system
by measurements of its trigonometric parallax at the milliarcsec level. With
the ESO NTT/SUSI2 telescope, in 2006 we began a campaign of photometric and
astrometric observations to measure the trigonometric parallax of 2M1207 A. An
accurate distance ($52.4\pm 1.1$ pc) to 2M1207A was measured. From distance and
proper motions we derived spatial velocities fully compatible with TWA
membership. With this new distance estimate, we discuss three scenarios
regarding the nature of 2M1207 b: (1) a cool ($1150\pm150$ K) companion of mass
$4\pm1$ M$_{\rm{Jup}}$, (2) a warmer ($1600\pm100$ K) and heavier ($8\pm2$
M$_{\rm{Jup}}$) companion occulted by an edge-on circum-secondary disk or (3) a
hot protoplanet collision afterglow.

Xray afterglows of GRBs observed by Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT) during the
period of January 2005 to December 2006. We found that the intrinsic break time
at the shallow-to-normal decay transition in the X-ray light curve Tbrk^0 is
moderately well correlated with the isotropic X-ray luminosity in the end of
the shallow decay phase (LX,end) as Tbrk^0 = (9.39+/-0.64)*10^3s(LX,end/10^47
ergs/s)^(-0.71+/-0.03), while Tbrk^0 is weakly correlated with the isotropic
gamma-ray energy of the prompt emission Egamma,iso. Using Tbrk^0 - LX,end
relation we have determined the pseudo redshifts of 33 GRBs. We compared the
pseudo redshifts of 11 GRBs with measured redshifts and found the rms error to
be 0.17 in log z. From this pseudo redshift, we estimate that ~15% of the Swift
GRBs have z > 5. The advantages of this distance indicator is that (1) it
requires only X-ray afterglow data while other methods such as Amati and
Yonetoku correlations require the peak energy (Ep) of the prompt emission, (2)
the redshift is uniquely determined without redshift degeneracies unlike the
Amati correlation, and (3) the redshift is estimated in advance of deep
follow-ups so that possible high redshift GRBs might be selected for detailed
observations.

limit of QCD at fixed strange quark mass and most likely does occur in
two-flavor QCD. We point out that a chiral transition in the O(4) universality
class at zero baryon density as well as the transition at the chiral critical
point which belongs to the Z(2) universality class both lead to the critical
behavior of bulk viscosity. In particular, the latter universality class
implies the divergence of the bulk viscosity, which may be used as a signature
of the critical point. We discuss the physical picture behind the dramatic
increase of bulk viscosity seen in our analysis, and devise possible
experimental tests of related phenomena.

sufficient to characterize the equivalence classes of cycles. The proof
requires only simple combinatorial arguments. As a corollary, we also obtain a

confining potentials. Proteins are described in the framework of an effective
potential model which contains the Ramachandran angles as degrees of freedom
and does not need any {\it a priori} information about the native state.
Hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole- and hydrophobic interactions are taken
explicitly into account. An interesting feature displayed by this potential is
the presence of some intermediates between the unfolded and native states. We
consider different types of confining potentials in order to study the
structural properties of proteins folding inside cages with repulsive or
attractive walls. Using the Wang-Landau algorithm we determine the density of
states (DOS) and analyze in detail the thermodynamical properties of the
confined proteins for different sizes of the cages. We show that confinement
dramatically reduces the phase space available to the protein and that the
presence of intermediate states can be controlled by varying the properties of
the confining potential. Cages with strongly attractive walls lead to the
disappearance of the intermediate states and to a two-state folding into a less
stable configuration. However, cages with slightly attractive walls make the
native structure more stable than in the case of pure repulsive potentials, and
the folding process occurs through intermediate configurations. In order to
test the metastable states we analyze the free energy landscapes as a function
of the configurational energy and of the end-to-end distance as an order
parameter.

made using the Green Bank Telescope's S-band receiver and the Pulsar Spigot
spectrometer, we have set out to use the same observing system in a systematic
search for pulsars in other globular clusters. Here we report on the discovery
of five new pulsars in NGC 6440 and three in NGC 6441; each cluster previously
had one known pulsar. Using the most recent distance estimates to these
clusters, we conclude that there are as many potentially observable pulsars in
NGC 6440 and NGC 6441 as in Terzan 5. We present timing solutions for all of
the pulsars in these globular clusters. Four of the new discoveries are in
binary systems; one of them, PSR J1748-2021B (NGC 6440B), has a wide (P_b =
20.5 d) and eccentric (e = 0.57) orbit. This allowed a measurement of its rate
of advance of periastron: 0.00391(18) degrees per year. If due to the effects
of general relativity, the total mass of this binary system is 2.92 +/- 0.20
solar masses (1 sigma), implying a median pulsar mass of 2.74 +/- 0.21 solar
masses. There is a 1 % probability that the inclination is low enough that
pulsar mass is below 2 solar masses, and 0.10 % probability that it is between
1.20 and 1.44 solar masses. If confirmed, this anomalously large mass would
strongly constrain the equation of state for dense matter. The other highly
eccentric binary, PSR J1750-37A, has e = 0.71, and periastron advance of
0.0055(3) degrees per year, implying a total system mass of 1.97 +/-0.15 solar
masses and, along with the mass function, maximum and median pulsar masses of
1.65 and 1.26 solar masses respectively.

particularly, in interstellar and circumstellar media, with the goal of
developing new diagnostics of magnetic fields in these environments. We
understand atomic alignment as alignment of atoms or ions in their ground
state. Such atoms are sensitive to weak magnetic fields. In particular, we
provide predictions of the polarization that arises from astrophysically
important aligned atoms (ions) with fine structure of the ground level, namely,
OI and SII and Ti II. Unlike our earlier papers which dealt with weak fields
only, a substantial part of our current paper is devoted to the studies of
atomic alignment when magnetic fields get strong enough to affect the emission
from the excited level, i.e. with the regime when the magnetic splitting is
comparable to the line-width. This is a regime of Hanle effect modified by the
atomic alignment. Using an example of emission and absorption lines of SII ion
we demonstrate how polarimetric studies can probe magnetic fields in
circumstellar regions and accretion disks. In addition, we show that atomic
alignment induced by anisotropic radiation can induce substantial variations of
magnetic dipole transitions within the ground state, thus affecting abundance
studies based on this emission. Moreover, the radio emission is polarized,
provides a new way to study magnetic fields, e.g. at the epoch of Universe
reionization.

have now been routinely used in speech recognition, processing of natural

observations $X_1,X_2,...$ to be conditionally independent given an
""explanotary"" Markov process $Y_1,Y_2,...$, which itself is not observed;
moreover, the conditional distribution of $X_i$ depends solely on $Y_i$.
Central to the theory and applications of HMM is the Viterbi algorithm to find
{\em a maximum a posteriori} estimate $q_{1:n}=(q_1,q_2,...,q_n)$ of $Y_{1:n}$
given the observed data $x_{1:n}$. Maximum {\em a posteriori} paths are also
called Viterbi paths or alignments. Recently, attempts have been made to study
the behavior of Viterbi alignments of HMMs with two hidden states when $n$
tends to infinity. It has indeed been shown that in some special cases a
well-defined limiting Viterbi alignment exists. While innovative, these
attempts have relied on rather strong assumptions. This work proves the
existence of infinite Viterbi alignments for virtually any HMM with two hidden

an interest in UWB exposure safety standards. Despite an increase of the
scientific research on bioeffects of exposure to non-ionizing UWB pulses,
characterization of those effects is far from complete. A numerical
computational approach, such as a finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method,
is required to visualize and understand the complexity of broadband
electromagnetic interactions. The FDTD method has almost no limits in the
description of the geometrical and dispersive properties of the simulated
material, it is numerically robust and appropriate for current computer
technology. In this paper, a complete calculation of exposure of the human eye
to UWB electromagnetic pulses in the frequency range of 3.1-10.6, 22-29, and
57-64 GHz is performed. Computation in this frequency range required a
geometrical resolution of the eye of $\rm 0.1 \: mm$ and an arbitrary precision
in the description of its dielectric properties in terms of the Debye model.
New results show that the interaction of UWB pulses with the eye tissues
exhibits the same properties as the interaction of the continuous
electromagnetic waves (CW) with the frequencies from the pulse's frequency
spectrum. It is also shown that under the same exposure conditions the exposure
to UWB pulses is from one to many orders of magnitude safer than the exposure
to CW.

an arbitrarily weak field leads to the formation of localized electronic states
inside the free nanotube band gap. We study the binding energy of these subgap
states as a function of the range and strength of the electrostatic potential.
When the range of the potential is held constant and the strength is varied,
the binding energy shows crossover behavior: the states lie close to the free
nanotube band edge until the potential exceeds a threshold value, after which
the binding energy increases rapidly. When the potential strength is held
constant and the range is varied, we find resonant behavior: the binding energy
passes through a maximum as the range of the potential is increased. Large
electric fields confined to a small region of the nanotube are required to
create localized states far from the band edge.

Kolmogorov equations for stochastic processes for contour enhancement and
completion. The solutions are group-convolutions with the corresponding Green's
function, which we derive in explicit form. We mainly focus on the Kolmogorov
equations for contour enhancement processes which, in contrast to the
Kolmogorov equations for contour completion, do not include convection. The
Green's functions of these left-invariant partial differential equations
coincide with the heat-kernels on SE(2), which we explicitly derive. Then we
compute completion distributions on SE(2) which are the product of a forward
and a backward resolvent evolved from resp. source and sink distribution on
SE(2). On the one hand, the modes of Mumford's direction process for contour
completion coincide with elastica curves minimizing $\int \kappa^{2} + \epsilon
ds$, related to zero-crossings of 2 left-invariant derivatives of the
completion distribution. On the other hand, the completion measure for the
contour enhancement concentrates on geodesics minimizing $\int \sqrt{\kappa^{2}
+ \epsilon} ds$. This motivates a comparison between geodesics and elastica,
which are quite similar. However, we derive more practical analytic solutions
for the geodesics. The theory is motivated by medical image analysis
applications where enhancement of elongated structures in noisy images is
required. We use left-invariant (non)-linear evolution processes for automated
contour enhancement on invertible orientation scores, obtained from an image by

according to which for uniform ground states of systems of (interacting)
fermions, which may be metallic or insulating, the number of k points
corresponding to non-negative values of G_s(k;mu) is equal to the total number
of particles with spin index s in these ground states. Here G_s(k;mu) is the
single-particle Green function of particles with spin index s at the chemical
potential mu. For the cases where the two-body interaction potential is
short-range, and in particular for lattice models, we explicitly demonstrate
that this theorem is unconditionally valid, irrespective of the strength of the
bare interaction potential. We arrive at this conclusion by amongst other
things demonstrating that the perturbation series expansion for self-energy in
terms of skeleton diagrams, as encountered in the proof of the Luttinger-Ward
identity, is uniformly convergent for almost all momenta and energies. We
further investigate the mechanisms underlying some reported instances of
failure of the Luttinger theorem. With one exception, for all the cases
considered in this paper, we show that the apparent failures of the Luttinger
theorem can be attributed either to shortcomings of the employed
single-particle Green functions or to misapplication of this theorem. The one
exceptional case brings to light the possibility of a genuine failure of the
Luttinger theorem for insulating ground states, which we show to be brought
about by a false limit that in principle can be reached on taking the
zero-temperature limit without the value of mu coinciding with the
zero-temperature limit of the chemical potential satisfying the equation of
state at finite temperatures; no such ambiguity can arise for metallic states.

plausible dark energy theories and gravity theories, e.g., inflation,
quintessence, k-essence, f(R), Generalized Einstein-Aether f(K), MOND, TeVeS,

of numerous conflicting results, both analytical and numerical. In particular,
there is much disagreement on whether the decay rate of an initially pure

${\bar\ell}$ is the least multipole moment whose excitation is not disallowed,

decoupled secondary bar may produce only a weak twist of the kinematic minor
axis in the stellar velocity field, due to the relatively large random motion
of stars in the central region. We also find that the edge-on nuclear bars are
probably not related to boxy peanut-shaped bulges which are most likely to be
edge-on primary large-scale bars. Finally we demonstrate that the non-rigid
rotation of the secondary bar causes its pattern speed not to be derived with
great accuracy using the Tremaine-Weinberg method. We also compare with

physics of correlated quantum systems. Much attention has now turned to
mixtures of bosonic and fermionic atoms. A central puzzle is the disagreement
between the experimental observation of a reduced bosonic visibility ${\cal
V}_b$, and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations which show ${\cal V}_b$
increasing. In this paper, we present QMC simulations which evaluate the
density profiles and ${\cal V}_b$ of mixtures of bosons and fermions in
one-dimensional optical lattices. We resolve the discrepancy between theory and
experiment by identifying parameter regimes where ${\cal V}_b$ is reduced, and
where it is increased. We present a simple qualitative picture of the different
response to the fermion admixture in terms of the superfluid and
Mott-insulating domains before and after the fermions are included. Finally, we
show that ${\cal V}_b$ exhibits kinks which are tied to the domain evolution
present in the pure case, and also additional structure arising from the
formation of boson-fermion molecules, a prediction for future experiments.

established by searching for sources with periodic variability in 506 archival
Chandra observations and 441 archival XMM-Newton observations of the Galactic
plane (|b|<5 degree). Our search revealed four sources with periodic
variability on time scales of 200-5000 s, all of which are probably accreting
white dwarfs. We identify 7 of 12 known Galactic magnetars, but find no new
examples with periods between 5 and 20 s. We convert this non-detection into
limits on the total number of Galactic magnetars by computing the fraction of
the young Galactic stellar population that was included in our survey. We find
that easily-detectable magnetars, modeled after persistent anomalous X-ray
pulsars, could have been identified in 5% of the Galactic spiral arms by mass.
If we assume there are 3 previously-known examples within our random survey,
then there are 59 (+92,-32) in the Galaxy. Transient magnetars in quiescence
could have been identified throughout 0.4% of the spiral arms, and the lack of
new examples implies that <540 exist in the Galaxy (90% confidence). Similar
constraints are found by considering the detectability of transient magnetars
in outburst by current and past X-ray missions. For assumed lifetimes of 1e4
yr, we find that the birth rate of magnetars could range between 0.003 and 0.06
per year. Therefore, the birth rate of magnetars is at least 10% of that for
normal radio pulsars. The magnetar birth rate could exceed that of radio
pulsars, unless the lifetimes of transient magnetars are >1e5 yr. Obtaining
better constraints will require wide-field X-ray or radio searches for
transient X-ray pulsars similar to XTE J1810--197, AX J1845.0--0250, CXOU

statistical practice to then construct a confidence interval for the parameter
of interest based on the assumption that the selected model had been given to
us a priori. This assumption is false and it can lead to a confidence interval
with poor coverage properties. We provide an easily-computed finite sample
upper bound (calculated by repeated numerical evaluation of a double integral)
to the minimum coverage probability of this confidence interval. This bound
applies for model selection by any of the following methods: minimum AIC,
minimum BIC, maximum adjusted R-squared, minimum Mallows' Cp and t-tests. The
importance of this upper bound is that it delineates general categories of
design matrices and model selection procedures for which this confidence
interval has poor coverage properties. This upper bound is shown to be a finite
sample analogue of an earlier large sample upper bound due to Kabaila and Leeb.

contain not only the total gravitational mass of the source, but also an {\it

""temporal Schwarzschild"", ""spatial Schwarzschild"" and
""Reissner-Nordstr{\""o}m-like"" exteriors are not arbitrary but are completely
determined by star's parameters, like the equation of state and the
gravitational potential. Consequently, in the braneworld scenario the
gravitational field outside of a star is no longer determined by the total mass
alone, but also depends on the details of the internal structure of the source.
We show that the general relativistic upper bound on the gravitational
potential $M/R < 4/9$, for perfect fluid stars, is significantly increased in
these exteriors. Namely, $M/R < 1/2$, $M/R < 2/3$ and $M/R < 1$ for the
temporal Schwarzschild, spatial Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr{\""o}m-like
exteriors, respectively. Regarding the surface gravitational redshift, we find
that the general relativistic Schwarzschild exterior as well as the braneworld
spatial Schwarzschild exterior lead to the same upper bound, viz., $Z < 2$.
However, when the external spacetime is the temporal Schwarzschild metric or
the Reissner-Nordstr{\""o}m-like exterior there is no such constraint: $Z <
\infty$. This infinite difference in the limiting value of $Z$ is because for
these exteriors the effective pressure at the surface is negative. The results
of our work are potentially observable and can be used to test the theory.

our work. Specifically, that the deviation from the geodesic motion in 4D is
due to the variation of the rest mass of a particle, which is induced by the
scalar field in the 5D metric and the explicit dependence of the spacetime
metric on the extra coordinate. Thus, the principle of least action not only
leads to the correct equations of motion, but also provides a concrete physical

to what extent the change in the Casimir energy that arises when the parallel

condensation energy. Our aim here is merely to obtain an order of magnitude
estimate. To this end, the material is modelled as consisting below T_c of
parallel plasma sheets separated by vacuum and as without a significant Casimir
effect above T_c. Due to the close proximity of the Cu-O planes the system is
in the regime where the Casimir effect becomes a van der Waals type effect,

essential signatures of the protein families. In order to elucidate what kind
of ingredients constitute such family-specific signatures, we apply singular
value decomposition to a set of PSSMs and examine the properties of dominant
right and left singular vectors. The first right singular vectors were
correlated with various amino acid indices including relative mutability, amino
acid composition in protein interior, hydropathy, or turn propensity, depending
on proteins. A significant correlation between the first left singular vector
and a measure of site conservation was observed. It is shown that the
contribution of the first singular component to the PSSMs act to disfavor
potentially but falsely functionally important residues at conserved sites. The
second right singular vectors were highly correlated with hydrophobicity
scales, and the corresponding left singular vectors with contact numbers of
protein structures. It is suggested that sequence alignment with a PSSM is
essentially equivalent to threading supplemented with functional information.
The presented method may be used to separate functionally important sites from
structurally important ones, and thus it may be a useful tool for predicting
protein functions.

the dipole-dipole interaction for closely spaced atoms. Exact calculations for
small atom systems in the near-Dicke limit show the increased emission times

data can be handled within a reasonable CPU time by using a conventional
relational database management system with appropriate indexing of geometric
data. This method, which we call geometric indexing, can enumerate ligand
binding sites that are structurally similar to sub-structures of a query
protein among more than 160,000 possible candidates within a few hours of CPU
time on an ordinary desktop computer. After detecting a set of high scoring
ligand binding sites by the geometric indexing search, structural alignments at
atomic resolution are constructed by iteratively applying the Hungarian
algorithm, and the statistical significance of the final score is estimated
from an empirical model based on a gamma distribution. Applications of this
method to several protein structures clearly shows that significant
similarities can be detected between local structures of non-homologous as well
as homologous proteins.

E(B-V), of up to 0.36 mag. The majority (13 out of 14) of the extinction curves
are not steep in the UV. Of the seven best determined extinction curves, five
have extinction curves that are as flat as the standard Galactic curve in the
optical and near UV, but flatter in the far UV, and without the 2175 Angstrom
feature. One AGN, B3 0754+394, has a steep SMC-like extinction curve, and
another, Mrk 304, has an LMC-like extinction curve, including a probable 2175
Ang. bump. The remaining seven, lower-quality, extinction curves have overall
shapes that are consistent with an LMC-like shape or a flatter shape. Two have
possible 2175 features, and one might be identical to the Galactic curve. The
flatter curves that predominate in our best determined extinction curves are
not as flat as the Gaskell et al. (2004) extinction curve for radio-loud AGNs.
This suggests that the previous radio-loud extinction curve might be slightly
too flat in the range 4 < 1/lambda < 6.5 inverse microns because of
luminosity-dependent reddening biases in the composite spectra, but further
investigation is needed. We present a parameterized average AGN extinction
curve. Observed variations in the continuum properties of the AGNs are
inconsistent with intrinsic object-to-object variations because observed
differences are least in the far UV where changes in the accretion disk
spectrum should be greatest. We suggest that the steepening of AGN spectra
around Lyman alpha is the result of a small amount of SMC-like dust (E(B-V) ~
0.03). We find the largest object-to-object differences in spectral shape to be
in the Fe II emission of the ""small blue bump"".

the polarized flux is comparable to the amplitude of variability of the total
U-band flux, except that the polarized flux follows the total flux with a lag
of 8 +/- 3 days. The time lag and the constancy of the position angle strongly
favor a scattering origin for the variable polarization rather than a
non-thermal synchrotron origin. The orientation of the position angle of the
polarized flux (parallel to the radio axis) and the size of the lag imply that
the polarization arises from electron scattering in a flattened region within
the low-ionization component of the broad-line-region. Polarization from dust
scattering in the equatorial torus is ruled out as the source of the lag in
polarized flux because it would produce a larger lag and, unless the
half-opening angle of the torus is more than 53 degrees, the polarization would
be perpendicular to the radio axis. We note a long-term change in the
percentage of polarization at similar total flux levels and this could be due
either to changing non-axisymmetry in the optical continuum emission, or a
change in the number of scatterers on a timescale of years.

implies that the internal reddening of NGC5548 is E(B-V) = 0.17 mag. The
extinction curve is consistent with the mean curve of other AGNs found by
Gaskell & Benker, but inconsistent with an SMC-type reddening curve. Because
most IR emission originates exterior to the broad-line region (BLR), the SED
seen by the inner BLR is different from that seen by the outer BLR and from the
earth. The most likely BLR covering factor is ~ 40% and it is not possible to
get an overall BLR covering factor of less than 20%. This requires that the BLR
is not spherically symmetric and that we are viewing through a hole.
Line-continuum variability transfer functions are consistent with this
geometry. The covering factor and geometry imply that near the equatorial plane
the BLR covering approaches 100%. The spectrum seen by the outer regions of the
BLR and by the torus is thus modified by the absorption in the inner BLR. This
shielding solves the problem of observed BLR ionization stratification being
much greater than implied by photoionization models. The BLR obscuration also
removes the problem of the torus covering factor being greater than the BLR
covering factor, and gives consistency with the observed fraction of obscured
AGNs. The flux reduction at the torus also reduces the problem of AGN
dust-reverberation lags giving sizes smaller than the dust-sublimation radii.

In particular, we study the effects of baryon chemical potential on eta and

collisions (pi pi, pi N, and NN) for a state slightly deviated from thermal
equilibrium at temperature T and baryon chemical potential mu. The use of
phenomenological amplitudes in the collision terms, which are constructed to
reproduce experimental data, greatly helps to extend the validity region in the
T-mu plane. The total viscosity coefficient eta(T,mu)=eta^pi + eta^N increases
as a function of T and mu, indirectly reflecting energy dependences of binary
cross sections. The increase in mu direction is due to enhancement of the
nucleon contribution eta^N while the pion contribution eta^pi diminishes with
increasing mu. On the other hand, due to rapid growth of entropy density, the
ratio eta/s becomes a decreasing function of T and mu in a wide region of the
T-mu plane. In the kinematical region we investigated T < 180MeV, mu < 1GeV,
the smallest value of eta/s is about 0.3. Thus, it never violates the
conjectured lower bound eta/s= 1/4pi ~ 0.1. The smallness of eta/s in the
hadronic phase and its continuity at T ~ T_c (at least for crossover at small
mu) implies that the ratio will be small enough in the deconfined phase T >
T_c. There is a nontrivial structure at low temperature and at around normal
nuclear density. We examine its possible interpretation as the liquid-gas phase
transition.

their uttering. Thus, the pronounctiation errors might depend on the characters
composing the words. The average error rate reduction that we observed is

trends by applying high-pass filters to the time series. However, the choice of
the filter is very important because it can keep the periodic signals
throughout the spectrum. At the same time, these filters should not introduce
any spurious effects on the remaining signal, which would modify the periodic
signatures in the Fourier domain. One of the most used filters is the so-called
backwards difference filter that can be applied when the time series are
regularly sampled. The problem of this filter is that the amplitudes and the
phases of the periodic signals in the Fourier domain are modified and,
therefore, their extracted amplitudes are biased when the frequency of the
periodic signals decreases. The objective of this research note is to give a
correction that could be applied to the power spectrum to over come this
problem. We properly derive the transfer function of the backwards difference
filter and we show how this can be applied to the power spectrum to correct the
amplitudes. For the amplitude spectrum and the time series, we also derive a
correction for the phase. The amplitudes of the periodic signals in the
resultant power spectrum density are corrected from the cut-off frequency down
to zero.

required for successful message-passing decoding of some important families of
graph-based code ensembles (including low-density parity-check codes and
variations of repeat-accumulate codes). The transmission of the code ensembles
is assumed to take place over a binary erasure channel, and the bounds refer to
the asymptotic case where we let the block length tend to infinity. The
simplicity of the bounds derived in this paper stems from the fact that they
are easily evaluated and are expressed in terms of some basic parameters of the
ensemble which include the fraction of degree-2 variable nodes, the target bit
erasure probability and the gap between the channel capacity and the design
rate of the ensemble. This paper demonstrates that the number of iterations
which is required for successful message-passing decoding scales at least like
the inverse of the gap (in rate) to capacity, provided that the fraction of
degree-2 variable nodes of these turbo-like ensembles does not vanish (hence,
the number of iterations becomes unbounded as the gap to capacity vanishes).

JHK_s bands. We find that the rms scatter on the photometric redshift estimate
over 1<z<2 is sigma_z=0.2 from DES alone and sigma_z=0.15 from DES+VISTA, i.e.
an improvement of more than 30%. We draw attention to the effects of galaxy
formation scenarios such as reddening on the photo-z estimate and using our
neural network code, calculate the extinction, A_v for these reddened galaxies.
We also look at the impact of using different training sets when calculating
photometric redshifts. In particular, we find that using the ongoing DEEP2 and
VVDS-Deep spectroscopic surveys to calibrate photometric redshifts for DES,
will prove effective. However we need to be aware of uncertainties in the
photometric redshift bias that arise when using different training sets as
these will translate into errors in the dark energy equation of state
parameter, w. Furthermore, we show that the neural network error estimate on
the photometric redshift may be used to remove outliers from our samples before
any kind of cosmological analysis, in particular for large-scale structure
experiments. By removing all galaxies with a neural network photo-z error
estimate of greater than 0.1 from our DES+VHS sample, we can constrain the
galaxy power spectrum out to a redshift of 2 and reduce the fractional error on
this power spectrum by ~15-20% compared to using the entire catalogue.

the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity, solving the Usadel equation

we report that in a certain parameter regime the spatial oscillations of the
anomalous (superconducting) part of the Green's function induced in the
ferromagnet by the proximity effect from the s-wave superconductor, are damped
out due to the presence of spin-flip processes. As a consequence, spin-flip
scattering may under certain conditions actually enhance the local density of
states due to the oscillatory behaviour of the latter in
ferromagnet/superconductor structures. We also conjecture that the damping
could be manifested in the behaviour of the critical temperature ($T_c$) of the
s-wave superconductor in contact with the ferromagnet. More specifically, we
argue that the non-monotonic decrease of $T_c$ in ferromagnet/s-wave
superconductor junctions without magnetic impurities is altered to a monotonic,
non-oscillatory decrease when the condition $1>16\tau_\text{sf}^2h^2$ is
fulfilled, where $\tau_\text{sf}$ is the spin-flip relaxation time and $h$ is

Observatory Wide-Field Infrared Survey. This survey covers 1.53 deg^2 to
5-sigma detection limits of K_vega = 20.5-21 and J_vega = 22.5, and overlaps
with the DEEP2 spectroscopic redshift survey. We discuss the details of this
NIR survey, including our J and K band counts. We show that the K-band galaxy
population has a redshift distribution that varies with K-magnitude, with most
K < 17 galaxies at z < 1.5 and a significant fraction (38.3+/-0.3%) of K > 19
systems at z > 1.5. We further investigate the stellar masses and morphological
properties of K-selected galaxies, particularly extremely red objects, as
defined by (R-K) > 5.3 and (I-K) > 4. One of our conclusions is that the ERO
selection is a good method for picking out galaxies at z > 1.2, and within our
magnitude limits, the most massive galaxies at these redshifts. The ERO limit
finds 75% of all M_* > 10^{11} M_0 galaxies at z ~ 1.5 down to K_vega = 19.7.
We further find that the morphological break-down of K < 19.7 EROs is dominated
by early-types (57+/-3%) and peculiars (34+/-3%). However, about a fourth of
the early-types are distorted ellipticals, and within CAS parameter space these
bridge the early-type and peculiar population, suggesting a morphological
evolutionary sequence. We also investigate the use of a (I-K) > 4 selection to
locate EROs, finding that it selects galaxies at slightly higher average
redshifts (<z> = 1.43+/-0.32) than the (R-K) > 5.3 limit with <z> =
1.28+/-0.23. Finally, by using the redshift distribution of K < 20 selected
galaxies, and the properties of our EROs, we are able to rule out all
monolithic collapse models for the formation of massive galaxies.

fine-grained phase-space structure of dark matter throughout the Galactic halo.
Our goal is to understand this structure on the scales relevant for direct and
indirect detection experiments. Our method is based on evaluating the geodesic
deviation equation along the trajectories of individual DM particles. It
requires no assumptions about the symmetry or stationarity of the halo
formation process. In this paper we study general static potentials which
exhibit more complex behaviour than the separable potentials studied
previously. For ellipsoidal logarithmic potentials with a core, phase mixing is
sensitive to the resonance structure, as indicated by the number of independent
orbital frequencies. Regions of chaotic mixing can be identified by the very
rapid decrease in the real space density of the associated dark matter streams.
We also study the evolution of stream density in ellipsoidal NFW halos with
radially varying isopotential shape, showing that if such a model is applied to
the Galactic halo, at least $10^5$ streams are expected near the Sun. The most
novel aspect of our approach is that general non-static systems can be studied
through implementation in a cosmological N-body code. Such an implementation
allows a robust and accurate evaluation of the enhancements in annihilation
radiation due to fine-scale structure such as caustics. We embed the scheme in
the current state-of-the-art code GADGET-3 and present tests which demonstrate
that N-body discreteness effects can be kept under control in realistic
configurations.

"0711.1106","Haye Hinrichsen","Haye Hinrichsen","Ageing in homogeneous systems at criticality","8 pages, 2 eps figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  Ageing phenomena are observed in a large variety of dynamical systems
exhibiting a slow relaxation from a non-equilibrium initial state. Ageing can
be characterised in terms of the linear response R(t,s) at time t to a local
perturbation at time s<t. Usually one distinguishes two dynamical regimes,
namely, the quasi-stationary regime, where the response is translationally
invariant in time, and the ageing regime, where this invariance is broken. In
general these two regimes are separate in the sense that the two limits of (a)
taking t,s to infinity while keeping t/s fixed, and (b) taking t,s to infinity
with fixed t-s, give different results. In recent years, ageing was also
investigated in the context of homogeneous critical systems such as the
Glauber-Ising model and the contact process. Here we argue that, in contrast to
a widespread believe, homogeneous critical systems do not have a separate
quasi-stationary regime, hence the two limits do commute. Moreover, it is
discussed under which conditions two particular exponents, denoted as a and a'
in the literature, have to be identical.

Markarian 509, using X-ray data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and
optical data taken by the SMARTS consortium. Both light curves show significant
variations, and are strongly correlated with the optical flux leading the X-ray
flux by 15 days. The X-ray power spectrum shows a steep high-frequency slope of
-2.0, breaking to a slope of -1.0 at at timescale of 34 days. The lag from
optical to X-ray emission is most likely caused by variations in the accretion
disk propagating inward.
