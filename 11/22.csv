double barrier structure in the adiabatic limit. The superconducting barriers
are assumed to be reflection-less so that an incident electron on the barrier
can either tunnel through it or Andreev reflect from it. In this structure,
quantum charge pumping can be achieved (a) by modulating the amplitudes,
$\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ of the two superconducting gaps or alternatively, (b)
by a periodic modulation of the order parameter phases, $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$
of the superconducting barriers. In the former case, we show that the
superconducting gap gives rise to a very sharp resonance in the transmission
resulting in quantization of pumped charge, when the pumping contour encloses
the resonance. On the other hand, we find that quantization is hard to achieve
in the latter case. We show that inclusion of weak electron-electron
interaction in the quantum wire leads to renormalisation group evolution of the
transmission amplitude towards the perfectly transmitting limit due to
proximity effects. Hence as we approach the zero temperature limit, we get
destruction of quantized pumped charge. This is in sharp contrast to the case
of charge pumping in a double barrier in a Luttinger liquid where quantized
charge pumping is actually achieved in the zero temperature limit. We also
propose an experimental set-up to study these effects.

modeled in the recent past to explain both the initial cosmological singularity
problem and the observationally supported cosmological perturbations. Here I
present an overview of the recent developments in the use of modified
Gauss-Bonnet gravity to explain current observations, touching on key
cosmological and astrophysical constraints applicable to theories of
scalar-tensor gravity. The Gauss-Bonnet type modification of Einstein's theory
admits nonsingular solutions for a wide range of scalar-curvature couplings. It
also provides plausible explanation to some outstanding cosmological
conundrums, including: the transition from matter dominance to dark energy and
the late time cosmic acceleration. The focus is placed here to constrain such
an effective theory of gravity against the recent cosmological and
astrophysical observations.

compactification of $E_8 \times E_8$ heterotic string theory on a half-flat
manifold is the product space-time $R^{1,2} \times Z_7$ where $Z_7$ is a
generalized cylinder with $G_2$ riemannian holonomy. Standard embedding on
$Z_7$ then implies an embedding on the half-flat manifold which involves the
torsionful connection rather than the Levi-Civita connection. This leads to the
breakdown of $E_8 \times E_8$ to $E_6 \times E_8$, as in the case of the
standard embedding on Calabi-Yau manifolds, which agrees with the result
derived recently by Gurrieri, Lukas and Micu (arXiv:0709.1932) using a
different approach. Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation is then implemented via
the torsionful connection on half-flat manifolds.

clustering. Obtained from the equations of motion or their path-integral
formulation, they provide several perturbative expansions that are organized in
different fashion or involve different partial resummations. We focus on the
two-point and three-point correlation functions, but these methods also apply
to all higher-order correlation and response functions. We present the general
formalism, which holds for the gravitational dynamics as well as for similar
models, such as the Zeldovich dynamics, that obey similar hydrodynamical
equations of motion with a quadratic nonlinearity. We give our explicit
analytical results up to one-loop order for the simpler Zeldovich dynamics. For
the gravitational dynamics, we compare our one-loop numerical results with
numerical simulations. We check that the standard perturbation theory is
recovered from the path integral by expanding over Feynman's diagrams. However,
the latter expansion is organized in a different fashion and it contains some
UV divergences that cancel out as we sum all diagrams of a given order.
Resummation schemes modify the scaling of tree and one-loop diagrams, which
exhibit the same scaling over the linear power spectrum (contrary to the
standard expansion). However, they do not significantly improve over standard
perturbation theory for the bispectrum, unless one uses accurate two-point
functions (e.g. a fit to the nonlinear power spectrum from simulations).
Extending the range of validity to smaller scales, to reach the range described
by phenomenological models, seems to require at least two-loop diagrams.

generated $\tilde\Lambda_c$ and $\tilde\Sigma_c$ resonances remain close to
their free space position while acquiring a remarkable width because of the
thermal smearing of Pauli blocking. Therefore, the $D$ meson spectral density
shows a single pronounced quasiparticle peak close to the free mass, that

the Landscape. We demand that the matter profile in the LTB background satisfy
the weak energy condition. For sample profiles that satisfy this restriction,
we find that the evolution of the bubble (in terms of the physically relevant
coordinates intrinsic to the shell) is largely unaffected by the prsence of
local inhomogeneities. Our setup should also be a useful toy model for
capturing the effects of ambient inhomogeneities on an inflating region.

instruments and the observational conditions, the simulator provides a virtual
observation of a patch of the sky. It includes several sources of noise such as
photon-noise, sky background, seeing, and instrumental noise. Ray-tracing
through simulated mass distributions accounts for gravitational lensing. Source
morphologies are realistically simulated based on shapelet decompositions of
galaxy images retrieved from the GOODS-ACS archive. According to their
morphological class, spectral-energy-distributions are assigned to the source
galaxies in order to reproduce observations of each galaxy in arbitrary
photometric bands. We illustrate our techniques showing virtual observations of
a galaxy-cluster core as it would be observed with the space telescope DUNE,
which was recently proposed to ESA within its ""Cosmic vision"" programme.

extension SWRL to develop an integrated ontology/rule language, and 2) layering
rules on top of an ontology with RuleML and OWL. Toward this end, we are

alternative approaches for dealing with inconsistencies in the knowledge base.

determine where the condensate goes out of equilibrium as it approaches the

This is done within a quantum Kibble-Zurek scheme traditionally employed in the
context of symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions. Then we study the
influence of the nonequilibrium dynamics near a critical point on the
condensate magnetization. In particular, when the quench stops at the critical
point, nonlinear oscillations of magnetization occur. They are characterized by
a period and an amplitude that are inversely proportional. If we keep driving
the condensate far away from the critical point through the unmagnetized
``symmetric'' polar phase, the amplitude of magnetization oscillations slowly
decreases reaching a non-zero asymptotic value. That process is described by
the equation that can be mapped onto the classical mechanical problem of a
particle moving under the influence of harmonic and ``anti-friction'' forces
whose interplay leads to surprisingly simple fixed-amplitude oscillations. We
obtain several scaling results relating the condensate magnetization to the
quench rate, and verify numerically all analytical predictions.

system is in thermal equilibrium at temperature $\beta^{-1}$. For spatially
bounded free fields, the Bekenstein bound states that the specific entropy
satisfies the inequality $\frac{S}{E} < 2 \pi R$, where $R$ stands for the
radius of the smallest sphere that circumscribes the system. Employing the
strong-coupling perturbative expansion, we obtain the renormalized mean energy
$E$ and entropy $S$ for the system up to the order $(g_{0})^{-\frac{2}{p}}$,
presenting an analytical proof that the specific entropy also satisfies in some
situations a quantum bound. Defining $\epsilon_d^{(r)}$ as the renormalized
zero-point energy for the free theory per unit length, the dimensionless
quantity $\xi=\frac{\beta}{L}$ and $h_1(d)$ and $h_2(d)$ as positive analytic
functions of $d$, for the case of high temperature, we get that the specific
entropy satisfies $\frac{S}{E} < 2\pi R \frac{h_1(d)}{h_2(d)} \xi$. When
considering the low temperature behavior of the specific entropy, we have
$\frac{S}{E} <2\pi R \frac{h_1(d)}{\epsilon_d^{(r)}}\xi^{1-d}$. Therefore the
sign of the renormalized zero-point energy can invalidate this quantum bound.
If the renormalized zero point-energy is a positive quantity, at intermediate

predictive. We also consider a modified scenario with new physics beyond a
certain high-energy cut-off showing up as non-renormalizable operators (NRO) in
the inflaton field. We find that both kinds of models fit remarkably well CMB
and LSS data, with very few free parameters. Besides, a large part of these
models naturally predict a reasonable number of e-folds. A robust feature of
these scenarios is the smallness of tensor perturbations (r < 10^{-3}). The NRO
case can give a sizeable running of the spectral index while achieving a
sufficient number of e-folds. We use Bayesian model comparison tools to assess
the relative performance of the models. We believe that these scenarios can be
considered as a standard physical class of inflationary models, on a similar
footing with monomial potentials.

Dvali's proposal contains additional N~10^{32} Z_2-conserved quantum fields
beyond the Standard Model particles with mass ~1 TeV, which weaken gravity by a
factor of 1/N, and thus explain the hierarchy between the Plank scale and the
electroweak scale. We show that, in this scenario, the decay rates of inflaton
fields through gravitational decay channels are enhanced by a factor of N, and
thus they decay into N species of the quantum fields very efficiently, in the
limit that quantum gravity effects are unimportant for the gravitational decay
rate. In order not to over-reheat the universe, inflaton mass, vacuum
expectation value of inflaton, or non-minimal gravitational coupling should be
tightly fine-tuned. Our conclusion holds even when the gravitational decay is
prohibited by some symmetry of the theory; the universe may still be
over-reheated via annihilation of inflatons, if the number density of inflaton
quanta is greater than the critical value.

performed taking into account both thermal and non-thermal production
mechanisms. The hadronic thermal emission rate is based on an electromagnetic
current-correlation function with a low-mass region (LMR, M \lsim 1 GeV)
dominated by vector mesons (\rho, \omega, \phi) and an intermediate-mass region
(IMR, 1 GeV \le M \le 3 GeV) characterized by (the onset of) a multi-meson
continuum. A convolution of the emission rates over a thermal fireball
expansion results in good agreement with experiment in the low-mass spectra,
confirming the predicted broadening of the \rho meson in hadronic matter in
connection with the prevalence of baryon-induced medium effects. The absolute
magnitude of the LMR excess is mostly controlled by the fireball lifetime,
which in turn leads to a consistent explanation of the dilepton excess in the
IMR in terms of thermal radiation. The analysis of experimental
transverse-momentum (q_T) spectra reveals discrepancies with thermal emission
for q_T \gsim 1 GeV in noncentral In-In collisions, which we address by
extending our calculations by: (i) a refined treatment of \rho decays at
thermal freezeout, (ii) primordially produced \rho's subject to energy-loss,
(iii) Drell-Yan annihilation, and (iv) thermal radiation from t-channel meson
exchange processes. We investigate the sensitivity of dilepton spectra to the
critical temperature and hadro-chemical freezeout of the fireball. The \rho
broadening in the LMR turns out to be robust, while in the IMR Quark-Gluon
Plasma radiation is moderate unless the critical temperature is rather low.

and our counting (for samples of size $N$ up to 4096 spins) gives results which
are consistent with our arguments. We can estimate the leading finite size
correction for any thermodynamic quantity by finding its $K$ dependence in the
Parisi scheme and then replacing $K$ by K(N). Our predictions of how the
Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the internal energy of the system approach
their thermodynamic limit compare well with the results of our Monte Carlo

methods used to study Lie algebras must be modified for our purposes. We use an
explicit representation of the Lie group SL(3,O) to produce the multiplication
table of the corresponding algebra sl(3,O). Both the multiplication table and
the group are then utilized to find subalgebras of sl(3,O). In particular, we
identify various subalgebras of the form sl(n, F) and su(n, F) within sl(3,O)
and we also find algebras corresponding to generalized Lorentz groups. Methods
based upon automorphisms of complex Lie algebras are developed to find less
obvious subalgebras of sl(3,O). While we focus on the subalgebra structure of
our real form of E6, these methods may also be used to study the subalgebra
structure of any other real form of E6. A maximal set of simultaneously
measurable observables in physics corresponds to a maximal set of Casimir
operators in the Lie algebra. We not only identify six Casimir operators in E6,
but produce a nested sequence of subalgebras and Casimir operators in E6
containing both su(3)+su(2)+u(1) corresponding to the Standard Model and the

sub-orbital surveying experiment designed to study the evolutionary history and
processes of star formation in local galaxies (including the Milky Way) and
galaxies at cosmological distances. The BLAST continuum camera, which consists
of 270 detectors distributed between 3 arrays, observes simultaneously in
broad-band (30%) spectral-windows at 250, 350, and 500 microns. The optical
design is based on a 2m diameter telescope, providing a diffraction-limited
resolution of 30"" at 250 microns. The gondola pointing system enables raster
mapping of arbitrary geometry, with a repeatable positional accuracy of ~30"";
post-flight pointing reconstruction to ~5"" rms is achieved. The on-board
telescope control software permits autonomous execution of a pre-selected set
of maps, with the option of manual override. In this paper we describe the
primary characteristics and measured in-flight performance of BLAST. BLAST
performed a test-flight in 2003 and has since made two scientifically
productive long-duration balloon flights: a 100-hour flight from ESRANGE

potential energy surface, the extended auxiliary electronic degrees of freedom
evolve as a harmonic oscillator centered around the adiabatic propagation of
the self-consistent ground state. The formulation enables the application of
higher-order symplectic or geometric integration schemes that are stable and
energy conserving even under incomplete self-consistency convergence. It is
demonstrated how the extended Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics improves the
accuracy by over an order of magnitude compared to previous formulations at the

build magnetic fields without the aid of a tachocline of shear, that those

established in hydrodynamic progenitor calculations, but strongly quenched in

simple form (l/r)^k = 1 + e cos(m*phi), where k = 2 - alpha > 0 and 'l' and 'e'
are generalisations of the semi-latus-rectum and the eccentricity. 'm' is given
as a function of 'eccentricity'. For nearly circular orbits 'm' is sqrt{k},
while the above orbit becomes exact at the energy of escape where 'e' is one
and 'm' is 'k'. Orbits in the logarithmic potential that gives rise to a
constant circular velocity are derived via the limit of small alpha. For such
orbits, r^2 vibrates almost harmonically whatever the 'eccentricity'. Unbound
orbits in power-law potentials are given in an appendix. The transformation of
orbits in one potential to give orbits in a different potential is used to
determine orbits in potentials that are positive powers of r. These
transformations are extended to form a group which associates orbits in sets of
six potentials, e.g. there are corresponding orbits in the potentials
proportional to r, r^{-2/3}, r^{-3}, r^{-6}, r^{4/3} and r^{-4}. A degeneracy
reduces this to three, which are r^{-1}, r^2 and r^{-4} for the Keplerian case.
A generalisation of this group includes the isochrone with the Kepler set.

square-free monomial inequalities in the Fourier transformed coordinates. These
inequalities, along with the phylogenetic invariants, form a complete

integrations of the orbital evolution of particles. The deviation of the
derived spectral parameters for various sources of dust used in the model
reached maximum at the elongation (measured eastward from the Sun) between 90
deg and 120 deg. For the future zodiacal light Doppler shifts measurements, it
is important to pay a particular attention to observing at this elongation
range. At the elongations of the fields observed by WHAM, the model-predicted
Doppler shifts were close to each other for several scattering functions
considered. Therefore the main conclusions of our paper don't depend on a
scattering function and mass distribution of particles if they are reasonable.
A comparison of the dependencies of the Doppler shifts on solar elongation and
the mean width of the Mg I line modeled for different sources of dust with
those obtained from the WHAM observations shows that the fraction of cometary
particles in zodiacal dust is significant and can be dominant. Cometary
particles originating inside Jupiter's orbit and particles originating beyond
Jupiter's orbit (including trans-Neptunian dust particles) can contribute to
zodiacal dust about 1/3 each, with a possible deviation from 1/3 up to 0.1-0.2.
The fraction of asteroidal dust is estimated to be about 0.3-0.5. The mean
eccentricities of zodiacal particles located at 1-2 AU from the Sun that better
fit the WHAM observations are between 0.2 and 0.5, with a more probable value
of about 0.3.

\leq i \leq n$. This notion from {\it Control Theory} is closely related to the
notion of {\it Hyperbolicity} used intensively in the {\it PDE} theory.
  The main theorem in this paper states that if $p(x_1,...,x_n)$ is a
homogeneous {\bf H-Stable} polynomial of degree $n$ with nonnegative
coefficients; $deg_{p}(i)$ is the maximum degree of the variable $x_i$, $C_i =
\min(deg_{p}(i),i)$ and $$ Cap(p) = \inf_{x_i > 0, 1 \leq i \leq n}

the Schrijver-Valiant conjecture on the number of perfect matchings in

(z=1.928) exhibits the steepest far-UV decline (F_nu prop nu^{-5.3}) among the
183 quasar HST-FOS spectra analyzed by Telfer et al. It is an ideal object to
test the crystalline dust hypothesis as well as alternative interpretations of
the UV break. We reconstruct the UV spectral energy distribution of Ton 34 by
combining HST, IUE and Palomar spectra. The far-UV continuum shows a very deep
continuum trough, which is bounded by a steep far-UV rise. We fit the trough
assuming nanodiamond dust grains. Extinction by carbon crystalline dust
reproduces the deep absorption trough of Ton 34 reasonably well, but not the
observed steep rise in the extreme UV. We also study the possibility of an
intrinsic continuum rollover. The dust might be part of a high velocity outflow
(13000 km/s), which is observed in absorption in the lines of CIV, OVI, NV and
Ly_alpha.

significant disagreement between the observations and the predictions of
stellar structure models. Results show that theoretical models underestimate
the radii and overestimate the effective temperatures of low-mass stars but
yield luminosities that accord with observations. A hypothesis based upon the
effects of stellar activity was put forward to explain the discrepancies. In
this paper we study the existence of the same trend in single active stars and
provide a consistent scenario to explain systematic differences between active
and inactive stars in the H-R diagram reported earlier. The analysis is done
using single field stars of spectral types late-K and M and computing their
bolometric magnitudes and temperatures through infrared colours and spectral
indices. The properties of the stars in samples of active and inactive stars
are compared statistically to reveal systematic differences. After accounting
for a number of possible bias effects, active stars are shown to be cooler than
inactive stars of similar luminosity therefore implying a larger radius as
well, in proportions that are in excellent agreement with those found from
eclipsing binaries. The present results generalise the existence of strong
radius and temperature dependences on stellar activity to the entire population
of low-mass stars, regardless of their membership in close binary systems.

optical, X-ray, and millimeter light-curves indicate, significant fraction of
the jet energy must be released in the vicinity of the millimeter-photosphere,
i.e. at distances where, due to the lateral expansion, the jet becomes
transparent at millimeter wavelengths. We conclude that this region is located
at ~10 parsecs, the distance coinciding with the location of the hot dust
region. This location is consistent with the high amplitude variations observed
on ~10 day time scale, provided the Lorentz factor of a jet is ~20. We argue
that dissipation is driven by reconfinement shock and demonstrate that X-rays
and gamma-rays are likely to be produced via inverse Compton scattering of
near/mid IR photons emitted by the hot dust. We also infer that the largest
gamma-to-synchrotron luminosity ratio ever recorded in this object - having
taken place during its lowest luminosity states - can be simply due to weaker
magnetic fields carried by a less powerful jet.

attracted interest over the years in view of its link with fundamental
properties of particle motion. The bulk of the approaches concerning the
torsion dynamics focus their attention on their geometrical nature and they are
naturally led to formulate a non-propagating theory.
  Here we review two different paradigms to describe the role of the torsion
field, as far as a propagating feature of the resulting dynamics is concerned.
However, these two proposals deal with different pictures, i.e., a macroscopic
approach, based on the construction of suitable potentials for the torsion
field, and a microscopic approach, which relies on the identification of
torsion with the gauge field associated with the local Lorentz symmetry. We

the reliability of communication over wireless channels. While space-time codes
have initially been designed with a focus on open-loop systems, recent
technological advances have enabled the possibility of low-rate feedback from
the receiver to the transmitter. The focus of this paper is on the implications
of this feedback in a single-user multi-antenna system with a general model for
spatial correlation. We assume a limited feedback model, that is, a coherent
receiver and statistics along with B bits of quantized channel information at
the transmitter. We study space-time coding with a family of linear dispersion
(LD) codes that meet an additional orthogonality constraint so as to ensure
low-complexity decoding. Our results show that, when the number of bits of
feedback (B) is small, a space-time coding scheme that is equivalent to
beamforming and does not code across time is optimal in a weak sense in that it
maximizes the average received SNR. As B increases, this weak optimality
transitions to optimality in a strong sense which is characterized by the
maximization of the average mutual information. Thus, from a system designer's
perspective, our work suggests that beamforming may not only be attractive from
a low-complexity viewpoint, but also from an information-theoretic viewpoint.

selection of reaction observables in dissipative collisions particularly
sensitive to the isovector part of the interaction, i.e. to the symmetry term
of the nuclear Equation of State (EoS). At low energies the behavior of the
symmetry energy around saturation influences dissipation and fragment
production mechanisms. We will first discuss the recently observed Dynamical
Dipole Radiation, due to a collective neutron-proton oscillation during the
charge equilibration in fusion and deep-inelastic collisions. Important Iso-EOS
effects are stressed. Reactions induced by unstable 132Sn beams appear to be
very promising tools to test the sub-saturation Isovector EoS. New Isospin
sensitive observables are also presented for deep-inelastic, fragmentation
collisions and Isospin equilibration measurements (Imbalance Ratios). The high
density symmetry term can be derived from isospin effects on heavy ion
reactions at relativistic energies (few AGeV range), that can even allow a
``direct'' study of the covariant structure of the isovector interaction in the
hadron medium. Rather sensitive observables are proposed from collective flows
and from pion/kaon production. The possibility of the transition to a mixed
hadron-quark phase, at high baryon and isospin density, is finally suggested.
Some signatures could come from an expected ``neutron trapping'' effect. The
importance of studying violent collisions with radioactive beams from low to
relativistic energies is finally stressed.

defect the propagation of linear perturbations is of the standard type, in
spite of the non-standard kinetic term. Consequently, this compacton domain
wall may act like a brane of finite thickness which is embedded in a higher
dimensional space, but to which matter fields are constrained. In addition, we
find strong indications that, when gravity is taken into account, location of
gravity in the sense of Randall--Sundrum works for these compacton domain
walls. When seen from the bulk, these finite thickness branes, in fact, cannot
be distinguished from infinitely thin branes.

show that they can be suitably modified to obtain similar linear lower bounds
for $\delta_c(p)$ (with $p$ near $p_c$) for a much larger class of 2D lattices,
including bond percolation on the square and triangular lattices, and site
percolation on the star lattice (or matching lattice) of the square lattice.

(~12K), shoulder of emission. We use a radiative transfer code to model the
filament's appearance, either in emission or absorption, simultaneously at each
of the different wavelengths. Our best fit model uses a Plummer-like density
profile and a homogeneous interstellar dust grain population. Unlike previous

agents differ in the characteristics describing these components, such as time

the mechanical unit order size that is commonly assumed. In this way the order
flow is better related to the ongoing evolution of the market. For the given

in a closed form which is exact to all orders in epsilon, containing
Gamma-functions and hypergeometric functions of unit argument. In all other
cases we derive multiple Mellin-Barnes representations from which the
coefficients of the Laurent expansion in epsilon are extracted in an analytical
form. To obtain the finite part of the three-loop quark and gluon form factors,
all coefficients through transcendentality six in the Riemann zeta-function
have to be included.

  1574-1585, 2007","10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602308",,"cs.NE cs.CE",,"  This paper proposes a new memetic evolutionary algorithm to achieve explicit
learning in rule-based nurse rostering, which involves applying a set of
heuristic rules for each nurse's assignment. The main framework of the
algorithm is an estimation of distribution algorithm, in which an ant-miner
methodology improves the individual solutions produced in each generation.
Unlike our previous work (where learning is implicit), the learning in the
memetic estimation of distribution algorithm is explicit, i.e. we are able to
identify building blocks directly. The overall approach learns by building a
probabilistic model, i.e. an estimation of the probability distribution of
individual nurse-rule pairs that are used to construct schedules. The local
search processor (i.e. the ant-miner) reinforces nurse-rule pairs that receive
higher rewards. A challenging real world nurse rostering problem is used as the
test problem. Computational results show that the proposed approach outperforms
most existing approaches. It is suggested that the learning methodologies
suggested in this paper may be applied to other scheduling problems where
schedules are built systematically according to specific rules

particle properties and search for new phenomena. In particular, they are
extremely suitable for performing direct searches for dark matter. In this kind
of experiments, the light produced after an interaction within the sensitive
volume is usually read-out by photomultipliers. The need to go to masses in the
tonne scale to explore deeper regions of the parameter space, calls for the use
of large area photomultipliers. In this paper we address the need to perform
laboratory calibration measurements of these large photomultipliers, in
particular to characterize its behaviour at cryogenic temperatures where no
reference from the manufacturer is available. We present comparative tests of
phototubes from two companies. The tests are performed in conditions similar to
those of operation in a real experiment. Measurements of the most relevant
phototube parameters (quantum efficiency, gain, linearity, etc.) both at room
and liquid Argon temperatures are reported. The results show that the studied
phototubes comply with the stringent requirements posed by current dark matter
searches performed with noble-liquid detectors.

$O(n^2)$. We show that with a transitive distance and an observed property,

population. In this model, each infected individual waits an exponentially
distributed time with parameter 1 before becoming healthy. In this paper, we
introduce and study the contact process in a randomly evolving environment.
Here we associate to every individual an independent two-state, $\{0,1\},$
background process. Given $\delta_0<\delta_1,$ if the background process is in
state $0,$ the individual (if infected) becomes healthy at rate $\delta_0,$
while if the background process is in state $1,$ it becomes healthy at rate
$\delta_1.$ By stochastically comparing the contact process in a randomly
evolving environment to the ordinary contact process, we will investigate
matters of extinction and that of weak and strong survival. A key step in our
analysis is to obtain stochastic domination results between certain point
processes. We do this by starting out in a discrete setting and then taking
continuous time limits.

of the black hole brings richer physics. Nonzero angular momentum triggers the
super-radiance which becomes stronger when the angular momentum increases. We
also find that rotations along different angles influence the result in
absorption probability and Hawking radiation. Compared with the black hole
rotating orthogonal to the brane, in the background that black hole spins on
the brane, its angular momentum brings less super-radiance effect and the brane
tension increases the range of frequency to accommodate super-radiance. These

correspondence. In this paper we study the near flat limit reduction of string
theory on the Maldacena-Nunez background, which is dual to $\N=1$ Yang-Mills

a realistic treatment of the energy balance by doing radiation-hydrodynamical
simulations. We look at accretion and migration rates and compare them to
isothermal studies. We used a three-dimensional version of the hydrodynamical
method RODEO, together with radiative transport in the flux-limited diffusion
approach. The accretion rate, as well as the torque on the planet, depend
critically on the ability of the disk to cool efficiently. For densities
appropriate to 5 AU in the solar nebula, the accretion rate drops by more than
an order of magnitude compared to isothermal models, while at the same time the
torque on the planet is positive, indicating outward migration. It is necessary
to lower the density by a factor of 2 to recover inward migration and more than
2 orders of magnitude to recover the usual Type I migration. The torque appears
to be proportional to the radial entropy gradient in the unperturbed disk.
These findings are critical for the survival of protoplanets, and they should
ultimately find their way into population synthesis models.

If the interactions are phenomenologically described by a power law in the

substituted by two non interacting effective fluids, where one of them may
violate the strong energy condition and/or have negative energy density.
Analytical solutions of the Friedmann equations of this general setting are
obtained and studied. One may have, depending on the scale where the
interaction becomes important, non singular universes with early accelerated
phase, or singular models with transition from decelerated to accelerated
expansion at large scales. Among the first, there are bouncing models where
contraction is stopped by the interaction. In the second case, one obtains dark
energy expansion rates without dark energy, like $\Lambda$CDM or phantomic
accelerated expansions without cosmological constant or phantoms, respectively.
