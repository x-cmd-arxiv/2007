spectrum is used in a modern test of the Copernican Principle. The reionized

measurements of the CMB spectrum, a limit is placed on the possibility that we
occupy a privileged location, residing at the center of a large void. The
Hubble diagram inferred from lines-of-sight originating at the center of the

existence of such a void or confirm the validity of the Copernican Principle.

identical, finite dimensional quantum systems. These evolve in discrete time
steps according to a local, shift-invariant unitary evolution. By local we mean
that no instantaneous long-range communication can occur. In order to define
these over a Hilbert space we must restrict to a base of finite, yet unbounded

representation, and hence the inverse QCA is again a QCA. This is a striking
result since the property does not hold for classical one-dimensional cellular
automata as defined over such finite configurations. As an example we discuss a
bijective cellular automata which becomes non-local as a QCA, in a rare case of
reversible computation which does not admit a straightforward quantization. We
argue that a whole class of bijective cellular automata should no longer be
considered to be reversible in a physical sense. Note that the same two-layered
block representation result applies also over infinite configurations, as was
previously shown for one-dimensional systems in the more elaborate formalism of

irreducible modules by reducible ones obtained by requiring that only one of
the two principal singular vectors of each module vanish. The resulting theory
is then constructed systematically by repeatedly fusing these building block
representations. This generates indecomposable representations of the type
which signify the presence of logarithmic partner fields in the theory. The
basic data characterising these indecomposable modules, the logarithmic
couplings, are computed for many special cases and given a new structural
interpretation. Quite remarkably, a number of them are presented in closed
analytic form (for general p). These are the prime examples of
``gauge-invariant'' data - quantities independent of the ambiguities present in
defining the logarithmic partner fields. Finally, mere global conformal
invariance is shown to enforce strong constraints on the allowed spectrum: It
is not possible to include modules other than those generated by the fusion of
the model's building blocks. This generalises the statement that there cannot
exist two effective central charges in a c=0 model. It also suggests the
existence of a second ``dual'' logarithmic theory for each p. Such dual models

with the exact value depending on how the state is prepared. This result can be
qualitatively explained in terms of the motion and pinning of quantized
vortices within the sample. Several aspects of the data are also consistent
with the response of dislocation lines to oscillating stress fields imposed on
the solid.

  Polynomials",,,,,"math.NT",,"  We give a representation of the classical theory of multiplicative arithmetic
functions (MF)in the ring of symmetric polynomials. The basis of the ring of
symmetric polynomials that we use is the isobaric basis, a basis especially
sensitive to the combinatorics of partitions of the integers. The representing
elements are recursive sequences of Schur polynomials evaluated at subrings of
the complex numbers. The multiplicative arithmetic functions are units in the
Dirichlet ring of arithmetic functions, and their properties can be described
locally, that is, at each prime number $p$. Our representation is, hence, a
local representation. One such representing sequence is the sequence of
generalized Fibonacci polynomials. In general the sequences consist of
Schur-hook polynomials. This representation enables us to clarify and
generalize classical results, e.g., the Busche-Ramanujan identity, as well as
to give a richer structural description of the convolution group of
multiplicative functions. It is a consequence of the representation that the
MF's can be defined in a natural way on the negative powers of the prime $p$.

randomly switched nonlinear systems. These systems may be regarded as piecewise
deterministic stochastic systems: the discrete switches are triggered by a
stochastic process which is independent of the state of the system, and between
two consecutive switching instants the dynamics are deterministic. Our results
provide sufficient conditions for almost sure global asymptotic stability using
Lyapunov-based methods when individual subsystems are stable and a certain
``slow switching'' condition holds. This slow switching condition takes the
form of an asymptotic upper bound on the probability mass function of the
number of switches that occur between the initial and current time instants.
This condition is shown to hold for switching signals coming from the states of
finite-dimensional continuous-time Markov chains; our results therefore hold
for Markov jump systems in particular. For systems with control inputs we
provide explicit control schemes for feedback stabilization using the universal
formula for stabilization of nonlinear systems.

signal of baryonic features in the anisotropic correlation function, i.e., a
``baryon ridge'' which corresponds to a baryon acoustic peak in the spherically
averaged correlation function which has already been reported using the same
sample. The baryon ridge has primarily a spherical structure with a known
radius in comoving coordinates. It enables us to divide the redshift distortion
effects into dynamical and geometrical components and provides further
constraints on cosmological parameters, including the dark energy
equation-of-state. With an assumption of a flat $\Lambda$ cosmology, we find
the best-fit values of $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.218^{+0.047}_{-0.037}$ and
$\Omega_{\rm b} = 0.047^{+0.016}_{-0.016}$ (68% C.L.) when we use the overall

algebraic deformation procedure is developed. This procedure is analogous to
the deformation of an algebra of observables like deformation quantization, but
for an imaginary deformation parameter (the Planck constant). This method is
demonstrated on diverse relativistic and nonrelativistic models with finite and
infinite degrees of freedom. It is shown that under stochastic deformation the
model of a nonrelativistic particle interacting with the electromagnetic field
on a curved background passes into the stochastic model described by the
Fokker-Planck equation with the diffusion tensor being the inverse metric
tensor. The first stochastic correction to the Newton equations for this system
is found. The Klein-Kramers equation is also derived as the stochastic
deformation of a certain classical model. Relativistic generalizations of the
Fokker-Planck and Klein-Kramers equations are obtained by applying the
procedure of stochastic deformation to appropriate relativistic classical
models. The analog of the Fokker-Planck equation associated with the stochastic
Lorentz-Dirac equation is derived too. The stochastic deformation of the models
of a free scalar field and an electromagnetic field is investigated. It turns
out that in the latter case the obtained stochastic model describes a
fluctuating electromagnetic field in a transparent medium.

analyticae variae de combinationibus"" (1741).
  This paper introduces the problem of partitions, or partitio numerorum (the
partition of integers). In the first part of the paper Euler looks at infinite
symmetric functions. He defines three types of series: the first denoted with
capital Latin letters are sums of powers, e.g. $A=a+b+c+...$,
$B=a^2+b^2+c^3+...$, etc.; the second denoted with lower case Greek letters are
the elementary symmetric functions; the third denoted with Germanic letters are
sums of all combinations of $n$ symbols, e.g. $\mathfrak{A}=a+b+c+...$ is the
series for $n=1$, $\mathfrak{B}=a^2+ab+b^2+ac+bc+c^2+...$ is the series for
$n=2$, etc.
  Euler proves a lot of relations between these series. He defines some
infinite products and proves some more relations between the products and these
series. Then in \S 17 he looks at the particular case where $a=n,b=n^2,c=n^3$
etc.
  In \S 19 he says the Naud\'e has proposed studying the number of ways to
break an integer into a certain number of parts. Euler proves his recurrence
relations for the number of partitions into a $\mu$ parts with repetition and
without repetition. Finally at the end of the paper Euler states the pentagonal
number theorem, but says he hasn't been able to prove it rigorously.

factor $\Delta$. If we fix the coloring of the leaves, as $\ell$ tends to
$\infty$, for what range of $k$ is the root uniformly distributed over all $k$
colors? This corresponds to the threshold for uniqueness of the infinite-volume
Gibbs measure. It is straightforward to show the existence of colorings of the
leaves which ``freeze'' the entire tree when $k\le\Delta+1$. For
$k\geq\Delta+2$, Jonasson proved the root is ``unbiased'' for any fixed
coloring of the leaves and thus the Gibbs measure is unique. What happens for a
{\em typical} coloring of the leaves? When the leaves have a non-vanishing
influence on the root in expectation, over random colorings of the leaves,
reconstruction is said to hold. Non-reconstruction is equivalent to extremality
of the free-boundary Gibbs measure. When $k<\Delta/\ln{\Delta}$, it is
straightforward to show that reconstruction is possible and hence the measure
is not extremal.
  We prove that for $C>1$ and $k =C\Delta/\ln{\Delta}$, that the Gibbs measure
is extremal in a strong sense: with high probability over the colorings of the
leaves the influence at the root decays exponentially fast with the depth of
the tree. Closely related results were also proven recently by Sly. The above
strong form of extremality implies that a local Markov chain that updates
constant sized blocks has inverse linear entropy constant and hence $O(N\log

is an interesting topic. According to Flory's theory, a power law between
radius of gyration and the length of homopolymer chain is found, with exponent
3/5 for good solvent and 1/3 for poor solvent. For protein in physiological
condition, a solvent condition in between, a power law with exponent ~2/5 is
obtained. In this paper, we present a unified formula to cover all above cases.
It shows that the scaling exponents are generally correlated with fractal
dimension of a chain under certain solvent condition. While applying our
formula to protein, the fractal dimension is found to depend on its
hydrophobicity. By turning a physical process-varying hydrophobicity of a chain
by amino acid mutation, to an equivalent chemical process-varying polarity of
solvent by adding polar or nonpolar molecules, we successfully deprive this
relation, with reasonable agreement to statistical data. And it will be helpful
for protein structure prediction. Our results indicate that the protein may
share the same basic principle with homopolymer, despite its specificity as a
heteropolymer.

star 44 Tau. The star was monitored during several multisite campaigns which
confirmed the presence of radial and nonradial oscillations. Moreover, its
exceptionally low rotational velocity makes 44 Tau particulary interesting for
an asteroseismic study. Due to the measured log g value of 3.6 +/- 0.1, main
sequence and post-main sequence models have to be considered. We perform mode
identification based on photometric and spectroscopic data. A nonadiabatic
pulsation code is used to compute models that fit the identified modes. The
influence of different opacity tables and element mixtures on the results is
tested. The observed frequencies of 44 Tau can be fitted in both the main
sequence and the post-main sequence evolutionary stage. Post-main sequence
models are preferable as they fulfill almost all observational constraints (fit
of observed frequencies, position in the HRD and instability range). These
models can be obtained with normal chemical composition which is in agreement
with recent spectroscopic measurements. The efficiency of envelope convection
(in the framework of the mixing-length theory) is predicted to be very low in
44 Tau. We show that the results are sensitive to the choice between the OPAL
and OP opacities. While the pulsation models of 44 Tau computed with OP
opacities are considerably too cool and too faint, the use of OPAL opacities
results in models within the expected temperature and luminosity range.

meteorological autumn of 2006. Compared to 1961-1990, the 2m temperature was
more than three degrees Celsius above normal from the North side of the Alps to
southern Norway. This made it by far the warmest autumn on record in the United
Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland, with the
records in Central England going back to 1659, in the Netherlands to 1706 and
in Denmark to 1768.
  Assuming that the mean of the temperature distribution changes proportional
to the global mean temperature, but the shape remains the same includes to
first order the effects of global warming. Even under this assumption the
autumn temperatures were very unusual, with estimates of the return time of 200
to 2000 years in this region. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval is
more than 100 to 300 years.
  Climate models that simulate the current atmospheric circulation well
underestimate the observed mean rise in autumn temperatures. They do not
simulate a change in the shape of the distribution that would increase the
probability of warm events under global warming. This implies that the warm
autumn 2006 either was a very rare coincidence, or the local temperature rise
is much stronger than modelled, or non-linear physics that is missing from
these models increases the probability of warm extremes.

eccentricity using the Monte Carlo Glauber (MCG) approach. In particular, we
examine the participant eccentricity, which quantifies the eccentricity of the
initial source shape by the major axes of the ellipse formed by the interaction
points of the participating nucleons. We show that reasonable variation of the
density parameters in the Glauber calculation, as well as variations in how
matter production is modeled, do not significantly modify the already
established behavior of the participant eccentricity as a function of collision
centrality. Focusing on event-by-event fluctuations and correlations of the
distributions of participating nucleons we demonstrate that, depending on the
achieved event-plane resolution, fluctuations in the elliptic flow magnitude
$v_2$ lead to most measurements being sensitive to the root-mean-square, rather
than the mean of the $v_2$ distribution. Neglecting correlations among
participants, we derive analytical expressions for the participant eccentricity
cumulants as a function of the number of participating nucleons,
$\Npart$,keeping non-negligible contributions up to $\ordof{1/\Npart^3}$. We
find that the derived expressions yield the same results as obtained from
mixed-event MCG calculations which remove the correlations stemming from the
nuclear collision process. Most importantly, we conclude from the comparison
with MCG calculations that the fourth order participant eccentricity cumulant
does not approach the spatial anisotropy obtained assuming a smooth nuclear
matter distribution. In particular, for the Cu+Cu system, these quantities
deviate from each other by almost a factor of two over a wide range in
centrality.

statistical model includes various processes contributing to the sample
dynamics at this particular radiation wavelength, and is computationally
efficient also for large samples. Two effects are investigated in detail: the
impact of the electron heating rate and the effect of the plasma environment on
the overall ionization dynamics. Results on the maximal ion charge, the average
ion charge and the average energy absorbed per atom estimated with this model
are compared to the experimental data obtained at the free-electron-laser
facility FLASH at DESY. Our analysis confirms that the dynamics within the
irradiated samples is complex, and the total ionization rate is the resultant
of various processes. In particular, within the theoretical framework defined
in this model the high charge states as observed in experiment cannot be
obtained with the standard heating rates derived with Coulomb atomic
potentials. Such high charge states can be created with the enhanced heating
rates derived with the effective atomic potentials. The modification of
ionization potentials by plasma environment is found to have less effect on the
ionization dynamics than the electron heating rate. We believe that our results

  Aims: We use the relation between mid IR and hard X-ray luminosities to

  Methods: We present new VISIR observations of 17 nearby AGN and combine these
with our earlier VISIR sample of 8 Seyfert galaxies. Combining these
observations with X-ray data from the literature we study the correlation
between their mid IR and hard X-ray luminosities.
  Results: A statistically highly significant correlation between the rest
frame 12.3 mircon (L_MIR) and 2-10 keV (L_X) luminosities is found.
Furthermore, with a probability of 97%, we find that Sy 1 and Sy 2 have the
same distribution of L_MIR over L_X.
  Conclusions: The high resolution of our MIR imaging allows us to exclude any
significant non-torus contribution to the AGN mid IR continuum,thereby implying
that the similarity in the L_MIR / L_X ratio between Sy 1s and Sy 2s is
intrinsic to AGN. We argue that this is best explained by clumpy torus models.
The slope of the correlation is in good agreement with the expectations from
the unified scenario and indicates little to no change of the torus geometry
with luminosity. In addition, we demonstrate that the high angular resolution
is crucial for AGN studies in the IR regime.

localized regime in the one-dimensional Anderson model are calculated
analytically for weak disorder, starting from the recursion relations for the

for the reflection amplitudes is approximated by improved Born approximation
forms which ensure that averaged reflection coefficients tend asymptotically to
unity in the localized regime, for chain lengths $L=Na\to\infty$. In contrast
the familiar Born approximation of perturbation theory would not be adapted for
the localized regime since it constrains the reflection coefficient to be less
than one. The proper behaviour of the reflection coefficient (and of other
related reflection parameters) is responsible for various anomalies in the
cumulants of $\ln g$, in particular for the well-known band center anomaly of
the localization length. While a simple improved Born approximation is
sufficient for studying cumulants at a generic band energy, we find that a
generalized improved Born approximation is necessary to account satisfactorily
for numerical results for the band center anomaly in the mean of $\ln g$. For
the variance of $\ln g$ at the band center, we reveal the existence of a weak
anomalous quadratic term proportional to $L^2$, besides the previously found
anomaly in the linear term. At a generic band energy the variance of $\ln g$ is
found to be linear in $L$ and is given by twice the mean, up to higher order
corrections which are calculated. We also exhibit the $L=$independent offset
terms in the variance, which strongly depend on reflection anomalies.

single power law nor by the Band model. Instead we find that the data present
high energy (> 3 keV, in the observer frame) excesses with respect to these
models. We estimated the joint statistical significance of these excesses at
the level of 4.3 sigma. In all four cases, the deviations can be modeled well
by adding either a second power law or a blackbody component to the usual
synchrotron power law spectrum. The additional power law would be explained by
the emerging of the afterglow, while the blackbody could be interpreted as the
photospheric emission from X-ray flares or as the shock breakout emission. In
one case these models leave a 2.2 sigma excess which can be fit by a Gaussian
line at the energy the highly ionized Nickel recombination. Although the data
do not allow an unequivocal interpretation, the importance of this analysis

the form of a back stress in addition to the external shear and the
self-consistent internal stress. We here present the study of size effects in

relaxation in thin films on substrates subject to thermal loading, and (2)
simple shear in constrained films. In these problems, earlier discrete

such a system leads to the uniqueness of its sequentially estimated solutions
and is required for the convergence of these solutions to the system's true,
chaotic evolution. The key ideas of our approach are illustrated for a
linearized Lorenz system. Stability of two nonlinear prediction-assimilation
systems from dynamic meteorology is studied next via the complete spectrum of
their Lyapunov exponents; these two systems are governed by a large set of
ordinary and of partial differential equations, respectively. The degree of
data-induced stabilization is crucial for the performance of such a system.
This degree, in turn, depends on two key ingredients: (i) the observational
network, either fixed or data-adaptive; and (ii) the assimilation method.

balanced planar four-bar mechanims is presented. Using complex variables to
model the kinematics of the mechanism, the dynamic balancing constraints are
written as algebraic equations over complex variables and joint angular

problem is formulated as a problem of factorization of Laurent polynomials.
Using toric polynomial division, necessary and sufficient conditions for
dynamic balancing of planar four-bar mechanisms are derived.

two-dimensional crystals described by periodized discrete elasticity models is
presented. When the crystal is sheared beyond a critical strain $F=F_{c}$, the
strained dislocation-free state becomes unstable via a subcritical pitchfork
bifurcation. Selecting a fixed final applied strain $F_{f}>F_{c}$, different
simultaneously stable stationary configurations containing two or four edge
dislocations may be reached by setting $F=F_{f}t/t_{r}$ during different time
intervals $t_{r}$. At a characteristic time after $t_{r}$, one or two dipoles
are nucleated, split, and the resulting two edge dislocations move in opposite
directions to the sample boundary. Numerical continuation shows how
configurations with different numbers of edge dislocation pairs emerge as
bifurcations from the dislocation-free state.

graphene is studied. By comparing the self-consistent non-crossing
approximation on the honeycomb lattice with perturbation theory on the Dirac
fermions, we conclude, that the linear density of states of pure graphene
changes to a non-universal power-law, whose exponent depends on the strength of
disorder like 1-4g/sqrt{3}t^2\pi, with g the variance of the Gaussian disorder,
t the hopping integral. This can result in a significant suppression of the
exponent of the density of states in the weak-disorder limit. We argue, that
even a non-linear density of states can result in a conductivity being
proportional to the number of charge carriers, in accordance with experimental
findings.

stability, high efficiency and a spacial resolution of around 70 um or better,

homopolymer adsorption problem. In particular we discuss how the critical
adsorption energy and the fraction of adsorbed monomers depend on the block
length $M$ of sticking monomers $A$, and on the total length $N$ of the polymer
chains. Also the adsorption of the random copolymers is considered and found to
be well described within the framework of the annealed approximation. For a
better test of our theoretical prediction, two different Monte Carlo (MC)
simulation methods were employed: a) off-lattice dynamic bead-spring model,
based on the standard Metropolis algorithm (MA), and b) coarse-grained lattice
model using the Pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) which enables tests
for very long chains. The findings of both methods are fully consistent and in
good agreement with theoretical predictions.
