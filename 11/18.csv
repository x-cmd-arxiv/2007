interested to investigate the effects of those variables which may impact
significantly on pattern formation of granular mixtures in Hele-Shaw cells. The
results indicate that the frictional forces influence remarkably the formation
of pile on the grain level. Furthermore, We see that increasing grain insertion
rate decreases slightly the angle of repose. We also find that in accordance
with experimental results, the cell thickness is another significant factor and
the angle of repose decays exponentially by increasing the cell thickness. It
is shown that this effect can be interpreted as a cross-over from two to three
dimensions. In fact, using grains with different sizes shows that the behaviour
of the angle of repose when both size and cell thickness are varied is
controlled by a scaled function of the ratio of these two variables.

estimates of the acceleration field for an N-body model of a spherical

reduction in the variance in the central acceleration field when compared to a
traditional equal-mass model with the same number of particles. When evolving
both models with a real N-body code, the diffusion coefficients in our model
are reduced by a similar factor. Therefore, for certain types of problems, our
scheme is a practical method for reducing the two-body relaxation effects,
thereby bringing the N-body simulations closer to the collisionless ideal.

test particle approximation, and there are two ways to calculate a power-law
index, Peacock's approximation and Vietri's formulation. In Peacock's
approximation, it is assumed that particles cross a shock front many times and
energy-gains for each step are fully uncorrelated. On the other hand,
correlation of the distribution of an energy-gain factor for a particle is
considered in Vietri's formulation. We examine how Peacock's approximation
differs from Vietri's formulation. It is useful to know when we can use
Peacock's approximation because Peacock's approximation is simple to derive the
power-law index. In addition, we focus on how the variance of the energy-gain
factor has an influence on the difference between Vietri's formulation and
Peacock's approximation. The effect of the variance has not been examined well
until now. For demonstration, we consider two cases for the scattering in the
upstream: the large-angle scattering (model A) and the regular deflection by
large-scale magnetic fields (model B). Especially there is no correlation among
the distribution of an energy-gain factor for every step in model A. In this
model, we see the power-law index derived from Peacock's approximation differs
from the one derived from Vietri's formulation when we consider the
mildly-relativistic shock, and the variance of the energy-gain factor affects
this difference. We can use Peacock's approximation for a non-relativistic
shock and a highly-relativistic shock because the effect of the variance is
hidden. In model B, we see the difference of the power-law converging along the
shock velocity.

Emissions of directionality depending on the macroscopic geometry manifest that
the standing wave is global in the polycrystalline sample. In this work,
further observations of the directional emissions are summarized. By applying
an external magnetic field at room temperature, not only the predicted
macroscopic nuclear polarization but also its strong directionality are
demonstrated. The standing wave lasts for more than hundred hours at room

asymmetry is oriented in the direction of the Earth's motion within an assumed

velocities and polarization properties of these masers it is possible to map
out the structure, kinematics and magnetic fields in the molecular gas that
surrounds newly-formed massive stars. The intrinsic angular resolution of the
observations was 43 mas (~100 AU at the distance of DR21), but structures far
smaller than this were revealed by employing a non-standard mapping technique.
This technique was used in an attempt to identify the physical structure (e.g.
disc, outflow, shock) associated with the methanol masers. Two distinct
star-forming centres were identified. In DR21(OH) the masers had a linear
morphology, and the individual maser spots each displayed an internal velocity
gradient in the same direction as the large-scale structure. They were detected
at the same position as the OH 1.7-GHz ground-state masers, close to the centre
of an outflow traced by CO and class I methanol masers. The shape and velocity
gradients of the masers suggests that they probably delineate a shock. In
DR21(OH)N the methanol masers trace an arc with a double-peaked profile and a
complex velocity gradient. This velocity gradient closely resembles that of a
Keplerian disc. The masers in the arc are 4.5% linearly polarized, with a
polarization angle that indicates that the magnetic field direction is roughly
perpendicular to the large-scale magnetic field in the region (indicated by
lower angular resolution measurements of the CO and dust polarization). The
suitability of channel-by-channel centroid mapping is discussed as an improved
and viable means to maximise the information gained from the data.

non-equilibrium systems described in terms of stochastic non-linear field
theories. In some of those systems like the KPZ and related models, the
interesting behavior is in the strong coupling regime, which is inaccessible by
traditional perturbative treatments such as dynamical renormalization group
(DRG). A useful tool in the study of such system is the Self Consistent
Expansion (SCE), which might be said to generate its own ""small parameter"" .The
self consistent expansion (SCE) has the advantage that its structure is just
that of a regular expansion, the only difference is that the simple system
around which the expansion is performed is adjustable. The purpose of the this
article is to present the method in a simple and understandable way, that
hopefully will make it accessible to a wider public working on non-equilibrium
statistical physics.
