in string theory and certain confining gauge theories. The gauge theories in
question are N=2 supersymmetric theories deformed to N=1 by superpotential
terms. We first geometrically engineer supersymmetry-breaking vacua by wrapping
D5 branes on rigid 2-cycles in noncompact Calabi-Yau geometries, such that the
central charges of the branes are misaligned. In a limit of slightly misaligned
charges, this has a gauge theory description, where supersymmetry is broken by
Fayet-Iliopoulos D-terms. Geometric transitions relate these configurations to
dual Calabi-Yaus with fluxes, where H_RR, H_NS and dJ are all nonvanishing. We
argue that the dual geometry can be effectively used to study the resulting
non-supersymmetric, confining vacua.

the model may be decoupled via the Higgs mechanism and strong dynamics. We

non-standard representation of the spin-raising and lowering angular operators
in terms of non-conformal coordinates on the sphere; we couple this formalism
to a partially first-order reduction (in the angular variables) of the Einstein
equations. The numerical implementation of our approach supplies the basic
building blocks for a highly parallel, easily extensible numerical code. We
demonstrate the adaptability and excellent scaling of our numerical code by
solving, within our numerical framework, for a scalar field minimally coupled
to gravity (the Einstein-Klein-Gordon problem) in 3-dimensions. The nonlinear
code is globally second-order convergent, and has been extensively tested using
as reference a calibrated code with the same boundary-initial data and radial
marching algorithm. In this context, we show how accurately we can follow
quasi-normal mode ringing. In the linear regime, we show energy conservation
for a number of initial data sets with varying angular structure. A striking
result that arises in this context is the saturation of the flow of energy
through the Schwarzschild radius. As a final calibration check we perform a
large simulation with resolution never achieved before.

dimension lower can be described by a tachyon field with a Dirac-Born-Infeld
effective action. In this paper we investigate the fluctuation modes of the
tachyon field around a two-parameter family of static solutions representing an
array of brane-antibrane pairs. Besides a pair of zero modes associated with
the parameters of the solution, and instabilities associated with annihilation
of the brane-antibrane pairs, we find states corresponding to excitations of
the tachyon field around the brane and in the bulk. In the limit that the brane
thickness tends to zero, the support of the eigenmodes is limited to the brane,
consistent with the idea that propagating tachyon modes drop out of the
spectrum as the tachyon field approaches its ground state. Low-lying excited
states, including the zero modes, appear to show a 4-fold degeneracy in this
limit. Finally, we also discuss the slow motion of the solution corresponding
to the decay process in the moduli space, finding a trajectory which oscillates
periodically between the unstable D-brane and the brane-antibrane pairs of one
dimension lower.

model for multicomponent plasmas by accounting for the electromagnetic field
influence. We deal with a possible thermal nonequilibrium of the translational
energy of the particles, neglecting their internal energy and the reactive
collisions. Given the strong disparity of mass between the electrons and heavy
particles, such as molecules, atoms, and ions, we conduct a dimensional
analysis of the Boltzmann equation. We then generalize the Chapman-Enskog
method, emphasizing the role of a multiscale perturbation parameter on the
collisional operator, the streaming operator, and the collisional invariants of
the Boltzmann equation. The system is examined at successive orders of
approximation, each of which corresponding to a physical time scale. The
multicomponent Navier-Stokes regime is reached for the heavy particles, which
follow a hyperbolic scaling, and is coupled to first order drift-diffusion
equations for the electrons, which follow a parabolic scaling. The transport
coefficients exhibit an anisotropic behavior when the magnetic field is strong
enough. We also give a complete description of the Kolesnikov effect, i.e., the
crossed contributions to the mass and energy transport fluxes coupling the
electrons and heavy particles. Finally, the first and second principles of
thermodynamics are proved to be satisfied by deriving a total energy equation
and an entropy equation. Moreover, the system of equations is shown to be
conservative and the purely convective system hyperbolic, thus leading to a
well-defined structure.

quantity, known as a first passage time (FPT), has led to a growing number of
theoretical investigations over the last decade1. The importance of FPTs
originates from the crucial role played by first encounter properties in
various real situations, including transport in disordered media, neuron firing
dynamics, spreading of diseases or target search processes. Most methods to
determine the FPT properties in confining domains have been limited to
effective 1D geometries, or for space dimensions larger than one only to
homogeneous media1. Here we propose a general theory which allows one to
accurately evaluate the mean FPT (MFPT) in complex media. Remarkably, this
analytical approach provides a universal scaling dependence of the MFPT on both
the volume of the confining domain and the source-target distance. This
analysis is applicable to a broad range of stochastic processes characterized
by length scale invariant properties. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed
by numerical simulations for several emblematic models of disordered media,
fractals, anomalous diffusion and scale free networks.

"0711.0700","Peter van der Gulik","Peter van der Gulik","Three phases in the evolution of the standard genetic code: how
  translation could get started",,,,,"q-bio.PE",,"  A primordial genetic code is proposed, having only four codons assigned, GGC
meaning glycine, GAC meaning aspartate/glutamate, GCC meaning alanine-like and
GUC meaning valine-like. Pathways of ambiguity reduction enlarged the codon
repertoire with CUC meaning leucine, AUC meaning isoleucine, ACC meaning
threonine-like and GAG meaning glutamate. Introduction of UNN anticodons, in a
next episode of code evolution in which nonsense elimination was the leading
theme, introduced a family box structure superposed on the original mirror
structure. Finally, growth rate was the leading theme during the remaining
repertoire expansion, explaining the ordered phylogenetic pattern of
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The special role of natural aptamers in the process
is high-lighted, and the error robustness characteristics of the code are shown
to have evolved by way of a stepwise, restricted enlargement of the tRNA
repertoire, instead of by an exhaustive selection process testing myriads of
codes.

the classes in terms of physical parameters is also important to get an
unbiased statistical view on the variability mechanisms and the borders of
instability strips. Our goal is twofold: provide an overview of the stellar
variability classes that are presently known, in terms of some relevant stellar
parameters; use the class descriptions obtained as the basis for an automated
`supervised classification' of large databases. Such automated classification
will compare and assign new objects to a set of pre-defined variability
training classes. For every variability class, a literature search was
performed to find as many well-known member stars as possible, or a
considerable subset if too many were present. Next, we searched on-line and
private databases for their light curves in the visible band and performed
period analysis and harmonic fitting. The derived light curve parameters are
used to describe the classes and define the training classifiers. We compared
the performance of different classifiers in terms of percentage of correct
identification, of confusion among classes and of computation time. We describe
how well the classes can be separated using the proposed set of parameters and
how future improvements can be made, based on new large databases such as the
light curves to be assembled by the CoRoT and Kepler space missions.

employing the notion of electron-positron pair production in which the number

in Maxwell's equations viewed as the wave equation for photons. In a medium
containing ``inverted energy populations'' of excited atoms, e.g. in a LASER
medium, one may again compute possible ``negative probabilities''. The
resolution of the electromagnetic Klein paradox is that when the atoms decay,
the final state may contain more photons then were contained the initial state.
The optical theorem total cross section for scattering photons from excited
state atoms may then be computed as negative within a frequency band with
matter induced amplification.

sigma model on an AdS_5 space. This classical T-duality relation was used in
the recently uncovered connection between light-like Wilson loops and MHV gluon
scattering amplitudes in the strong coupling limit of the AdS/CFT duality. We
show that the explicit coordinate dependence along the T-duality directions of
the associated Lax connection (flat current) can be eliminated by means of a
field dependent gauge transformation. As a result, the gauge equivalent Lax
connection can easily be T-dualized, i.e. written in terms of the dual set of
isometric coordinates. The T-dual Lax connection can be used for the derivation
of infinitely many conserved charges in the T-dual model. Our construction
implies that local (Noether) charges of the original model are mapped to
non-local charges of the T-dual model and vice versa.

from a matrix perspective that is closely related to the subspace perspective
of K\""otter and Kschischang. A large class of constant-dimension subspace codes
is investigated. It is shown that codes in this class can be easily constructed
from rank-metric codes, while preserving their distance properties. Moreover,
it is shown that minimum distance decoding of such subspace codes can be
reformulated as a generalized decoding problem for rank-metric codes where
partial information about the error is available. This partial information may
be in the form of erasures (knowledge of an error location but not its value)
and deviations (knowledge of an error value but not its location). Taking
erasures and deviations into account (when they occur) strictly increases the
error correction capability of a code: if $\mu$ erasures and $\delta$
deviations occur, then errors of rank $t$ can always be corrected provided that
$2t \leq d - 1 + \mu + \delta$, where $d$ is the minimum rank distance of the
code. For Gabidulin codes, an important family of maximum rank distance codes,
an efficient decoding algorithm is proposed that can properly exploit erasures
and deviations. In a network coding application where $n$ packets of length $M$
over $F_q$ are transmitted, the complexity of the decoding algorithm is given
by $O(dM)$ operations in an extension field $F_{q^n}$.

two energy basins corresponding to the ``closed'' apo conformation and ``open''

therefore investigate the three most likely options to explain this object: (a)
a background galaxy, (b) a cluster in the disk of M51 and (c) a cluster in M51,
but in front of the disk. Methods: We use HST/ACS and HST/NICMOS broad-band
photometry to study the properties of this object. Assuming the object is a
star cluster, we fit the metallicity, age, mass and extinction using simple
stellar population models. Assuming the object is a background galaxy, we
estimate the extinction from the colour of the background around the object. We
study the structural parameters of the object by fitting the spatial profile
with analytical models. Results: We find de-reddened colours of the object
which are bluer than expected for a typical elliptical galaxy, and the central
surface brightness is brighter than the typical surface brightness of a disc
galaxy. It is therefore not likely that the object is a background galaxy.
Assuming the object is a star cluster in the disc of M51, we estimate an age
and mass of 0.7 Gyr and 2.2 x 10^5 \msun, respectively (with the extinction
fixed to E(B-V) = 0.2). Considering the large size of the object, we argue that
in this scenario we observe the cluster just prior to final dissolution. If we
fit for the extinction as a free parameter, a younger age is allowed and the
object is not close to final dissolution. Alternatively, the object could be a
star cluster in M51, but in front of the disc, with an age of 1.4 Gyr and mass
M = 1.7 x 10^5 \msun. Its effective radius is between ~12-25 pc. This makes the
object a ""fuzzy star cluster"", raising the issue of how an object of this age
would end up outside the disc.

experimental results, not only in steady-states but also in some unsteady
situations. From this analysis follows that the solutions of the alternative
Vinen's equation tend significantly faster to the corresponding final steady
state values than the solutions of the usual Vinen's equation, and that the
latter seems more suitable for the description of the experimental available
data.

one needs to clarify the role of Fermi surface topology, density of states,

strength of the induced d-wave state. To this end, we study the generalized
phase diagram of the two-dimensional half-filled Hubbard model as a function of
interaction strength $U/t$, frustration induced by second-order hopping
$t^{\prime}/t$, and temperature $T/t$. In experiment, $U/t$ and $t^{\prime}/t$
can be controlled by pressure. We use the two-particle self-consistent approach
(TPSC), valid from weak to intermediate coupling. We first calculate as a
function of $t^{\prime}/t$ and $U/t$ the temperature and wave vector at which
the spin response function begins to grow exponentially.D-wave
superconductivity in a half-filled band can be induced by such magnetic
fluctuations at weak to intermediate coupling, but only if they are near
commensurate wave vectors and not too close to perfect nesting conditions where
the pseudogap becomes detrimental to superconductivity. For given $U/t$ there
is thus an optimal value of frustration $t^{\prime}/t$ where the
superconducting $T_c$ is maximum. The non-interacting density of states plays
little role. The symmetry d$_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ vs d$_{xy}$ of the superconducting
order parameter depends on the wave vector of the underlying magnetic
fluctuations in a way that can be understood qualitatively from simple
arguments.

\rho/d\log r \propto r^{\alpha}$, first used by Einasto to fit star counts in
the Milky Way. The best-fit value of the additional shape parameter, $\alpha$,
increases gradually with mass, from alpha ~ 0.16 for present-day galaxy halos
to alpha~ 0.3 for the rarest and most massive clusters. Halo concentrations
depend only weakly on mass at z=0, and this dependence weakens further at
earlier times. At z ~3 the average concentration of relaxed halos does not vary
appreciably over the mass range accessible to our simulations (M >=3e11Msun).
Furthermore, in our biggest simulation, the average concentration of the most

results have important implications for currently planned surveys of distant

be the final observational key to confirming the inflationary paradigm. The
search for viable models of inflation from particle physics and string theory
has (re)discovered another source for B-modes: cosmic strings. Strings
naturally generate as much vector mode perturbation as they do scalar,
producing B-mode polarization with a spectrum distinct from that expected from
inflation itself. In a large set of models, B-modes arising from cosmic strings
are more prominent than those expected from primordial gravity waves. In light
of this, we study the physical underpinnings of string-sourced B-modes and the
model dependence of the amplitude and shape of the $C_l^{BB}$ power spectrum.
Observational detection of a string-sourced B-mode spectrum would be a direct
probe of post-inflationary physics near the GUT scale. Conversely,
non-detection would put an upper limit on a possible cosmic string tension of
G\mu < 10^{-7} within the next three years.

between photoheating and adiabatic cooling, which are usually assumed to define
a tight equation of state in which the temperature increases monotonically with
density. We use a semi-analytic model, accurate at low to moderate IGM
densities (<5 times the mean), to show that inhomogeneous reionization can
substantially modify these expectations. Because reionization is driven by
biased sources, dense pockets of the IGM are likely to be ionized first. As a
result, voids initially remain cool while dense regions are heated
substantially. However, near the end of reionization, dense regions have
already cooled from their initially large temperature while voids have only
just been heated. Thus, near the end of helium reionization the equation of
state can invert itself, with the hottest gas inside voids. The degree to which
this happens depends on the magnitude of the density bias during reionization:
if rare, bright sources dominate reionization, so that each ionized region
contains a typical volume of the IGM, the equation of state will remain
monotonic. We also show that the distribution of temperatures at a fixed
density has significant scatter and evolves rapidly throughout and even after
reionization. Finally, we show that the observed temperature jump at z ~3.2 is
consistent with the behavior at the end of helium reionization, although it
requires a somewhat larger temperature increase than expected.

models at the Rokhsar-Kivelson point on the bipartite square and cubic lattices

Henley, we simulate a stochastic process of classical dimer configurations in
continuous time and perform a stochastic analytical continuation to obtain the
dynamical correlations in momentum space and the frequency domain. This
approach allows us to observe directly the dispersion relations and the
evolution of the spectral intensity within the Brillouin zone beyond the
single-mode approximation. On the square lattice, we confirm analytical
predictions related to soft modes close to the wavevectors (pi,pi) and (pi,0)
and further reveal the existence of shadow bands close to the wavevector (0,0).
On the cubic lattice the spectrum is also gapless but here only a single soft
mode at (pi,pi,pi) is found, as predicted by the single mode approximation. The
soft mode has a quadratic dispersion at very long wavelength, but crosses over
to a linear behavior very rapidly. We believe this to be the remnant of the
linearly dispersing ""photon"" of the Coulomb phase. Finally the triangular
lattice is in a fully gapped liquid phase where the bottom of the dimer
spectrum exhibits a rich structure. At the M point the gap is minimal and the
spectral response is dominated by a sharp quasiparticle peak. On the other
hand, at the X point the spectral function is much broader. We sketch a
possible explanation based on the crossing of the coherent dimer excitations

coupled fiber lasers. While the dynamics of the two systems are very different,
robust synchronization of end lasers is obtained in both cases over a range of
parameters. Here, we present analysis and numerical simulation to explain some
of the observed synchronization phenomena. First, we introduce the system of
three coupled semiconductor lasers and discuss the onset of oscillations that
occurs via a bifurcation as the coupling strength increases. Next, we analyze
the synchronization of the end lasers by examining the dynamics transverse to
synchronized state. We prove that chaotic synchronization of the outer
semiconductor lasers will occur for sufficiently long delays, and we make a
comparison to generalized synchronization in driven dissipative systems. It is
shown that the stability of synchronous state (as indicated by negative
Lyupunov exponents transverse to the synchronization manifold) depends on the
internal dissipation of the outer lasers. We next present numerical simulations
for three coupled fiber lasers, highlighting some of the differences between
the semiconductor and fiber laser systems. Due to the large number of coupled
modes in fiber lasers, this is a good system for investigating spatio-temporal
chaos. Stochastic noise is included in the fiber laser model, and synchrony of

sets of statistical properties that can be used to study the early evolution of
the IGM. Among all properties of a leak profile, we investigate its equivalent
width in this paper, since it is weakly affected by instrumental resolution and
noise. Using 10 Keck QSO spectra at $z\sim6$, we have measured the number
density distribution function $n(W,z)$, defined to be the number of leaks per
equivalent width $W$ and per redshift $z$, in the redshift range $5.4 - 6.0$.
These new observational statistics, in both the differential and cumulative

in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In this model, Ly $\alpha$ leaks are mainly due
to low density voids. It supports the early studies that the IGM at $z\simeq6$

formation regions, in which photoionisation driven shocks caused by the
expansion of HII regions induce protostellar collapse within the clouds. Aims:
The main purpose of the paper is to establish the level of star formation
occuring within a known set of BRCs. A secondary aim is to determine the
extent, if any, to which this star formation has been promulgated by the
process of photoionisation triggering. Methods:A primary set of observations is
presented obtained with submillimeter SCUBA observations and archival data from
near-IR and mid- to far-IR have been explored for relevant observations and
incorporated where appropriate. Results:SCUBA observations show a total of 47
dense cores within the heads of 44 observed BRCs drawn from a catalogue of IRAS
sources embedded within HII regions, supportive of the scenario proposed by RDI
models. The physical properties of these cores indicate star formation across
the majority of our sample. This star formation appears to be predominately in
the regime of intermediate to high mass and may indicate the formation of
clusters. IR observations indicate the association of early star forming
sources with our sample. A fundamental difference appears to exist between
different morphological types of BRC, which may indicate a different
evolutionary pathway toward star formation in the different types of BRC.
Conclusions:Bright-rimmed clouds are found to harbour star formation in its
early stages. Different evolutionary scenarios are found to exist for different
morphological types of BRC. The morphology of a BRC is described as type `A',
moderately curved rims, type `B', tightly curved rims, and `C', cometary rims.

examine the effects of the assumptions made and numerical techniques employed

serious problems, raised here for the first time, and of their impact on the

to methods used in the numerical study of turbulence are used. Numerical

following problems, arising from the (virtually exclusive) use of the SB

MRI development in disks, are analyzed and discussed: (i) inconsistencies in
the application of the SB approximation itself; (ii) the limited spatial scale

side-effects of the SB symmetry and the non-trivial nature of the linear MRI;

of L dwarfs and the condensate cloud properties. The fits to the two T dwarfs

narrower wavelength ranges (i.e., individual photometric bands) almost always
yields excellent agreement between the data and models. Limitations in our
knowledge of the opacities of key absorbers such as FeH, VO, and CH4 at certain

fitting the narrower wavelength ranges can show a large scatter compared to the

Recent results on the structure of the nucleon and the pion in terms of

parton distribution functions are presented. These observables allow us to
investigate a number of fundamental physics questions related to e.g. the
distribution of charge and momentum in hadrons, the spin structure of the
nucleon and the pion, and correlations between spin, orbital angular momentum
and coordinate degrees of freedom. Chiral extrapolations of selected lattice
results are presented and compared to results from experiment and
phenomenology. We conclude that lattice simulations already today strongly
contribute to our understanding of the structure of hadrons.

an integral over all frequencies of a space-dependent function. The latter can
be expanded in momentum space, and by integrating over all frequencies, we
finally find the expansion of the Green's function up to four derivatives of

the Spitzer Wide-area Infrared Extragalactic (SWIRE) legacy survey. The angular
two-point correlation function is calculated for eleven samples with flux
limits of S_3.6 > 4-400 mujy, over an 8 square degree field. The angular
clustering strength is measured at >5-sigma significance at all flux limits,
with amplitudes of A=(0.49-29)\times10^{-3} at one degree, for a power-law
model, A\theta^{-0.8}. We estimate the redshift distributions of the samples
using phenomological models, simulations and photometric redshifts, and so
derive the spatial correlation lengths. We compare our results with the GalICS
(Galaxies In Cosmological Simulations) models of galaxy evolution and with
parameterized models of clustering evolution. The GalICS simulations are
consistent with our angular correlation functions, but fail to match the
spatial clustering inferred from the phenomological models or the photometric
redshifts. We find that the uncertainties in the redshift distributions of our
samples dominate the statistical errors in our estimates of the spatial
clustering. At low redshifts (median z<0.5) the comoving correlation length is
approximately constant, r_0=6.1\pm0.5h^{-1} Mpc, and then decreases with
increasing redshift to a value of 2.9\pm0.3h^{-1} Mpc for the faintest sample,
for which the median redshift is z=1. We suggest that this trend can be
attributed to a decrease in the average galaxy and halo mass in the fainter
flux-limited samples, corresponding to changes in the relative numbers of
early- and late-type galaxies. However, we cannot rule out strong evolution of
the correlation length over 0.5<z<1.

coil conformation of a protein is discussed through a simple model, that
includes both short and long-range interactions. Besides the bonding parameter
and helical initiation factor in Zimm-Bragg model, three new parameters are
introduced to describe beta structure: the local constraint factor for a single
residue to be contained in a $\beta$-strand, the long-range bonding parameter
that accounts for the interaction between a pair of bonded $\beta$-strands, and
a correction factor for the initiation of a $\beta$-sheet. Either increasing
local constraint factor or long-range bonding parameter can cause a transition
from $\alpha$-helix or random coil conformation to $\beta$-sheet conformation.
The sharpness of transition depends on the competition between short and
long-range interactions. Other effective factors, such as the chain length and
temperature, are also discussed. In this model, the entropy due to different
ways to group $\beta$-strands into different $\beta$-sheets gives rise to
significant contribution to partition function, and makes major differences
between beta structure and helical structure.

Spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry is the necessary and sufficient

thermodynamic limit, are negligible. Their catastrophic behavior can arise only
as a result of incorrect calculations, when a Bose-condensed system is
described without gauge symmetry breaking. It is crucially important to employ

techniques to numerical calculations of asymptotically flat spacetimes. The
conformal compactification technique enables us to calculate spatially
unbounded domains, thereby avoiding the introduction of an artificial timelike
outer boundary. We construct in spherical symmetry an explicit scri-fixing
gauge, i.e. a conformal and a coordinate gauge in which the spatial coordinate
location of null infinity is independent of time so that no resolution loss in
the physical part of the conformal extension appears. Going beyond spherical
symmetry, we develop a method to include null infinity in the computational
domain. With this method, hyperboloidal initial value problems for the Einstein
equations can be solved in a scri-fixing general wave gauge. To study spatial
infinity, we discuss the conformal Gauss gauge and the reduced general
conformal field equations from a numerical point of view. This leads us to the
first numerical calculation of the entire Schwarzschild-Kruskal solution
including spatial, null and timelike infinity and the domain close to the
singularity. After developing a three dimensional, frame based evolution code
with smooth inner and outer boundaries we calculate a radiative axisymmetric
vacuum solution in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity represented as a
cylinder including a piece of null infinity. In this context, a certain
component of the rescaled Weyl tensor representing the radiation field is
calculated unambiguously with respect to an adapted tetrad at null infinity.

surprisingly, for higher dimensional systems, the unbiasedness may not be
mutual but unidirectional in that phase remains unbiased with respect to number

compare with theories of single impurities in correlated hosts, as well as

of impurities in d-wave superconductors including residual quasiparticle

argue that existing data exhibit a remarkable similarity to impurity-induced

lensing and stellar dynamics in ellipticals offers a new way to measure the
cosmological matter and dark-energy density parameters. A gravitational lensing
estimate of the mass enclosed inside the Einstein circle can be obtained by
measuring the Einstein angle, once the critical density of the system is known.
A model-dependent dynamical estimate of this mass can also be obtained by
measuring the central velocity dispersion of the stellar component. By assuming
the well-tested homologous 1/r^{2} profile for the total density distribution
in the lens elliptical galaxies, these two mass measurements can be properly
compared. Thus, a relation between the Einstein angle and the central stellar
velocity dispersion is derived, and the cosmological matter and the dark-energy
density parameters can be estimated from this. We determined the accuracy of
the cosmological parameter estimates by means of simulations that include
realistic measurement uncertainties on the relevant quantities. Interestingly,
the expected constraints on the cosmological parameter plane are complementary
to those coming from other observational techniques. Then, we applied the
method to the data sets of the Sloan Lens ACS and the Lenses Structure and
Dynamics Surveys, and showed that the concordance value between 0.7 and 0.8 for
the dark-energy density parameter is included in our 99% confidence regions.
The small number of lenses available to date prevents us from precisely
determining the cosmological parameters, but it still proves the feasibility of
the method. When applied to samples made of hundreds of lenses that are
expected to become available from forthcoming surveys, this technique will be
an important tool for measuring the geometry of the Universe.

spectroscopy of an additional dozen lens systems. Bayesian modelling of both
the surface brightness distribution of the lensed source and the

us, under the only assumptions of axisymmetry and a two-integral stellar
distribution function (DF) for the lens galaxy, to dissect this galaxy in three
dimensions and break the classical mass--anisotropy, mass-sheet and
inclination--oblateness degeneracies. Our main results are that the galaxy (i)
has a total density profile well described by a single power-law rho propto
r^{-gamma'} with gamma'=2.06^{+0.03}_{-0.06}; (ii) is a very slow rotator
(specific stellar angular momentum parameter lambda_R = 0.075); (iii) shows

the structure of massive early-type galaxies beyond the local Universe can now
be studied in great detail using the combination of stellar kinematics and
gravitational lensing. Extending these studies to look-back times where

Local Group dwarf galaxies we compute the ``BSS frequency'' and compare it with
that found in the Milky Way globular/open clusters and halo. The comparison
shows that the BSS-frequency in dwarf galaxies, at any given Mv, is always
higher than that in globular clusters of similar luminosities. Moreover, the
estimated BSS-frequency for the lowest luminosity dwarf galaxies is in
excellent agreement with that observed in the Milky Way halo and open clusters.
We conclude that the low density, almost collision-less environment, of our

multi-hop wireless networks. We start our work from the observation, known in
the literature, that shortest path routing creates congested areas in multi-hop
wireless networks. These areas are critical--they generate both security and
energy efficiency issues. We attack these problems and set out routing in outer
space, a new routing mechanism that transforms any shortest path routing
protocol (or approximated versions of it) into a new protocol that, in case of
uniform traffic, guarantees that every node of the network is responsible for
relaying the same number of messages, on expectation. We can show that a
network that uses routing in outer space does not have congested areas, does
not have the associated security-related issues, does not encourage selfish
positioning, and, in spite of using more energy globally, lives longer of the
same network using the original routing protocol.

one best supported by the data is the following. Accreting compact objects,
such as black holes, are seen to emit relativistic puffs of plasma:
`cannonballs' (CBs). The inner domain of a rotating star whose core has
collapsed resembles such an accreting system. This suggests that core-collapse
supernovae (SNe) emit CBs, as SN1987A did. The fate of a CB as it exits a SN
and travels in space can be studied as a function of the CB's mass and energy,
and of `ambient' properties: the encountered matter- and light- distributions,
the composition of the former, and the location of intelligent observers. The
latter may conclude that the interactions of CBs with ambient matter and light
generate CRs and GRBs, all of whose properties can be described by this `CB
model' with few parameters and simple physics. GRB data are still being taken
in unscrutinized domains of energy and timing. They agree accurately with the
model's predictions. CR data are centenary. Their precision will improve, but
new striking predictions are unlikely. Yet, a one-free-parameter description of
all CR data works very well. This is a bit as if one discovered QED today and
