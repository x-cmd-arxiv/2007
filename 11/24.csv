Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST) experiment, but which should
have general application to data from other submillimeter arrays. Our method
uses a Maximum Likelihood based approach, with several approximations, which
allows images to be constructed using large amounts of data with fairly modest
computer memory and processing requirements. This new approach, Signal And
Noise Estimation Procedure Including Correlations (SANEPIC), builds upon
several previous methods, but focuses specifically on the regime where there is
a large number of detectors sampling the same map of the sky, and explicitly
allowing for the the possibility of strong correlations between the detector
timestreams. We provide real and simulated examples of how well this method
performs compared with more simplistic map-makers based on filtering. We
discuss two separate implementations of SANEPIC: a brute-force approach, in
which the inverse pixel-pixel covariance matrix is computed; and an iterative
approach, which is much more efficient for large maps. SANEPIC has been
successfully used to produce maps using data from the 2005 BLAST flight.

captured by all the instruments on-board Swift and by Suzaku WAM. The high
energy light curve remained generally flat for several hundred seconds before
going into a steep decline. Spectral evolution from hard to soft is clearly
taking place throughout the prompt emission, beginning at 285 s after the
trigger and extending to 1200 s. We track the movement of the spectral peak
energy, whilst observing a softening of the low energy spectral slope. The
steep decline in flux may be caused by a combination of this strong spectral
evolution and the curvature effect. We investigate origins for the spectral
evolution, ruling out a superposition of two power laws and considering instead
an additional component dominant during the late prompt emission. We also
discuss origins for the early optical emission and the physics of the
afterglow. The case of GRB 070616 clearly demonstrates that both broadband
coverage and good time resolution are crucial to pin down the origins of the

localizes newly detected sources with <10 arcmin accuracy. While individual GRB
photons are available hours later, GRB alerts are transmitted over a VHF
network within seconds to ground, in particular to robotic follow-up
telescopes, which refine GRB localizations to the level needed by large
spectroscopic telescopes. This paper describes the ECLAIRs concept, with

reveals certain similarities, but the following important difference is found:
The model suggests that the entropy $S_-$ under time reversal becomes larger
compared to the entropy $S$ in forward time, thus disagreeing with the
experimental SES results which show that $S$ may be either smaller or larger
than $S_-$. This might be due to the fact that SES activities exhibit {\em
critical} dynamics, while the model cannot capture all the characteristics of
such dynamics.

We show that in the immediate vicinity of half filling the projected 2D BCS

ground state. This result explicitly demonstrates that antiferromagnetism in
this model appears as a natural consequence of the strong Coulomb repulsion in
a low doped regime. At moderate doping the ground state of the
Gutzwiller-projected BCS Hamiltonian becomes qualitatively similar to
Anderson's resonating valence bond state which is known to fit nicely the
properties of the t-J model in this regime. These two properties taken together
indicate that the projected BCS Hamiltonian captures the essential low-energy

the physics of quantum measurement. The first explanation, known as the
many-worlds interpretation, does not require any modification of quantum
mechanics, and asserts that at the time of measurement the Universe splits into
many branches, one branch for every possible alternative. The various branches
do not interfere with each other because of decoherence, thus providing a
picture broadly consistent with the observed Universe. The second explanation,
which requires quantum mechanics to be modified from its presently known form,
is that at the time of measurement the wave-function collapses into one of the
possible alternatives. The two explanations are mutually exclusive, and up
until now, no theoretical reasoning has been put forward to choose one
explanation over the other. In this article, we provide an argument which
implies that the collapse interpretation is favored over the many-worlds
interpretation. Our starting point is the assertion (which we justify) that
there ought to exist a reformulation of quantum mechanics which does not refer
to a classical spacetime manifold. The need for such a reformulation implies
that quantum theory becomes non-linear on the Planck mass/energy scale.
Standard linear quantum mechanics is an approximation to this non-linear
theory, valid at energy scales much smaller than the Planck scale. Using ideas
based on noncommutative differential geometry, we develop such a reformulation
and derive a non-linear Schr\""{o}dinger equation, which can explain collapse of
the wave-function. We also obtain an expression for the lifetime of a quantum
superposition. We suggest ideas for an experimental test of this model.

Anomalous X-ray Pulsar (AXP) 1E 1547.0-5408, we initiated X-ray monitoring with
the Swift X-ray Telescope, and obtained a single target-of-opportunity
observation with the Newton X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM-Newton). In
comparison with its historic minimum flux of 3e-13 ergs cm^-2 s^-1, the source
was found to be in a record high state, f_X(1-8 keV) = 5e-12 ergs cm^-2 s^-1,
or L_X = 1.7e35(d/9 kpc)^2 ergs s^-1, and declining by 25% in 1 month.
Extrapolating the decay, we bound the total energy in this outburst to 1e42 < E
< 1e43 ergs. The spectra (fitted with a Comptonized blackbody) show that an
increase in the temperature and area of a hot region, to 0.5 keV and ~16% of
the surface area of the neutron star, respectively, are primarily responsible
for its increase in luminosity. The energy, spectrum, and timescale of decay
are consistent with a deep crustal heating event, similar to an interpretation
of the X-ray turn-on of the transient AXP XTE J1810-197. Simultaneous with the
4.6 hour XMM-Newton observation, we observed at 6.4 GHz with the Parkes
telescope, measuring the phase relationship of the radio and X-ray pulse. The
X-ray pulsed fraction of 1E 1547.0-5408 is only ~7%, while its radio pulse is
relatively broad for such a slow pulsar, which may indicate a nearly aligned
rotator. As also inferred from the transient behavior of XTE J1810-197, the
only other AXP known to emit in the radio, the magnetic field rearrangement
responsible for this X-ray outburst of 1E 1547.0-5408 is probably the cause of

C II/III/IV model for non-LTE line-formation calculations based on carefully
selected atomic data. The model is calibrated with high-S/N spectra of six
apparently slow-rotating early B-type dwarfs and giants, which cover a wide
parameter range and are randomly distributed in the solar neighbourhood. A
self-consistent quantitative spectrum analysis is performed using an extensive
iteration scheme to determine stellar atmospheric parameters and to select the
appropriate atomic data used for the derivation of chemical abundances. We
establish the carbon ionization balance for all sample stars based on a unique
set of input atomic data, achieving consistency for all modelled lines. Highly
accurate atmospheric parameters and a homogeneous carbon abundance with reduced
systematic errors are derived. This results in a present-day stellar carbon
abundance in the solar neighbourhood, which is in good agreement with recent
determinations of the solar value and with the gas-phase abundance of the Orion
H II region. The homogeneous present-day carbon abundance also conforms with
predictions of chemical-evolution models for the Galaxy. The present approach

velocity anisotropy, beta(r), analytically. Our main result is that for the
NFW-like profile the beta - gamma relation is not a linear one (where gamma is
the logarithmic derivative of the density rho[r]). The shape of beta(r) depends
mostly on the ratio of the gravitational to kinetic energy within the NFW scale
radius R_s. For the Sersic profile a linear beta - gamma relation is recovered,
and in particular for the Sersic index of n = 6.0 case the linear fit of Hansen

law, the Sersic density form and the linear beta - gamma dependence constitute
a consistent set of relations which obey the spherical Jeans equation and as

12 1997 is developed. First, the magnetic field is constructed by superimposing
a large-scale background field and a localized bipolar field to model the
active region (AR) in the current-free approximation. Second, this potential
configuration is quasi-statically sheared by photospheric vortex motions
applied to two flux concentrations of the AR. Third, the resulting force-free
field is then evolved by canceling the photospheric magnetic flux with the help
of an appropriate tangential electric field applied to the central part of the
AR.
  To understand the structure of the modeled configuration, we use the field
line mapping technique by generalizing it to spherical geometry. It is
demonstrated that the initial potential configuration contains a hyperbolic
flux tube (HFT) which is a union of two intersecting quasi-separatrix layers.
This HFT provides a partition of the closed magnetic flux between the AR and
the global solar magnetic field. The vortex motions applied to the AR interlock
the field lines in the coronal volume to form additionally two new HFTs pinched
into thin current layers. Reconnection in these current layers helps to
redistribute the magnetic flux and current within the AR in the
flux-cancellation phase. In this phase, a magnetic flux rope is formed together
with a bald patch separatrix surface wrapping around the rope. Other important
implications of the identified structural features of the modeled configuration
are also discussed.

asymmetric phase on the outside. Our goal is two-fold. First we want to explore
how the tension depends on the magnetic flux discretized by the integer n. The
BPS case is already known, but not much has been explored about the non-BPS
potentials. A generic renormalizable potential has two dimensionless parameters
that can be varied. Variation of only one of them lead to a type I and type II
vortex, very similar to the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) case. Variation of
both the parameters leads to a much richer structure. In particular we have
found a new type of vortex, which is type I-like for small flux and then turns
type II-like for larger flux. We could tentatively denote it a type III vortex.
This results in a stable vortex with number of fluxes which can be greater than
one. Our second objective is to study the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory and and
understand how the large n limit of the CS vortex is smoothly connected with
the large n limit of the ANO vortex.

can be highly stochastic. How protein concentration fluctuations affect the
growth rate of a population of cells, is, however, a wide open question. We
present a mathematical model that makes it possible to quantify the effect of
protein concentration fluctuations on the growth rate of a population of
genetically identical cells. The model predicts that the population's growth
rate depends on how the growth rate of a single cell varies with protein
concentration, the variance of the protein concentration fluctuations, and the
correlation time of these fluctuations. The model also predicts that when the
average concentration of a protein is close to the value that maximizes the
growth rate, fluctuations in its concentration always reduce the growth rate.
However, when the average protein concentration deviates sufficiently from the
optimal level, fluctuations can enhance the growth rate of the population, even
when the growth rate of a cell depends linearly on the protein concentration.
The model also shows that the ensemble or population average of a quantity,
such as the average protein expression level or its variance, is in general not
equal to its time average as obtained from tracing a single cell and its
descendants. We apply our model to perform a cost-benefit analysis of gene
regulatory control. Our analysis predicts that the optimal expression level of
a gene regulatory protein is determined by the trade-off between the cost of
synthesizing the regulatory protein and the benefit of minimizing the
fluctuations in the expression of its target gene. We discuss possible
experiments that could test our predictions.

Should
the sample be as thick as possible? The answer is `no'. Although more thickness
allows T-rays to interact more with bulk material, SNR rolls off with thickness
due to signal attenuation. Then, should the sample be extremely thin? Again,
the answer is `no'. A sample that is too thin renders itself nearly invisible
to T-rays, in such a way that the system can hardly sense the difference
between the sample and a free space path. So, where is the optimal boundary
between `too thick' and `too thin'? The trade-off is analysed and revealed in
this paper, where our approach is to find the optimal thickness that results in
the minimal variance of measured optical constants.

  Detailed abundance analysis and fundamental parameters","13 pages, accepted by A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20078523",,"astro-ph",,"  The gamma Doradus stars are a recent class of variable main sequence F-type
stars located on the red edge of the Cepheid instability strip. They pulsate in
gravity modes, and this makes them particularly interesting for detailed
asteroseismic analysis, which can provide fundamental knowledge of properties
near the convective cores of intermediate-mass main sequence stars. To improve
current understanding of gamma Dor stars through theoretical modelling,
additional constraints are needed. Our aim is to estimate the fundamental
atmospheric parameters and determine the chemical composition of these stars.
Detailed analyses of single stars have previously suggested links to Am and
lambda Bootis stars, so we wish to explore this interesting connection between
chemical peculiarity and pulsation. We have analysed a sample of gamma Dor
stars for the first time, including nine bona fide and three candidate members
of the class. We determined the fundamental atmospheric parameters and compared
the abundance pattern with other A-type stars. We used the semi-automatic
software package VWA for the analysis. This code relies on the calculation of
synthetic spectra and thus takes line-blending into account. This is important
because of the fast rotation in some of the sample stars, and we made a
thorough analysis of how VWA performs when increasing vsini. We obtained good
results in agreement with previously derived fundamental parameters and
abundances in a few selected reference stars with properties similar to the
gamma Dor stars. We find that the abundance pattern in the gamma Dor stars is
not distinct from the constant A- and F-type stars we analysed.

real-valued signal is constructed, resolving the time-dependent effects of
non-negligible amplitude and frequency modulation. The analytic signal is first
locally represented as a modulated oscillation, demodulated by its own
instantaneous frequency, and then Taylor-expanded at each point in time. The
terms in this expansion, called the instantaneous modulation functions, are
time-varying functions which quantify, at increasingly higher orders, the local
departures of the signal from a uniform sinusoidal oscillation. Closed-form
expressions for these functions are found in terms of Bell polynomials and
derivatives of the signal's instantaneous frequency and bandwidth. The analytic
wavelet transform is shown to depend upon the interaction between the signal's
instantaneous modulation functions and frequency-domain derivatives of the
wavelet, inducing a hierarchy of departures of the transform away from a
perfect representation of the signal. The form of these deviation terms
suggests a set of conditions for matching the wavelet properties to suit the
variability of the signal, in which case our expressions simplify considerably.
One may then quantify the time-varying bias associated with signal estimation
via wavelet ridge analysis, and choose wavelets to minimize this bias.
