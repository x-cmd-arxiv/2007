metrics that could represent the exterior field of spinning black holes. For
the standard choice of the background scalar, the modified field equations
decouple into the Einstein equations and additional constraints. These
constraints eliminate essentially all solutions except for Schwarzschild. For
non-canonical choices of the background scalar, we find several exact solutions
of the modified field equations, including mathematical black holes and
pp-waves. We show that the ultrarelativistically boosted Kerr metric can
satisfy the modified field equations, and we argue that physical spinning black
holes may exist in Chern-Simons modified gravity only if the metric breaks
stationarity, axisymmetry or energy-momentum conservation.

terrestrial-mass planets (< 5-10 Earth masses). Many more such discoveries are
anticipated in the coming years with radial velocity and transit searches. Here
we investigate the different mechanisms that could form ""hot Earths"" and their
observable predictions. Models include: 1) in situ accretion; 2) formation at
larger orbital distance followed by inward ""type 1"" migration; 3) formation
from material being ""shepherded"" inward by a migrating gas giant planet; 4)
formation from material being shepherded by moving secular resonances during
dispersal of the protoplanetary disk; 5) tidal circularization of eccentric
terrestrial planets with close-in perihelion distances; and 6)
photo-evaporative mass loss of a close-in giant planet. Models 1-4 have been
validated in previous work. We show that tidal circularization can form hot
Earths, but only for relatively massive planets (> 5 Earth masses) with very
close-in perihelion distances (< 0.025 AU), and even then the net inward
movement in orbital distance is at most only 0.1-0.15 AU. For planets of less
than about 70 Earth masses, photo-evaporation can remove the planet's envelope
and leave behind the solid core on a Gyr timescale, but only for planets inside
0.025-0.05 AU. Using two quantities that are observable by current and upcoming
missions, we show that these models each produce unique signatures, and can be
observationally distinguished. These observables are the planetary system
architecture (detectable with radial velocities, transits and transit-timing)
and the bulk composition of transiting close-in terrestrial planets (measured
by transits via the planet's radius).

the observation of the two patterns of dynamic arrest, one in which both
species become simultaneously arrested, and the other involving the sequential
arrest of the two species. The latter case gives rise to mixed states in which
one species is arrested while the other species remains mobile. We also derive
the (""fixed point"") equations for the non-ergodic parameters of the system,
which takes the surprisingly simple form of a system of coupled equations for
the localization length of the particles of each species. The solution of this
system of equations indicates unambiguously which species is arrested (finite
localization length) and which species remains ergodic (infinite localization
length). As a result, we are able to draw the entire ergodic--non-ergodic phase

results in information retrieval, collaborative filtering, computational

This paper evaluates four algorithms for higher-order tensor decomposition:
Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HO-SVD), Higher-Order Orthogonal

measure the time (elapsed run time), space (RAM and disk space requirements),

associated K-band luminosity function indicate a normal Salpeter initial mass
function (IMF) for NGC 2244. This is inconsistent with the top-heavy IMF
reported from earlier optical studies that lacked a good census of <4Msun
stars. The spatial distribution of X-ray stars is strongly concentrated around
the central O5 star, HD 46150. The other early O star, HD 46223, has few
companions. The cluster's stellar radial density profile shows two distinctive
structures. This double structure, combined with the absence of mass
segregation, indicates that this cluster is not in dynamical equilibrium. The
spatial distribution of X-ray selected K-excess disk stars and embedded stars
is asymmetric with an apparent deficit towards the north. The fraction of
X-ray-selected cluster members with K-band excesses caused by inner
protoplanetary disks is 6%, slightly lower than the 10% disk fraction estimated
from the FLAMINGOS study based on the NIR-selected sample. This is due to the
high efficiency of X-ray surveys in locating disk-free T Tauri stars.[Abridged]

supermassive black holes (BHs) within a semi-analytical framework developed on
the outputs of the Millennium Simulation. This model, described in detail in
Croton et al. (2006) and De Lucia & Blaizot (2007), introduces a `radio mode'
feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at the centre of X-ray emitting
atmospheres in galaxy groups and clusters. Thanks to this mechanism, the model
can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling
flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off in the bright end of the galaxy luminosity
function; and (iii) the bulge-dominated morphologies and old stellar ages of
the most massive galaxies in clusters. This paper is the first of a series in
which we investigate how well this model can also reproduce the physical
properties of BHs and AGN. Here we analyze the scaling relations, the
fundamental plane and the mass function of BHs, and compare them with the most
recent observational data. Moreover, we extend the semi-analytic model to
follow the evolution of the BH mass accretion and its conversion into
radiation, and compare the derived AGN bolometric luminosity function with the
observed one. While we find for the most part a very good agreement between
predicted and observed BH properties, the semi-analytic model underestimates
the number density of luminous AGN at high redshifts, independently of the
adopted Eddington factor and accretion efficiency. However, an agreement with
the observations is possible within the framework of our model, provided it is
assumed that the cold gas fraction accreted by BHs at high redshifts is larger
than at low redshifts.

ground-based observations of the J=1-0 transitions of 12CO and 13CO obtained at
the FCRAO and, for a subset of the outflows, data from ISO. Assuming the SWAS
water line emission originates from the same gas traced by CO emission, we find
that the outflowing gas in most outflows has an o-H2O abundance relative to H2
of between 10(-7) and 10(-6). Analysis of the water abundance as a function of
outflow velocity reveals a strong dependence. The water abundance increases
with velocity, and at the highest outflow velocities some outflows have
relative o-H2O abundances of order 10(-4). However the mass of gas with such
elevated water abundances represents less that 1% of the total outflow gas
mass. The ISO LWS observations of high-J rotational lines of CO and the 179.5
micron transition of o-H2O provide evidence for a warmer outflow component than
required to produce either the SWAS or FCRAO lines. The mass associated with
the ISO emission is similar to that responsible for the highest velocity water
emission detected by SWAS. The bulk of the outflowing gas has an abundance of
o-H2O well below what would be expected if the gas has passed through a C-shock
with shock velocities greater than 10 km/s. Gas-phase water can be depleted in
the post-shock gas due to freeze-out onto grain mantles, however the rate of
freeze-out is too slow to explain our results. Therefore we believe that only a
small fraction of the outflowing molecular gas has passed through shocks strong
enough to fully convert the gas-phase oxygen to water. This result has
implications for the acceleration mechanism of the molecular gas in these
outflows.

volume methods for unstructured grids. A key feature of these schemes is that
they make use of genuinely multidimensional (approximate) Riemann solvers as
opposed to the piecemeal 1D Riemann solvers usually employed by finite volume
methods. In 1D, LeVeque and Pelanti [J. Comp. Phys. 172, 572 (2001)] showed
that many of the standard approximate Riemann solver methods (e.g., the Roe
solver, HLL, Lax-Friedrichs) can be obtained from applying an exact Riemann
solver to relaxation systems of the type introduced by Jin and Xin [Comm. Pure
Appl. Math. 48, 235 (1995)]. In this work we extend LeVeque and Pelanti's
results and obtain a multidimensional relaxation system from which
multidimensional approximate Riemann solvers can be obtained. In particular, we
show that with one choice of parameters the relaxation system yields the
standard N-scheme. With another choice, the relaxation system yields a new
Riemann solver, which can be viewed as a genuinely multidimensional extension
of the local Lax-Friedrichs scheme. This new Riemann solver does not require
the use Roe-Struijs-Deconinck averages, nor does it require the inversion of an
m-by-m matrix in each computational grid cell, where $m$ is the number of
conserved variables. Once this new scheme is established, we apply it on a few
standard cases for the 2D compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics. We show
that through the use of linear-preserving limiters, the new approach produces
numerical solutions that are comparable in accuracy to the N-scheme, despite
being computationally less expensive.

H-band extinction and optical color excess of AH=0.2E(B-V). This variation is
as small as the scatter in distance modulus measurements currently used for
cosmology based on optical light curves after corrections for light-curve
shape. Combining the homogeneous PAIRITEL measurements with 23 SNe Ia from the
literature, these 41 SNe Ia have standard H-band magnitudes with an rms scatter
of 0.16 mag. The good match of our sample with the literature sample suggests
there are few systematic problems with the photometry. We present a nearby NIR
Hubble diagram that shows no correlation of the residuals from the Hubble line
with light-curve properties. Future samples that account for optical and NIR
light-curve shapes, absorption, spectroscopic variation, or host-galaxy
properties may reveal effective ways to improve the use of SNe Ia as distance
indicators. Since systematic errors due to dust absorption in optical bands
remain the leading difficulty in the cosmological use of supernovae, the good
behavior of SN Ia NIR light curves and their relative insensitivity to
reddening make these objects attractive candidates for future cosmological

Upsilon_* V^{-3} and xi = 1.4 V/r_e. Finally, we present and discuss the
distributions of eta and xi for the full range of galaxies. For systems with
internal velocities comparable to that of the Milky Way (149 < V < 163 km/s),
eta = 0.14 +- 0.05, and xi is, on average, ~ 5 times greater for spheroids than

Early-type galaxies in the Virgo cluster (AMUSE-Virgo). This large program
targets 100 early-type galaxies with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer on
board the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Multi-band Imaging Photometer on
board the Spitzer Space Telescope, with the aim of providing an unbiased census
of low-level super-massive black hole (SMBH) activity in the local universe.
Here we report on the Chandra observations of the first 16 targets, and combine
them with results from archival data of another, typically more massive, 16
targets. Point-like X-ray emission from a position coincident with the optical
nucleus is detected in 50% of the galaxies (down to our completeness limit of
~4E+38 erg/sec). Two of the X-ray nuclei are hosted by galaxies (VCC1178=N4464
and VCC1297=N4486B) with absolute B magnitudes fainter than -18, where nuclear
star clusters are known to become increasingly common. After carefully
accounting for possible contamination from low mass X-ray binaries, we argue
that the detected nuclear X-ray sources are most likely powered by low-level
accretion on to a SMBH, with a <11% chance contamination in VCC1178, where a
star cluster is barely resolvable in archival Hubble Space Telescope images.
Based on black hole mass estimates from the global properties of the host
galaxies, all the detected nuclei are highly sub-Eddington, with luminosities
in the range -8.4<log(L_0.3-10keV/L_Edd)<-5.9. The incidence of nuclear X-ray
activity increases with the stellar mass M_star of the host galaxy: only
between 3-44% of the galaxies with M_star<1E+10 M_Sun harbor an X-ray active
SMBH. The fraction rises to between 49-87% in galaxies with stellar mass above
1E+10 M_Sun (at the 95% confidence level).

becomes fully polarized--an event marked by a sudden jump in the magnetic

susceptibility (and several other physical observables) are insensitive to
further increases in field strength. This behavior ends abruptly with the

three general theorems regarding the effects of hadron loops, which show that
given certain constraints on the external ""bare"" quark model states, the
valence-continuum coupling, and the hadrons summed in the loops, the following
results hold: (1) The loop mass shifts are identical for all states within a

numerically for all 1S, 1P and 2S charmonium valence states due to loops of D,
D$^*$, D$_s$ and D$_s^*$ meson pairs. We find that the mass shifts are quite
large, but are numerically similar for all the low-lying charmonium states, as
suggested by the first theorem. Thus, loop mass shifts may have been ""hidden""

components of the physical charmonium states are also found to be large,

features were detected, and thus no redshifts could be measured, lower redshift
limits were assigned to the objects based on the expected equivalent widths of
absorption features in their host galaxies. Redshifts were also estimated for

  488-498 (2007)",,,"q-bio.TO q-bio.BM",,"  Increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is important in
neurological disorders. Neuroinflammation is associated with increased BBB
breakdown and brain injury. Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) is involved in BBB
injury and edema formation through a mechanism involving matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) upregulation. There is emerging evidence indicating
that cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition limits BBB disruption following ischemic
stroke and bacterial meningitis, but the mechanisms involved are not known. We
used intracerebral injection of TNF-a to study the effect of COX inhibition on
TNF-a-induced BBB breakdown, MMP expression/activity and oxidative stress. BBB
disruption was evaluated by the uptake of 14C-sucrose into the brain and by
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) utilizing Gd-DTPA as a paramagnetic contrast
agent. Using selective inhibitors of each COX isoform, we found that COX-1
activity is more important than COX-2 in BBB opening. TNF-a induced a
significant upregulation of gelatinase B (MMP-9), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) and
COX-2. In addition, TNF-a significantly depleted glutathione as compared to
saline. Indomethacin (10 mg/kg; i.p.), an inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2, reduced
BBB damage at 24 h. Indomethacin significantly attenuated MMP-9 and MMP-3
expression and activation, and prevented the loss of endogenous radical
scavenging capacity following intracerebral injection of TNF-a. Our results
show for the first time that BBB disruption during neuroinflammation can be
significantly reduced by administration of COX inhibitors. Modulation of COX in
brain injury by COX inhibitors or agents modulating prostaglandin E2
formation/signaling may be useful in clinical settings associated with BBB
disruption.

stochastic model to study the compression limits of the plenoptic function. In
the proposed framework, we isolate the two fundamental sources of information
in the POF: the one representing the camera motion and the other representing
the information complexity of the ""reality"" being acquired and transmitted. The
sources of information are combined, generating a stochastic process that we
study in detail. We first propose a model for ensembles of realities that do
not change over time. The proposed model is simple in that it enables us to
derive precise coding bounds in the information-theoretic sense that are sharp
in a number of cases of practical interest. For this simple case of static
realities and camera motion, our results indicate that coding practice is in
accordance with optimal coding from an information-theoretic standpoint. The
model is further extended to account for visual realities that change over
time. We derive bounds on the lossless and lossy information rates for this
dynamic reality model, stating conditions under which the bounds are tight.
Examples with synthetic sources suggest that in the presence of scene dynamics,
simple hybrid coding using motion/displacement estimation with DPCM performs
considerably suboptimally relative to the true rate-distortion bound.

well-constrained. Despite the variety of orbital parameters, the atmospheric
dynamics of these eccentric planets display a number of interesting common

intense irradiation at periastron. The resulting expansion of heated air
produces high-velocity turbulent flow, including long-lived circumpolar
vortices. Additionally, a superrotating acoustic front develops on some
planets; the strength of this disturbance depends on both the eccentricity and
the temperature gradient resulting from uneven heating. The specifics of the

of light, rather than on dynamical timescales. This argues that the
energy-generation mechanism is electromagnetic rather that hydrodynamic. Since
the velocities are near the speed of light, there can be significant local
anisotropy in the emission. The large rapid variations of the BBB imply that
the magnetohydrodynamic energy generation is fundamentally unstable. Because of
the inevitable radial temperature gradient in the accreting material, different
spectral regions come predominantly from different radii, and variations in
different spectral regions correspond to variability at different radii. This
explains the frequently observed independence of X-ray and optical variations,
cases of variability at lower energies leading variability at higher energies,
and rapid changes in emission-line reverberation lags. Some observational tests
of the local variability hypothesis are proposed.

measures) in a context of decision making where underlying scales are bipolar.
They are able to capture a wide variety of decision behaviours, encompassing
models such as Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT). The aim of this paper in two
parts is to present the machinery behind bi-capacities, and thus remains on a
rather theoretical level, although some parts are firmly rooted in decision
theory, notably cooperative game theory. The present first part is devoted to
the introduction of bi-capacities and the structure on which they are defined.
We define the M\""obius transform of bi-capacities, by just applying the well
known theory of M\"" obius functions as established by Rota to the particular
case of bi-capacities. Then, we introduce derivatives of bi-capacities, by
analogy with what was done for pseudo-Boolean functions (another view of
capacities and set functions), and this is the key point to introduce the
Shapley value and the interaction index for bi-capacities. This is done in a
cooperative game theoretic perspective. In summary, all familiar notions used
for fuzzy measures are available in this more general framework.

However, we find that most of the trajectories emerging from the standard
big-bang singularity lead to future re-collapse whereas the system beginning
its evolution from the non-standard singularity enters the Kasner regime at

giving rise to a smooth evolution from a standard singularity to the Einstein

produced by random ballistic deposition with porosities between 85% and 93%.
Impact velocities ranged from ~0.1 m/s to ~3 m/s and impact angles were almost
randomly distributed. We also used ""molded"" target aggregates such that the
radii of the local surface curvatures corresponded to the projectile radii. The
experiments showed that impacts into the highest-porosity targets almost always
led to sticking, whereas for the less porous dust aggregates, the collisions
with intermediate velocities and high impact angles resulted in the bouncing of
the projectile with a mass transfer from the target to the projectile
aggregate. Sticking probabilities for the impacts into the ""molded"" target
aggregates were considerably decreased. For the impacts into smooth targets, we
measured the depth of intrusion and the crater volume and could derive some
interesting dynamical properties which can help to derive a collision model for
protoplanetesimal dust aggregates. Future models of the aggregate growth in

compression, the influence of the local radius of curvature on the collisional
outcome and the possible mass transfer between target and projectile

various lattice determinations of low energy constants in $N_f=2$ chiral

other non-lattice estimates. Recently the $P$-wave $\pi\pi$ scattering phase
shift for the I=1 channel has been calculated. A preliminary estimate of the

experimental value. Two approaches to potentials between hadrons are discussed.
One is a method using static quarks to define the distance between two hadrons.
The other is a method to define a potential from a wave function of two
hadrons. An application of the latter to the nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) potential
turns out to reproduce qualitative features of the phenomenological $NN$

challenge to conventional simple stellar population (SSP) models. Conventional
SSP models are based on the evolution theory of single stars. Meanwhile, the
typical locations of BSs in the colour-magnitude diagram of a cluster are
brighter and bluer than the main sequence turn-off point. Such loci cannot be
predicted by single-star evolution theory. However, stars with such properties
contribute significantly to the integrated light of the cluster. In this paper,
we reconstruct the integrated properties of the Large Magellanic Cloud cluster
ESO 121-SC03, based on a detailed exploration of the individual cluster stars,
and with particular emphasis on the cluster's BSs. We find that the integrated
light properties of ESO 121-SC03 are dramatically modified by its BS component.
The integrated spectral energy distribution (ISED) flux level is significantly
enhanced toward shorter wavelengths, and all broad-band colours become bluer.
When fitting the fully integrated ISED of this cluster based on conventional
SSP models, the best-fitting values of age and metallicity are significantly
underestimated compared to the true cluster parameters. The age underestimate
is $\sim40$ per cent if we only include the BSs within the cluster's half-light
radius and $\sim60$ per cent if all BSs are included. The corresponding
underestimates of the cluster's metallicity are $\sim30$ and $\sim60$ per cent,
respectively. The populous star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds are ideal
objects to explore the potential importance of BSs for the integrated light
properties of more distant unresolved star clusters in a statistically robust
manner, since they cover a large range in age and metallicity.

galaxy spectra given broad-band photometry alone. There is a general consent
that colours, and spectral features, most notably the 4000 A break, can predict
many properties of galaxies, including star formation rates and hence they
could infer some of the line properties. We argue that these techniques have
great prospects in helping us understand line emission in extragalactic objects
and might speed up future galaxy redshift surveys if they are to target
emission line objects only. We use two independent methods, Artifical Neural
Neworks (based on the ANNz code) and Locally Weighted Regression (LWR), to
retrieve correlations present in the colour N-dimensional space and to predict
the equivalent widths present in the corresponding spectra. We also investigate
how well it is possible to separate galaxies with and without lines from broad
band photometry only. We find, unsurprisingly, that recombination lines can be
well predicted by galaxy colours. However, among collisional lines some can and
some cannot be predicted well from galaxy colours alone, without any further
redshift information. We also use our techniques to estimate how much
information contained in spectral diagnostic diagrams can be recovered from
broad-band photometry alone. We find that it is possible to classify AGN and
star formation objects relatively well using colours only. We suggest that this
technique could be used to considerably improve redshift surveys such as the
upcoming FMOS survey and the planned WFMOS survey.

to circumvent at least two hurdles, namely the rapid loss of material due to
radial drift and particle fragmentation due to destructive collisions. In this
paper, we present the results of numerical simulations with more and more
realistic physics involved. Step by step, we include various effects, such as
particle growth, radial/vertical particle motion and dust particle
fragmentation in our simulations. We demonstrate that the initial dust-to-gas
ratio is essential for the particles to overcome the radial drift barrier. If
this value is increased by a factor of 2 compared with the canonical value for
the interstellar medium, km-sized bodies can form in the inner disk <2 AU
within 10 thousand years. However, we find that solid particles get destroyed
through collisional fragmentation. Only with the unrealistically high-threshold
velocities needed for fragmentation to occur (>30 m/s), particles are able to
grow to larger sizes in low turbulent disks. We also find that less than 5% of
the small dust grains remain in the disk after 1 Myrs due to radial drift, no
matter whether fragmentation is included in the simulations or not. In this

dust-particle coagulation, which speed up the coagulation scheme by a factor of

in the high energy limit of perturbative QCD. A model of a relativistic
proton-like wave function, dependent on valence quark longitudinal and
transverse momenta and on quark helicities, is proposed, and we derive the
baryon impact factors for two, three and four t-channel gluons. We find that
the baryonic impact factor can be written as a sum of three pieces: in the
first one a subsystem consisting of two of the three quarks behaves very much
like the quark-antiquark pair in gamma* scattering, whereas the third quark
acts as a spectator. The second term belongs to the odderon, whereas in the
third (C-even) piece all three quarks participate in the scattering. This term
is new and has no analogue in gamma* scattering. We also study the small x
evolution of gluon radiation for each of these three terms. The first term
follows the same pattern of gluon radiation as the gamma*-initiated
quark-antiquark dipole, and, in particular, it contains the BFKL evolution
followed by the 2-->4 transition vertex (triple Pomeron vertex). The
odderon-term is described by the standard BKP evolution, and the baryon couples
to both known odderon solutions, the Janik-Wosiek solution and the BLV
solution. Finally, the t-channel evolution of the third term starts with a
three reggeized gluon state which then, via a new 3-->4 transition vertex,
couples to the four gluon (two-Pomeron) state. We briefly discuss a few
consequences of these findings, in particular the pattern of unitarization of
high energy baryon scattering amplitudes.

propositions. Concretely, a mathematical framework of a specific type of modal
approach is extended to the topos theory, and further, structures of the

approach based on a determinate lattice $\Dcal(e,R)$, which is a sublattice of
the lattice $\Lcal$ of all quantum propositions and is determined by a quantum
state $e$ and a preferred determinate observable $R$. Topos-theoretic extension
is made in the functor category $\Sets^{\CcalR}$ of which base category
$\CcalR$ is determined by $R$. Each true atom, which determines truth values,
true or false, of all propositions in $\Dcal(e,R)$, generates also a
multi-valued valuation function of which domain and range are $\Lcal$ and a
Heyting algebra given by the subobject classifier in $\Sets^{\CcalR}$,
respectively. All true propositions in $\Dcal(e,R)$ are assigned the top
element of the Heyting algebra by the valuation function. False propositions
including the null proposition are, however, assigned values larger than the
bottom element. This defect can be removed by use of a subobject
semi-classifier. Furthermore, in order to treat all possible determinate
observables in a unified framework, another valuations are constructed in the
functor category $\Sets^{\Ccal}$. Here, the base category $\Ccal$ includes all
$\CcalR$'s as subcategories. Although $\Sets^{\Ccal}$ has a structure
apparently different from $\Sets^{\CcalR}$, a subobject semi-classifier of
$\Sets^{\Ccal}$ gives valuations completely equivalent to those in
$\Sets^{\CcalR}$'s.

Indeed, it turns out that the result with a smooth switching function and the

persistent current in a one-dimensional ring threaded by a magnetic flux
$\phi$, using an Anderson tight-binding model. In our model, the system of
$N=2M$ atomic sites of the ring is assumed to be partitioned into $M$ pairs of
identical nearest-neighbour sites (dimers). The site energies for different
dimers are taken to be uncorrelated gaussian variables. For this system we
obtain the exact flux-dependent energy levels to second order in the random
site energies, using an earlier exact transfer matrix perturbation theory.
These results are used to study the mean persistent current generated by
$N_e\leq N$ spinless electrons occupying the $N_e$ lowest levels of the
flux-dependent energy band at zero temperature. Detailed analyses are carried
out in the limit $1\ll N_e\ll N$ and for a half-filled band ($N_e=N/2$), for
magnetic fluxes $-1/2 <\phi/\phi_0<1/2$. While the uncorrelated disorder leads
to a reduction of the persistent current, the disorder correlation acts to
enhance it. In particular, in the half-filled band case the correlated disorder
leads to a global flux-dependent enhancement of persistent current which has
the same form for even and odd $N_e$. At low filling of the energy band the
effect of the disorder on the persistent current is found to depend on the
parity of $N_e$: the correlated disorder yields a reduction of the current for
odd $N_e$ and an enhancement of the current for even $N_e$.

properties of high-degree solar oscillations observed at two levels in the
solar atmosphere, in the G-band (formed in the photosphere) and in the Ca II H
line (chromospheric emission).
  Methods. We analyzed the data by calculating the individual power spectra as
well as the cross-spectral properties, i.e., coherence and phase shift. The
observational properties are compared with a simple theoretical model, which
includes the effects of correlated noise.
  Results. The results reveal significant frequency shifts between the Ca II H
and G-band spectra, in particular above the acoustic cut-off frequency for
pseudo-modes. The cross-spectrum phase shows peaks associated with the acoustic
oscillation (p-mode) lines, and begins to increase with frequency around the
acoustic cut-off. However, we find no phase shift for the (surface gravity
wave) f-mode. The observed properties for the p-modes are qualitatively
reproduced in a simple model with a correlated background if the correlated
noise level in the Ca II H data is higher than in the G-band data. These
results suggest that multi-wavelength observations of solar oscillations, in
combination with the traditional intensity-velocity observations, may help to
determine the level of the correlated background noise and to determine the
type of wave excitation sources on the Sun.

modifications of the numerical integration, that the development of these
correlations can be well described by an approximation of the evolution in two
phases: a first perturbative phase in which particles' displacements are small
compared to the lattice spacing, and a subsequent phase in which particles
interact only with their nearest neighbor. For the range of initial amplitudes
considered we show that the first phase can be well approximated as a
transformation of the perturbed lattice configuration into a Poisson
distribution at the relevant scales. This appears to explain the
``universality'' of the spatial dependence of the asymptotic non-linear
clustering observed from both shuffled lattice and Poisson initial conditions.

afterglow light curves cluster in luminosity, even when we consider the l ast
SWIFT data. We observe this clustering only for the afterglow light curves; the
inclusion of prompt-related data broaden the distribution. A similar clu
stering is observed for the optical light curves; GRB sources can be divided in
three classes, namely optical and X-ray bright afterglows, optical and X-ray
dim ones, and optically bright -X-ray dim ones. We argue that this clustering
is related to the fireball total energy, the external medium density, the
fraction of fireball energy going in relativistic electrons and magnetic
fields. These parameters can be either fixed to a standard va lue, or
correlated. We finally propose a method for the estimation of the GRB source

five different dynamic states of motion in regard to the translational and

action of bonds, its translational and angular velocities become synchronized
and the dynamic state changes from slipping to rolling. We also investigate the
effect of non-molecular parameters. In particular, we find that an increase in
viscosity of the medium leads to a characteristic expansion of the region of
stable rolling to the expense of the region of firm adhesion, but not to the
expense of the regions of free or transient motion. Our results can be used in

$1\pi$-exchange with the parity-conserving one. The analytical results
presented in this work can be easily implemented into calculations of
parity-violating nuclear observables.
