emission bands in the spectrum of Akn 120, a low-redshift AGN which is one of
the best candidates for such a study. On time scales of several years the Fe II
line strengths follow the variations in the continuum strength. However, we are
unable to measure a clear reverberation lag time for these Fe II lines on any
time scale. This is due to the very broad and flat-topped nature of the Fe II
cross correlation functions, as compared to the H-beta response which is much
more sharply localized in time. Although there is some suggestion in the light
curve of a 300-day response time, our statistical analysis does not pick up
such a feature. We conclude that the optical Fe II emission does not come from
a photoionization-powered region similar in size to the H-beta emitting region,
but we cannot say for sure where it does come from. Our results are generally
consistent either with emission from a photoionized region several times larger
than the H-beta zone, or with emission from gas heated by some other means,
perhaps responding only indirectly to the continuum variations.

walls of HI SGSs, while three are an ionized portion of a larger and more

show that under the decoupling scheme, the charge-spin separation fermion-spin
representation is a natural representation of the constrained electron defined
in a restricted Hilbert space without double electron occupancy. Based on the
charge-spin separation fermion-spin theory, we have developed the kinetic
energy driven superconducting mechanism, where the superconducting state is
controlled by both superconducting gap parameter and quasiparticle coherence.
Within this kinetic energy driven superconductivity, we have discussed the low
energy electronic structure of the single layer and bilayer cuprate
superconductors in both superconducting and normal states, and qualitatively
reproduced all main features of the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
measurements on the single layer and bilayer cuprate superconductors. We show
that the superconducting state in cuprate superconductors is the conventional
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer like with the d-wave symmetry, so that the basic
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer formalism with the d-wave gap function is still valid
in discussions of the low energy electronic structure of cuprate
superconductors, although the pairing mechanism is driven by the kinetic energy
by exchanging spin excitations. We also show that the well pronounced
peak-dip-hump structure of the bilayer cuprate superconductors in the
superconducting state and double-peak structure in the normal state are mainly

rings. By integrating micron-scale metal rings into sensitive micromechanical
cantilevers and using the cantilevers as torque magnetometers, it should be
possible to measure the rings' persistent currents with greater sensitivity
than the SQUID-based and microwave resonator-based detectors used in the past.
In addition, cantilever-based detectors may allow for measurements in a cleaner
electromagnetic environment. We have fabricated ultra sensitive cantilevers
with integrated rings and measured their mechanical properties. We present an
estimate of the persistent current sensitivity of these cantilever-based
detectors, focusing on the limits set by the cantilever's Brownian motion and
the shot noise in the laser interferometer that monitors the cantilever.

spin distributions in an electric field is qualitatively different from the
steady state for charge distributions. This is primarily because the steady
state established for spin distributions involves spin precession due to
spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate in this work that the spin density matrix
in an external electric field acquires two corrections with different
dependencies on the characteristic momentum scattering time. One part is
associated with conserved spins, diverges in the clean limit and is responsible
for the establishment of a steady-state spin density in electric fields.
Another part is associated with precessing spins, is finite in the clean limit
and is responsible for the establishment of spin currents in electric fields.
Scattering between these distributions has important consequences for spin
dynamics and spin-related effects in general, and explains some recent puzzling
observations, which are captured by our unified theory.

  Encounters in Globular Clusters","Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters",,"10.1086/524943",,"astro-ph",,"  The unveiled main-sequence splitting in omega Centauri as well as NGC 2808
suggests that matter highly-enriched in He (in terms of its mass fraction
Y~0.4) was produced and made the color of some main-sequence stars bluer in
these globular clusters (GCs). The potential production site for the He-rich
matter is generally considered to be massive AGB stars that experience the
second dredge-up. However, it is found that massive AGB stars provide the
matter with Y~0.35 at most, while the observed blue-shift requires the presence
of Y~0.4 matter. Here, we show that extra mixing, which operates in the red
giant phase of stars less massive than ~2Msun, could be a mechanism that
enhances He content in their envelopes up to Y~0.4. The extra mixing is
supposed to be induced by red giant encounters with other stars in a
collisional system like GCs. The Y~0.4 matter released in the AGB phase has
alternative fates to (i) escape from a GC or (ii) be captured by kinematically
cool stars through encounters. The AGB ejecta in omega Cen, which follows the
latter case, can supply sufficient He to cause the observed blue-shift.
Simultaneously, this scheme generates the extreme horizontal branch, as
observed in omega Cen in response to the higher mass loss rates, which is also
caused by stellar encounters.

interferometry. Aims: Our initial goal was to constrain the geometry and flux
contribution of the CSE of Achernar at distances of a few tens of AU from the
star, in the thermal IR domain to complement our near-IR interferometric
observations. Methods: We obtained diffraction-limited images of Achernar in
the thermal infrared using VISIR at the VLT. In order to freeze the turbulence,
we used the BURST mode of this instrument. Results: The images obtained in the
PAH1 band show a point-like source located 0.280"" north-west of Achernar
(projected linear separation of 12.3 AU). Its emission is 1.8 % of the flux of
Achernar in this band, but is not detected in the PAH2, SiC and NeII bands. We
also provide new thermal IR photometry of Achernar in four bands. Conclusions:
Being aligned with the expected azimuth of the equatorial plane of Achernar,
the detected source could be a main sequence stellar companion. In this case,
it apparent brightness would correspond to an A7V spectral type.

general and single molecule spectroscopy in particular such as the generating
function method, the quantum jump approach or time ordering methods. In this
paper starting with the optical Bloch equation, within the paths interpretation
of Zoller, Marte and Walls we obtain the photon statistics from a sequence of
laser pulses expressed by means of quantum trajectories. We find general
expressions for Pn(t) - the probability of emitting n photons up to time t,
discuss several consequences and show that the interpretation of the quantum
trajectories (i) emphasizes contribution to the photon statistics of the
coherence paths accumulated in the delay interval between the pulses and (ii)
allows simple classification of the terms negligible under certain physical
constraints . Applying this method to the concrete example of two square laser
pulses we find the probabilities of emitting 0,1 and 2 photons, examine several
limiting cases and investigate the upper and lower bounds of P0(t), P1(t) and
P2(t) for a sequence of two strong pulses in the limit of long measurement
times. Implication to single molecule non-linear spectroscopy and theory of
pairs of photons on demand are discussed briefly.

habitable distance from M-type stars. Recently, two planets with minimum masses
below 10 Earth masses were reported in a triple system around the M-type star
Gliese 581. Using results from atmospheric models and constraints from the
evolution of Venus and Mars, we assess the habitability of planets Gl 581c and
Gl 581d and we discuss the uncertainties affecting the habitable zone (HZ)
boundaries determination. We provide simplified formulae to estimate the HZ
limits that may be used to evaluate the astrobiological potential of
terrestrial exoplanets that will hopefully be discovered in the near future.
Planets Gl 581c and 'd' are near, but outside, what can be considered as the
conservative HZ. Planet 'c' receives 30% more energy from its star than Venus
from the Sun, with an increased radiative forcing caused by the spectral energy
distribution of Gl 581. Its habitability cannot however be positively ruled out
by theoretical models due to uncertainties affecting cloud properties.
Irradiation conditions of planet 'd' are comparable with those of early Mars.
Thanks to the warming effect of CO2-ice clouds planet 'd' might be a better
candidate for the first exoplanet known to be potentially habitable. A mixture
of various greenhouse gases could also maintain habitable conditions on this
planet.

  localization","17 pages; 5 figures; 2006 International Conference on Toric Topology",,,,"math.SG math.AG",,"  Localization is a topological technique that allows us to make global
equivariant computations in terms of local data at the fixed points. For
example, we may compute a global integral by summing integrals at each of the
fixed points. Or, if we know that the global integral is zero, we conclude that
the sum of the local integrals is zero. This often turns topological questions
into combinatorial ones and vice versa. This expository article features
several instances of localization that occur at the crossroads of symplectic
and algebraic geometry on the one hand, and combinatorics and representation
theory on the other. The examples come largely from the symplectic category,
with particular attention to toric varieties. In the spirit of the 2006
International Conference on Toric Topology at Osaka City University, the main
goal of this exposition is to exhibit toric techniques that arise in symplectic
geometry.

self-consistent thermal model using an isospin and momentum dependent
interaction (MDI) constrained by the isospin diffusion data in heavy-ion
collisions, a momentum-independent interaction (MID), and an isoscalar
momentum-dependent interaction (eMDYI). In particular, we study the temperature
dependence of the isospin-dependent bulk and single-particle properties, the
mechanical and chemical instabilities, and liquid-gas phase transition in hot
asymmetric nuclear matter. Our results indicate that the temperature dependence
of the equation of state and the symmetry energy are not so sensitive to the
momentum dependence of the interaction. The symmetry energy at fixed density is
found to generally decrease with temperature and for the MDI interaction the
decrement is essentially due to the potential part. It is further shown that
only the low momentum part of the single-particle potential and the nucleon
effective mass increases significantly with temperature for the
momentum-dependent interactions. For the MDI interaction, the low momentum part
of the symmetry potential is significantly reduced with increasing temperature.
For the mechanical and chemical instabilities as well as the liquid-gas phase
transition in hot asymmetric nuclear matter, our results indicate that the
boundary of these instabilities and the phase-coexistence region generally
shrink with increasing temperature and is sensitive to the density dependence
of the symmetry energy and the isospin and momentum dependence of the nuclear
interaction, especially at higher temperatures.
