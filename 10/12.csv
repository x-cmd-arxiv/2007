  Curve","88+1 pages",,,,"math.AG hep-th math.CO",,"  A section K on a genus g canonical curve C is identified as the key tool to
prove new results on the geometry of the singular locus Theta_s of the theta
divisor. The K divisor is characterized by the condition of linear dependence
of a set of quadrics containing C and naturally associated to a degree g
effective divisor on C. K counts the number of intersections of special
varieties on the Jacobian torus defined in terms of Theta_s. It also identifies
sections of line bundles on the moduli space of algebraic curves, closely
related to the Mumford isomorphism, whose zero loci characterize special
varieties in the framework of the Andreotti-Mayer approach to the Schottky
problem, a result which also reproduces the only previously known case g=4.
This new approach, based on the combinatorics of determinantal relations for
two-fold products of holomorphic abelian differentials, sheds light on basic
structures, and leads to the explicit expressions, in terms of theta functions,
of the canonical basis of the abelian holomorphic differentials and of the
constant defining the Mumford form. Furthermore, the metric on the moduli space
of canonical curves, induced by the Siegel metric, which is shown to be
equivalent to the Kodaira-Spencer map of the square of the Bergman reproducing
kernel, is explicitly expressed in terms of the Riemann period matrix only, a
result previously known for the trivial cases g=2 and g=3. Finally, the induced
Siegel volume form is expressed in terms of the Mumford form.

$\beta$-expander independently at random with probability $n^{-\alpha}$ for
some constant $\alpha>0$, and study the properties of the resulting graph. Our
main result states that as $n$ tends to infinity, the deletion process
performed on a $\beta$-expander graph of bounded degree will result with high
probability in a graph composed of a giant component containing $n-o(n)$
vertices that is in itself an expander graph, and constant size components. We
proceed by applying the main result to expander graphs with a positive spectral
gap. In the particular case of $(n,d,\lambda)$-graphs, that are such expanders,
we compute the values of $\alpha$, under additional constraints on the graph,
for which with high probability the resulting graph will stay connected, or
will be composed of a giant component and isolated vertices. As a graph sampled
from the uniform probability space of $d$-regular graphs with high probability
is an expander and meets the additional constraints, this result strengthens a
recent result due to Greenhill, Holt and Wormald about vertex percolation on
random $d$-regular graphs. We conclude by showing that performing the above

the fluid rotation rate. Waves incident upon the corotation barrier may be
super-reflected (commonly referred to as corotation amplifier), but the
reflection can be strongly affected by wave absorptions at the corotation
resonance/singularity. The sign of the absorption is related to the Rossby wave
zone very near the corotation radius. We derive the explicit expressions for
the complex reflection and transmission coefficients, taking into account wave
absorption at the corotation resonance. We show that for generic discs, this
absorption plays a much more important role than wave transmission across the
corotation barrier. Depending on the sign of the gradient of the specific
vorticity of the disc the corotation resonance can either enhance or diminish
the super-reflectivity, and this can be understood in terms of the location of
the Rossby wave zone relative to the corotation radius. Our results provide the
explicit conditions (in terms of disc thickness, rotation profile and specific
vorticity gradient) for which super-reflection can be achieved. Global
overstable disc modes may be possible for discs with super-reflection at the

  It was conjectured by H. Bass in the 60's that the projective finitistic
dimension $\pfd (R):=\pfd (\mathrm{mod} R)$ has to be finite. Since then, much
work has been done toward the proof of this conjecture. Recently, K. Igusa and
J. Todorov defined a function $\Psi:\mathrm{mod} R\to \Bbb{N},$ which turned
out to be useful to prove that $\pfd (R)$ is finite for some classes of
algebras. In order to have a different approach to the finitistic dimension
conjecture, we propose to consider a class of full subcategories of
$\mathrm{mod} R$ instead of a class of algebras, namely to take the class of
categories $\F(\theta)$ of $\theta$-filtered $R$-modules for all stratifying
systems $(\theta,\leq)$ in $\mathrm{mod} R.$

lensing (particularly time delay, magnification centroid, and total

similar (though quantitatively different) for the Schwarzschild black holes,
weakly naked, and marginally strongly naked singularities. However, the lensing
characteristics of strongly naked singularities are qualitatively very
different from those due the Schwarzschild black holes. The images produced by
Schwarzschild black hole lenses and weakly naked and marginally strongly naked
singularity lenses always have positive time delays. On the other hand, the
strongly naked singularity lenses can give rise to images with positive, zero,
or negative time delays. In particular, for a large angular source position the
direct image (the outermost image on the same side as the source) due to
strongly naked singularity lensing always has negative time delay. We also
found that the scalar field decreases the time delay and increases the
magnitude of magnifications of images; this result could have important
implications for cosmology. As the Janis-Newman-Winicour metric also describes
the exterior gravitational field of a scalar star, naked singularities as well
as scalar star lenses, if these exist in nature, will serve as more efficient
cosmic telescopes than regular gravitational lenses.

phase of the binary black-hole coalescence problem. This enables us to
\emph{coherently} search for all three stages of the coalescence of
non-spinning binary black holes using a single template bank. Taking our
motivation from these results, we propose a family of template waveforms which
can model the inspiral, merger, and ring-down stages of the coalescence of
non-spinning binary black holes that follow quasi-circular inspiral. This
two-dimensional template family is explicitly parametrized by the physical
parameters of the binary. We show that the template family is not only
\emph{effectual} in detecting the signals from black hole coalescences, but
also \emph{faithful} in estimating the parameters of the binary. We compare the
sensitivity of a search (in the context of different ground-based
interferometers) using all three stages of the black hole coalescence with
other template-based searches which look for individual stages separately. We
find that the proposed search is significantly more sensitive than other
template-based searches for a substantial mass-range, potentially bringing
about remarkable improvement in the event-rate of ground-based interferometers.
As part of this work, we also prescribe a general procedure to construct
interpolated template banks using non-spinning black hole waveforms produced by

have obtained 397 spectra of low-redshift SNe through a multiple-decade effort
at Lick and Keck Observatories, and we have used 45 UV spectra obtained by
HST/IUE. The low-redshift spectra act as a control sample when comparing to the
ESSENCE spectra. In all instances, the ESSENCE and Lick composite spectra
appear very similar. The addition of galaxy light to the Lick composite spectra
allows a nearly perfect match of the overall spectral-energy distribution with
the ESSENCE composite spectra, indicating that the high-redshift SNe are more
contaminated with host-galaxy light than their low-redshift counterparts. This
is caused by observing objects at all redshifts with the same slit width, which
corresponds to different projected distances. After correcting for the
galaxy-light contamination, subtle differences in the spectra remain. We have
estimated the systematic errors when using current spectral templates for
K-corrections to be ~0.02 mag. The variance in the composite spectra give an
estimate of the intrinsic variance in low-redshift maximum-light SN spectra of
~3% in the optical and growing toward the UV. The difference between the
maximum light low and high-redshift spectra constrain SN evolution between our
samples to be < 10% in the rest-frame optical.

radio counterpart at 1.4 GHz, 610 MHz or at both frequencies respectively down
to ~40uJy and ~200uJy. IRAC photometry sets the majority of them in the
redshift interval z [1-3] and allows for a broad distinction between
AGN-dominated galaxies (~47% of the radio-identified sample) and systems
powered by intense star-formation (~13%), the remaining objects being
impossible to classify. The percentage of radio identifications is a strong
function of 24um flux. The radio number counts at both radio frequencies
suggest that the physical process(es) responsible for radio activity in these
objects have a common origin regardless of whether the source shows mid-IR
emission compatible with being an obscured AGN or a star-forming galaxy. We
also find that both candidate AGN and star-forming systems follow (although
with a large scatter) the relationship between 1.4 GHz and 24um fluxes reported
by Appleton et al. (2004) which identifies sources undergoing intense star
formation activity. On the other hand, the inferred radio spectral indices
alpha indicate that a large fraction of objects in our sample (~60% of all
galaxies with estimated alpha) may belong to the population of Ultra Steep
Spectrum (USS) Sources, typically 'frustrated' radio-loud AGN. We interpret our
findings as a strong indication for concurrent AGN and star-forming activity,

this theory into one place, and to present them using a unifying approach which

classical results on the theory of Hilbert functions to the case of filtered

module has one more important motivation. Namely, we have interesting
applications to the study of graded algebras which are not associated to a
filtration, in particular the Fiber cone and the Sally-module. We show here
that each of these algebras fits into certain short exact sequences, together
with algebras associated to filtrations. Hence one can study the Hilbert

We construct red-sequence luminosity functions (RSLFs) for a well-defined,
homogeneously selected, richness limited sample. The RSLF at higher redshifts
shows a deficit of faint red galaxies (to M_V=> -19.7) with their numbers
increasing towards the present epoch. This is consistent with the `down-sizing`
picture in which star-formation ended at earlier times for the most massive
(luminous) galaxies and more recently for less massive (fainter) galaxies. We
observe a richness dependence to the down-sizing effect in the sense that, at a
given redshift, the drop-off of faint red galaxies is greater for poorer (less
massive) clusters, suggesting that star-formation ended earlier for galaxies in
more massive clusters. The decrease in faint red-sequence galaxies is
accompanied by an increase in faint blue galaxies, implying that the process
responsible for this evolution of faint galaxies is the termination of
star-formation, possibly with little or no need for merging. At the bright end,
we also see an increase in the number of blue galaxies with increasing
redshift, suggesting that termination of star-formation in higher mass galaxies
may also be an important formation mechanism for higher mass ellipticals. By
comparing with a low-redshift Abell Cluster sample, we find that the
down-sizing trend seen within RCS-1 has continued to the local universe.

intersects a patch on each sphere, and via a hard sphere potential otherwise.
We analyze the location of the fluid-fluid transition and of the percolation
line as a function of the size of the patch (the fractional coverage of the
sphere's surface) and of the number of patches within a virial expansion up to
third order and within the first two terms (C0 and C1) of a class of closures
Cn hinging on a density expansion of the direct correlation function. We find
that the locations of the two lines depend sensitively on both the total

analytical within the chosen approximate theory. We test our findings by means
of specialized Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and find the main qualitative
features of the critical behaviour to be well captured in spite of the low

attractions into a model suspension of spherical particles is a first step

construction of the corresponding wavefunction of the universe. The basic
method for the full theory is to expand the constraints relative to the
solution for the pure Kodama state and rewrite them in the form of a
generalized nonlinear group transformation of the CDJ matrix, viewed as a
nine-dimensional vector. We then outline a prescription for finding the fixed
point of the flow, and the corresponding generalized Kodama state for the full
theory is constructed. The final solution is expressed in an asymptotic series
in powers of model-specific matter inputs, suppressed by a small dimensionless
constant, relative to the pure Kodama state. We discuss this expansion from
different perspectives. Lastly, we explicitly show how the solution to the
quantized constraints establishes a wavefunction of the universe with a
predetermined semiclassical limit built in as a boundary condition on quantized

  Stellar Systems"", IAUS 246, ed. E. Vesperini",,"10.1017/S1743921308015536",,"astro-ph",,"  The dissolution time (t_dis) of clusters in a tidal field does not scale with
the ``classical'' expression for the relaxation time. First, the scaling with
N, and hence cluster mass, is shallower due to the finite escape time of stars.
Secondly, the cluster half-mass radius is of little importance. This is due to
a balance between the relative tidal field strength and internal relaxation,
which have an opposite effect on t_dis, but of similar magnitude. When external
perturbations, such as encounters with giant molecular clouds (GMC) are
important, t_dis for an individual cluster depends strongly on radius. The mean
dissolution time for a population of clusters, however, scales in the same way
with mass as for the tidal field, due to the weak dependence of radius on mass.
The environmental parameters that determine t_dis are the tidal field strength
and the density of molecular gas. We compare the empirically derived t_dis of
clusters in six galaxies to theoretical predictions and argue that encounters
with GMCs are the dominant destruction mechanism. Finally, we discuss a number
of pitfalls in the derivations of t_dis from observations, such as
incompleteness, with the cluster system of the SMC as particular example.

scalar and tensor perturbations is estimated assuming a slow-roll inflation
model. By defining a more general initial state in inflation particular
properties of the power spectrum such as oscillation can be revealed. The
behavior of the power spectrum is shown to exhibit a step-like variation with
respect to finite inflation length in cases of both radiation- and scalar
matter-dominated pre-inflation. The power spectrum is shown to oscillate in the
radiation-dominated case. The effects of such a power spectrum on the TT and TE
power spectra are examined for three typical slow-roll inflation models; a
small-field model, a large field model, and a hybrid model, considering both
pre-inflation models. It is found that the discrepancies between WMAP3 data and
the Lambda CDM model, such as suppression of the spectrum at l=2, may be
explained to a certain extent by the finite length of inflation for inflation
of close to 60 e-folds. The small-field inflation model with scalar
matter-dominated pre-inflation provides the best fit to the WMAP3 data among
the models considered. Relatively large changes in the angular TT power
spectrum occur in response to small changes in inflation length in the
radiation-dominated pre-inflation models, and half cases do not fit well with
the observed data. This behavior is considered to be attributable to the
oscillatory behavior of the power spectrum. The scalar matter-dominated case is
thus preferred to the radiation-dominated case of pre-inflation, independent of
the length of inflation.

relationship in NGC 2099 (M37) shows a potential evidence of the effect of
metallicity on the IFMR. The IFMR for stars of $Z=0.02$ obtained in the paper
matches well with those inferred observationally in the Galaxy. For $Z\geq
0.02$, helium WDs are obtained from the stars of $M_{\rm i}\leq 1.0 M_{\odot}$
and this result is upheld by the discovery of numerous low-mass WDs in NGC 6791
which is a metal-rich old open cluster. Using the IFMR for stars of $Z=0.02$
obtained in the paper, we have reproduced the mass distribution of DA WDs in
Sloan DR4 except for some ultra-massive white dwarfs. The trend that the mean
mass of WDs decreases with effective temperature may originate from the
increase of the initial metallicities of stars. We predict that metal-rich
low-mass stars may become under-massive white dwarfs.

a function of color, rotation, and activity in a large sample of F-type stars.
Color and rotation exhibit a correlation with differential rotation in the

dynamical and radiative processes. By comparing physical quantities required by
the internal shock model with those obtained through the observed broadband
spectra for Mrk 421, we obtain that the ratio of the Lorentz factors of a pair
of cold shells resides in about $2\sim 20$, which implies that the shocks are
at most mildly relativistic. Using the obtained Lorentz factors, the total mass
density $\rho$ in the shocked shells is investigated. The upper limit of $\rho$
is obtained from the condition that thermal bremsstrahlung emission should not
exceed the observed $\gamma$-ray luminosity, whilst the lower limit is
constrained from the condition that the energy density of non-thermal electrons
is smaller than that of the total plasma. Then we find $\rho$ is $10^2$-$10^3$
times heavier than that of non-thermal electrons for pure $e^{\pm}$ pairs,
while $10^2$-$10^6$ times heavier for pure electron-proton ($e/p$) content,
implying the existence of a large amount of invisible plasma. The origin of the
continuous blazar sequence is shortly discussed and we speculate that the total
mass density and/or the blending ratio of $e^{\pm}$ pairs and $e/p$ plasma
could be new key quantities for the origin of the sequence.

two-body B decays with $\eta$ or $\eta^{\prime}$ in the final state. Starting
from the divergences of the SU(3) octet and singlet axial vector currents, we
show that nonet symmetry for the pseudo-scalar mass term implies nonet symmetry
for the pseudo-scalar density operators. In this nonet symmetry scheme, we find
that the branching ratio $B\to PP,PV$, with $\eta$ in the final state agrees
well with data, while those with $\eta'$ are underestimated, but by increasing
the $B\to \eta'$ form factor by $40-50%$, one could explain the tree-dominated
$B^{-}\to \pi^{-}\eta'$ and $B^{-}\to \rho^{-}\eta'$ measured branching ratios.
With this increased form factor and with only a moderate annihilation
contribution, we are able to obtain $62\times 10^{-6}$ for the
penguin-dominated $B^{-}\to K^{-}\eta'$ branching ratios, quite close to the
measured value. This supports the predicted value for the $B\to \eta'$ form
factor in PQCD and light-cone sum rules approach. A possible increase by 15% of
$<0|\bar{s} i\gamma_5 s|s\bar{s}>$ for $\eta_{0} $ would bring the predicted

It
is generally agreed that this emission comes from the material surrounding the
black hole which is either falling in or flowing out. The activity must be
driven by accretion but the character of accretion flow in this object is an
open question. We suggest that the inflow is dominated by the relatively low
angular momentum material originating in one of the nearby group of stars. Such
material flows in directly towards the black hole up to the distance of order
of ten Schwarzschild radii or less, where it hits the angular momentum barrier
which leads naturally to a flow variability. We study both the analytical and
the numerical solutions for the flow dynamics, and we analyze the radiation
spectra in both cases using the Monte Carlo code to simulate the synchrotron,
bremsstrahlung and the Compton scattering. Our model roughly reproduces the
broad band spectrum of Sgr A* and its variability if we allow for a small
fraction of energy to be converted to non-thermal population of electrons. It
is also consistent (for a range of viewing angles) with the strong constraints
on the amount of circumnuclear material imposed by the measurements of the

(rest frame time) after the trigger, show a surprising clustering, with a
minority of events being at a significant smaller luminosity. If real, this
dichotomy would be a crucial clue to understand the nature of optically dark
afterglows, i.e. bursts that are detected in the X-ray band, but not in the
optical. We investigate this issue by studying bursts of the pre-Swift era,
both detected and undetected in the optical. The limiting magnitudes of the
undetected ones are used to construct the probability that a generic bursts is
observed down to a given magnitude limit. Then, by simulating a large number of
bursts with pre-assigned characteristics, we can compare the properties of the
observed optical luminosity distribution with the simulated one. Our results
suggest that the hints of bimodality present in the observed distribution
reflects a real bimodality: either the optical luminosity distributions of
bursts is intrinsically bimodal, or there exists a population of bursts with a
quite significant grey absorption, i.e. wavelength independent extinction. This
population of intrinsically weak or grey-absorbed events can be associated to
dark bursts.

minimum mass M2sin i between 16 and 20 Jupiter masses is derived when using
model-dependent mass estimates for the primary. The mass ratio M2/M1 might be
as small as 0.2 and, with a probability of 87%, it is less than 0.4. ChaHa8
harbors most certainly the lowest mass companion detected so far in a close (~1
AU) orbit around a brown dwarf or very low-mass star. From the uncertainty in
the orbit solution, it cannot completely be ruled out that the companion has a
mass in the planetary regime. Its discovery is in any case an important step
towards RV planet detections around BDs. Further, ChaHa8 is the fourth known

in-falling matter to a black hole (BH) will be eventually stalled and ""frozen""
just outside the event horizon of the BH, although an in-falling observer will
see the matter falling straight through the event horizon. Thus in this ""frozen
star"" scenario, as distant observers, we could never observe matter falling
into a BH, neither could we see any ""real"" BH other than primordial ones, since
all other BHs are believed to be formed by matter falling towards singularity.
Here we first obtain the exact solution for a pressureless mass shell around a
pre-existing BH. The metrics inside and interior to the shell are all different
from the Schwarzschild metric of the enclosed mass. The metric interior to the
shell can be transformed to the Schwarzschild metric for a slower clock which
is dependent of the location and mass of the shell. Another result is that
there does not exist a singularity nor event horizon in the shell. Therefore
the ""frozen star"" scenario is incorrect. We also show that for all practical
astrophysical settings the in-falling time recorded by an external observer is
sufficiently short that future astrophysical instruments may be able to follow
the whole process of matter falling into BHs. The distant observer could not
distinguish between a ""real"" BH and a ""frozen star"", until two such objects
merge together. It has been proposed that electromagnetic waves will be
produced when two ""frozen stars"" merge together, but not true when two ""real""
bare BHs merge together. However gravitational waves will be produced in both
cases. Thus our solution is testable by future high sensitivity astronomical
observations.

obtain spatially-resolved information on an evolved giant star in order to
understand the mass-loss processes at work in these objects. The system
consists of a low-luminosity white dwarf and a mass-losing, non-dusty M2 giant.
The ultraviolet observations follow the white dwarf continuum through periodic
gradual occultations by the wind and chromosphere of the giant, providing a
unique diagnosis of the circumstellar gas in absorption. Unocculted spectra
display high ionization features, such as the OVI resonance doublet which is
present as a variable (hourly time-scales), broad wind profile, which diagnose
the hot gas close to the dwarf component. Spectra observed at stages of partial
occultation display a host of low-ionization, narrow, absorption lines, with
transitions observed from lower energy levels up to ~5eV above ground. This
absorption is due to chromospheric/wind material, with most lines due to
transitions of SiII, PII, NI, FeII and NiII, as well as heavily damped HI Lyman
series features. No molecular features are observed in the wind acceleration
region despite the sensitivity of FUSE to molecular hydrogen. From analysis of
the ultraviolet dataset, as well as optical data, we find that the dwarf
radiation does not dominate the wind acceleration region of the giant, and that
observed thermal and dynamic wind properties are most likely representative of
isolated red giants.

such as the Chandra Deep Fields, allows us to span the lower Lx range of the
XLF. Our sample is selected from both the hard (z < 3; f(2-8 keV) > 6.3x10^-16

achieve an adequate level of completeness (>50%) regarding X-ray source
identification (i.e., redshift). We find that the luminosity function is
similar to that found in previous X-ray surveys up to z~3 with an evolution
dependent upon both luminosity and redshift. At z > 3, there is a significant
decline in the numbers of AGN with an evolution rate similar to that found by
studies of optically-selected QSOs. Based on our XLF, we assess the resolved
fraction of the Cosmic X-ray Background, the cumulative mass density of
Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs), and the comparison of the mean accretion rate
onto SMBHs and the star formation history of galaxies as a function of
redshift. A coevolution scenario up to z~2 is plausible though at higher
redshifts the accretion rate onto SMBHs drops more rapidly. Finally, we
highlight the need for better statistics of high redshift AGN at z > 3, which

obtained with archival data we built the long-term X-ray light curve, spanning
a time interval of 26 years, and the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of this
source. The light curve shows a large flux increasing, about a factor of six,
in a time interval of a few years. After reaching its maximum in coincidence
with the XMM-Newton pointing in December 2000 the flux decreased in later
years, as revealed by Swift. The very good statistics available in the 0.5-10

single power law. A log-parabolic model with a best fit curvature parameter of
0.25 and a peak energy at ~1 keV describes well the spectral shape of the
synchrotron emission. The simultaneous fit of Swift UVOT and XRT data provides
a milder curvature (b~0.1) and a peak at higher energies (~15 keV), suggesting
a different state of source activity. In both cases UVOT data support the
scenario of a single synchrotron emission component extending from the
optical/UV to the X-ray band. New X-ray observations are important to monitor
the temporal and spectral evolution of the source; new generation gamma-ray

After having assessed the numerical stability of the simulations, we compare
the resulting evolution of the cooled mass with the predictions of the
classical cooling model of White & Frenk and of the cooling model proposed in
the MORGANA code of galaxy formation. We find that the classical model predicts
fractions of cooled mass which, after about two central cooling times, are
about one order of magnitude smaller than those found in simulations. Although
this difference decreases with time, after 8 central cooling times, when
simulations are stopped, the difference still amounts to a factor of 2-3. We
ascribe this difference to the lack of validity of the assumption that a mass
shell takes one cooling time, as computed on the initial conditions, to cool to
very low temperature. [...] The MORGANA model [...] better agrees with the
cooled mass fraction found in the simulations, especially at early times, when
the density profile of the cooling gas is shallow. With the addition of the
simple assumption that the increase of the radius of the cooling region is
counteracted by a shrinking at the sound speed, the MORGANA model is also able
to reproduce for all simulations the evolution of the cooled mass fraction to
within 20-50 per cent, thereby providing a substantial improvement with respect
to the classical model. Finally, we provide a very simple fitting function
which accurately reproduces the cooling flow for the first ~10 central cooling

chains with an energy bias, where the initial excitation is taking place at the
high-energy end of the chain and the energy is harvested (trapped) at the other
end. The efficiency is characterized by means of the average time for the
exciton to be trapped after the initial excitation. The exciton transport is
treated as the intraband energy relaxation over the states obtained by
numerically diagonalizing the Frenkel Hamiltonian that corresponds to the
biased chain. The relevant intraband scattering rates are obtained from a
linear exciton-phonon interaction. Numerical solution of the Pauli master
equation that describes the relaxation and trapping processes, reveals a
complicated interplay of factors that determine the overall harvesting
efficiency. Specifically, if the trapping step is slower than or comparable to
the intraband relaxation, this efficiency shows a nonmonotonic dependence on
the bias: it first increases when introducing a bias, reaches a maximum at an
optimal bias value, and then decreases again because of dynamic (Bloch)
localization of the exciton states. Effects of on-site (diagonal) disorder,
leading to Anderson localization, are addressed as well.

suggest a relatively massive disk (Mdisk~0.1 Msun). Nevertheless, the

reduces the absorptive effects as compared to the predictions in which only the

positive maps between arbitrary C*-algebras are close in cb-norm iff we can
find corresponding dilations that are close in operator norm. The proof
establishes the equivalence of the cb-norm distance and the Bures distance for
completely positive maps. We briefly discuss applications to quantum
information theory.
