Klebanov-Strassler (KS) warped throat, metastable Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations
can be formed due to nearly-conserved angular momenta along isometric
directions in the throat. If sufficiently long-lived, these relics could
conflict with big bang nucleosynthesis or baryogenesis by dominating the energy
density of the universe. We make a detailed estimate of the decay rate of such
relics using the low energy effective action of type IIB string theory
compactified on the throat geometry, with attention to powers of the warp
factor. We find that it is necessary to turn on SUSY-breaking deformations of
the KS background in order to ensure that the most dangerous relics will decay
fast enough. The decay rate is found to be much larger than the naive guess
based on the dimension of the operators which break the angular isometries of
the throat. For an inflationary warp factor of order $w\sim 10^{-4}$, we obtain
the bound $M_{3/2} \gsim 10^9$ GeV on the scale of SUSY breaking to avoid
cosmological problems from the relics, which is satisfied in the KKLT
construction assumed to stabilize the compactification. Given the requirement
that the relics decay before nucleosynthesis or baryogenesis, we place bounds
on the mass of the relic as a function of the warp factor in the throat for
more general warped backgrounds.

model of the dynamic process of learning that explains the experimentally
observed features of the normalized gain. In Hake's study with thousands of
students' pre-post testing results, he observed that on average 48 courses
employing ""interactive engagement"" types of instruction achieved average
normalized gains about two standard deviations greater than did 14 courses
subjected to traditional instruction. For all courses the average normalized
gains had a very low correlation +0.02 with average pretest scores. This
feature of the normalized gain has allowed researchers to investigate the
effectiveness of instruction using data collected from classes with widely
different average pretest scores. However, the question of why the average
normalized gain has this feature and to what extent this feature is generally
present is not well understood. In addition, there have been debates as to what
the normalized gain actually measures, and concerns that it lacks a probability
framework that undergirds psychometric methods such as Item Response Theory
(IRT). The present model leads to an explanation of the observed features of
the normalized gain, connects to other models such as IRT, and shows that the
normalized gain does have a probability framework but one different from that

the competitive multi-armed bandit problem. First, the scenario in which a
single cognitive user wishes to opportunistically exploit the availability of
empty frequency bands in the spectrum with multiple bands is considered. In
this scenario, the availability probability of each channel is unknown to the
cognitive user a priori. Hence efficient medium access strategies must strike a
balance between exploring the availability of other free channels and
exploiting the opportunities identified thus far. By adopting a Bayesian
approach for this classical bandit problem, the optimal medium access strategy
is derived and its underlying recursive structure is illustrated via examples.
To avoid the prohibitive computational complexity of the optimal strategy, a
low complexity asymptotically optimal strategy is developed. The proposed
strategy does not require any prior statistical knowledge about the traffic
pattern on the different channels. Next, the multi-cognitive user scenario is
considered and low complexity medium access protocols, which strike the optimal
balance between exploration and exploitation in such competitive environments,
are developed. Finally, this formalism is extended to the case in which each
cognitive user is capable of sensing and using multiple channels
simultaneously.

denied beam time on the intensive cold neutron beam at ILL (Grenoble, France)
for a number of years, we could only conduct the experiment in 2005 on the
newly opened FRMII reactor of Technical University of Muenchen. The main result
of this experiment was the discovery of radiative neutron decay and the
measurement of its relative intensity B.R.= (3.2+-1.6)10-3 with C.L.=99.7% for
radiative gamma quanta with energy over 35 kev [5,6]. Over a year after our

intervals of processes. Under this set-theoretic approach, the logic that
governs the processes acquires a Boolean structure. However, in a real

repressors, which negatively regulate each other in a cyclic manner. This
circuit was synthetically constructed on plasmids in {\it Escherichia coli} and
was found to exhibit oscillations in the concentrations of the three
repressors. Since the repressors and their binding sites often appear in low
copy numbers, the oscillations are noisy and irregular. Therefore, the
repressilator circuit cannot be fully analyzed using deterministic methods such
as rate-equations. Here we perform stochastic analysis of the repressilator
circuit using the master equation and Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that
fluctuations modify the range of conditions in which oscillations appear as
well as their amplitude and period, compared to the deterministic equations.
The deterministic and stochastic approaches coincide only in the limit in which
all the relevant components, including free proteins, plasmids and bound
proteins, appear in high copy numbers. We also find that subtle features such

formulated in the frame of the Tetrode-Weyl-Fock-Ivanenko tetrad formalism,
allows for a non-relativistic approximation if the metric tensor is of a
special form. The Pauli equation for a vector particle involves the Riemann
curvature tensor explicitly. In analogous way, the procedure of the
non-relativistic approximation in the theory of scalar particle, charged and
neutral, is investigated in the background of Riemannian space-time. A
generalized covariant Schrodinger equation is derived when taking into account
non-minimal interaction term through scalar curvature R(x), it substantially
differs from the conventional generally covariant Schrodinger equation produced
when R(x)=0. It is demonstrated that the the non-relativistic wave function is
always complex-valued irrespective of the type of relativistic scalar particle,
charged or neutral, taken initially. The theory of vector particle proves the
same property: even if the wave function of the relativistic particle of spin 1
is taken real,the corresponding wave function in the non-relativistic
approximation is complex-valued.

lattices up to a size of $32^3 \times 200$. We use the standard Wilson action
at $\beta = 6.0$ and compare our results with previous computations using large
asymmetric and symmetric lattices. In particular, we focus on the impact of the
lattice geometry and momentum cuts to achieve compatibility between data from
symmetric and asymmetric lattices for a large range of momenta.

acting between sections of certain bundles associated to Cartan geometries of
the so called metaplectic contact projective type. These bundles are associated
via representations, which are derived from the so called higher symplectic,
harmonic or generalized Kostant spinor modules. Higher symplectic spinor
modules are arising from the Segal-Shale-Weil representation of the metaplectic
group by tensoring it by finite dimensional modules. We show that for all pairs
of the considered bundles, there is at most one $1^{st}$ order invariant
differential operator up to a complex multiple and give an equivalence
condition for the existence of such an operator. Contact projective analogues
of the well known Dirac, twistor and Rarita-Schwinger operators appearing in
Riemannian geometry are special examples of these operators.

It arises in the accretion of an
\textit{ideal} fluid onto a black hole, where, under suitable boundary
conditions, the flow can violate the generalized second law of thermodynamics.
The paradox indicates that there is in fact a lower bound to the correlation
length of any \textit{real} fluid, the value of which is determined by the
thermodynamic properties of that fluid. We observe that the universal bound on
entropy, itself suggested by the generalized second law, puts a lower bound on
the correlation length of any fluid in terms of its specific entropy. With the
help of a new, efficient estimate for the viscosity of liquids, we argue that
this also means that viscosity is bounded from below in a way reminiscent of
the conjectured Kovtun-Son-Starinets lower bound on the ratio of viscosity to
entropy density. We conclude that much light may be shed on the
Kovtun-Son-Starinets bound by suitable arguments based on the generalized
second law.
