foreground weak lensing (WL) information. We build an estimator of the CMB
lensing potential out of optimally combined projected potential estimators to
different source redshift bins. Our estimator is most sensitive to the redshift
depth of the WL survey, less so to the shape noise level. Estimators built
using galaxy surveys like LSST and SNAP yield a 30-50% reduction in the lensing
B-mode power. We illustrate the potential advantages of a 21-cm survey by
considering a fiducial WL survey for which we take the redshift depth zmax and
the effective angular concentration of sources n as free parameters. For a
noise level of 1 muK arcmin in the polarization map itself, as projected for a
CMBPol experiment, and a beam with FWHM=10 arcmin, we find that going to
zmax=20 at n=100 gal/sqarcmin yields a delensing performance similar to that of
a quadratic lensing potential estimator applied to small-scale CMB maps: the
lensing B-mode contamination is reduced by almost an order of magnitude. In
this case, there is also a reduction by a factor of ~4 in the detectability
threshold of the tensor B-mode power. At this CMB noise level, there is little
gain from sources with zmax>20. The delensing gains are lost if the CMB beam
exceeds ~20 arcmin. The delensing efficiency and useful zmax depend acutely on
the CMB map noise level, but beam sizes below 10 arcmin do not help. Delensing
via foreground sources does not require arcminute-resolution CMB observations,
a substantial practical advantage over the use of CMB observables for
delensing.

use the models of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence that were tested in numerical
simulations, in which the turbulence is injected on large scale and cascades to
small scales. Our attention is focused on the models of the strong turbulence,
but we also briefly discuss the effects that the weak turbulence and the slab
Alfv\'enic perturbations can have. The latter are likely to emerge as a result
of instabilities with in the cosmic ray fluid itself, e.g., beaming and
gyroresonance instabilities of cosmic rays. To describe the interaction of
cosmic rays with magnetic perturbations we develop a non-linear formalism that
extends the ordinary Quasi-Linear Theory (QLT) that is routinely used for the
purpose. This allows us to avoid the usual problem of 90 degree scattering and
enable our computation of the mean free path of cosmic rays. We apply the
formalism to the cosmic ray propagation in the galactic halo and in the Warm
Ionized medium (WIM). In addition, we address the issue of the transport of
cosmic rays perpendicular to the mean magnetic field and show that the issue of
cosmic ray subdiffusion (i.e., propagation with retracing the trajectories
backwards, which slows down the diffusion) is only important for restricted
cases when the ambient turbulence is far from what numerical simulations
suggest to us. As a result, this work provides formalism that can be applied
for calculating cosmic ray propagation in a wide variety of circumstances.

encoded in the time-dependent couplings (gauge and axionic) and their
supersymmetric completion. This form of the SYM allows a detailed perturbative

introduce higher derivative corrections in the effective action which can serve

homeomorphism of the manifold that sends each orbit of one flow onto an orbit
of the other flow while preserving the time orientation. The topological
entropy of a flow is defined as the entropy of its time-1 map. While
topological entropy is an invariant for equivalent homeomorphisms, finite
non-zero topological entropy for a flow cannot be an invariant because its
value is affected by time reparameterization. However, 0 and $\infty$
topological entropy are invariants for equivalent flows without fixed points.
  In equivalent flows with fixed points there exists a counterexample,
constructed by Ohno, showing that neither 0 nor $\infty$ topological entropy is
preserved by equivalence. The two flows constructed by Ohno are suspensions of
a transitive subshift and thus are not differentiable. Note that a
differentiable flow on a compact manifold cannot have $\infty$ entropy. These
facts led Ohno in 1980 to ask the following: ""Is 0 topological entropy an
invariant for equivalent differentiable flows?""
  In this paper, we construct two equivalent $C^\infty$ smooth flows with a
singularity, one of which has positive topological entropy while the other has
zero topological entropy. This gives a negative answer to Ohno's question in
the class $C^\infty$.

a locally free sheaf, or as a union of covering spaces T = T(H). When M is an
open set in a bigger manifold, the local system will generally not extend,
because of local monodromy. This paper proposes an extension of the local
system as an analytic space, in the case when the complement of M has normal
crossing singularities, and the local system is unipotent along the boundary
divisor. The analytic space is obtained by taking the closure of T inside the

nominal and real pricing kernels, in terms of which the price index can be
expressed, are then modelled by introducing a Sidrauski-type utility function

of real liquidity benefit conferred by the money supply. Consumption and money
supply policies are chosen such that the expected joint utility obtained over a
specified time horizon is maximised subject to a budget constraint that takes
into account the ""value"" of the liquidity benefit associated with the money
supply. For any choice of the bivariate utility function, the resulting model
determines a relation between the rate of consumption, the price level, and the
money supply. The model also produces explicit expressions for the real and
nominal pricing kernels, and hence establishes a basis for the valuation of

that were recently studied in connection with cosmological hydrogen
recombination. The impact of these considerations is two-fold: (i) the
associated release of photons during this epoch leads to interesting and unique
deviations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) energy spectrum from a
perfect blackbody, which, in particular at decimeter wavelength, may become
observable in the near future. Observing these distortions, in principle would
provide an additional way to determine some of the key parameters of the
Universe (e.g. the specific entropy, the CMB monopole temperature and the
pre-stellar abundance of helium), not suffering from limitations set by cosmic
variance. Also it permits us to confront our detailed understanding of the
recombination process with direct observational evidence. In this contribution
we illustrate how the theoretical spectral template for the cosmological
recombination spectrum may be utilized for this purpose. (ii) with the advent
of high precision CMB data, e.g. as will be available using the Planck Surveyor
or Cmbpol, a very accurate theoretical understanding of the ionization history
of the Universe becomes necessary for the interpretation of the CMB temperature
and polarization anisotropies. (abridged)

astrophysics: is the IMF universal, or does it vary? Using our very deep, high
angular resolution JHKsL' images obtained with NAOS-CONICA at the VLT at ESO,
we have successfully revealed the stellar population down to the subsolar mass
range in the core of the starburst cluster. The derived IMF of NGC 3603 is
reasonably fitted by a single power law with index Gamma ~ -0.74 within a mass
range of 0.4 - 20 Msun, substantially flatter than the Salpeter-like IMF. A
strong radial steepening of the IMF is observed mainly in the inner r < 30''
field, indicating mass segregation in the cluster center. We estimate the total
mass of NGC 3603 to be about 1.0 - 1.6 x 10^4 Msun. The derived core density is
> 6 x 10^4 Msun pc^-3, an order of magnitude larger than e.g., the Orion Nebula
Cluster. The estimate of the half-mass relaxation time for solar-mass stars is
about 10 - 40 Myr, suggesting that the intermediate- and low-mass stars have
not yet been affected significantly by the dynamical relaxation in the cluster.
The relaxation time for the high-mass stars can be comparable to the age of the
cluster. We estimate that the stars residing outside the observed field cannot
steepen the IMF significantly, indicating our IMF adequately describes the
whole cluster. Analyzing thoroughly the systematic uncertainties in our IMF
determination, we conclude that the power law index of the IMF of NGC 3603 is
Gamma = -0.74^{+0.62}_{-0.47}. Our result thus supports the hypothesis of a
potential top-heavy IMF in massive star-forming clusters and starbursts.

ranking to binary classification. The reduction guarantees an average pairwise
misranking regret of at most that of the binary classifier regret, improving a
recent result of Balcan et al which only guarantees a factor of 2. Moreover,
our reduction applies to a broader class of ranking loss functions, admits a
simpler proof, and the expected running time complexity of our algorithm in
terms of number of calls to a classifier or preference function is improved
from $\Omega(n^2)$ to $O(n \log n)$. In addition, when the top $k$ ranked
elements only are required ($k \ll n$), as in many applications in information
extraction or search engines, the time complexity of our algorithm can be
further reduced to $O(k \log k + n)$. Our reduction and algorithm are thus
practical for realistic applications where the number of points to rank exceeds
several thousands. Much of our results also extend beyond the bipartite case
previously studied.
  Our rediction is a randomized one. To complement our result, we also derive
lower bounds on any deterministic reduction from binary (preference)
classification to ranking, implying that our use of a randomized reduction is
essentially necessary for the guarantees we provide.

formation in a cold dark matter universe. We analyse two model galaxies
generated in the N-body/hydrodynamic simulations of Okamoto et al. Starting
from identical initial conditions, but using different assumptions for the
baryonic physics, one of the simulations produced a bulge-dominated galaxy and
the other one a disc-dominated galaxy. The main difference is the treatment of
star formation and feedback, both of which were designed to be more efficient
in the disc-dominated object. We find that the specific angular momentum of the
disc-dominated galaxy tracks the evolution of the angular momentum of the dark
matter halo very closely: the angular momentum grows as predicted by linear
theory until the epoch of maximum expansion and remains constant thereafter. By
contrast, the evolution of the angular momentum of the bulge-dominated galaxy
resembles that of the central, most bound halo material: it also grows at first
according to linear theory, but 90% of it is rapidly lost as pre-galactic
fragments, into which gas had cooled efficiently, merge, transferring their
orbital angular momentum to the outer halo by tidal effects. The disc-dominated
galaxy avoids this fate because the strong feedback reheats the gas which
accumulates in an extended hot reservoir and only begins to cool once the
merging activity has subsided. Our analysis lends strong support to the
classical theory of disc formation whereby tidally torqued gas is accreted into
the centre of the halo conserving its angular momentum.

nucleation in sub-saturated vapors. Due to radiation losses, the sub-critical
clusters have a smaller temperature compared to their vapor. This alters the
dynamical balance between attachment and detachment of monomers, allowing for
stable nucleation of grains in vapors that are sub-saturated for their
temperature. We find this effect particularly important at low densities and in
the absence of a strong background radiation field. We find new conditions for
stable nucleation in the n-T phase diagram. The nucleation in the non-LTE
regions is likely to be at much slower rate than in the super-saturated vapors.
We evaluate the nucleation rate, warning the reader that it does depend on
poorly substantiated properties of the macro-molecules assumed in the
computation. On the other hand, the conditions for nucleation depend only on
the properties of the large stable grains and are more robust. We finally point
out that this mechanism may be relevant in the early universe as an initial
dust pollution mechanism, since once the interstellar medium is polluted with
dust, mantle growth is likely to be dominant over non-LTE nucleation in the
diffuse medium.

Boltzmann equations are only a classical approximation of the quantum

in this article a detailed comparison of Boltzmann and Kadanoff-Baym equations

significant differences between both types of equations. Apart from
quantitative differences, on a qualitative level the late-time universality
respected by Kadanoff-Baym equations is severely restricted in the case of
Boltzmann equations. Furthermore, Kadanoff-Baym equations strongly separate the
time scales between kinetic and chemical equilibration. In contrast to this
standard Boltzmann equations cannot describe the process of quantum-chemical
equilibration, and consequently also cannot feature the above separation of

reduces to a boundary value problem involving a single Maxwell first-order
differential equation, explicit formulae for the relative
permittivity-permeability dyadic and fields of spherical and circular
cylindrical annular cloaks are derived in terms of general compressed radial
coordinate functions. The general formulation is based on the requirements that
the cloaking occurs for all possible incident fields and that the cloaks with
frequency w > 0 have continuous tangential E and H fields across their outer
surfaces, and zero normal D and B fields at their inner material surfaces. The
tangential-field boundary conditions at the outer surface of the cloak ensure
zero scattered fields, and the normal-field boundary conditions at the inner
surface of the cloak are compatible with zero total fields inside the interior
cavity of the cloak. For spherical cloaks, unlike cylindrical cloaks, these
boundary conditions lead to all the tangential components of the E and H fields
being continuously zero across their inner surfaces -- cylindrical cloaks
having delta functions in polarization densities at their inner surfaces. For
bodies with no interior free-space cavities, the formulation is used to derive
nonscattering spherical and cylindrical concentrators that magnify the incident
fields near their centers. For static fields (w = 0), the boundary value
formulation is appropriately modified to obtain a permeability dyadic that will
cloak magnetostatic fields. Causality conditions imply that, unlike
magnetostatic cloaking, electrostatic cloaking as well as low-frequency
cloaking for w > 0 is not realizable.

shock waves that form when global oscillations and convective flows leak into

very thin (<200km wide), have lifetimes of 10-150s (at any one height) and seem
to be rapidly heated to (at least) transition region temperatures, sending
material through the chromosphere at speeds of order 50-150 km/s. The
properties of Type II spicules suggest a formation process that is a
consequence of magnetic reconnection, typically in the vicinity of magnetic
flux concentrations in plage and network. Both types of spicules are observed

hole has been speculated about since the 1970s, it has not been accurately
verified so far. For the first time, we previously demonstrated it through
two-dimensional, long-term radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. To clarify why
this accretion is possible, we quantitatively investigate the dynamics of a
simulated supercritical accretion flow with a mass accretion rate of ~10^2
L_E/c^2 (with L_E and c being, respectively, the Eddington luminosity and the
speed of light). We confirm two important mechanisms underlying supercritical
disk accretion flow, as previously claimed, one of which is the radiation
anisotropy arising from the anisotropic density distribution of very optically
thick material. We qualitatively show that despite a very large radiation
energy density, E_0>10^2L_E/(4 pi r^2 c) (with r being the distance from the
black hole), the radiative flux F_0 cE_0/tau could be small due to a large
optical depth, typically tau 10^3, in the disk. Another mechanism is photon
trapping, quantified by vE_0, where v is the flow velocity. With a large |v|
and E_0, this term significantly reduces the radiative flux and even makes it
negative (inward) at r<70r_S, where r_S is the Schwarzschild radius. Due to the
combination of these effects, the radiative force in the direction along the
disk plane is largely attenuated so that the gravitational force barely exceeds
the sum of the radiative force and the centrifugal force. As a result, matter
can slowly fall onto the central black hole mainly along the disk plane with
velocity much less than the free-fall velocity, even though the disk luminosity
exceeds the Eddington luminosity. Along the disk rotation axis, in contrast,
the strong radiative force drives strong gas outflows.

develop a longitudinal fluid shear because of unequal local number densities of
participant target and projectile nucleons. Under such fluid shear, local
parton pairs with non-vanishing impact parameter have finite local relative
orbital angular momentum along the direction opposite to the reaction plane.
Such finite relative orbital angular momentum among locally interacting quark
pairs can lead to global quark polarization along the same direction due to
spin-orbital coupling. Local longitudinal fluid shear is estimated within both
Landau fireball and Bjorken scaling model of initial parton production. Quark
polarization through quark-quark scatterings with the exchange of a thermal
gluon is calculated beyond small-angle scattering approximation in a
quark-gluon plasma. The polarization is shown to have a non-monotonic
dependence on the local relative orbital angular momentum dictated by the
interplay between electric and magnetic interaction. It peaks at a value of
relative orbital angular momentum which scales with the magnetic mass of the
exchanged gluons. With the estimated small longitudinal fluid shear in
semi-peripheral $Au+Au$ collisions at the RHIC energy, the final quark
polarization is found to be small $|P_q|<0.04$ in the weak coupling limit.
Possible behavior of the quark polarization in the strong coupling limit and
implications on the experimental detection of such global quark polarization at

electron pairs in one-dimensional (1D) channels induced by electron-electron

the adiabatic quantum pumping of charge and spin previously studied. However,
the presence of interactions that vary only in localized regions of space
requires an intrinsically two-body description which is irreducible to the 1D
single particle scattering matrix elements that are sufficient to describe
quantum pumping of charge and spin. Here we derive a generalized theory for the
pumping of such interacting pairs starting from first principles. We show that
the standard description of charge pumping is contained within our more broadly
applicable expressions. We then apply our general results to a concrete lattice
model and obtain an exact analytical expression for the pumped singlet current.

over wide ranges of redshift (0.06 < z < 1.08) and of luminosity (-29.8 < M_B <

properties in various quasar environments. The measured line strengths and
velocities, as functions of the quasar properties, are analyzed using
photoionization model calculations. We found that the flux ratio between Ca II

similar gas density in the emission region from quasar to quasar. On the other
hand, a scatter of the O I 11287/8446 ratios appears to imply the diversity of
the ionization parameter. These facts invoke a picture of the line-emitting
gases in quasars that have similar densities and are located at regions exposed
to various ionizing radiation fluxes. The observed O I line widths are found to
be remarkably similar over more than 3 orders of magnitude in luminosity, which
indicates a kinematically determined location of the emission region and is in

a non-perfect instrument in a noisy environment poses a challenge for a
statistically clean data analysis. We want to compute the probability of
frequencies determined in various data sets to be related or not, which cannot
be answered with a simple comparison of amplitudes. Our method provides a
statistical estimator for a given signal with different strengths in a set of
observations to be of instrumental origin or to be intrinsic. Based on the
spectral significance as an unbiased statistical quantity in frequency
analysis, Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) of target and background light
curves are comparatively examined. The individual False-Alarm Probabilities are
used to deduce conditional probabilities for a peak in a target spectrum to be
real in spite of a corresponding peak in the spectrum of a background or of
comparison stars. Alternatively, we can compute joint probabilities of
frequencies to occur in the DFT spectra of several data sets simultaneously but
with different amplitude, which leads to composed spectral significances. These
are useful to investigate a star observed in different filters or during
several observing runs. The composed spectral significance is a measure for the
probability that none of coinciding peaks in the DFT spectra under
consideration are due to noise. Cinderella is a mathematical approach to a
general statistical problem. Its potential reaches beyond photometry from
ground or space: to all cases where a quantitative statistical comparison of
periodicities in different data sets is desired. Examples for the composed and
the conditional Cinderella mode for different observation setups are presented.

permeability spectrum $\mu$(f) of magnetic materials at microwave frequencies.
The integral of the imaginary part of $\mu$(f) multiplied with the frequency f
gives remarkable properties. A generalisation of Snoek's law consists in this
quantity being bounded by the square of the saturation magnetization multiplied
with a constant. While previous results have been obtained in the case of
non-conductive materials, this work is a generalization to ferromagnetic
materials and ferromagnetic-based composites with significant skin effect. The
influence of truncating the summation to finite upper frequencies is
investigated, and estimates associated to the finite summation are provided. It
is established that, in practice, the integral does not depend on the damping
model under consideration. Numerical experiments are performed in the exactly
solvable case of ferromagnetic thin films with uniform magnetization, and these
numerical experiments are found to confirm our theoretical results. Microwave
permeability measurements on soft amorphous films are reported. The relation
between the integral and the saturation magnetization is verified
experimentally, and some practical applications of the theoretical results are
introduced. The integral can be used to determine the average magnetization
orientation in materials with complex configurations of the magnetization, and
furthermore to demonstrate the accuracy of microwave measurement systems. For
certain applications, such as electromagnetic compatibility or radar absorbing
materials, the relations established herein provide useful indications for the
design of efficient materials, and simple figures of merit to compare the

  We study the effects of interstellar clouds on the dynamical and chemical
evolution of gas-rich dwarf galaxies. In particular, we focus on two model
galaxies similar to IZw18 and NGC1569 in comparison to models in which a smooth
initial distribution of gas is assumed. We use a 2-D hydrodynamical code
coupled with a series of routines able to trace the chemical products of SNeII,
SNeIa and intermediate-mass stars. Clouds are simulated by adding overdense
regions in the computational grid, whose locations are chosen randomly and
whose density profiles match observed ones. The clouds are inherently
dynamically coupled to the diffuse gas, and they experience heat conduction
from a hot surrounding gas. Due to dynamical processes and thermal evaporation,
the clouds survive only a few tens of Myr. Due to the additional cooling agent,
the internal energy of cloudy models is typically reduced by 20 - 40% compared
with models of diffuse gas alone. The clouds delay the development of
large-scale outflows by mass loading, therefore helping to retain a larger
amount of gas inside the galaxy. However, their bullet effect can pierce the
expanding supershell and create holes through which the superbubble can vent
freshly produced metals. Moreover, assuming a pristine chemical composition for
the clouds, their interaction with the superbubble dilutes the gas, reducing
the metallicity. The resulting final metallicity is therefore generally lower
(by ~ 0.2 - 0.4 dex) than the one attained by diffuse models.

arc-like structure and a stream of material stretching 2 degrees away in
opposition to the arc. The alignment of the proper motion vector and the
arc-like structure shows the structures to be a bow shock and accompanying
tail. We have successfully hydrodynamically modelled the bow shock and tail as
the interaction between the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) wind launched from
Mira A and the surrounding interstellar medium. Our simulations show that the
wake behind the bow shock is turbulent: this forms periodic density variations
in the tail similar to those observed. We investigate the possiblity of
mass-loss variations, but find that these have limited effect on the tail
structure. The tail is estimated to be approximately 450,000 years old, and is
moving with a velocity close to that of Mira itself. We suggest that the
duration of the high mass-loss phase on the AGB may have been underestimated.
Finally, both the tail curvature and the rebrightening at large distance can be
qualitatively understood if Mira recently entered the Local Bubble. This is
estimated to have occured 17 pc downstream from its current location.

the charge and orbital ordered insulator through the spin glass to the
ferromagnetic metal. The enhanced phase fluctuations, namely the short-range
charge and orbital correlations dominate the paramagnetic region of the phase
diagram above all the ground-state phases. This paramagnetic region is
characterized by a full-gap to pseudo-gap crossover towards elevated
temperatures where a broad low-energy electronic structure appears in the
conductivity spectra over a large variation of the bandwidth. This pseudo-gap
state with local correlations is robust against thermal fluctuations at least
up to T=800 K. For small bandwidth the onset of the long-range charge order is
accompanied by an instantaneous increase of the gap. The emergence of the
ferromagnetic state is manifested in the optical spectra as a first-order
insulator to metal transition for compounds with moderate bandwidth while it
becomes a second-order transition on the larger bandwidth side. Unusually large
scattering rate of the metallic carriers is observed in the ferromagnetic state
which is attributed to orbital correlation with probably rod-like

the IMF is roughly flat in the substellar regime and shows no indication of
reaching a minimum down to a completeness limit of 0.01 M_sun. The low-mass

proportional to the Hubble parameter H. We see the expansion of the Universe as
a local effect due to the LAB value of the speed of light co taken as constant.
We present a generalized red shift law and find a predicted acceleration for

results that we call the Mass-Boom. It has a linear increase of mass m with
time as a result of the speed of light c linear decrease with time, and the
conservation of momentum mc. We obtain the baryonic mass parameter equal to the
curvature parameter, omega m = omega k, so that the model is of the type of the
Einstein static, closed, finite, spherical, unlimited, with zero cosmological
constant. This model is the cosmological view as seen by photons, neutrinos,
tachyons etc. in contrast with the local view, the LAB reference. Neither dark
matter nor dark energy is required by this model. With an initial constant
speed of light during a short time we get inflation (an exponential expansion).
This converts, during the inflation time, the Plancks fluctuation length of
10-33 cm to the present size of the Universe (about 1028 cm, constant from then

  its Consequences for Core-Collapse Supernovae","ApJ in press",,"10.1086/587732",,"astro-ph",,"  A perturbative analysis is used to investigate the effect of rotation on the
instability of a steady accretion shock (SASI) in a simple toy-model, in view
of better understanding supernova explosions in which the collapsing core
contains angular momentum. A cylindrical geometry is chosen for the sake of
simplicity. Even when the centrifugal force is very small, rotation can have a
strong effect on the non axisymmetric modes of SASI by increasing the growth
rate of the spiral modes rotating in the same direction as the steady flow.
Counter-rotating spiral modes are significantly damped, while axisymmetric
modes are hardly affected by rotation. The growth rates of spiral modes have a
nearly linear dependence on the specific angular momentum of the flow. The
fundamental one-armed spiral mode (m=1) is favoured for small rotation rates,
whereas stronger rotation rates favour the mode m=2. A WKB analysis of higher
harmonics indicates that the efficiency of the advective-acoustic cycles
associated to spiral modes is strongly affected by rotation in the same manner
as low frequency modes, whereas the purely acoustic cycles are stable. These
results suggest that the linear phase of SASI in rotating core-collapse
supernovae naturally selects a spiral mode rotating in the same direction of
the flow, as observed in the 3D numerical simulations of Blondin & Mezzacappa
(2007). This emphasizes the need for a 3D approach of rotating core-collapse,
before conclusions on the explosion mechanisms and pulsar kicks can be drawn.

Resonance Spectrum Expansion (RSE). For instance, in the S-wave Kaon-pion RSE
amplitude, a broad resonance was predicted slightly above 1.4 GeV
[hep-ex/0106077], which is confirmed by experiment as the K*0(1430). However, a
complete nonet of light scalar mesons was predicted (Zeit.Phys.C30,615
[http://www-spires.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep?key=1573454]) as well,
when a model strongly related to the RSE and initially developed to describe
the heavy quarkonia resonance spectra (Phys.Rev.D21,772
[http://www-spires.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep?key=363162]) was applied
in the light-quark sector. Thus, it was found that the light scalar-meson nonet
constitutes part of the ordinary meson spectrum, albeit represented by
""extraordinary"" [hep-ph/0701038] poles [hep-ex/0106077].
  Similar resonances and bound states appear in the charmed sector
[hep-ph/0305035], and are predicted in the B-meson spectrum [hep-ph/0312078,
hep-ph/0406242].
  A recent work [hep-ph/0703286] confirmed the presence of light scalar-meson
poles in the RSE amplitude for S-wave and P-wave pion-pion and Kaon-pion
contributions to three-body decay processes measured by the BES, E791 and FOCUS
collaborations.

10 Myr is shown to be smaller than the prediction based on the type-II

individual stars in four LMC fields situated at galactocentric distances of
3\arcdeg, 5\arcdeg, 6\arcdeg\@ and 8\arcdeg\@ to the north of the Bar. Observed
metallicity distributions show a well defined peak, with a tail toward low
metallicities. The mean metallicity remains constant until 6\arcdeg\@
([Fe/H]$\sim$-0.5 dex), while for the outermost field, at 8\arcdeg, the mean
metallicity is substantially lower than in the rest of the disk
([Fe/H]$\sim$-0.8 dex). The combination of spectroscopy with deep CCD
photometry has allowed us to break the RGB age--metallicity degeneracy and
compute the ages for the objects observed spectroscopically. The obtained
age--metallicity relationships for our four fields are statistically
indistinguishable. We conclude that the lower mean metallicity in the outermost
field is a consequence of it having a lower fraction of intermediate-age stars,
which are more metal-rich than the older stars. The disk age--metallicity
relationship is similar to that for clusters. However, the lack of objects with
ages between 3 and 10 Gyr is not observed in the field population. Finally, we
used data from the literature to derive consistently the age--metallicity
relationship of the bar. Simple chemical evolution models have been used to
reproduce the observed age--metallicity relationships with the purpose of
investigating which mechanism has participated in the evolution of the disk and
bar. We find that while the disk age--metallicity relationship is well
reproduced by close-box models or models with a small degree of outflow, that
of the bar is only reproduced by models with combination of infall and outflow.

transmembrane potential induced in biological cell membrane under the influence
of externally applied electric field (i.e., electroporation). This model
differs from the established models of electroporation in two distinct ways.
Firstly, it incorporates the presence of cholesterol (~20% mole-fraction) in
biological membrane. Secondly, it considers the distribution of pores as a
function of the variation of transmembrane potential from one region of the
cell to another. Formulation is based on the role of membrane tension and
electrical forces in the formation of pores in a cell membrane, which is
considered as an infinitesimally thin insulator. The model has been used to
explore the process of creation and evolution of pores and to determine the
number and size of pores as a function of applied electric field (magnitude and
duration). Results show that the presence of cholesterol enhances poration by
changing the membrane tension. Analyses indicate that the number of pores and
average pore radii differ significantly from one part of the cell to the other.
While some regions of the cell membrane undergo rapid and dense poration,
others remain unaffected. The method can be a useful tool for a more realistic
prediction of pore formation in cells subjected to electroporation.

between a finite number of compact objects of arbitrary shape and separation.
Here, we present details of the method for a scalar field to illustrate our
approach in its most simple form; the generalization to electromagnetic fields
is outlined in Ref. [1]. The interaction between the objects is attributed to
quantum fluctuations of source distributions on their surfaces, which we
decompose in terms of multipoles. A functional integral over the effective
action of multipoles gives the resulting interaction. Each object's shape and
boundary conditions enter the effective action only through its scattering
matrix. Their relative positions enter through universal translation matrices
that depend only on field type and spatial dimension. The distinction of our
method from the pairwise summation of two-body potentials is elucidated in
terms of the scattering processes between three objects. To illustrate the
power of the technique, we consider Robin boundary conditions $\phi -\lambda
\partial_n \phi=0$, which interpolate between Dirichlet and Neumann cases as
$\lambda$ is varied. We obtain the interaction between two such spheres
analytically in a large separation expansion, and numerically for all
separations. The cases of unequal radii and unequal $\lambda$ are studied. We
find sign changes in the force as a function of separation in certain ranges of
$\lambda$ and see deviations from the proximity force approximation even at
short separations, most notably for Neumann boundary conditions.

in brightness designed to characterize the atmospheres of hot Jupiters. In
particular, we focus on recent observations of the transiting planet HD 189733b
at 8 micron using the Spitzer Space Telescope, which allow us to determine the
efficiency of the day-night circulation on this planet and estimate the
longitudinal positions of hot and cold regions in the atmosphere. We discuss
the implications of these observations in the context of two other successful
detections of more sparsely-sampled phase variations for the non-transiting
systems upsilon And b and HD 179949b, which imply a potential diversity in the
properties of the atmospheres of hot Jupiters. Lastly, we highlight several
upcoming Spitzer observations that will extend this sample to additional
wavelengths and more transiting systems in the near future.

resource that is sufficient for the realization of a large number N of quantum
channels based on distributed Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entangled states.
Each channel can serve as a resource for, e.g. independent quantum key
distribution or teleportation protocols. N-fold channel multiplexing can be
realized by accessing 2N squeezed modes at different Fourier frequencies. We
report on the experimental implementation of the N=1 case through the
interference of two squeezed states, extracted from a single broadband squeezed
field, and demonstrate all techniques required for multiplexing (N>1). Quantum
channel frequency multiplexing can be used to optimize the exploitation of a
broadband squeezed field in a quantum information task. For instance, it is
useful if the bandwidth of the squeezed field is larger than the bandwidth of
the homodyne detectors. This is currently a typical situation in many
experiments with squeezed and two-mode squeezed entangled light.

the spinon interaction from two different perspectives: (i) For finite N the
energy of all eigenstates is expressed as a function of spinon momenta and
spinon spins, which, in turn, are solutions of a set of Bethe ansatz equations.
The latter are the basis of an exact thermodynamic analysis in the spinon
representation of the XX model. (ii) For N -> infinity the energy per site of
spinon configurations involving any number of spinon orbitals is expressed as a
function of reduced variables representing momentum, filling, and magnetization
of each orbital. The spins of spinons in a single orbital are found to be
coupled in a manner well described by an Ising-like equivalent-neighbor
interaction, switching from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic as the filling

Drell-Yan lepton pair production at the Tevatron and the LHC is analyzed in two
situations, when the first KK resonance is too heavy to be directly detected at
the colliders, and when the first KK resonance is visible but other states are
still too heavy. It is shown that in both cases the contribution from the KK
invisible tower leads to a modification of final particles distributions. In
particular, for the second case a nontrivial interference between the first KK
mode and the rest KK tower takes place. Expected 95% CL limits for model
parameters for the Tevatron and the LHC are given. In the Appendix useful
formulas for the cross sections and distributions of various new $2\to2$
processes via heavy KK tower exchange are presented, the new formulas
containing nonzero particle masses for final state fermions and bosons. The
