gravitational lensing and hydrostatic X-ray masses for a sample of 18 clusters

r2500 we obtain a ratio MX/ML=1.03+/-0.07 which decreases to MX/ML=0.78+/-0.09
at r500. This difference is significant at 3 sigma once we account for
correlations between the measurements. We show that correcting the lensing mass
for excess correlated structure outside the virial radius slightly reduces, but
does not eliminate this trend. An X-ray mass underestimate, perhaps due to
nonthermal pressure support, can explain the residual trend. The trend is not
correlated with the presence or absence of a cool core. We also examine the
cluster gas fraction and find no correlation with ML, an important result for
techniques that aim to determine cosmological parameters using the gas

their cubes, the philosophy being that this should force the group to be, in
some sense, close to abelian. We prove two theorems. In the first, we
completely classify all finite groups with an automorphism cubing more than
half their elements. All such groups are either nilpotent class 2 or have an
abelian subgroup of index at most 2. For our second theorem we show that, if a
group possesses an automorphism sending more than 4/15 of its elements to their
cubes, then it must be solvable. The group A_5 shows that this result is best
possible.
  Both our main findings closely parallel results of previous authors on finite
groups possessing an automorphism which inverts many group elements. The
technicalities of the new proofs are somewhat more subtle, and also throw up a
nice connection to a basic problem in combinatorial number theory, namely the
study of subsets of finite cyclic groups which avoid non-trivial solutions to

by, and interpreted through, a new analytic model. A few general scaling rules
for the disk evolution are suggested. The timescale of the collisional
evolution is inversely proportional to the initial disk mass and scales with
radial distance as r^4.3 and with eccentricities of planetesimals as e^-2.3.
Further, we show that at actual ages of debris disks between 10 Myr and 10 Gyr,
the decay of the dust mass and the total disk mass follow different laws. The
reason is that the collisional lifetime of planetesimals is size-dependent. At
any moment, there exists a transitional size, which separates larger objects
that still have the ``primordial'' size distribution set in the growth phase
from small objects whose size distribution is already set by disruptive
collisions. The dust mass and its decay rate evolve as that transition affects
objects of ever-larger sizes. Under standard assumptions, the dust mass,
fractional luminosity, and thermal fluxes all decrease as t^xi with xi =
-0.3...-0.4. Specific decay laws of the total disk mass and the dust mass,
including the value of xi, largely depend on a few model parameters, such as
the critical fragmentation energy as a function of size, the primordial size
distribution of largest planetesimals, as well as the characteristic
eccentricity and inclination of their orbits. With standard material
prescriptions and a distribution of disk masses and extents, a synthetic
population of disks generated with our analytic model agrees quite well with
the observed Spitzer/MIPS statistics of 24 and 70 micron fluxes and colors
versus age.

regularization at the - in single patch approaches inevitable - coordinate
singularities is worked out. After having collected the necessary background
material, including a description of the problems of interest, we discuss the
method and its implementation. Then we perform various tests, in particular
also in the presence of cosmological singularities. After that, the numerical
method is applied to obtain insights into three open issues in mathematical

Gowdy spacetimes with positive cosmological constants with spatial 3-sphere and
those with spatial 3-torus topology. Second, we perform a stability analysis of
Gowdy symmetry within the class of U(1)-symmetric spacetimes for spatial
3-sphere topology. Third, we make a preliminary analysis of the behavior of

binaries embedded in gravitationally-bound stellar cusps, and study the binary
orbital decay by three-body interactions, the impact of stellar slingshots on
the density profile of the inner cusp, and the properties of the ejected
hypervelocity stars (HVSs). We find that the scattering of bound stars shrinks
the binary orbit and increases its eccentricity more effectively than that of
unbound ambient stars. Binaries with initial eccentricities e>0.3 and/or
unequal-mass companions (M_2/M_1<0.1) can decay by three-body interactions to
the gravitational wave emission regime in less than a Hubble time. The stellar
cusp is significantly eroded, and cores as shallow as \rho\propto r^-0.7 may
develop from a pre-existing singular isothermal density profile. A population
of HVSs is ejected in the host galaxy halo, with a total mass ~M_2. We scale
our results to the scattering of stars bound to Sgr A*, the massive black hole
in the Galactic Center, by an inspiraling companion of intermediate mass.
Depending on binary mass ratio, eccentricity, and initial slope of the stellar
cusp, a core of radius ~0.1 pc typically forms in 1-10 Myr. On this timescale
about 500-2500 HVSs are expelled with speeds sufficiently large to escape the
gravitational potential of the Milky Way.

structure of the many-body wave functions through spin-resolved two-point

molecules. For certain ranges of dot parameters (mainly at strong anisotropy),
the Wigner molecules acquire a linear geometry, and the associated wave
functions with a spin projection S_z=1/2 are similar to the representative
class of strongly entangled states referred to as W-states. For other ranges of
parameters (mainly at intermediate anisotropy), the Wigner molecules exhibit a
more complex structure consisting of two mirror isosceles triangles. This
latter structure can be viewed as an embryonic unit of a zig-zag Wigner crystal

versatility of photonic crystals in confining and manipulating light, quantum
networks allow for the prospect of an integrated and low power quantum
technology. Within quantum networks, which consist of a system of waveguides
and nanocavities with embedded quantum dots, it has been demonstrated in theory
that many-qubit states stored in electron spins could be teleported from one
quantum dot to another via a single photon using the Single Photon Faraday
Effect. However, in addition to being able to transfer quantum information from
one location to another, quantum networks need added functionality such as (1)
controlling the flow of the quantum information and (2) performing specific
operations on qubits that can be easily integrated. In this paper, we show how
in principle a single photon Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which uses the
concept of the single photon Faraday Effect to manipulate the geometrical phase
of a single photon, can be operated both as a switch to control the flow of
quantum information inside the quantum network and as various single qubit
quantum gates to perform operations on a single photon. Our proposed
Mach-Zehnder interferometer can be fully integrated as part of a quantum
network on a chip. Given that the X gate, the Z gate, and the XZ gate are
essential for the implementation of quantum teleportation, we show explicitly
their implementation by means of our proposed single photon Mach-Zehnder
interferometer. We also show explicitly the implementation of the Hadamard gate
and the single-qubit phase gate, which are needed to complete the universal set
of quantum gates for integrated quantum computing in a quantum network.

the process of cosmological reionization. The models include non-equilibrium
primordial gas chemistry and cooling processes and accurate radiation transport
in the Case B approximation using adaptively ray traced photon packages,
retaining the time derivative in the transport equation. Supernova feedback is
modeled by thermal explosions triggered at parsec scales. All calculations
resolve the local Jeans length by at least 16 grid cells at all times and as
such cover a spatial dynamic range of ~10^6. These first sources of
reionization are highly intermittent and anisotropic and first photoionize the
small scales voids surrounding the halos they form in, rather than the dense
filaments they are embedded in. As the merging objects form larger, dwarf sized
galaxies, the escape fraction of UV radiation decreases and the HII regions
only break out on some sides of the galaxies making them even more anisotropic.
In three cases, SN blast waves induce star formation in overdense regions that
were formed earlier from ionization front instabilities. These stars form tens
of parsecs away from the center of their parent DM halo. Approximately 5
ionizing photons are needed per sustained ionization when star formation in
10^6 M_sun halos are dominant in the calculation. As the halos become larger
than ~10^7 M_sun, the ionizing photon escape fraction decreases, which in turn
increases the number of photons per ionization to 15-50, in calculations with
stellar feedback only. Supernova feedback in these more massive halos creates a
more diffuse medium, allowing the stellar radiation to escape more easily and
maintaining the ratio of 5 ionizing photons per sustained ionization.

coordinates, modulo gauge symmetries) the celestial sphere S9. There presence
allows us to separate covariantly the first and the second class constraints of
the model. After taking into account the second class constraints by means of
Dirac brackets and after further reducing the first class constraints algebra,
the system is described in terms of a simple BRST charge associated to the d=1,
n=16 supersymmetry algebra. The study of the cohomology of this BRST operator
requires a regularization by complexifying the bosonic ghosts for the
kappa-symmetry and further reduction of the regularized cohomology problem to
the one for a simpler complex BRST charge which is essentially the pure spinor
BRST operator by Berkovits, but with a composite pure spinor. This exhibits a
possible origin of the complexity (non-hermiticity) characteristic of the
Berkovits pure spinor approach.

finds explanation in the properties that the superparticle action exhibits in

This bound suggests a novel solution to the hierarchy problem in which there

copies of the Standard Model. The black hole bound forces them to be at the
weak scale, hence providing a stable hierarchy. We present various arguments,
that in such theories the effective gravitational cutoff is reduced to
\Lambda_G \approx M_{Planck}/\sqrt{N} and a new description is needed around
this scale. In particular black-holes smaller than \Lambda_G^{-1} are already
no longer semi-classical. The nature of the completion is model dependent. One
natural possibility is that \Lambda_G is the quantum gravity scale. We provide
evidence that within this type of scenarios, contrary to the standard
intuition, micro black holes have a (slowly-fading) memory of the species of

the black hole evaporation problem is then presented.
  The leitmotif is the singular behavior of modes on the horizon which gives
rise to a steady rate of production. Special emphasis is put on how each
produced particle contributes to the mean albeit arising from a particular
vacuum fluctuation. It is the mean which drives the semiclassical back
reaction. This aspect is analyzed in more detail than heretofore and in
particular its drawbacks are emphasized. It is the semiclassical theory which
gives rise to Hawking's famous equation for the loss of mass of the black hole
due to evaporation $dM/dt \simeq -1/M^2$. Black hole thermodynamics is derived
from the evaporation process whereupon the reservoir character of the black
hole is manifest. The relation to the thermodynamics of the eternal black hole
through the Hartle--Hawking vacuum and the Killing identity are displayed.
  It is through the analysis of the fluctuations of the field configurations
which give rise to a particular Hawking photon that the dubious character of
the semiclassical theory is manifest. The present frontier of research revolves
around this problem and is principally concerned with the fact that one calls
upon energy scales that are greater than Planckian and the possibility of a non
unitary evolution as well. These last subjects are presented in qualitative
fashion only, so that this review stops at the threshold of quantum gravity.

they arise simultaneously from an underlying quantum system. It is through the
emergent matter degrees of freedom that geometry is inferred. We have termed
our program Internal Relativity to stress the importance of looking at the
system from the point of view of an internal observer. We argue that special
relativity is then a natural consequence of this viewpoint. The most important
new aspect of Internal Relativity involves how gravity appears. It is not just
a new quantum theory of gravity but a new theory of gravity. We also argue that
the presence of a massive object implies curvature. In particular we show that
Newtonian gravity arises in the appropriate limit. Our argument implies that
there is no propagation without gravitation.

reveals previously undetected ionized filaments in the outer halo. Through
combining these results with our spectroscopy we have been able to re-define

estimates for their expansion velocities, which we find to be in the range
50-100 km/s. The implied dynamical ages of <25 Myr are consistent with the
recent star- and cluster-formation histories of the galaxy. Detailed
decomposition of the multi-component H-alpha line has shown that within a
distinct region ~700x500 pc in size, roughly centred on the bright super star
cluster A, the profile is composed of a bright, narrow (FWHM <= 70 km/s)
feature with an underlying, broad component (FWHM ~ 150 km/s). Applying the
conclusions found in our previous work regarding the mechanism through which
the broad component is produced, we associate the faint, broad emission with
the interaction of the hot, fast-flowing winds from the young star clusters
with cool clumps of ISM material. This interaction generates turbulent mixing
layers on the surface of the clouds and the evaporation and/or ablation of
material into the outflow. Under this interpretation, the extent of the broad
component region may indicate an important transition point in the outflow,
where ordered expansion begins to dominate over turbulent motion. In this
context, we present a multi-wavelength discussion of the evolutionary state of
the outflow.

using exactly solvable one-dimensional discrete-state stochastic models. An
interaction between molecules and membrane pores is modeled via a set of
binding sites with different energies. It is shown that the interaction
potential strongly influences the particle currents as well as fluctuations in
the number of translocated molecules. For small concentration gradients the
attractive sites lead to largest currents and fluctuations, while the repulsive
interactions yield the largest fluxes and dispersions for large concentration
gradients. Interaction energies that lead to maximal currents and maximal
fluctuations are the same only for locally symmetric potentials, while they
differ for the locally asymmetric potentials. The conditions for the most
optimal translocation transport with maximal current and minimal dispersion are
discussed. It is argued that in this case the interaction strength is
independent of local symmetry of the potential of mean forces. In addition, the
effect of the global asymmetry of the interaction potential is investigated,
and it is shown that it also strongly affects the particle translocation
dynamics. These phenomena can be explained by analyzing the details of the
particle entering and leaving the binding sites in the channel.

The initialmass function (IMF) of EMP stars is derived from the observed
fraction of carbon-enhanced EXP (CEMP) stars among the EMP survivors, which are
thought to originate from the evolution in the close binary systems with mass
transfer. Relying upon the theory of the evolution of EMP stars and of their
binary evolution, we find that stars of metallicity [Fe/H]<-2.5 were formed at
typical mass of ~10M_sun. The top heavy IMF thus obtained is applied to study
the early chemical evolution of the Galaxy. We construct the merging history of
our Galaxy semi-analytically and derive the metallicity distribution function

terms of the equilibrium metric h_e associated to h, as well as in terms of the
Monge-Ampere measure of h on a certain support set. It is also shown that the
equilibrium metric h_e is in the class C^{1,1} on the complement of the
augmented base locus of L. For L ample these results give generalizations of
well-known results concerning the case when the curvature of h is globally
positive (then h_e=h). In general, the results can be seen as local metrized
versions of Fujita's approximation theorem for the volume of L.

Carlo simulations has been highlighted in the recent literature. Our main
concern in this paper is to devise methods which produce the optimal weight,
which is well known to be given by the score, in a general context where the
density of $Z(\lambda)$ is not explicitly known. To do this, we randomize the
parameter $\lambda$ by introducing an a priori distribution, and we use
classical kernel estimation techniques in order to estimate the score function.
By an integration by parts argument on the limit of this first kernel
estimator, we define an alternative simpler kernel-based estimator which turns
out to be closely related to the partial gradient of the kernel-based estimator
of $\mathbb{E}[\phi(Z(\lambda))]$. Similarly to the finite differences
technique, and unlike the so-called Malliavin method, our estimators are
biased, but their implementation does not require any advanced mathematical
calculation. We provide an asymptotic analysis of the mean squared error of
these estimators, as well as their asymptotic distributions. For a
discontinuous payoff function, the kernel estimator outperforms the classical
finite differences one in terms of the asymptotic rate of convergence. This
result is confirmed by our numerical experiments.

galaxies. We estimate and discuss the excitation conditions of HCN and HNC in
NGC 1068, NGC 3079, NGC 2623 and NGC 7469, based on the observed 3-2/1-0 line
intensity ratios. We also observed CN 1-0 and 2-1 emission and discuss its role
in photon and X-ray dominated regions. HNC 3-2 was detected in 3 galaxies (NGC
3079, NGC 1068 and NGC 2623). HCN 3-2 was detected in NGC 3079, NGC 1068 and
NGC 1365. The HCN 3-2/1-0 ratio is lower than 0.3 only in NGC 3079, whereas the
HNC 3-2/1-0 ratio is larger than 0.3 only in NGC 2623. The HCN/HNC 1-0 and 3-2
line ratios are larger than unity in all the galaxies. The HCN/HNC 3-2 line
ratio is lower than unity only in NGC 2623, similar to Arp 220, Mrk 231 and NGC
4418. In three of the galaxies the HNC emissions emerge from gas of densities
n<10^5 cm^3, where the chemistry is dominated by ion-neutral reactions. In NGC
1068 the emission of HNC emerges from lower (<10^5 cm^3) density gas than HCN
(>10^5 cm^3). Instead, the emissions of HNC and HCN emerge from the same gas in
NGC 3079. The observed HCN/HNC and CN/HCN line ratios favor a PDR scenario,
rather than an XDR one. However, the N(HNC)/N(HCN) column density ratios
obtained for NGC 3079 can be found only in XDR environments.

level of blocking replaces GCD computations by multiplications, as suggested by
Pollard (1975), von zur Gathen and Shoup (1992), and others. The novelty of our
approach is that a finer level of blocking replaces multiplications by
squarings, which speeds up the computation in GF(2)[x]/P(x) of certain interval
polynomials when P(x) is sparse. As an application we give a fast algorithm to
search for all irreducible trinomials x^r + x^s + 1 of degree r over GF(2),
while producing a certificate that can be checked in less time than the full
search. Naive algorithms cost O(r^2) per trinomial, thus O(r^3) to search over
all trinomials of given degree r. Under a plausible assumption about the
distribution of factors of trinomials, the new algorithm has complexity O(r^2
(log r)^{3/2}(log log r)^{1/2}) for the search over all trinomials of degree r.
Our implementation achieves a speedup of greater than a factor of 560 over the
naive algorithm in the case r = 24036583 (a Mersenne exponent). Using our
program, we have found two new primitive trinomials of degree 24036583 over

  2007",,"10.1051/eas:0830006",,"gr-qc",,"  The harmonic formulation of Einstein's field equations is considered, where
the gauge conditions are introduced as dynamical constraints. The difference
between the fully constrained approach (used in analytical approximations) and
the free evolution one (used in most numerical approximations) is pointed out.
As a generalization, quasi-stationary gauge conditions are also discussed,
including numerical experiments with the gauge-waves testbed. The complementary
3+1 approach is also considered, where constraints are related instead with
energy and momentum first integrals and the gauge must be provided separately.
The relationship between the two formalisms is discussed in a more general
framework (Z4 formalism). Different strategies in black hole simulations follow
when introducing singularity avoidance as a requirement. More flexible
quasi-stationary gauge conditions are proposed in this context, which can be
seen as generalizations of the current 'freezing shift' prescriptions.

that without scattering of the electrons, the tunneling conductance can either
exhibit resonances at certain voltage values or be substantially suppressed

turns out to be very sensitive to the relation between Rashba and Dresselhaus

broadens the resonances in the first case and restores the conductance to a

seen as modifications or generalisations of General Relativity. The motivation
for considering such theories, stemming from Cosmology, High Energy Physics and
Astrophysics is thoroughly discussed (cosmological problems, dark energy and
dark matter problems, the lack of success so far in obtaining a successful
formulation for Quantum Gravity). The basic principles which a gravitational
theory should follow, and their geometrical interpretation, are analysed in a
broad perspective which highlights the basic assumptions of General Relativity
and suggests possible modifications which might be made. A number of such
possible modifications are presented, focusing on certain specific classes of
theories: scalar-tensor theories, metric f(R) theories, Palatini f(R) theories,
metric-affine f(R) theories and Gauss--Bonnet theories. The characteristics of
these theories are fully explored and attention is payed to issues of dynamical
equivalence between them. Also, cosmological phenomenology within the realm of
each of the theories is discussed and it is shown that they can potentially
address the well-known cosmological problems. A number of viability criteria
are presented: cosmological observations, Solar System tests, stability
criteria, existence of exact solutions for common vacuum or matter
configurations etc. Finally, future perspectives in the field of modified
gravity are discussed and the possibility for going beyond a trial-and-error
approach to modified gravity is explored.

the continuum levels and strengths of weak emission lines are accurately
measured. The result is several new combinations of emission line ratios,
line/continuum and continuum/continuum ratios that turn out to be effective
diagnostics of the strength of the AGN component in the IR emission of these
galaxies. The line ratios [NeV]/[NeII], [OIV]/[NeII], already known, but also
[NeIII]/[NeII] and [NeV]/[SiII] can all be effectively used to measure the
dominance of the AGN. We extend the analysis, already done using the 6.2um PAH
emission feature, to the equivalent width of the 11.25um PAH feature, which
also anti-correlates with the dominance of the AGN. We measure that the 11.25um

gives another measure of the AGN dominance and correlates both with the EWs of
[NeII] and PAH emission. Using the rotational transitions of H$_2$ we were able
to estimate temperatures (200-300K) and masses (1-10 x 10^6 M_sun), or
significant limits on them, for the warm molecular component in the galaxies

its relation with stellar clusters, we are carrying out several imaging
projects with HST at near-UV, optical and near-IR wavelengths. In this paper,
we present the first results obtained with observations of the central regions
of 57 LLAGNs imaged with the WFPC2 through any of the V (F555W, F547M, F614W)
and I (F791W, F814W) filters that are available in the HST archive. The sample
contains 34% of the LINERs and 36% of the TOs in the Palomar sample. The mean
spatial resolution of these images is 10 pc. With these data we have built an
atlas that includes structural maps for all the galaxies, useful to identify
compact nuclear sources and, additionally, to characterize the circumnuclear
environment of LLAGNs, determining the frequency of dust and its morphology.
The main results obtained are: 1) We have not found any correlation between the
presence of nuclear compact sources and emission-line type. Thus, nucleated
LINERs are as frequent as nucleated TOs. 2) The nuclei of ""Young-TOs"" are
brighter than the nuclei of ""Old-TOs"" and LINERs. These results confirm our
previous results that Young-TOs are separated from other LLAGNs classes in
terms of their central stellar population properties and brightness. 3)
Circumnuclear dust is detected in 88% of the LLAGNs, being almost ubiquitous in
TOs. 4) The dust morphology is complex and varied, from nuclear spiral lanes to
chaotic filaments and nuclear disk-like structures. Chaotic filaments are as
frequent as dust spirals; but nuclear disks are mainly seen in LINERs. These
results suggest an evolutionary sequence of the dust in LLAGNs, LINERs being
the more evolved systems and Young-TOs the youngest. The full collection of

The Symanzik tree-level-improved Wilson action is used for the gauge field and

hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm (PHMC). The mass spectrum of hadronic bound states
is investigated at two different lattice spacings: a ~ 0.37r_0 and a ~ 0.27r_0,

a pion with mass ~270MeV. Properties of the theory are analyzed by making use
of the ideas of partially quenched chiral perturbation theory (PQChPT). The
symmetry of the single flavor theory can be artificially enhanced by adding
extra valence quarks, which can be interpreted as u and d quarks. Operators in
the valence pion sector can be built. Masses and decay constants are analyzed

detected with the integrated-pulse method, which is a variant of the pulsed
switching DC SQUID method. In this scheme the DC SQUID bias current pulse is
applied via a capacitor instead of a resistor, giving rise to a narrow
band-pass instead of a pure low-pass filter configuration of the
electromagnetic environment. Measuring one and the same qubit with both setups
allows a direct comparison. With the capacitive method about four times faster
switching pulses and an increased visibility are achieved. Furthermore, the
deliberate engineering of the electromagnetic environment, which minimizes the
noise due to the bias circuit, is facilitated. Right at the degeneracy point
the qubit coherence is limited by energy relaxation. We find two main noise
contributions. White noise is limiting the energy relaxation and contributing
to the dephasing far from the degeneracy point. 1/f-noise is the dominant
source of dephasing in the direct vicinity of the optimal point. The influence
of 1/f-noise is also supported by non-random beatings in the Ramsey and spin
echo decay traces. Numeric simulations of a coupled qubit-oscillator system
indicate that these beatings are due to the resonant interaction of the qubit
with at least one point-like fluctuator, coupled especially strongly to the

``causation'' that are relevant in legal cases involving statistical input
based on epidemiological (or more generally observational or population-based)
information. We distinguish between three versions of ``cause'': the first
involves negligence in providing or allowing exposure, the second involves
``cause'' as it is shown through a scientifically proved increased risk of an
outcome from the exposure in a population, and the third considers ``cause'' as
it might apply to an individual plaintiff based on the first two. The
population-oriented ``cause'' is that commonly addressed by statisticians, and
we propose a variation on the Bradford Hill approach to testing such causality
in an observational framework, and discuss how such a systematic series of
tests might be considered in a legal context. We review some current legal
approaches to using probabilistic statements, and link these with the
scientific methodology as developed here. In particular, we provide an approach
both to the idea of individual outcomes being caused on a balance of
probabilities, and to the idea of material contribution to such outcomes.
Statistical terminology and legal usage of terms such as ``proof on the balance
of probabilities'' or ``causation'' can easily become confused, largely due to
similar language describing dissimilar concepts; we conclude, however, that a
careful analysis can identify and separate those areas in which a legal
decision alone is required and those areas in which scientific approaches are
useful.

currently expected in certain approaches. We argue that the strong absorption
of resonances in the high baryon density region of the heavy ion collision
masks information from the early hot and dense phase due to a strong increase
of the total decay width because of collisional broadening. To obtain
additional information, we also compare the currently used approaches to
extract di-leptons from transport simulations - i.e. shining, only vector
mesons from final baryon resonance decays and instant emission of di-leptons
and find a strong sensitivity on the method employed in particular at FAIR and
SPS energies. It is shown explicitly that a restriction to rho meson (and
therefore di-lepton) production only in final state baryon resonance decays
provide a strong bias towards rather low baryon densities. The results
presented are obtained from UrQMD v2.3 calculations using the standard set-up.

check the consistency of the method. Published IRAS and Spitzer data confirm
that the same tight correlation between $K-[12]$ colour and dust mass-loss
rates is observed for AGB stars from galaxies with different metallicities,

3$\times10^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the observed AGB stars in Sgr dSph
and around 5$\times10^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for those in Fornax; while
values obtained with the two different methods are of the same order of
magnitude. The mass-loss rates for these stars are higher than the nuclear
burning rates, so they will terminate their AGB phase by the depletion of their
stellar mantles before their core can grow significantly. Some observed stars

  Pub. ISBN 978-1-60456-366-5",,,"gr-qc",,"  The General Theory of Relativity has been an extremely successful theory,
with a well established experimental footing, at least for weak gravitational
fields. Its predictions range from the existence of black holes, gravitational
radiation to the cosmological models, predicting a primordial beginning, namely
the big-bang. All these solutions have been obtained by first considering a
plausible distribution of matter, and through the Einstein field equation, the
spacetime metric of the geometry is determined. However, one may solve the
Einstein field equation in the reverse direction, namely, one first considers
an interesting and exotic spacetime metric, then finds the matter source
responsible for the respective geometry. In this manner, it was found that some
of these solutions possess a peculiar property, namely 'exotic matter,'
involving a stress-energy tensor that violates the null energy condition. These
geometries also allow closed timelike curves, with the respective causality
violations. These solutions are primarily useful as 'gedanken-experiments' and
as a theoretician's probe of the foundations of general relativity, and include
traversable wormholes and superluminal 'warp drive' spacetimes. Thus, one may
be tempted to denote these geometries as 'exotic' solutions of the Einstein
field equation, as they violate the energy conditions and generate closed
timelike curves. In this article, in addition to extensively exploring
interesting features, in particular, the physical properties and
characteristics of these 'exotic spacetimes,' we also analyze other non-trivial
general relativistic geometries which generate closed timelike curves.

(2007) to assess remaining systematic uncertainties. The integrated AGN
emissivity closely tracks the cosmic star formation history, suggesting that
star formation and black hole growth are closely linked at all redshifts.
Observational uncertainties in the local black hole mass function remain
substantial, with estimates of the integrated black hole mass density \rho_BH
spanning the range 3-5.5x10^5 Msun/Mpc^3. We find good agreement with estimates
of the local mass function for a reference model where all active black holes
have efficiency \eps=0.065 and L_bol/L_Edd~0.4. In this model, the duty cycle
of 10^9 Msun black holes declines from 0.07 at z=3 to 0.004 at z=1 and 0.0001
at z=0. The decline is shallower for less massive black holes, a signature of
""downsizing"" evolution in which more massive black holes build their mass
earlier. The predicted duty cycles and AGN clustering bias in this model are in
reasonable accord with observational estimates. If the typical Eddington ratio
declines at z<2, then the ""downsizing"" of black hole growth is less pronounced.
Matching the integrated AGN emissivity to the local black hole mass density
implies \eps=0.075 (\rho_BH/4.5x10^5 Msun/Mpc^3)^{-1} for our standard

Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and trapped in a tight optical lattice. Within
the strong-coupling regime, we derive an extended Hubbard model describing the
dynamics of the impurities in terms of polarons, i.e. impurities dressed by a
coherent state of Bogoliubov phonons. Using a generalized master equation based
on this microscopic model we show that inelastic and dissipative phonon
scattering results in (i) a crossover from coherent to incoherent transport of
impurities with increasing BEC temperature and (ii) the emergence of a net
atomic current across a tilted optical lattice. The dependence of the atomic
current on the lattice tilt changes from ohmic conductance to negative
differential conductance within an experimentally accessible parameter regime.
This transition is accurately described by an Esaki-Tsu-type relation with the
effective relaxation time of the impurities as a temperature-dependent
parameter.

  matchings of odd squares with a unit hole","35 pages",,,,"math.CO",,"  We say that two graphs are similar if their adjacency matrices are similar
matrices. We show that the square grid $G_n$ of order $n$ is similar to the
disjoint union of two copies of the quartered Aztec diamond $QAD_{n-1}$ of
order $n-1$ with the path $P_n^{(2)}$ on $n$ vertices having edge weights equal
to~2. Our proof is based on an explicit change of basis in the vector space on
which the adjacency matrix acts. The arguments verifying that this change of
basis works are combinatorial. In particular, this allows computing the number
of spanning trees of quartered Aztec diamonds.
  We present and analyze three more families of graphs that share the above
described ``linear squarishness'' property of square grids: odd Aztec diamonds,
mixed Aztec diamonds, and Aztec pillowcases--graphs obtained from two copies of
an Aztec diamond by identifying the corresponding vertices on their convex
hulls.
  We apply the above results to enumerate all the symmetry classes of spanning
trees of the even Aztec diamonds, and all the symmetry classes not involving
rotations of the spanning trees of odd and mixed Aztec diamonds. We also
enumerate all but the base case of the symmetry classes of perfect matchings of
odd square grids with the central vertex removed. In addition, we obtain a
product formula for the number of spanning trees of Aztec pillowcases.

the heavily extinguished Type Ia supernova (SN) 2002cv, located in NGC 3190,
which is also the parent galaxy of the Type Ia SN 2002bo. SN 2002cv, not
visible in the blue, has a total visual extinction of 8.74 +- 0.21 mag. In
spite of this we were able to obtain the light curves between -10 and +207 days
from the maximum in the I band, and also to follow the spectral evolution,
deriving its key parameters. We found the peak I-band brightness to be Imax =
16.57 +- 0.10 mag, the maximum absolute I magnitude to be MmaxI = -18.79 +-
0.20, and the parameter dm15(B) specifying the width of the B-band light curve
to be 1.46 +- 0.17 mag. The latter was derived using the relations between this
parameter and dm40(I) and the time interval dtmax(I) between the two maxima in
the I-band light curve. As has been found for previously observed, highly
extinguished SNe Ia, a small value of 1.59 +- 0.07 was obtained here for the
ratio Rv of the total-to-selective extinction ratio for SN 2002cv, which
implies a small mean size for the grains along the line of sight toward us.
Since it was found for SN 2002bo a canonical value of 3.1, here we present a
clear evidence of different dust properties inside NGC 3190.
