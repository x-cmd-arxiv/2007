  Conference Series, ed. Debra Fischer, Fred Rasio, Steve Thorsett and Alex
  Wolszczan",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Compared to planets around Sun-like stars, relatively little is known about
the occurrence rate and orbital properties of planets around stars more massive
than 1.3 Msun. The apparent deficit of planets around massive stars is due to a
strong selection bias against early-type dwarfs in Doppler-based planet
searches. One method to circumvent the difficulties inherent to massive
main-sequence stars is to instead observe them after they have evolved onto the
subgiant branch. We show how the cooler atmospheres and slower rotation
velocities of subgiants make them ideal proxies for F- and A-type stars. We
present the early results from our planet search that reveal a paucity of
planets orbiting within 1 AU of stars more massive than 1.5 Msun, and evidence
of a rising trend in giant planet occurrence with stellar mass.

realizes the democratic mass matrix patterns and explains why one family is

by explicitly breaking the left-right flavor symmetry into the diagonal A4, it
is possible to explain both the observed charged fermion mass hierarchies and

the tribimaximal mixing for the leptons, and we suggest a possible origin of

The predicted scalar spectral index n_s cannot be smaller than 0.97 and can
exceed unity including corrections from minimal supergravity, if the number of
e-foldings corresponding to the pivot scale k_*=0.002/Mpc is around 50. These
results are marginally consistent with the fitting of the three-year Wilkinson
microwave anisotropy probe data by the standard power-law cosmological model

by applying two mechanisms: (i) The utilization of a quasi-canonical Kahler
potential with a convenient choice of a sign and (ii) the restriction of the
number of e-foldings that k_* suffered during FHI. In the case (i), we
investigate the possible reduction of n_s without generating maxima and minima

e-foldings required for solving the horizon and flatness problems can be
generated by a subsequent stage of fast-roll [slow-roll] modular inflation

to a redshift of 1.7, using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) GOODS data
combined with an additional HST dataset covering the North GOODS field
collected in 2004. We employ a novel technique that does not require
spectroscopic data for identifying Type Ia supernovae (although spectroscopic
measurements of redshifts are used for over half the sample); instead we employ
a Bayesian approach using only photometric data to calculate the probability
that an object is a Type Ia supernova. This Bayesian technique can easily be
modified to incorporate improved priors on supernova properties, and it is
well-suited for future high-statistics supernovae searches in which
spectroscopic follow up of all candidates will be impractical. Here, the method
is validated on both ground- and space-based supernova data having some
spectroscopic follow up. We combine our volumetric rate measurements with low
redshift supernova data, and fit to a number of possible models for the
evolution of the Type Ia supernova rate as a function of redshift. The data do
not distinguish between a flat rate at redshift > 0.5 and a previously proposed
model, in which the Type Ia rate peaks at redshift >1 due to a significant
delay from star-formation to the supernova explosion. Except for the highest
redshifts, where the signal to noise ratio is generally too low to apply this
technique, this approach yields smaller or comparable uncertainties than
previous work.

stance by suggesting that this degree of freedom somehow corresponded to an
inner rotational motion, though it was unclear from the very beginning how
literal one was actually supposed to take this picture, since it was
immediately recognised (already by Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck) that it would very
likely lead to serious problems with Special Relativity if the model were to
reproduce the electron's values for mass, charge, angular momentum, and
magnetic moment. However, probably due to the then overwhelming impression that
classical concepts were generally insufficient for the proper description of
microscopic phenomena, a more detailed reasoning was never given. In this
contribution I shall investigate in some detail what the restrictions on the
physical quantities just mentioned are, if they are to be reproduced by rather
simple classical models of the electron within the framework of Special
Relativity. It turns out that surface stresses play a decisive role and that
the question of whether a classical model for the electron does indeed
contradict Special Relativity can only be answered on the basis of an
\emph{exact} solution, which has hitherto not been given.

inertia relative to an axis perpendicular to the axis of rotation may be very
important. This formalism, that takes into account the precession contribution
to the angular momentum, is based on the existence of a parameter $\it p$ which
determines three characteristic densities resulting from the averaging process
and imposes constraints on the actual disk density. It is shown that the
precession velocity will lie in a three branch solution, and depends on how
large is the disk actual density as compared to the characteristic densities.
Besides the large spread on the solution for the precession velocity, depending
on the density strength, it may be prograde and retrograde. It is shown that
the keplerian thin disk, with very large density values compared to
characteristic ones, only precesses very far away from the primary object,
which implies very large precession periods. For other models, the disk will
thicken, with large deviations from the keplerian approximation. Constraints on
the density only will be effective for very large values of the ratio ${{\dot
M} \over M_{p}}$, respectively, accretion rate and mass of the primary. Under
this condition, the structure of the precessing region is found. Lower bounds
on the precession period are found for not so large values of this ratio.
Deviations from the mean precessional motion are considered. It is shown that
these deviations result in periodic motions as long as the time scales
associated to them are comparable to the remaining time scales. Otherwise, they
result in misalignment motions, forcing the plane of the disk to become normal
to the orbital plane of the secondary.

mass degeneracy among its states, possibly allowing for two-body decays of a
heavier colored scalar to a lighter one and a gauge boson. We perform a
renormalization group analysis of these couplings and find that limits from
Tevatron searches leave little room for these decays. This fact, and the
assumption of minimal flavor violation, lead us to study the case where the
octets decay to the heaviest kinematically accessible fermion pairs. Focusing
on pair-production events leading to (t t-bar t t-bar), (b b-bar b b-bar), and

exclusively associated with very massive (M>~10^{13} M_sun)haloes, comparable
to those which locally host groups-to-clusters of galaxies, and are very common
within such (rare) structures. Conversely, lower-z galaxies are found to reside
in smaller halos (M_min~10^{12} M_sun) and to be very rare in such systems.
While recent studies have determined a strong evolution of the 24um luminosity
function between z~2 and z~0, they cannot provide information on the physical
nature of such an evolution. Our clustering results instead indicate that this
is due to the presence of different populations of objects inhabiting different
structures, as active systems at z<~1.5 are found to be exclusively associated
with low-mass galaxies, while very massive sources appear to have concluded
their active phase before this epoch. Finally, we note that the small-scale
clustering data seem to require steep profiles for the distribution of galaxies
within their halos. This is suggestive of close encounters and/or mergers which
could strongly favour both AGN and star-formation activity.

the lensing of gravitational waves, the long wavelength, compared with the
usual case of optical lensing, can lead to the geometrical optics approximation
being invalid, in which case a wave optical solution is necessary. In general,
wave optical solutions can only be obtained numerically. We describe a
computational method that is particularly well suited to numerical wave optics.
This method enables us to compare the properties of several lens models for
globular clusters without ever calling upon the geometrical optics
approximation, though that approximation would sometimes have been valid.
Finally, we estimate the probability that lensing by a globular cluster will
significantly affect the detection, by ground-based laser interferometer
detectors such as LIGO, of gravitational waves from an asymmetric neutron star
in our galaxy, finding that the probability is insignificantly small.

varies with GC color even within the red peak of the typical bimodal cluster

the effect of an adiabatic passage, conventionally achieved with a single

transfer to the target state. The effect is demonstrated experimentally by
observing piecewise excitation of Rubidium atoms from 5s_1/2 to 5p_1/2
electronic state. We show that similarly to the conventional adiabatic passage,
the piecewise process is insensitive to the total excitation energy as long as
the adiabaticity conditions are satisfied. The piecewise nature of the process
suggests that robust and selective population transfer could be implemented in
a variety of complex quantum systems beyond the two-level approximation.

in the inner regions and hence appears ruled out. Dark matter becomes
significant by the half-light radius and becomes increasingly dominant at

with the mass of the host galaxy. If CMOs formed in (progenitor) galaxies with
n ~ 1, we predict a mass fraction of ~ 0.1-0.5%, consistent with observations

mixing can be activated. Mixing has the greatest impact when the buoyancy at
the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes is overcome.
This occurs preferentially at high accretion rates or low spin frequencies and
may depend on the ash composition from the previous burst. We then find two new
regimes of burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of
heavier elements with recurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes, similar to
short recurrence time bursts. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second
regime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably,
quenching X-ray bursts altogether. The carbon-rich material produced by stable

blue disk galaxies that subsequently had their star formation quenched. Since
red-sequence galaxies typically have an early-type morphology, the transition
from the blue to the red sequence also involves a morphological transformation.
In this paper we study the impact of transformation mechanisms that operate
only on satellite galaxies, such as strangulation, ram-pressure stripping and
galaxy harassment. Using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the
SDSS, we compare the colors and concentrations of satellites galaxies to those
of central galaxies of the same stellar mass, adopting the hypothesis that the
latter are the progenitors of the former. On average, satellites are redder and
more concentrated than central galaxies of the same stellar mass.
Central-satellite pairs that are matched in both stellar mass and color,
however, show no average concentration difference, indicating that the
transformation mechanisms affect color more than morphology. The color and
concentration differences of matched central-satellite pairs are completely
independent of the halo mass of the satellite galaxy, indicating that
satellite-specific transformation mechanisms are equally efficient in haloes of
all masses. This strongly favors strangulation as the main quenching mechanism
for satellite galaxies. Finally, we determine the relative importance of
satellite quenching for the build-up of the red sequence. We find that roughly
70 percent of red sequence satellite galaxies with a stellar mass of 10^9 Msun
had their star formation quenched as satellites. This drops rapidly to zero
with increasing stellar mass, indicating that a significant fraction of red
satellites were already quenched before they became a satellite.

Models of stellar evolution have difficulty producing black holes in close

the most massive stellar black holes known so all have masses within 1 sigma of
10 solar masses. Here we report a mass of 15.65 +/- 1.45 solar masses for the

star must have retained much of its outer envelope until after helium fusion in
the core was completed. On the other hand, in order for the black hole to be in
its present 3.45 day orbit about its 70.0 +/- 6.9 solar mass companion, there
must have been a ``common envelope'' phase of evolution in which a significant
amount of mass was lost from the system. We find the common envelope phase

established from the models of Mattila et al. which, when coupled with the

out progenitor systems for these supernovae with secondaries close enough to
the white dwarf to be experiencing Roche lobe overflow at the time of

nonlinear optical spectroscopy. Short pulses enable direct observation of fast
molecular dynamics, whereas broad spectral bandwidth offers ways of controlling
nonlinear optical processes by means of quantum interferences. Special care is
usually taken to preserve the coherence of laser pulses as it determines the
accuracy of a spectroscopic measurement. Here we present a new approach to
coherent Raman spectroscopy based on deliberately introduced noise, which
increases the spectral resolution, robustness and efficiency. We probe laser
induced molecular vibrations using a broadband laser pulse with intentionally
randomized amplitude and phase. The vibrational resonances result in and are
identified through the appearance of intensity correlations in the noisy
spectrum of coherently scattered photons. Spectral resolution is neither
limited by the pulse bandwidth, nor sensitive to the quality of the temporal
and spectral profile of the pulses. This is particularly attractive for the
applications in microscopy, biological imaging and remote sensing, where
dispersion and scattering properties of the medium often undermine the
applicability of ultrafast lasers. The proposed method combines the efficiency
and resolution of a coherent process with the robustness of incoherent light.
As we demonstrate here, it can be implemented by simply destroying the
coherence of a laser pulse, and without any elaborate temporal scanning or
spectral shaping commonly required by the frequency-resolved spectroscopic
methods with ultrashort pulses.

always the cusp of the steepest progenitor is preserved. We model each merger
progenitor with an effective number of particles of approximately 10^8

approximately doubles whereas in the cusp-cusp case the central density only
increases by approximately 50%. This may suggest that the central region of

absorbed, high temperature bremsstrahlung model the flux limits are 3.2E-16

conservative model assumptions and a 10 km/s wind speed, we derive a mass loss

non-detection of Halpha lines from other SNe Ia. Two other objects, SN 2002ic

flux upper limits are ~4 times below predictions of the interaction model
currently favored to explain the bright optical emission. To resolve this
discrepancy we invoke the mixing of cool dense ejecta fragments into the
forward shock region, which produces increased X-ray absorption. A modest
amount of mixing allows us to accommodate the Chandra upper limit. SN 2005gj is
less well studied at this time. Assuming the same circumstellar environment as
for SN 2002i, the X-ray flux upper limits for SN 2005gj are ~4 times below the

also occurred here. Our reanalysis of Swift and Chandra data on SN 2005ke does

well as the M20 and GINI parameters have become popular to automatically
classify distant galaxies in images. Ellipticals, spirals and irregular
galaxies all appear to occupy different regions of this parameter space. At the
same time, the Source Extractor (SE) program has become the mainstay to produce
ob ject catalogs from large image surveys. A logical next step would be to
incorporate the structural parameters into the Source Extractor software. There
are however several problems that arise: 1) the CAS parameters are fits to the
images and Source Extractor eschews fits in the interest of speed, 2) the
definition of the structural parameters changed over time. Now that there is a
clear and agreed-upon definition of the structural parameters, I am
incorporating computed versions in the Source Extractor code (v2.5). The fitted
CAS parameters are available for the GOODS-N/S fields and I compare the
computed structural parameters to those found by the previous fits. My goal is
to expand the source structure information in Source Extractor catalogs in
order to improve automatic identification of sources, specifically of distant
galaxies. The computed parameters perform reasonably close to the fitted
versions but noise appears in faint ob jects due to a lack of information. For
a subset of objects, the asymmetry signal is outside the SE boundaries and
Smoothness still fails to compute for many ob jects. Type classification based
on the SE parameters still lacks resolving power.

the small family of V838 Mon-like objects, whose nature is still a mystery.
This event took place in the Virgo cluster of galaxies and peaked at an
absolute magnitude of I~-13. Here we present Hubble Space Telescope images of
M85 OT 2006-1 and its environment, taken before and after the eruption, along
with a spectrum of the host galaxy at the transient location. We find that the
progenitor of M85 OT 2006-1 was not associated with any star forming region.
The g and z-band absolute magnitudes of the progenitor were fainter than about
-4 and -6 mag, respectively. Therefore, we can set a lower limit of ~50 Myr on
the age of the youngest stars at the location of the progenitor that
corresponds to a mass of <7 solar mass. Previously published line indices
suggest that M85 has a mean stellar age of 1.6+/-0.3 Gyr. If this mean age is
representative of the progenitor of M85 OT 2006-1, then we can further
constrain its mass to be less than 2 solar mass. We compare the energetics and
mass limit derived for the M85 OT 2006-1 progenitor with those expected from a
simple model of violent stellar mergers. Combined with further modeling, these
new clues may ultimately reveal the true nature of these puzzling events.

decay of the orientational correlation by random but large amplitude molecular
jumps, as opposed to infinitesimal small jumps assumed in Brownian diffusion.
Recent computer simulation studies on water and supercooled liquids have shown
that large amplitude motions may indeed be more of a rule than exception.
Existing theoretical studies on jump diffusion mostly assume an exponential
(Poissonian) waiting time distribution for jumps, thereby again leading to an
exponential decay. Here we extend the existing formalism of Ivanov and Anderson
to include an algebraic waiting time distribution between two jumps. As a
result, the first and second rank orientational time correlation functions show
the same long time power law, but their short time decay behavior is quite
different. The predicted Cole-Cole plot of dielectric relaxation reproduces
various features of non-Debye behaviour observed experimentally. We also
developed a theory where both unrestricted small jumps and large angular jumps
coexist simultaneously. The small jumps are shown to have a large effect on the
long time decay, particularly in mitigating the effects of algebraic waiting
time distribution, and in giving rise to an exponential-like decay, with a time
constant, surprisingly, less than the time constant that arises from small
amplitude decay alone.

maps--that describe chaotic interactions between colliding solitary waves. The
chaotic behavior of such solitary wave collisions depends on the transfer of
energy to a secondary mode of oscillation, often an internal mode of the pulse.
Unlike previous analyses, this map allows one to understand the interactions in
the case when this mode is excited prior to the first collision. The map is
derived using Melnikov integrals and matched asymptotic expansions and
generalizes a ``multi-pulse'' Melnikov integral and allows one to find not only
multipulse heteroclinic orbits, but exotic periodic orbits. The family of maps
derived exhibits singular behavior, including regions of infinite winding. This
problem is shown to be a singular version of the conservative Ikeda map from

derivation of existence proofs and computational techniques for calculating

where the new field variables are expected to reduce to those of the
Cho-Faddeev-Niemi- Shabanov decomposition in the continuum limit. By
introducing a new variable, say color field, carrying the color direction with
it, this formulation enables us to restore and maintain color symmetry that was
lost in the conventional MA gauge due to the naive separation of the gauge
potential into diagonal and off-diagonal components. An advantage of this
formulation is that we can define gaugeinvariant magnetic monopoles without
relying on specific gauges to investigate quark confinement from the viewpoint
of dual superconductivity. In this talk, we will present the relevant lattice
formulation to realize the above advantages and preliminary results of
numerical simulations to demonstrate the validity of this formulation. This
SU(3) formulation is an extension of the SU(2) version already proposed by us

slope of the low-mass stellar global mass function (GMF) of globular clusters

logarithmic ratio of tidal and core radii. This result is based on the analysis
of a sample of twenty Galactic GCs, with solid GMF measurements from deep HST
or VLT data, representative of the entire population of Milky Way GCs. While
all high-concentration clusters in the sample have a steep GMF,
low-concentration clusters tend to have a flatter GMF implying that they have
lost many stars via evaporation or tidal stripping. No GCs are found with a
flat GMF and high central concentration. This finding appears
counter-intuitive, since the same two-body relaxation mechanism that causes
stars to evaporate and the cluster to eventually dissolve should also lead to
higher central density and possibly core-collapse. Therefore, severely depleted
GCs should be in a post core-collapse state, contrary to what is suggested by
their low concentration. Several hypotheses can be put forth to explain the
observed trend, none of which however seems completely satisfactory. It is
likely that GCs with a flat GMF have a much denser and smaller core than
suggested by their surface brightness profile and may well be undergoing
collapse at present. It is, therefore, likely that the number of post

order parameter as the average length of the loops at equilibrium. This order
parameter exhibits a sharp increase as the mass is decreased through a critical
value, the behaviour seems to be a cross-over transition. We believe that the
model represents an effective description of the broken-symmetry sector of the
2+1 dimensional abelian Higgs model, in the extreme strong coupling limit. The
massive gauge bosons and the neutral scalars are decoupled, and the relevant
low-lying excitations correspond to vortices and anti-vortices. The functional
integral can be approximated by a sum over simple, closed vortex loop
configurations. We present a novel fashion to generate non-intersecting closed
loops, starting from a tetrahedral tessellation of three space. The two phases
that we find admit the following interpretation: the usual Higgs phase and a
novel phase which is heralded by the appearance of effectively infinitely long
loops. We compute the expectation value of the Wilson loop operator and that of
the Polyakov loop operator. The Wilson loop exhibits perimeter law behaviour in
both phases implying that the transition corresponds neither to the restoration
of symmetry nor to confinement. The effective interaction between external
charges is screened in both phases, however there is a dramatic increase in the
polarization cloud in the novel phase as shown by the energy shift introduced

that this energy is not zero, for elementary particles as well as for
macroscopic spheres. The calculation is presented in this article.
  This leads to a principle problem not being answered up to now: From where

computer simulations performed on the Rotne-Prager level of the mobility

the latter case the Oseen contribution to the mobility tensor is screened due
to the opposite motion of counterions. The simulation results are compared to
that resulting from simple Brownian dynamics where hydrodynamic interactions
are neglected. For sedimentation, we find that hydrodynamic interactions
strongly disfavor laning. In the steady-state of lanes, a macroscopic phase
separation of lanes is observed. This is in marked contrast to the simple
Brownian case where a finite size of lanes was obtained in the steady-state.
For strong Coulomb interactions between the colloidal particles a lateral
square lattice of oppositely driven lanes is stable similar to the simple
Brownian dynamics. In an electric field, on the other hand, the behavior is
found in qualitative and quantitative accordance with the case of neglected

classes of non-Gaussian states of the radiation field as entangled resources.
First, we introduce the class two-mode squeezed symmetric superposition of Fock
states, including finite truncations of twin-beam Gaussian states as special
realizations. These states depend on a set of free independent parameters that
can be adjusted for the optimization of teleportation protocols, with an
enhancement of the success probability of teleportation both for coherent and
Fock input states. We show that the optimization procedure reduces the
entangled resources to truncated twin beam states, which thus represents an
optimal class of non-Gaussian resources for quantum teleportation. We then
introduce a further class of two-mode non-Gaussian entangled resources, in the
form of squeezed cat-like states. We analyze the performance and the properties
of such states when optimized for (CV) teleportation, and compare them to the
optimized squeezed Bell-like states introduced in a previous work
\cite{CVTelepNoi}. We discuss how optimal resources for teleportation are
characterized by a suitable balance of entanglement content and squeezed vacuum
affinity. We finally investigate the effects of thermal noise on the efficiency
of quantum teleportation. To this aim, a convenient framework is to describe
noisy entangled resources as linear superpositions of non-Gaussian state and
thermal states. Although the presence of the thermal component strongly reduces
the teleportation fidelity, noisy non-Gaussian states remain preferred
resources when compared to noisy twin-beam Gaussian states.

no contact angle hysteresis due to strong thermal fluctuations, which occur at

there is strong contact angle hysteresis due to higher energy barrier. These

on homogeneous traffic consisting solely of either delay-constrained data

this paper, we investigate the resource allocation problem in a heterogeneous
multiuser OFDM system with both delay-constrained (DC) and
non-delay-constrained (NDC) traffic. The objective is to maximize the sum-rate
of all the users with NDC traffic while maintaining guaranteed rates for the
users with DC traffic under a total transmit power constraint. Through our
analysis we show that the optimal power allocation over subcarriers follows a
multi-level water-filling principle; moreover, the valid candidates competing
for each subcarrier include only one NDC user but all DC users. By converting
this combinatorial problem with exponential complexity into a convex problem or
showing that it can be solved in the dual domain, efficient iterative
algorithms are proposed to find the optimal solutions. To further reduce the
computational cost, a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm is also developed.
Numerical studies are conducted to evaluate the performance the proposed
algorithms in terms of service outage probability, achievable transmission rate
pairs for DC and NDC traffic, and multiuser diversity.

homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow is considered. Within a simple model of
advection and condensation, the dynamics and growth of millions of droplets are
integrated. A droplet-size spectra broadening is obtained and it is shown to
increase with the Reynolds number of turbulence, by means of two series of
direct numerical simulations at increasing resolution. This is a key point
towards a proper evaluation of the effects of turbulence for condensation in
warm clouds, where the Reynolds numbers typically achieve huge values. The
obtained droplet-size spectra broadening as a function of the Reynolds number
is shown to be consistent with dimensional arguments. A generalization of this
expectation to Reynolds numbers not accessible by DNS is proposed, yielding
upper and lower bounds to the actual size-spectra broadening. A further DNS
matching the large scales of the system suggests consistency of the picture
drawn, while additional effort is needed to evaluate the impact of this effect
for condensation in more realistic cloud conditions.

Type I errors with relatively high power for multiple hypothesis testing. The
Benjamini--Hochberg (BH) procedure is a well-known FDR controlling procedure.
Under a random effects model, we show that, in general, unlike the FDR, the
positive FDR (pFDR) of the BH procedure cannot be controlled at an arbitrarily
low level due to the limited evidence provided by the observations to separate
false and true nulls. This results in a criticality phenomenon, which is
characterized by a transition of the procedure's power from being positive to
asymptotically 0 without any reduction in the pFDR, once the target FDR control
level is below a positive critical value. To address the constraints on the
power and pFDR control imposed by the criticality phenomenon, we propose a
procedure which applies BH-type procedures at multiple locations in the domain
of $p$-values. Both analysis and simulations show that the proposed procedure
can attain substantially improved power and pFDR control.

the unidentified infrared bands (UIR, UIB) that are observed in emission from
many objects in space. From stimulated emission studies in RM, a slightly
simpler theoretical model is found that describes the transitions giving the
UIR bands better. The general theory for RM was recently shown to be very
accurate using rotational spectroscopy to observe several types of RM clusters
(Mol. Phys. 105 (2007) 933). Two different large studies of UIR are now
interpreted with the improved model. High-resolution UIR observations by
Beintema et al. are interpreted as transitions from high levels n = 40 - 80
down to levels n = 5 - 12 in the final state. The upper level quantum numbers
for the observed bands agree well with those found in experiments. The
stationary UIR bands at 3.3 and 11.3 micrometer are due to deexcitation n = 9
-> 5 and 9 -> 7 of Rydberg species through stimulated emission. The other UIR
bands vary considerably in wavelength in different environments and even with
time as seen in numerous observational studies. Their great variability is
difficult to model by the commonly used PAH model, but is a natural consequence
of the varying excitation state of RM.

by scattering. In scattering materials, such as powders, disordered
metamaterials or biological tissue, multiple scattering on sub-wavelength
particles makes light diffuse. Recently, we showed that it is possible to
construct a wavefront that focuses through a solid, strongly scattering object.
The focusing wavefront uniquely matches a certain configuration of the
particles in the medium. To focus light through a turbid liquid or living
tissue, it is necessary to dynamically adjust the wavefront as the particles in
the medium move. Here we present three algorithms for constructing a wavefront
that focuses through a scattering medium. We analyze the dynamic behavior of
these algorithms and compare their sensitivity to measurement noise. The
algorithms are compared both experimentally and using numerical simulations.
The results are in good agreement with an intuitive model, which may be used to
develop dynamic diffusion compensators with applications in, for example, light
delivery in human tissue.

distribution. We thus introduce a model of partially random networks with a
broad degree distribution, where self-averaging due to size growth is absent.
In this case, the regime of global firing persists for large sizes. Our results
extend previous work on the constructive effects of diversity in the collective

an interior instability arising from the production of electron-positron pairs.
This ""pair instability"" leads to explosive burning that is insufficient to
unbind the star, but ejects many solar masses of the envelope. After the first
explosion, the remaining core contracts and searches for a stable burning
state. When the next explosion occurs, several solar masses of material are
again ejected, which collide with the earlier ejecta. This collision can
radiate 1E50 erg of light, about a factor of ten more than an ordinary

a function of the strain rate. Interestingly, the exponents of these quantities
violate the linear superposition principle, indicating a nonlinear response. We
propose that this is due to breaking of a fraction of the crosslinks during the
deformation process. The Soft Glassy Rheology Model accounts for the relation

  small-scale flux tubes","22 pages 6 color figures, submitted to Solar Physics, proceeding of
  SOHO 19/ GONG 2007 meeting, Melbourne, Australia",,"10.1007/s11207-008-9133-8",,"astro-ph",,"  We present results of non-linear, 2D, numerical simulations of
magneto-acoustic wave propagation in the photosphere and chromosphere of
small-scale flux tubes with internal structure. Waves with realistic periods of
three to five minutes are studied, after applying horizontal and vertical
oscillatory perturbations to the equilibrium model. Spurious reflections of
shock waves from the upper boundary are minimized thanks to a special boundary
condition. This has allowed us to increase the duration of the simulations and
to make it long enough to perform a statistical analysis of oscillations. The
simulations show that deep horizontal motions of the flux tube generate a slow
(magnetic) mode and a surface mode. These modes are efficiently transformed
into a slow (acoustic) mode in the vA < cS atmosphere. The slow (acoustic) mode
propagates vertically along the field lines, forms shocks and remains always
within the flux tube. It might deposit effectively the energy of the driver
into the chromosphere. When the driver oscillates with a high frequency, above
the cut-off, non-linear wave propagation occurs with the same dominant driver
period at all heights. At low frequencies, below the cut-off, the dominant
period of oscillations changes with height from that of the driver in the
photosphere to its first harmonic (half period) in the chromosphere. Depending
on the period and on the type of the driver, different shock patterns are
observed.
