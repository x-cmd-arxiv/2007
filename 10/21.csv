excitons in a strong magnetic field. We show that, in the presence of an
in-plane field component, the excitonic absorption spectrum develops a
double-peak structure due to hybridization of bright and dark magnetoexcitons.
If the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit constants are comparable, the
magnitude of splitting can be tuned in a wide interval by varying the azimuthal
angle of the in-plane field. We also show that the interplay between spin-orbit
and Coulomb interactions leads to an anisotropy of exciton energy dispersion in
the momentum plane. The results suggest a way for direct optical measurements
of spin-orbit parameters.

computing gravitational waveforms of non-spinning, equal-mass black-hole
binaries. We consider three sequences of simulations, starting with a
quasi-circular inspiral completing 1.5, 2.3 and 9.6 orbits, respectively, prior
to coalescence of the holes. For each sequence, the binding energy of the
system is kept constant and the orbital angular momentum is progressively
reduced, producing orbits of increasing eccentricity and eventually a head-on
collision. We analyze in detail the radiation of energy and angular momentum in
gravitational waves, the contribution of different multipolar components and
the final spin of the remnant. We find that the motion transitions from
inspiral to plunge when the orbital angular momentum L=L_crit is about 0.8M^2.
For L<L_crit the radiated energy drops very rapidly. Orbits with L of about
L_crit produce our largest dimensionless Kerr parameter for the remnant,
j=J/M^2=0.724. Generalizing a model recently proposed by Buonanno, Kidder and
Lehner to eccentric binaries, we conjecture that (1) j=0.724 is the maximal
Kerr parameter that can be obtained by any merger of non-spinning holes, and
(2) no binary merger (even if the binary members are extremal Kerr black holes
with spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum, and the inspiral is highly
eccentric) can violate the cosmic censorship conjecture.

between fermions, the system will exhibit spin-3/2 antiferromagnetic order at

context of autonomous map pseudomonoids. We concentrate in the Hopf modules and
the Centre or Drinfel'd double. If $A$ is a map pseudomonoid in a monoidal
bicategory \M, the analogue of the category of Hopf modules for $A$ is an
Eilenberg-Moore construction for a certain monad in
$\mathbf{Hom}(\M^{\mathrm{op}},\mathbf{Cat})$. We study the existence of the
internalisation of this notion, called the Hopf module construction, by
extending the completion under Eilenberg-Moore objects of a 2-category to a
endo-homomorphism of tricategories on $\mathbf{Bicat}$.
  Our main result is the equivalence between the existence of a left
dualization for $A$ ({\em i.e.}, $A$ is left autonomous) and the validity of an
analogue of the structure theorem of Hopf modules. In this case the Hopf module
construction for $A$ always exists.
  We use these results to study the lax centre of a left autonomous map
pseudomonoid. We show that the lax centre is the Eilenberg-Moore construction
for a certain monad on $A$ (one existing if the other does). If $A$ is also
right autonomous, then the lax centre equals the centre. We look at the
examples of the bicategories of \V-modules and of comodules in \V, and obtain
the Drinfel'd double of a coquasi-Hopf algebra $H$ as the centre of $H$.

different populations of black-hole binaries; two invoke stellar-mass (~10
Msun) black hole accretors, and the third utilizes intermediate-mass (~1000
Msun) black holes (IMBHs). For each of the three populations, we computed
30,000 binary evolution sequences using a full Henyey stellar evolution code.
The optical flux from the model ULXs includes contributions from the accretion
disk, due to x-ray irradiation as well as intrinsic viscous heating, and that
due to the donor star. We present ""probability images"" for the ULX systems in
planes of color-magnitude, orbital period vs. X-ray luminosity, and luminosity
vs. evolution time. Estimates of the numbers of ULXs in a typical galaxy as

are compared with six ULX counterparts that have been discussed in the

systems with very high-mass donors (> ~25 Msun) in binaries with IMBH
accretors. However, significant difficulties remain with both the IMBH and
stellar-mass black hole models.

cells, altered cells, adaptive and innate immune cells, and pathogens. We study
four regimes obtained with or without auto-immune disorder and with or without

seven different states are naturally described by the model: (i) strong healthy
immune system, (ii) healthy organism with evanescent immune cells, (iii)

causes generation of large-scale vorticity. Three types of the background
large-scale flows are considered, i.e., the Couette and Poiseuille flows in a
small-scale homogeneous turbulence, and the ""log-linear"" velocity shear in an
inhomogeneous turbulence. It is known that laminar plane Couette flow and
antisymmetric mode of laminar plane Poiseuille flow are stable with respect to
small perturbations for any Reynolds numbers. We demonstrate that in a
small-scale turbulence under certain conditions the large-scale Couette and
Poiseuille flows are unstable due to the large-scale instability. This
instability causes formation of large-scale vortical structures stretched along
the mean sheared velocity. The growth rate of the large-scale instability for
the ""log-linear"" velocity shear is much larger than that for the Couette and
Poiseuille background flows. We have found a turbulent analogue of the
Tollmien-Schlichting waves in a small-scale sheared turbulence. A mechanism of
excitation of turbulent Tollmien-Schlichting waves is associated with a
combined effect of the turbulent Reynolds stress-induced generation of
perturbations of the mean vorticity and the background sheared motions. These
waves can be excited even in a plane Couette flow imposed on a small-scale
turbulence when perturbations of mean velocity depend on three spatial
coordinates. The energy of these waves is supplied by the small-scale sheared
turbulence.

able to produce faint but extended gaseous tails. Such low-mass, starless,
tidal debris may become detached and appear as free floating clouds in the very
deep HI surveys that are currently being carried out. We show in this paper
that these debris possess the same apparent properties as the so-called ""Dark
Galaxies"", objects originally detected in HI, with no optical counterpart, and
presumably dark matter dominated. We present a numerical model of the prototype
of such Dark Galaxies - VirgoHI21 -, that is able to reproduce its main
characteristics: the one-sided tail linking it to the spiral galaxy NGC 4254,
the absence of stars, and above all the reversal of the velocity gradient along
the tail originally attributed to rotation motions caused by a massive dark
matter halo and which we find to be consistent with simple streaming motions
plus projection effects. According to our numerical simulations, this tidal
debris was expelled 750 Myr ago during a fly-by at 1100 km/s of NGC 4254 by a
massive companion which should now lie at a projected distance of about 400
kpc. A candidate for the intruder is discussed. The existence of galaxies that
have never been able to form stars had already been challenged based on
theoretical and observational grounds. Tidal collisions, in particular those
occurring at high speed, provide a much more simple explanation for the origin
of such putative Dark Galaxies.

formation of vortices. Once formed, these vortices essentially survive forever.
What happens in three dimensions? We show with pseudospectral simulations that
in 3D a vortex in a short box forms and survives just as in 2D. But a vortex in
a tall box is unstable and is destroyed. In our simulation, the unstable vortex
decays into a transient turbulent-like state that transports angular momentum
outward at a nearly constant rate for hundreds of orbital times. The 3D
instability that destroys vortices is a generalization of the 2D instability
that forms them. We derive the conditions for these nonlinear instabilities to
act by calculating the coupling between linear modes, and thereby derive the
criterion for a vortex to survive in 3D as it does in 2D: the azimuthal extent
of the vortex must be larger than the scale height of the accretion disk. When
this criterion is violated, the vortex is unstable and decays. Because vortices
are longer in azimuthal than in radial extent by a factor that is inversely
proportional to their excess vorticity, a vortex with given radial extent will
only survive in a 3D disk if it is sufficiently weak. This counterintuitive
result explains why previous 3D simulations always yielded decaying vortices:
their vortices were too strong. We conclude that in protoplanetary disks weak
vortices can trap dust and serve as the nurseries of planet formation. Decaying
strong vortices might be responsible for the outwards transport of angular
momentum that is required to make accretion disks accrete.

Soft Leptogenesis. It has been usually assumed that the initial state is a
statistical mixture of sterile sneutrinos and anti-sneutrinos with equal
abundances. We calculate the lepton asymmetry due to the most general initial
mixture. The usually assumed equal mixture produces a small, but sufficient,
lepton asymmetry which is proportional to the ratio of the supersymmetry
breaking scale over the Majorana scale. A more generic mixture, still with
equal contents of sneutrinos and anti sneutrinos, yields an unsuppressed lepton
asymmetry. Mixtures of non equal contents of sneutrinos and anti sneutrinos
result in a large lepton asymmetry too. While these results establish the

The use of such technology however poses the problem of protection against

major problem of this method of protection resides in finding the optimal set
of p-cycles which protect the network for a given distribution of working
capacity. Existing heuristics generate a large set of p-cycle candidates which
are entirely independent of the network state, and from then the good sub-set
of p-cycles which will protect the network is selected. In this paper, we
propose a new algorithm of generation of p-cycles based on the incremental
aggregation of the shortest cycles. Our generation of p-cycles depends on the
state of the network. This enables us to choose an efficient set of p-cycles
which will protect the network. The set of p-cycles that we generate is the
final set which will protect the network, in other words our heuristic does not
go through the additional step of p-cycle selection

introduced the concept of Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes, and suggested
a simple decoding algorithm based on message passing. In 1994 Alon and Kahale
exhibited a coloring algorithm and proved its usefulness for finding a
$k$-coloring of graphs drawn from a certain planted-solution distribution over
$k$-colorable graphs. In this work we show an interpretation of Alon and
Kahale's coloring algorithm in light of Gallager's decoding algorithm, thus
showing a connection between the two problems - coloring and decoding. This

effects. Here we establish the complementarity of the electric, magnetic and
photon fields in driving an insulator-metal transition in epitaxial thin films
of La$_{0.175}$Pr$_{0.45}$Ca$_{0.375}$MnO$_{3}$ whose electrical ground state
is insulating. Both pulsed and CW lasers cause a giant photon flux dependent
enhancement of conductivity. It is further observed that electric and magnetic
fields trigger the persistent enhancement of conductivity whose magnitude can
be accentuated by application of these fields in parallel.

magnetic field in a sheared turbulent plasma is presented. This mechanism is
associated with the shear-current effect which is related to the W x J-term in
the mean electromotive force. This effect causes the generation of the
large-scale magnetic field even in a nonrotating and nonhelical homogeneous
sheared turbulent convection whereby the alpha effect vanishes. It is found
that turbulent convection promotes the shear-current dynamo instability, i.e.,
the heat flux causes positive contribution to the shear-current effect.
However, there is no dynamo action due to the shear-current effect for small
hydrodynamic and magnetic Reynolds numbers even in a turbulent convection, if
the spatial scaling for the turbulent correlation time is k^{-2}, where k is
the small-scale wave number. We discuss here also the nonlinear mean-field
dynamo due to the shear-current effect and take into account the transport of
magnetic helicity as a dynamical nonlinearity. The magnetic helicity flux
strongly affects the magnetic field dynamics in the nonlinear stage of the
dynamo action. When the magnetic helicity flux is not small, the saturated
level of the mean magnetic field is of the order of the equipartition field
determined by the turbulent kinetic energy. The obtained results are important
for elucidation of origin of the large-scale magnetic fields in astrophysical
and cosmic sheared turbulent plasma.

understand the emergence of ferromagnetism in finite magnetic systems starting
from microscopic models without phenomenological on-site barriers. Here we
study its relevance for finite systems with long range interacting potential in
contact with a thermal bath. We show that, even in this case, the induced
magnetic reversal time is exponentially large in the number of spins, thus
determining {\it stable} (to any experimental observation time) ferromagnetic
behavior. Moreover, the explicit temperature dependence of the magnetic
reversal time obtained from the microcanonical results, is found to be in good
agreement with numerical simulations. Also, a simple and suggestive expression,
indicating the Topological Energy Threshold at which the disconnection occurs,
as a real energy barrier for many body systems, is obtained analytically for
low temperature.

qualitative predictions for the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of
multiplicity fluctuations. The resulting effects are of similar magnitude as
the predicted enhancement due to a phase transition from a quark-gluon plasma
to a hadron gas phase, or due to the critical point of strongly interacting
matter, and qualitatively agree with recently published preliminary
multiplicity fluctuation data of the NA49 SPS experiment.

interpretations are not routinely investigated.
  Results. We describe efficient loop sampling procedures in Rappertk and
demonstrate that single loops in proteins can be automatically and accurately
modelled with few positional restraints. Loops constructed with a composite
CNS/Rappertk protocol consistently have better Rfree than those with CNS alone.
This approach is extended to a more realistic scenario where there are often
large positional uncertainties in loops along with small imperfections in the
secondary structural framework. Both ensemble and collection methods are used
to estimate the structural heterogeneity of loop regions.
  Conclusion. Apart from benchmarking Rappertk for the all-atom protein
refinement task, this work also demonstrates its utility in both aspects of
loop modelling - building a single conformer and estimating structural
heterogeneity the loops can exhibit.
