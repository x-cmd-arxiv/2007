Faraday's law of induction implies that the time-varying distance between the

induces time-varying electrical currents, which are the source of an
electromagnetic wave at the same frequency as the incident gravitational wave.
At sufficiently low temperatures, the internal degrees of freedom of the
superconductors are frozen out because of the superconducting energy gap, and
only external degrees of freedom, which are coupled to the radiation fields,
remain. Hence this wave-conversion process is loss-free and therefore
efficient, and by time-reversal symmetry, so is the reverse process. A
Hertz-like experiment at microwave frequencies should therefore be practical to
perform. This would open up observations of the gravitational-wave analog of
the Cosmic Microwave Background from the extremely early Big Bang, and also

distribution at the Earth using our previously developed method. The source
number density that can best reproduce observational results by Akeno Giant Air
Shower Array is estimated at about $10^{-5} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ in a simple source
model. Despite having large uncertainties of about one order of magnitude, due
to small number of observed events in current status, we find that more
detection of UHECRs in the Auger era can sufficiently decrease this so that the
source number density can be more robustly estimated. 200 event observation
above $4 \times 10^{19} {\rm eV}$ in a hemisphere can discriminate between
$10^{-5}$ and $10^{-6} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$. Number of events to discriminate
between $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-5} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ is dependent on EGMF strength.

the smaller problem on those constraints, and the other performs a sparse
random projection and solves the smaller problem on those projected
coordinates. In both cases, solving the smaller problem provides relative-error

caused by evolved low-mass stars, in particular sdB stars. The stellar system
most similar to the ellipticals for age and metallicity, in which it is
possible to resolve these stars, is the bulge of our Galaxy. sdB star
candidates were observed in the color magnitude diagram of a bulge region by
Zoccali et al. (2003). The follow-up spectroscopic analysis of these stars
confirmed that most of these stars are bulge sdBs, while some candidates turned
out to be disk sdBs or cool stars. Both spectroscopic and photometric data and
a spectral library are used to construct the integrated spectrum of the
observed bulge region from the UV to the optical: the stars in the color
magnitude diagram are associated to the library spectra, on the basis of their
evolutionary status and temperature. The total integrated spectrum is obtained
as the sum of the spectra associated to the color magnitude diagram.
  The comparison of the obtained integrated spectrum with old single stellar
population synthetic spectra calculated by Bruzual & Charlot (2003) agrees with
age and metallicity of the bulge found by previous work. The bulge integrated
spectrum shows only a very weak UV excess, but a too strict selection of the

be overcome. For telescopes detecting atmospheric signatures of transiting

available samples are probably too small to guarantee detection of life-bearing

the Moon, new, more precise laser ranging applications will be demanded,
including continuous tracking from more sites on Earth, placing new CCR arrays
on the Moon, and possibly installing other devices such as transponders, etc.
Successful achievement of this goal strongly demands further significant
improvement of the theoretical model of the orbital and rotational dynamics of
the Earth-Moon system. This model should inevitably be based on the theory of
general relativity, fully incorporate the relevant geophysical processes, lunar
librations, tides, and should rely upon the most recent standards and
recommendations of the IAU for data analysis. This paper discusses methods and
problems in developing such a mathematical model. The model will take into
account all the classical and relativistic effects in the orbital and
rotational motion of the Moon and Earth at the sub-centimeter level. The new
model will allow us to navigate a spacecraft precisely to a location on the
Moon. It will also greatly improve our understanding of the structure of the
lunar interior and the nature of the physical interaction at the core-mantle
interface layer. The new theory and upcoming millimeter LLR will give us the
means to perform one of the most precise fundamental tests of general
relativity in the solar system.

suggest that the broad-line Halpha/Hbeta ratio can be used as a good indicator
for dust extinction in the AGN broad-line region; this is especially true for
radio-quiet AGN with regular emission-line profiles, which constitute the vast
majority of the AGN population.

calculated within quenched approximation using improved gauge and Wilson

and continuum extrapolation, we find that our quenched results for the
scattering phase shifts in this channel are consistent with the experimental
data when the three-momentum of the pion is below 300MeV. Agreement is also
found when compared with previous theoretical results from lattice and other
means. Moreover, with the usage of asymmetric volume, we are able to compute

detect mass segregation in extra-galactic clusters based on such a comparison.
Our results follow naturally from the fact that in nearly all filters most of
the light comes from the most massive stars. Therefore, the observed surface
brightness profile is dominated by stars of similar mass, which are centrally

short-hard bursts and long-soft bursts have been suggested. Based on the X-ray
afterglow observation and the cumulative red-shift distribution of short-hard

suggested after considering multiple characteristics of gamma-ray bursts,
including fluences and the duration time. In this work, we extended the
analysis of cumulative red-shift distribution to two possible subclasses in

conservatively approximate liveness by reachability from program variables. In
this paper, we describe a sequence of static analyses that takes as input a
program written in a first-order, eager functional programming language, and
finds at each program point the references to objects that are guaranteed not
to be used in the future. Such references are made null by a transformation
pass. If this makes the object unreachable, it can be collected by the garbage
collector. This causes more garbage to be collected, resulting in fewer
collections. Additionally, for those garbage collectors which scavenge live
objects, it makes each collection faster.
  The interesting aspects of our method are both in the identification of the
analyses required to solve the problem and the way they are carried out. We
identify three different analyses -- liveness, sharing and accessibility. In
liveness and sharing analyses, the function definitions are analyzed
independently of the calling context. This is achieved by using a variable to
represent the unknown context of the function being analyzed and setting up
constraints expressing the effect of the function with respect to the variable.
The solution of the constraints is a summary of the function that is
parameterized with respect to a calling context and is used to analyze function
calls. As a result we achieve context sensitivity at call sites without
analyzing the function multiple number of times.

horizontal branch (HB) morphology and post-HB stellar evolution including the
production of ultraviolet-bright stars, dredge up of nucleosynthesis products
and replenishment of the intra-cluster medium. Studies of mass loss in globular
clusters also allows one to investigate the metallicity dependence of the mass
loss from cool, low-mass stars down to very low metallicities.
  Aims: We present an analysis of new VLT/UVES spectra of 47 red giants in the
Galactic globular clusters 47 Tuc (NGC 104), NGC 362, omega Cen (NGC 5139), NGC
6388, M54 (NGC 6715) and M15 (NGC 7078). The spectra cover the wavelength
region 6100-9900A at a resolving power of R = 110,000. Some of these stars are
known to exhibit mid-infrared excess emission indicative of circumstellar dust.
Our aim is to detect signatures of mass loss, identify the mechanism(s)
responsible for such outflows, and measure the mass-loss rates.
  Methods: We determine for each star its effective temperature, luminosity,
radius and escape velocity. We analyse the H-alpha and near-infrared calcium
triplet lines for evidence of outflows, pulsation and chromospheric activity,
and present a simple model for estimating mass-loss rates from the H-alpha line
profile. We compare our results with a variety of other, independent methods.
  Results: We argue that a chromosphere persists in Galactic globular cluster
giants and controls the mass-loss rate to late-K/early-M spectral types, where
pulsation becomes strong enough to drive shock waves at luminosities above the
RGB tip. This transition may be metallicity-dependent. We find mass-loss rates
of ~10^-7 to 10^-5 solar masses per year, largely independent of metallicity.

with active and inactive galactic nuclei from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, in
the range 0.01 < z < 0.16. The SDSS galaxy catalogue was split into two classes
of active galaxies, Type~2 AGN and composites, and one set of inactive,
star-forming/passive galaxies. For each active galaxy, two inactive control
galaxies were selected by matching redshift, absolute magnitude, inclination,
and radius. The sample of inactive galaxies naturally divides into a red and a
blue sequence, while the vast majority of AGN hosts occur along the red
sequence. In terms of H-alpha equivalent width, the population of composite
galaxies peaks in the valley between the two modes, suggesting a transition
population. However, this effect is not observed in other properties such as
colour-magnitude space, or colour-concentration plane. Active galaxies are seen
to be generally bulge-dominated systems, but with enhanced H-alpha emission
compared to inactive red-sequence galaxies. AGN and composites also occur in
less dense environments than inactive red-sequence galaxies, implying that the
fuelling of AGN is more restricted in high-density environments. These results
are therefore inconsistent with theories in which AGN host galaxies are a
`transition' population. We also introduce a systematic 3D spectroscopic
imaging survey, to quantify and compare the gaseous and stellar kinematics of a
well-selected, distance-limited sample of up to 20 nearby Seyfert galaxies, and
20 inactive control galaxies with well-matched optical properties. The survey
aims to search for dynamical triggers of nuclear activity and address
outstanding controversies in optical/IR imaging surveys.

dynamics and chemical structure of dense molecular gas. The launch of Herschel
with on board HIFI and PACS allow to probe the behaviour of multiple water
lines with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution. Aims: we investigate the
diagnostic value of specific water transitions in high-mass star-forming
regions. As a test case, we apply our models to the AFGL2591 region. Results:
in general, for models with a constant water abundance, the ground state lines,
i.e., 1_(10)-1_(01), 1_(11)-0_(00), and 2_(12)-1_(01), are predicted in
absorption, all the others in emission. This behaviour changes for models with
a water abundance jump profile in that the line profiles for jumps by a factor
of ~10-100 are similar to the line shapes in the constant abundance models,
whereas larger jumps lead to emission profiles. Asymmetric line profiles are
found for models with a cavity outflow and depend on the inclination angle.
Models with an outflow cavity are favoured to reproduce the SWAS observations
of the 1_(10)-1_(01) ground-state transition. PACS spectra will tell us about
the geometry of these regions, both through the continuum and through the
lines. Conclusions: it is found that the low-lying transitions of water are
sensitive to outflow features, and represent the excitation conditions in the
outer regions. High-lying transitions are more sensitive to the adopted density
and temperature distribution which probe the inner excitation conditions. The
Herschel mission will thus be very helpful to constrain the physical and
chemical structure of high-mass star-forming regions such as AFGL2591.

the ground state. Regardless of the spatial distribution of the water
molecules, the H2O 1_{10}-1_{01} line at 557 GHz observed by the Submillimeter
Wave Astronomy Satellite (SWAS) is found to be pumped primarily through the
absorption of dust-emitted photons at 6 $\mu$m in the nu2 band. As noted by
previous authors, the inclusion of radiative pumping lowers the ortho-H2O
abundance required to account for the 557 GHz emission, which is found to be
(0.5-1)x10^{-7} if the presence of H2O is a consequence of vaporization of
orbiting comets or Fischer-Tropsch catalysis. Predictions for other

  Publishing Co",,"10.1142/9789812797049_0044",,"astro-ph",,"  We present the general relativistic calculation of the energy release
associated with a first order phase transition (PT) at the center of a rotating
neutron star (NS). The energy release, E_rel, is equal to the difference in
mass-energies between the initial (normal) phase configuration and the final
configuration containing a superdense matter core, assuming constant total
baryon number and the angular momentum. The calculations are performed with the
use of precise pseudo-spectral 2-D numerical code; the polytropic equations of
state (EOS) as well as realistic EOSs (Skyrme interactions, Mean Field Theory
kaon condensate) are used. The results are obtained for a broad range of
metastability of initial configuration and size of the new superdense phase
core in the final configuration. For a fixed ``overpressure'', dP, defined as
the relative excess of central pressure of a collapsing metastable star over
the pressure of the equilibrium first-order PT, the energy release up to
numerical accuracy does not depend on the stellar angular momentum and
coincides with that for nonrotating stars with the same dP. When the equatorial
radius of the superdense phase core is much smaller than the equatorial radius
of the star, analytical expressions for the E_rel can be obtained: E_rel is
proportional to dP^2.5 for small dP. At higher dP, the results of 1-D
calculations of E_rel(dP) for non-rotating stars reproduce with very high
precision exact 2-D results for fast-rotating stars. The energy release-angular
momentum independence for a given overpressure holds also for the so-called
``strong'' PTs (that destabilise the star against the axi-symmetric
perturbations), as well as for PTs with ``jumping'' over the energy barrier.

single brane-antibrane pair in the slow roll regime, we provide constraints on
the parameters of the theory imposed by measurements of the CMB anisotropies by
WMAP including a cosmic string component. We find that inclusion of the string
component is critical in constraining parameters. In the most general model
studied, which includes an inflaton mass term, as well as the brane-antibrane
attraction, values n_s < 1.02 are compatible with the data at 95 % confidence
level. We are also able to constrain the volume of internal manifold (modulo
factors dependent on the warp factor) and the value of the inflaton field to be
less than 0.66M_P at horizon exit. We also investigate models with a mass term.
These observational considerations suggest that such models have r < 2*10^-5,
which can only be circumvented in the fast roll regime, or by increasing the
number of antibranes. Such a value of r would not be detectable in CMB
polarization experiment likely in the near future, but the B-mode signal from
the cosmic strings could be detectable. We present forecasts of what a similar

rule out G\mu > 6.5*10^-8 using just the TT, TE and EE power spectra.

constrained, is of paramount importance for different aspects in modern
astrophysics. From an observational perspective, most of the studies up to now
have been done using white dwarfs in open clusters. In order to improve the
initial-final mass relationship we explore the possibility of deriving a
semi-empirical relation studying white dwarfs in common proper motion pairs. We
have acquired long-slit spectra of the white dwarf members of the selected
common proper motion pairs, as well as high resolution spectra of their
companions. From these observations, a full analysis of the two members of each
common proper motion pair has lead to the initial and final masses of the white
dwarfs. These observations have allowed us to provide updated information for
the white dwarfs, since some of them were misclassified. This work is the first
one in using common proper motion pairs to improve the initial-final mass
relationship, and has also allowed to cover the poorly explored low-mass
domain. As in the case of studies based on white dwarfs in open clusters, the
distribution of the semi-empirical data presents a large scatter, which is
higher than the expected uncertainties in the derived values. This suggests
that the initial-final mass relationship may not be a single-valued function.

Cartan formula, one-cocycles of the group of contactomorphisms, K(1), with
values in tensor densities F_\lambda(S^{1|1}). The even cross-ratio yields a
K(1) one-cocycle with values in quadratic differentials, Q(S^{1|1}), whose
projection on F_{3/2}(S^{1|1}) corresponds to the super Schwarzian derivative
arising in superconformal field theory. This leads to the classification of the

the case of S^{1|N}. All previous invariants admit a prolongation for N>1, as

we have obtained 282 LSD Stokes V signatures of our 28 sample stars. All stars
were detected, showing clearly that when observed with sufficient precision,
all firmly classified Ap/Bp stars show detectable surface magnetic fields. To
better characterise the surface magnetic field intensities and geometries of
the sample, we have inferred the dipolar field intensity and the magnetic
obliquity. The distribution of derived dipole strengths for these stars
exhibits a plateau at about 1 kG, falling off to larger and smaller field
strengths. Remarkably, in this sample of stars selected for their presumably
weak magnetic fields, we find only 2 stars for which the derived dipole
strength is weaker than 300 G. We interpret this ""magnetic threshold"" as a
critical value necessary for the stability of large-scale magnetic fields, and
develop a simple quantitative model that is able to approximately reproduce the
observed threshold characteristics. This scenario leads to a natural
explanation of the small fraction of intermediate-mass magnetic stars. It may
also explain the near-absence of magnetic fields in more massive B and O-type

low-energy cut-off with monoenergetic electrons. We compute the synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) spectrum of such distribution, and using the IDV source
S5~0716+714 as an example, we compare it to the observed SED of S5~0716+714.
The hard radio spectrum is well-fitted by this model, and the optical data can
be accommodated by a power-law extension to the electron spectrum. We therefore
examine the scenario of an injection of electrons that is a double power law in
energy with a hard low-energy component that does not contribute to the
synchrotron opacity. We show that the double power-law injection model is in
good agreement with the observed SED of S5~0716+714. For intrinsic variability,
we find that a Doppler factor of D\geq30 can explain the observed SED provided
that low-frequency (<32 GHz) emission originates from a larger region than the
higher-frequency emission. To fit the entire spectrum, D\geq65 is needed. We
find the constraint imposed by induced Compton scattering at high T_B is
insignificant in our model. We confirm that electron distribution with a
low-energy cut-off can explain the high T_B in compact radio sources. We show
that synchrotron spectrum from such distributions naturally accounts for the
observed hard radio continuum with a softer optical component, without the need
for an inhomogeneous source.

fluctuations is introduced in this paper. The central idea is to transform
energy injected by random perturbations into rigid-body rotational kinetic
energy. The prototype considered in this paper is a mechanical system
consisting of a set of rigid bodies in interaction through magnetic fields. The
system is stochastically forced by white noise and dissipative through
mechanical friction. The Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution at a specific temperature
defines the unique invariant measure under the flow of this stochastic process
and allows us to define ``the temperature'' of the system. This measure is also
ergodic and weakly mixing. Although the system does not exhibit global directed
motion, it is shown that global ballistic motion is possible (the mean-squared
displacement grows like t squared). More precisely, although work cannot be
extracted from thermal energy by the second law of thermodynamics, it is shown
that ballistic transport from thermal energy is possible. In particular, the
dynamics is characterized by a meta-stable state in which the system exhibits
directed motion over random time scales. This phenomenon is caused by
interaction of three attributes of the system: a non flat (yet bounded)
potential energy landscape, a rigid body effect (coupling translational
momentum and angular momentum through friction) and the degeneracy of the
noise/friction tensor on the momentums (the fact that noise is not applied to
all degrees of freedom).

nuclei (AGN) are scaled-up versions of Galactic black holes. We show that the
amplitude of high-frequency X-ray variability in the hard spectral state is
inversely proportional to the black hole mass over eight orders of magnitude.
We have analyzed all available hard-state data from RXTE of seven Galactic
black holes. Their power density spectra change dramatically from observation
to observation, except for the high-frequency (>10 Hz) tail, which seems to
have a universal shape, roughly represented by a power law of index -2. The
amplitude of the tail, C_M (extrapolated to 1 Hz), remains approximately
constant for a given source, regardless of the luminosity, unlike the break or
QPO frequencies, which are usually strongly correlated with luminosity.
Comparison with a moderate-luminosity sample of AGN shows that the amplitude of
the tail is a simple function of black hole mass, C_M = C/M, where C = 1.25
M_Sol / Hz. This makes C_M a robust estimator of the black hole mass which is
easy to apply to low- to moderate-luminosity supermassive black holes. The
high-frequency tail with its universal shape is an invariant feature of a black
hole and, possibly, an imprint of the last stable orbit.

the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz requires an understanding of a companion 2d
theory which we call the mirror model. It is obtained from the original string
model by the double Wick rotation. The S-matrices describing the scattering of
physical excitations in the string and mirror models are related to each other
by an analytic continuation. We show that the unitarity requirement for the
mirror S-matrix fixes the S-matrices of both theories essentially uniquely. The
resulting string S-matrix S(z_1,z_2) satisfies the generalized unitarity
condition and, up to a scalar factor, is a meromorphic function on the elliptic
curve associated to each variable z. The double Wick rotation is then
accomplished by shifting the variables z by quarter of the imaginary period of
the torus. We discuss the apparent bound states of the string and mirror
models, and show that depending on a choice of the physical region there are
one, two or 2^{M-1} solutions of the M-particle bound state equations sharing
the same conserved charges. For very large but finite values of J, most of
these solutions, however, exhibit various signs of pathological behavior. In
particular, they might receive a finite J correction to their energy which is
complex, or the energy correction might exceed corrections arising due to
finite J modifications of the Bethe equations thus making the asymptotic Bethe
ansatz inapplicable.

applied our alignment approach to obtain a genome-wide catalogue of conserved

rearrangement events, such as local inversions, duplications and
translocations, which are not observable in the whole genome alignments

this database of CNBs can constitute the starting point for several

the in silico identification of unannotated functional elements.
