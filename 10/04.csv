singularity at the boundary of electron-hole excitations. The screening of this
singularity by long-range electron-electron interactions is usually treated
within the random phase approximation. The latter is exact only in the limit of
N -> infinity, where N is the ``color'' degeneracy. We find that the
ladder-type vertex corrections become crucial close to the threshold as the
ratio of the n-th order ladder term to the same order RPA contribution is
(\ln|qv-\omega|)^n/N^n$. We perform analytical summation of the infinite series
of ladder diagrams which describe excitonic effect. Beyond the threshold,
qv>\omega, the real part of the polarization operator is found to be positive
leading to the appearance of a strong and narrow plasmon resonance.

analysis of self-assembly systems from a computational perspective, that is,
from the perspective of mathematical problems whose study may give insight into
the natural processes through which elementary objects self-assemble into more
complex ones. One of the main problems of algorithmic self-assembly is the
minimum tile set problem (MTSP), which asks for a collection of types of
elementary objects (called tiles) to be found for the self-assembly of an
object having a pre-established shape. Such a collection is to be as concise as
possible, thus minimizing supply diversity, while satisfying a set of stringent
constraints having to do with the termination and other properties of the
self-assembly process from its tile types. We present a study of what we think
is the first practical approach to MTSP. Our study starts with the introduction
of an evolutionary heuristic to tackle MTSP and includes results from extensive
experimentation with the heuristic on the self-assembly of simple objects in
two and three dimensions. The heuristic we introduce combines classic elements
from the field of evolutionary computation with a problem-specific variant of
Pareto dominance into a multi-objective approach to MTSP.

Classically, the Atiyah-Segal theorem relates the representation ring R(\Gamma)
of a compact Lie group $\Gamma$ to the complex K-theory of the classifying
space $B\Gamma$. For infinite discrete groups, it is necessary to take into
account deformations of representations, and with this in mind we replace the
representation ring by Carlsson's deformation $K$--theory spectrum $\K
(\Gamma)$ (the homotopy-theoretical analogue of $R(\Gamma)$). Our main theorem
provides an isomorphism in homotopy $\K_*(\pi_1 \Sigma)\isom K^{-*}(\Sigma)$
for all compact, aspherical surfaces $\Sigma$ and all $*>0$. Combining this
result with work of Tyler Lawson, we obtain homotopy theoretical information
about the stable moduli space of flat unitary connections over surfaces.

tests on large samples of high redshift galaxies to constrain different
cosmological parameters. The goals of this paper are (1) to compare different
rotation indicators in order to understand the relation between rotation
velocities extracted from observations of the Halpha line and the [OII]3727
line, and (2) determine the scaling relations between physical size, surface
brightness and magnitude of galaxies and their rotation velocity using the
SFI++, a large catalog of nearby galaxies observed at I-band. A good
correlation is observed between the rotation curve-derived velocities of the
Halpha and [OII] observations, as well as between those calculated from
velocity histograms, justifying the direct comparison of velocities measured
from Halpha rotation curves in nearby galaxies and from [OII] line widths at
higher redshifts. To provide calibration for the geometrical tests, we give
expressions for the different scaling relations between properties of galaxies
(size, surface brightness, magnitude) and their rotation speeds. Apart from the
Tully-Fisher relation, we derive the size-rotation velocity and surface
brightness-rotation velocity relations with unprecedentedly small scatters. We
show how the best size-rotation velocity relation is derived when size is
estimated not from disc scale lengths but from the isophotal diameter r23.5,
once these have been corrected for inclination and extinction effects.

H, Ks and L' filters to search for tight companions to 45 Class I and Flat
Spectrum protostars located in 4 different molecular clouds (Taurus-Auriga,
Ophiuchus, Serpens and L1641 in Orion). We complemented these observations with
published high-resolution surveys of 13 additional objects in Taurus and
Ophiuchus. We found multiplicity rates of 32+/-6% and 47+/-8% over the 45-1400
AU and 14-1400 AU separation ranges, respectively. These rates are in excellent
agreement with those previously found among T Tauri stars in Taurus and
Ophiuchus, and represent an excess of a factor ~1.7 over the multiplicity rate
of solar-type field stars. We found no non-hierarchical triple systems, nor any
quadruple or higher-order systems. No significant cloud-to-cloud difference has
been found, except for the fact that all companions to low-mass Orion
protostars are found within 100 AU of their primaries whereas companions found
in other clouds span the whole range probed here. Based on this survey, we
conclude that core fragmentation always yields a high initial multiplicity
rate, even in giant molecular clouds such as the Orion cloud or in clustered
stellar populations as in Serpens, in contrast with predictions of numerical
simulations. The lower multiplicity rate observed in clustered Class II and
Class III populations can be accounted for by a universal set of properties for
young systems and subsequent ejections through close encounters with unrelated
cluster members.

Clifford algebras, where it is defined a new product involving an arbitrary,
but fixed, element of the Clifford algebra. This element acts as the unit with
respect to the introduced product, and is called isounit. We construct
isotopies in both associative and non-associative arbitrary algebras, and
examples of these constructions are exhibited using Clifford algebras, which
although associative, can generate the octonionic, non-associative, algebra.
The whole formalism is developed in a Clifford algebraic arena, giving also the
necessary pre-requisites to introduce isotopies of the exterior algebra. The
flavor hadronic symmetry of the six u,d,s,c,b,t quarks is shown to be exact,
when the generators of the isotopic Lie algebra su(6) are constructed, and the
unit of the isotopic Clifford algebra is shown to be a function of the six
quark masses. The limits constraining the parameters, that are entries of the
representation of the isounit in the isotopic group SU(6), are based on the
most recent limits imposed on quark masses.

derived from observations of the Deep Impact experiment. We find the dust
dominated by warm, fine (~1 um) particles, abundant in Mg-rich olivine,
crystalline pyroxenes, amorphous silicates, Fe-rich sulfides, amorphous carbon,
and colder water-ice. The warm dust material mix is akin to an inner main belt
asteroid of S-type composition. The ~440 K effective temperature of the warm
dust implies that the bulk of the observed material is in a narrow belt ~1.8 AU
from the 4.4 L_solar central source, in the terrestrial planet-forming region
and habitable zone of the system (equivalent to 0.9 AU in the solar system).
The icy dust lies in 2 belts, located at 4-9 AU and at 30 - 80 AU. The lower
bound of warm dust mass in 0.1 - 20 um, dn/da ~ a^-3.5 particles is very large,
at least 3 x 10^20 kg, equivalent to a 320 km radius asteroid of 2.5 g cm^-3
density. Assuming 10m largest particles present, the lower bound of warm dust
mass is at least 0.5 M_Mars The dust around HD 113766A originates from
catastrophic disruption of terrestrial planet embryo(s) and subsequent grinding
of the fragments, or from collisions in a young, extremely dense asteroid belt
undergoing aggregation. The persistence of the strong IR excess over the last
two decades argues for a mechanism to provide replenishment of the

Due to this structure, Asian options display a lower volatility and are
therefore cheaper than their standard European counterparts. This paper is a
survey of some recent enhancements to improve efficiency when pricing Asian
options by Monte Carlo simulation in the Black-Scholes model. We analyze the
dynamics with constant and time-dependent volatilities of the underlying asset
returns. We present a comparison between the precision of the standard Monte

known as Randomized Quasi Monte Carlo (RQMC). The latter has proven to be a
useful variance reduction technique for both problems of up to 20 dimensions

object of interest are non-local (logarithmic) terms generated in the effective
action of gravity due to the exchange in loops of massless modes (such as
photons or the gravitons themselves). We correct one mistake existing in the
previous work and discuss the issue in a more general setting in different
cosmological scenarios. We obtain the one-loop quantum-corrected evolution
equations for the cosmological scale factor up to a given order in a derivative
expansion in two particular cases: a matter dominated universe with vanishing
cosmological constant, and in a de Sitter universe. We show that the quantum
corrections, albeit tiny, may have a secular effect that eventually modifies
the expansion rate. For a de Sitter universe they tend to slow down the rate of
the expansion, while the effect seems to have the opposite sign in a matter
dominated universe. To partly understand these effects we provide a
complementary newtonian analysis.

smaller order. We conjecture this relationship holds widely in the context of
dynamic programming over random data, and Monte Carlo simulations for the

Euclidean distances or at high temperatures. On the other hand, low-lying
hadronic states exhibit the nonlinear Nambu--Goldstone mode. An interesting
question was raised as to whether the linear realization of the chiral symmetry
is asymptotically restored for highly excited states. We address it in a number
of ways. On the phenomenological side we argue that to the extent the meson
Regge trajectories are observed to be linear and equidistant, the Weyl--Wigner
mode is not realized.
  This picture is supported by quasiclassical arguments implying that the quark
spin interactions in high excitations are weak, the trajectories are linear,
and there is no chiral symmetry restoration. Then we use the string/gauge
duality. In the top-down Sakai--Sugimoto construction the nonlinear realization
of the chiral symmetry is built in. In the bottom-up AdS/QCD construction by
Erlich et al., and Karch et al. the situation is more ambiguous. However, in
this approach linearity and equidistance of the Regge trajectories can be
naturally implemented, with the chiral symmetry in the Nambu--Goldstone mode.
  Asymptotic chiral symmetry restoration might be possible if a nonlinearity
(convergence) of the Regge trajectories in an ""intermediate window"" of $n,J$,
beyond the explored domain, takes place. This would signal the failure of the
quasiclassical picture.

specifically, a discrete memoryless modulo-additive channel with a full-duplex

feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacity to the capacity of the
source-destination channel in the absence of the wiretapper. In the
achievability scheme, the feedback signal corresponds to a private key, known
only to the destination. Then a half-duplex system is considered, for which a
novel feedback technique that always achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate
(even when the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the
source-destination channel) is proposed. These results hinge on the
modulo-additive property of the channel, which is exploited by the destination
to perform encryption over the channel without revealing its key to the source.

[O/Fe] values falling above those of the disk. Based on these elevated values
of [O/Fe] extending to large Fe abundances, it is suggested that the bulge
underwent a rapid chemical enrichment with perhaps a top-heavy initial mass
function. The Galactic Center stars reveal a nearly uniform and slightly
elevated (relative to solar) iron abundance for a studied sample which is
composed of 10 red giants and supergiants. Perhaps of more significance is the
fact that the young Galactic Center M-type stars show abundance patterns that
are reminiscent of those observed for the bulge population and contain enhanced
abundance ratios of alpha-elements relative to either the Sun or Milky Way disk

properties of a specific candidate emitter. We use M31 as a proxy for the Milky
Way, and demonstrate this technique by applying it to the unidentified EGRET
sources. We find that it is highly improbable that the majority of the
unidentified EGRET sources are members of a Galactic halo population (e.g.,
dark matter subhalos), but that current observations do not provide any
constraints on all of these sources being Galactic objects if they reside
entirely in the disk and bulge. Applying this method to upcoming observations

stellar initial mass function (IMF) may evolve with time, such that it is more
weighted toward high mass stars at higher redshift. Here we test this idea by
comparing the rate of luminosity evolution of massive early-type galaxies in
clusters at 0.02<z<0.83 to the rate of their color evolution. A combined fit to
the rest-frame U-V color evolution and the previously measured evolution of the
M/L_B ratio gives x~-0.3 for the logarithmic slope of the IMF in the region
around 1 Solar mass, flatter than the present-day value in the Milky Way disk
of x=1.3. The best-fitting luminosity-weighted formation redshift of the stars
in massive cluster galaxies is ~3.7, and a possible interpretation is that the
characteristic mass m_c had a value of ~2 Solar masses at z~4 (compared to
m_c~0.1 Solar masses today), in qualitative agreement with models in which the
characteristic mass is a function of the Jeans mass in molecular clouds. Such a
``bottom-light'' IMF for massive cluster galaxies has significant implications
for the interpretation of measurements of galaxy formation and evolution.
Applying a simple form of IMF evolution to literature data, we find that the
volume-averaged star formation rate at high redshift may have been
overestimated (by a factor of 3-4 at z>4), and the cosmic star formation
history may have a fairly well-defined peak at z~1.5. The M/L_V ratios of
galaxies are less affected than their star formation rates, and future data on
the stellar mass density at z>3 will provide further constraints on IMF
evolution. The formal errors likely underestimate the uncertainties, and
confirmation of thes results requires a larger sample of clusters and the
inclusion of redder rest-frame colors in the analysis.

mergers originating from field populations and from dense stellar clusters. For
both populations we use the same treatment of stellar evolution. Our results
indicate that the merger rates of double neutron stars and black hole --
neutron star binaries are strongly dominated by field populations, while
merging black hole binaries are formed much more effectively in dense stellar
clusters. The overall merger rate of double compact objects depends sensitively
on the (largely unknown) initial mass fraction contained in dense clusters
f_cl. For f_cl < 0.0001, the Advanced LIGO detection rate will be dominated by
field populations of double neutron star mergers, with a small but significant
number of detections ~20 yr^-1. However for a higher mass fraction in clusters,
f_cl > 0.001, the detection rate will be dominated by numerous mergers of
double black holes originating from dense clusters, and it will be considerably
higher, ~25 - 300 yr^-1. In addition, we show that, once mergers of double
black holes are detected, it is easy to differentiate between systems formed in
the field and in dense clusters, since the chirp mass distributions are

redistribution of energy that can impart substantial kicks to one of the holes,
distinctive waveforms, and suppression of the emitted gravitational radiation.
We evolve two such configurations and find very different behaviors. In one
configuration the binary is quickly disrupted and the individual holes follow
complicated trajectories and merge with the third hole in rapid succession,
while in the other, the binary completes a half-orbit before the initial merger

by the Galileo probe, searching for signatures of life. They concluded that the
large amount of O2 and the simultaneous presence of CH4 traces are strongly
suggestive of biology. The detection of a widespread red-absorbing pigment with
no likely mineral origin supports the hypothesis of biophotosynthesis. The
search for signs of life on possibly very different planets implies that we
need to gather as much information as possible in order to understand how the
observed atmosphere physically and chemically works.
  The Earth-Sun intensity ratio is about 10^{-7} in the thermal infrared (10
micrometer), and about 10^{-10} in the visible (0.5 micrometer). The
interferometric systems suggested for Darwin and the Terrestrial Planet Finder
Interferometer (TPF-I) mission operates in the mid-IR (5 - 20 micrometer), the
coronagraph suggested for Terrestrial Planet Finder Coronagraph (TPF-C) in the
visible (0.5 - 1 micrometer). For the former it is thus the thermal emission
emanating from the planet that is detected and analyzed while for the later the
reflected stellar flux is measured. The spectrum of the planet can contain
signatures of atmospheric species that are important for habitability, like CO2
and H2O, or result from biological activity (O2, O3, CH4, and N2O). Both
spectral regions contain atmospheric bio-indicators. The presence or absence of
these spectral features will indicate similarities or differences with the
atmospheres of terrestrial planets and are discussed in detail and set into

structure becomes visible following galaxy subtraction, and luminous blue stars
can be seen in isolated areas of the disk. Dust is visible in the color map in
the region around the bar, and there is a linear color gradient throughout the
disk. We determine an accurate distance from the surface brightness
fluctuations (SBF) method, finding m-M = 31.44\pm0.12 mag, or d = 19.4\pm1.1
Mpc. We then study the globular cluster (GC) colors, sizes, and luminosity
function (GCLF). Estimates of the distance from the median of the GC half-light
radii and from the peak of the GCLF both agree well with the SBF distance. The
GC specific frequency is S_N=1.3\pm0.2, typical for an early-type disk galaxy.
The color distribution is bimodal, as commonly observed for bright galaxies.
There is a suggestion of the redder GCs having smaller sizes, but the trend is
not significant. The sizes do increase significantly with galactocentric
radius, in a manner more similar to the Milky Way GC system than to those in
Virgo. This difference may be an effect of the steeper density gradients in
loose groups as compared to galaxy clusters. Additional studies of early-type
galaxies in low density regions can help determine if this is indeed a general
environmental trend.

one line of sight at z_abs = 0.1556; this is only the second QSO absorber in
which a DIB has been detected. Unlike the majority of local DIB sight-lines,
both QSO absorbers with detected DIBs show weak 6284Ang absorption compared
with the 5780Ang band. This may be indicative of different physical conditions
in intermediate redshift QSO absorbers compared with local galaxies. Assuming
that local relations between the 5780Ang DIB strength and N(HI) and E(B-V)
apply in QSO absorbers, DIB detections and limits can be used to derive N(HI)
and E(B-V). For the one absorber in this study with a detected DIB, we derive
E(B-V) = 0.23mag and log[N(HI)] >= 20.9, consistent with previous conclusions
that CaII systems have high HI column densities and significant reddening. For
the remaining 8 CaII-selected absorbers with 5780Ang DIB non-detections, we
derive E(B-V) upper limits of 0.1-0.3mag.

operations, as differences between quantum operations can become magnified when
their inputs are entangled with auxiliary systems. Bounds on the dimension of
the auxiliary system needed to optimally distinguish quantum operations are
known in several situations. For instance, the dimension of the auxiliary space
never needs to exceed the dimension of the input space of the operations for
optimal distinguishability, while no auxiliary system whatsoever is needed to
optimally distinguish unitary operations. Another bound, which follows from
work of R. Timoney, is that optimal distinguishability is always possible when
the dimension of the auxiliary system is twice the number of operators needed
to express the difference between the quantum operations in Kraus form. This
paper provides an alternate proof of this fact that is based on concepts and
tools that are familiar to quantum information theorists.

NGC 1399 and NGC 4486 (M87) are well suited for this kind of analysis due to
their large globular cluster populations. The main assumption of our Monte
Carlo based models is that each globular cluster is formed along with a given
diffuse stellar mass that shares the same spatial distribution, chemical
composition and age. The main globular clusters subpopulations, that determine
the observed bimodal colour distribution, are decomposed avoiding a priori
parametric (e.g. Gaussian) fits and using a new colour (C-T1)-metallicity
relation. The eventual detectability of a blue tilt in the colour magnitude
diagrams of the blue globulars subpopulation is also addressed. A successful
link between globular clusters and the stellar galaxy halo is established by
assuming that the number of globular clusters per associated diffuse stellar
mass t is a function of total abundance [Z/H] and behaves as
t=gamma*exp(delta[Z/H]) (i.e. increases when abundance decreases).

stochastic perturbation to the receiving component does not rely on the giving

An application with a two-dimensional system is presented, and the resulting
transfers are just as expected. A remarkable observation is that, for two
highly correlated time series, there could be no information transfer from one
certain series, say $x_2$, to the other ($x_1$). That is to say, the evolution
of $x_1$ may have nothing to do with $x_2$, even though $x_1$ and $x_2$ are
highly correlated. Information transfer analysis thus extends the traditional
notion of correlation analysis by providing a quantitative measure of causality
between time series.

whether it is in the high-spin (HS) or low-spin (LS) state. This change causes
distortion of the lattice. Elastic interactions among these distortions play an
important role for the cooperative properties of spin-transition phenomena. We
find that the critical behavior caused by this elastic interaction belongs to
the mean-field universality class, in which the critical exponents for the
spontaneous magnetization and the susceptibility are $\beta = 1/2$ and $\gamma
= 1$, respectively. Furthermore, the spin-spin correlation function is a
constant at long distances, and it does not show an exponential decay in
contrast to short-range models. The value of the correlation function at long
distances shows different size-dependences: $O(1/N)$, $O(1/\sqrt{N})$, and
constant for temperatures above, at, and below the critical temperature,
respectively. The model does not exhibit clusters, even near the critical
point. We also found that cluster growth is suppressed in the present model and
that there is no critical opalescence in the coexistence region. During the
relaxation process from a metastable state at the end of a hysteresis loop,
nucleation phenomena are not observed, and spatially uniform configurations are
maintained during the change of the fraction of HS and LS. These
characteristics of the mean-field model are expected to be found not only in
spin-crossover materials, but also generally in systems where elastic
distortion mediates the interaction among local states.

folding/unfolding experiment done in the light tweezer, where the molecule is
flanked by long double-stranded DNA/RNA handles and tethered between two big

of the bead, the molecular structural transition, and the elasticity of the
handles and RNA. Then based on an analytic solution of the model, a Bayesian

Such
a framework is globally rigid if it is the only framework in E^d with the same
graph and edge lengths, up to rigid motions. For which underlying graphs is a
generic framework globally rigid? We answer this question by proving a
conjecture by Connelly, that his sufficient condition is also necessary: a
generic framework is globally rigid if and only if it has a stress matrix with
kernel of dimension d+1, the minimum possible.
  An alternate version of the condition comes from considering the geometry of
the length-squared mapping l: the graph is generically locally rigid iff the
rank of l is maximal, and it is generically globally rigid iff the rank of the
Gauss map on the image of l is maximal.
  We also show that this condition is efficiently checkable with a randomized
algorithm, and prove that if a graph is not generically globally rigid then it
is flexible one dimension higher.

photomagnetism by employing a kinetic model which includes internal conversions
and intersystem crossings. The key feature of the model is assumption of the
existence of two kinds of S=3 states: one which has no direct pathway for
internal conversion and the other characterized by slow kinetics for internal
conversion to the low-energy states. The trapped S=3 state can decay via a
thermally activated barrier to the other S=3 state. The experimental
temperature dependence of magnetization plot is fitted using rate constants
with Arrhenius dependence. The two different experimental cMT vs. T curves
obtained with different irradiation times are fitted with our model. Our
studies show that the photomagnetism in these systems is governed by kinetics
and not due to differences in oscillator strengths for excitation of the
different spin states.

  Methods: Our own photometric monitoring has been combined with data from the

derive pulsation periods. According to the global parameters of the cluster we
construct pulsation models taking into account the effect of the C/O ratio on

for both O-rich stars and carbon stars in the pulsation calculations.
  Results: The observed P-L-diagram of NGC 1846 can be fitted using a mass of
the AGB stars of about 1.8 M$_{\sun}$. We show that the period of pulsation is
increased when an AGB star turns into a carbon star. Using the mass on the AGB

  METHODS: By means of systematic spectroscopic campaigns and through the
literature search we have collected an optical spectrum for the large majority
of the sources in the XBS survey and applied a well-defined classification
``flow-chart''.
  RESULTS: We find that the AGN represent the most numerous population at the
flux limit of the XBS survey (~10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1) constituting 80% of the
XBS sources selected in the 0.5-4.5 keV energy band and 95% of the ``hard''
(4.5-7.5 keV) selected objects. Galactic sources populate significantly the
0.5-4.5 keV sample (17%) and only marginally (3%) the 4.5-7.5 keV sample. The
remaining sources in both samples are clusters/groups of galaxies and normal
galaxies (i.e. probably not powered by an AGN). Furthermore, the percentage of
type2 AGN (i.e. optically absorbed AGNs with A_V>2mag) dramatically increases
going from the 0.5-4.5 keV sample (f=N_AGN2/N_AGN=7%) to the 4.5-7.5 keV sample
(f=32%). We finally propose two simple diagnostic plots that can be easily used
to obtain the spectral classification for relatively low redshift AGNs even if
the quality of the spectrum is not good.

coupling mechanism is analysed and found to be due to an instability in the

characterised by alternation in the spin direction between adjacent carbon
atoms. The disruption of the $\pi$-bonding opens a semiconducting gap at the
Fermi edge. The size of the energy gap and the magnetic coupling strength are
strong functions of the defect separation and can thus be controlled by varying
the defect concentration. The position of the semiconducting energy gap and the
electron effective mass are strongly spin-dependent and this is expected to
result in a spin asymmetry in the transport properties of the system. A
defective graphene sheet is therefore a very promising material with an
in-built mechanism for tailoring the properties of the spintronic devices of

impact of small perturbations to the non-equilibrium steady states resulting
from Axiom A dynamical systems. We show that the causality of the response
functions allows for writing a set of Kramers-Kronig relations for the
corresponding susceptibilities at all orders of nonlinearity. Nonetheless, only
a special class of observable susceptibilities obey Kramers-Kronig relations.
Specific results are provided for arbitrary order harmonic response, which
allows for a very comprehensive Kramers-Kronig analysis and the establishment
of sum rules connecting the asymptotic behavior of the susceptibility to the
short-time response of the system. These results generalize previous findings
on optical Hamiltonian systems and simple mechanical models, and shed light on
the general impact of considering the principle of causality for testing
self-consistency: the described dispersion relations constitute unavoidable
benchmarks for any experimental and model generated dataset. In order to
connect the response theory for equilibrium and non equilibrium systems, we
rewrite the classical results by Kubo so that response functions formally
identical to those proposed by Ruelle, apart from the measure involved in the
phase space integration, are obtained. We briefly discuss how these results,
taking into account the chaotic hypothesis, might be relevant for climate
research. In particular, whereas the fluctuation-dissipation theorem does not
work for non-equilibrium systems, because of the non-equivalence between
internal and external fluctuations, Kramers-Kronig relations might be more
robust tools for the definition of a self-consistent theory of climate change.

double peaked profile at soft X-ray energy band (<3 keV) and a single peaked
smooth profile at hard X-rays. The width of the primary dip is found to be
increasing with energy. The broad-band energy spectrum of the pulsar is well
described with a Negative and Positive power-law with EXponential (NPEX)
continuum model along with a blackbody component for soft excess. A weak iron
K_alpha emission line with an equivalent width ~25 eV was detected in the
source spectrum. The blackbody component is found to be pulsating over the
pulse phase implying the accretion column and/or the inner edge of the
accretion disk may be the possible emission site of the soft excess in

of the secondary dip at the soft X-ray energy band. The iron line equivalent
width is found to be constant (within errors) over the pulse phase. However, a
sinusoidal type of flux variation of iron emission line, in phase with the hard
X-ray flux suggests that the inner accretion disk is the possible emission
region of the iron fluorescence line.

typical structural and orbital parameters, we find that ~30% of the initial hot
galactic halo gas can remain in place after 10 Gyr. We propose a physically
simple analytic model that describes the stripping seen in the simulations
remarkably well. The model is analogous to the original formulation of Gunn &
Gott (1972), except that it is appropriate for the case of a spherical (hot)
gas distribution (as opposed to a face-on cold disk) and takes into account
that stripping is not instantaneous but occurs on a characteristic timescale.
The model reproduces the results of the simulations to within approximately 10%
at almost all times for all the orbits, mass ratios, and galaxy structural
properties we have explored. The one exception involves unlikely systems where
the orbit of the galaxy is highly non-radial and its mass exceeds about 10% of
the group or cluster into which it is falling (in which case the model
under-predicts the stripping following pericentric passage). The proposed model
has several interesting applications, including modelling the ram pressure
stripping of both observed and cosmologically-simulated galaxies and as a way
to improve current semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. One immediate
consequence is that the colours and morphologies of satellite galaxies in
groups and clusters will differ significantly from those predicted with the
standard assumption of complete stripping of the hot coronae.

established as a new class of sources of very high energy (VHE) photons. The
gamma-rays are produced by inverse Compton scattering of the stellar light by
VHE electrons accelerated in the vicinity of the compact object. The VHE
emission from LS 5039 displays an orbital modulation.
  The inverse Compton spectrum depends on the angle between the incoming and
outgoing photon in the electron rest frame. Since the angle at which an
observer sees the star and electrons changes with the orbit, a phase dependence
of the spectrum is expected. The phase-dependent spectrum of LS 5039 is
calculated, assuming a continuous injection of electrons. The shape of the
electron distribution depends on the injected power-law and on the magnetic
field intensity.
  Anisotropic scattering produces hard emission at inferior conjunction, when
attenuation due to pair production of the VHE gamma-rays on star light is
minimum. The computed lightcurve and spectra provide good fits to the HESS and
EGRET observations, except at phases of maximum attenuation where pair cascade
emission may be significant for HESS. Detailed predictions are made for a
modulation in the GLAST energy range. The magnetic field intensity at
periastron is 0.8+-0.2 G.
  Anisotropic inverse Compton scattering plays a major role in LS 5039. The
derived magnetic field intensity, injection energy and slope suggest a
rotation-powered pulsar wind nebula. Gamma-ray binaries are promising sources

this prediction with the $N^*N\pi$ coupling constants extracted from the decay
widths and observe a 100 % correlation of these data with the spectroscopic
parity doublet patterns. These results suggest that the lowest approximate
chiral parity doublet is the $N(1440) - N(1535)$ pair. In the meson sector we
discuss predictions of the chiral symmetry restoration for still missing states
and a signature of the higher symmetry observed in new $\bar p p$ data. We
conclude with the exactly solvable chirally symmetric and confining model that
can be considered as a generalization of the 1+1 dimensional 't Hooft model to

definition for the entropy of a closed system, a microscopic foundation for the
Second Law, a resolution of the Information Loss (and other) Black-Hole
Puzzle(s) and an objective mechanism for decoherence. Presupposing a
conventional unitary theory of low-energy quantum gravity, it offers all this
by taking the physical density operator of a closed system to be the partial
trace of its total density operator (assumed pure) over gravity and by defining
its physical entropy to be its `matter-gravity entanglement entropy'. We also
recall Kay's 1998 modified non-relativistic (many-body) quantum mechanics based
on Kay's hypothesis with a Newtonian approximation to quantum gravity. In this
modification, we find formal expectation values for certain `observables' such
as momentum-squared and Parity are altered but those for functions of positions
are unaltered. However, by arguing that every real measurement can ultimately
be taken to be a position measurement, we prove that, in practice, it is
impossible to detect any alteration at all and, in particular, we predict no
alteration for Roger Penrose's experiment. Nevertheless, Kay's modification
contains no Schr\""odinger Cat-like states, and also allows an `events'
interpretation which we tentatively propose and begin to explore. We also
obtain a Second-Law type result for a non-relativistic toy-model closed system
and argue that similar results will apply for a wide class of model Newtonian
and post-Newtonian closed systems although we argue that ordinary actual
lab-sized systems can never be treated as closed for the purpose of calculating
their entropy. Compared with `collapse models' such as GRW, Kay's Newtonian
theory does a similar job while being free from ad hoc assumptions.

statistics in the topological sectors 0 and 1. Since the chiral condensate
Sigma vanishes in the chiral limit, we observe densities for the microscopic
Dirac spectrum, which have not been addressed yet by Random Matrix Theory
(RMT). Nevertheless, by confronting the averages of the lowest eigenvalues in
different topological sectors with chiral RMT in unitary ensemble we obtain --
for the very light fermion masses -- values for Sigma that follow closely the
analytical predictions in the continuum.

interest, while the effect of metallicity on binary evolution remains still
relatively unexplored. We study the effect of metallicity on the number of
binary systems that undergo different cases of mass transfer. We find that
binaries at low metallicity are more likely to start transferring mass after
the onset of central helium burning, often referred to as case C mass transfer.
In other words, the donor star in a metal poor binary is more likely to have
formed a massive CO core before the onset of mass transfer.
  At solar metallicity the range of initial binary separations that result in
case C evolution is very small for massive stars, because they do not expand
much after the ignition of helium and because mass loss from the system by
stellar winds causes the orbit to widen, preventing the primary star to fill
its Roche lobe. This effect is likely to have important consequences for the
metallicity dependence of the formation rate of various objects through binary
evolution channels, such as long GRBs, double neutron stars and double white
dwarfs.

data is used to simultaneously measure the proper motion and the Doppler
signals in DFs. For calibration of the Doppler signals we use spatially
resolved spectrograms of a similar active region. Significant variations in the
calibration constant for different solar features are observed, and only
regions containing DFs have been used in order to reduce calibration errors. We
find a coherent behavior of the Doppler velocity and the proper motion which
clearly demonstrates that the evolution of DFs involve plasma motion. The
Doppler velocities are found to be a factor 2--3 smaller than velocities
derived form proper motions in the image plane. The difference can be explained
by the radiative processes involved, the Doppler velocity is a result of the
local atmospheric velocity weighted with the response function. As a result the
Doppler velocity originates from a wide range in heights in the atmosphere.
This is contrasted by the proper motion velocity which is measured from the
sharply defined bright tops of the DFs and is therefore a very local velocity
measure. The Doppler signal originates from well below the top of the DF.
Finally we discuss how this difference together with the lacking spatial
resolution of older observations have contributed to some of the confusion
about the identity of DFs, spicules and mottles.

features of empirical wealth distribution across all wealth brackets, namely a
Gibbsian trend in the lower and middle wealth range and a Pareto trend in the
higher range, by simply limiting the an agents' interaction to only agents with
nearly the same wealth. To do this, we introduce a parameter BETA that limits
the range on the wealth of a partner with which an agent is allowed to
interact. We show that this wealth-limited interaction is enough to distribute
wealth in a purely power law trend. If the interaction is not wealth limited,
the wealth distribution is expectedly Gibbsian. The value of BETA where the
transition from a purely Gibbsian law to a purely power law distribution
happens depends on whether the choice of interaction partner is mutual nor not.
For a non-mutual choice, where the richer agent gets to decide, the transition
happens at BETA=1.0. For a mutual choice, the transition is at BETA= 0.60. In
order to generate a mixed Gibbs-Pareto distribution, we apply another
wealth-based rule that depends on the parameter w_limit. An agent whose wealth
is below w_limit can choose any partner to interact with, while an agent whose
wealth is above w_limit is subject to the wealth-limited range in his choice of
partner. A Gibbs-Pareto distribution appears if both these wealth-based rules
are applied.

an avalanche process, in which angular momentum is transferred erratically from
the flywheel-like superfluid in the star to the slowly decelerating, solid
crust via spatially connected chains of local, impulsive, threshold-activated
events, so that the system fluctuates around a self-organised critical state.
Analysis of the glitch population (currently 285 events from 101 pulsars)
demonstrates that the size distribution in individual pulsars is consistent
with being scale invariant, as expected for an avalanche process. The
waiting-time distribution is consistent with being exponential in seven out of
nine pulsars where it can be measured reliably, after adjusting for
observational limits on the minimum waiting time, as for a constant-rate
Poisson process. PSR J0537$-$6910 and PSR J0835$-$4510 are the exceptions;
their waiting-time distributions show evidence of quasiperiodicity. In each
object, stationarity requires that the rate $\lambda$ equals $- \epsilon
\dot{\nu} / <\Delta\nu>$, where $\dot{\nu}$ is the angular acceleration of the
crust, $<\Delta\nu>$ is the mean glitch size, and $\epsilon\dot{\nu}$ is the
relative angular acceleration of the crust and superfluid. There is no evidence
that $\lambda$ changes monotonically with spin-down age. The rate distribution
itself is fitted reasonably well by an exponential for $\lambda \geq 0.25 {\rm
yr^{-1}}$. For $\lambda < 0.25 {\rm yr^{-1}}$, its exact form is unknown; the
exponential overestimates the number of glitching pulsars observed at low
$\lambda$, where the limited total observation time exercises a selection bias.

bias due to the even zonal harmonic coefficients J_L of the multipolar

sphericity of the terrestrial gravitational potential induced by the
centrifugal effects of its diurnal rotation. The issue addressed here is: are
the so far published evaluations of such a systematic error reliable and
realistic? The answer is negative. Indeed, if the difference \Delta J_L among
the even zonals estimated in different global solutions (EIGEN-GRACE02S,

their more or less calibrated covariance sigmas \sigma_{J_L}, it turns out that
the systematic error \delta\mu in the Lense-Thirring measurement is about 3 to
4 times larger than in the evaluations so far published based on the use of the
sigmas of one model at a time separately, amounting up to 37% for the pair
EIGEN-GRACE02S/ITG-Grace03s. The comparison among the other recent GRACE-based
models yields bias as large as about 25-30%. The major discrepancies still
occur for J_4, J_6 and J_8, which are just the zonals the combined

Prokaryotes do not have introns in their genome. We report the calculations of

fungi kingdoms. Actin genes have been chosen because they have been highly
conserved during evolution. In these genes all introns were removed so as to
mimic ancient genes at the time of the early eukaryotic development, i.e.
before introns insertion. Common stability boundaries are found in evolutionary
distant organisms, which implies that these boundaries date from the early
origin of eukaryotes. In general boundaries correspond with introns positions
of vertebrates and other animals actins, but not much for plants and fungi. The
sharpest boundary is found in a locus where fungi, algae and animals have
introns in positions separated by one nucleotide only, which identifies a
hot-spot for insertion. These results suggest that some introns may have been
incorporated into the genomes through a thermodynamic driven mechanism, in
agreement with previous observations on human genes. They also suggest a
different mechanism for introns insertion in plants and animals.

ages between 70 and 200 Myr and velocities in the range 230 to 350 km/s, while
extinctions Av vary between ~1-2.5 mag. We also find evidence of differential
extinction across the faces of some clusters which hinders the photometric
determination of ages and extinctions in these cases. The cluster radial
velocities indicate that the clusters are located at different depths within
the disk, and are on regular disk orbits. Our results overall contradict the
findings of previous studies, where region B was thought to be a bound region
populated by intermediate-age clusters that formed in an independent, offset
starburst episode that commenced 600 Myr-1 Gyr ago. Our findings instead
suggest that region B is optically bright because of low extinction patches,
and this allows us to view the cluster population of the inner M82 disk, which
probably formed as a result of the last encounter with M81. This study forms
part of a series of papers aimed at studying the cluster population of M82

Finite-size scaling is a powerful method for the analysis of phase transitions
in lattice QCD simulations. From the scaling behavior, critical exponents can
be tested and the order as well as the universality class of a phase transition
can be established. This requires knowledge of the critical exponents and the
scaling behavior. We use a non-perturbative Renormalization Group method to
obtain critical exponents and the finite-size scaling functions for the O(4)
