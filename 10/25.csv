two-dimensional conformal field theory) is known to decrease under
renormalization group (RG) flow of the boundary theory. We study instead the
behavior of the boundary entropy as the bulk theory flows between two nearby
critical points. We use conformal perturbation theory to calculate the change
in g due to a slightly relevant bulk perturbation and find that it has no
preferred sign. The boundary entropy log(g) can therefore increase during
appropriate bulk flows. This is demonstrated explicitly in flows between
minimal models. We discuss the applications of this result to D-branes in
string theory and to impurity problems in condensed matter.

to an analysis of the $n_{ch}$ dependence of $p_t$ spectra from p-p collisions

reference is a L\'evy distribution on transverse mass $m_t$. The hard-component

Deviations of data from the reference are described by hard-component ratio
$r_{AA}$ which generalizes nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$. The analysis
suggests that centrality evolution of pion and proton spectra is dominated by
changes in parton fragmentation. The structure of $r_{AA}$ suggests that parton
energy loss produces a negative boost $\Delta y_t$ of a large fraction (but not
all) of the minimum-bias fragment distribution, and that lower-energy partons
suffer relatively less energy loss, possibly due to color screening. The
analysis also suggests that the anomalous $p/\pi$ ratio may be due to
differences in the parton energy-loss process experienced by the two hadron
species. This analysis provides no evidence for radial flow.

refinement (AMR). The patch-based AMR algorithm refines in both space and time
creating a hierarchy of levels, coarsest to finest. The physics modules are
time-advanced using operator splitting. On each level, separate level-solve
packages advance the modules. Our multigroup level-solve adapts an implicit
procedure which leads to a two-step iterative scheme that alternates between
elliptic solves for each group with intra-cell group coupling. For robustness,
we introduce pseudo transient continuation (PTC). We analyze the magnitude of
the PTC parameter to ensure positivity of the resulting linear system, diagonal
dominance and convergence of the two-step scheme. For AMR, a level defines a
subdomain for refinement. For diffusive processes such as MGD, the refined
level uses Dirichet boundary data at the coarse-fine interface and the data is
derived from the coarse level solution. After advancing on the fine level, an
additional procedure, the sync-solve (SS), is required in order to enforce
conservation. The MGD SS reduces to an elliptic solve on a combined grid for a
system of G equations, where G is the number of groups. We adapt the partial
temperature scheme for the SS; hence, we reuse the infrastructure developed for
scalar equations. Results are presented. (Abridged)

through the temporally self-similar solutions in two-dimensional axisymmetric

equation where plasma pressure plays the role of an eigenvalue. This allows a
structure of magnetic lobes in space, among which the polar axis lobe is
strongly peaked in intensity and collimated in angular spread comparing to the
others. For this reason, the polar lobe overwhelmes the other lobes, and a jet
structure arises in the polar direction naturally. Furthermore, within each
magnetic lobe in space, there are small secondary regions with closed
two-dimensional field lines embedded along this primary lobe. In these embedded
magnetic toroids, plasma pressure and mass density are much higher accordingly.
These are termed as secondary plasmoids. The magnetic field lines in these
secondary plasmoids circle in alternating sequence such that adjacent plasmoids
have opposite field lines. In particular, along the polar primary lobe, such
periodic plasmoid structure happens to be compatible with radio observations
where islands of high radio intensities are mapped.

nearly 2/3 of the known pulsars and provide a remarkably homogeneous sample to
compare with simulations. New proper motion measurements and an improved model
of the distribution of free electrons in the interstellar medium, NE2001, also
make revisiting these issues particularly worthwhile. We present a simple
population model that reproduces the actual observations well, and consider
others that fail. We conclude that: pulsars are born in the spiral arms, with
the birthrate of 2.8+/-0.5 pulsars/century peaking at a distance ~3 kpc from
the Galactic centre, and with mean initial speed of 380^{+40}_{-60} km/s; the
birth spin period distribution extends to several hundred milliseconds, with no
evidence of multimodality, implying that characteristic ages overestimate the
true ages of the pulsars by a median factor >2 for true ages <30,000 yr; models
in which the radio luminosities of the pulsars are random generically fail to
reproduce the observed P-Pdot diagram, suggesting a relation between intrinsic
radio luminosity and (P, Pdot); radio luminosities L Edot^0.5 provide a good
match to the observed P-Pdot diagram; for this favored radio luminosity model,
we find no evidence for significant magnetic field decay over the lifetime of
the pulsars as radio sources ~100 Myr.

in the Mellin transform space is not rigorously correct because of the
inconsistent double energy integral evaluation which generates the function
$<\eta^{s}>$ with its associated parametizations. To ensure an exact basic
working equation, the Faltung integral representation is introduced which has
the elasticity distribution function $u(\eta)$ as the only fundamental input
function and $<\eta^{s}>$ is just the Mellin transform of $u(\eta)$. This
Faltung representation eliminates standard phenomenological parameters which
serve only to mislead the physics of cascade. The exact flux transform equation
is solved by the method of characteristics, and the hadron flux in real space
is obtained by the inverse transform in terms of the simple and essential
residues. Since the essential residues are given by the singularities in the
elasticity distribution and particle production transforms that appear in the
exponentials, these functions should not be parametized arbitrarily to avoid
introducing non-physical essential residues. This Faltung formulation is
applied to the charged hadron integrated energy spectra of halo events detected
at Mt. Chacaltaya by the Brazil-Japan Collaboration, where the incoming flux at
the atmospheric boundary is a single energetic nucleon.

10^9 K km/s pc^2, corresponding to a HCN/CO luminosity ratio of L'(HCN)/L'(CO)
< 0.13. This limit is consistent with a fraction of dense molecular gas in

median value: L'(HCN)/L'(CO) = 0.17 {+0.05/-0.08}) and HCN-detected z>2

considered to be a measure for the efficiency at which stars form out of dense
gas. In the nearby universe, these quantities show a linear correlation, and
thus, a practically constant average ratio. In J1148+5251, we find
L(FIR)/L'(HCN) > 6600. This is significantly higher than the average ratios for
normal nearby spiral galaxies (L(FIR)/L'(HCN) = 580 {+510/-270}) and ULIRGs
(740 {+505/-50}), but consistent with a rising trend as indicated by other z>2
galaxies (predominantly quasars; 1525 {+1300/-475}). It is unlikely that this
rising trend can be accounted for by a contribution of AGN heating to L(FIR)
alone, and may hint at a higher median gas density and/or elevated
star-formation efficiency toward the more luminous high-redshift systems. There
is marginal evidence that the L(FIR)/L'(HCN) ratio in J1148+5251 may even
exceed the rising trend set by other z>2 galaxies; however, only future

We illustrate how the HCME parameters can be used for space weather forecast.
It is also demonstrated that the strength of a geomagnetic storm does not
depend on the determined width of HCMEs. This means that HCMEs do not have to
be very large to cause major geomagnetic storms.

VLT/FORS2 in the spectral region covering the near-infrared calcium triplet. In
this paper we focus on the well-known luminous blue compact galaxy ESO 338-IG04
(Tololo 1924-416). A previous investigation, using Fabry-Perot interferometry,
showed that this galaxy has a chaotic H-alpha velocity field, indicating that
either the galaxy is not in dynamical equilibrium or that H-alpha does not
trace the gravitational potential due to feedback from star formation. Along
the apparent major axis, the stellar and ionised gas velocities for the most
part follow each other. The chaotic velocity field must therefore be a sign
that the young stellar population in ESO 338-IG04 is not in dynamical
equilibrium. The most likely explanation, which is also supported by its
morphology, is that the galaxy has experienced a merger and that this has
triggered the current starburst. Summarising the results of our programme so
far, we note that emission-line velocity fields are not always reliable tracers
of stellar motions, and go on to assess the implications for kinematic studies

space-times, motivated by some D-particle foam models, is calculated for a
toy-model of bosons with flavour degrees of freedom. The presence of D-particle
defects in the space-time, which can interact non trivially (via particle
capture) with flavoured particles in a flavour non-preserving way, generates
mixing in the effective field theory of low-energy string excitations.
Moreover, the recoil of the D-particle defect during the capture/scattering
process implies Lorentz violation, which however may be averaged to zero in
isotropic D-particle populations, but implies non-trivial effects in
correlators. Both features imply that the flavoured mixed state sees a
non-trivial flavour (Fock-space) vacuum of a type introduced earlier by Blasone
and Vitiello in a generic context of theories with mixing. We discuss the
orthogonality of the flavour vacua to the usual Fock vacua and the effect on
flavour oscillations in these backgrounds. Furthermore we analyse the equation
of state of the Flavour vacuum, and find that, for slow expansion rates induced
by D particle recoil, it is equivalent to that of a cosmological constant. Some
estimates of these novel non-perturbative contribution to the vacuum energy are
made. The contribution vanishes if the mass difference and the mixing angle of
the flavoured states vanish.

Because of the extreme physical conditions near the bounce, a natural question
is whether the universe can retain, after the bounce, its memory about the

the state after evolving unitarily through the bounce or does it suffer from
some cosmic amnesia as has been recently suggested? Here we show that this
issue can be answered unambiguously at least within an exactly solvable model,
derived from a small simplification of loop quantum cosmology, for which there
is full analytical control on the quantum theory. We show that if there exists
a semiclassical state at late times on one side, peaked around a pair of
canonically conjugate variables, then there are very strong bounds on the
fluctuations on the other side of the bounce, implying semi-classicality. For
such a model universe which grows to a size of 1 megaparsec, at late times, the
change in relative fluctuations of the only non-trivial observable of the model
across the bounce is less than $10^{-56}$ (becoming smaller for universes which
grow larger). The universe maintains (an almost) total recall.

0.2<z<0.84 in 2,157 luminous face-on spiral galaxies from the COSMOS 2-square
degree field. Our sample is an order of magnitude larger than that used in any
previous investigation, and is based on substantially deeper imaging data than
that available from earlier wide-area studies of high-redshift galaxy
morphology. We find that the fraction of barred spirals declines rapidly with
redshift. Whereas in the local Universe about 65% of luminous spiral galaxies
contain bars (SB+SAB), at z ~0.84 this fraction drops to about 20%. Over this
redshift range the fraction of strong (SB) bars drops from about 30% to under
10%. It is clear that when the Universe was half its present age, the census of
galaxies on the Hubble sequence was fundamentally different from that of the
present day. A major clue to understanding this phenomenon has also emerged
from our analysis, which shows that the bar fraction in spiral galaxies is a
strong function of stellar mass, integrated color and bulge prominence. The bar
fraction in very massive, luminous spirals is about constant out to z ~ 0.84
whereas for the low mass, blue spirals it declines significantly with redshift
beyond z=0.3. There is also a slight preference for bars in bulge dominated
systems at high redshifts which may be an important clue towards the
co-evolution of bars, bulges and black holes. Our results thus have important
ramifications for the processes responsible for galactic downsizing, suggesting
that massive galaxies matured early in a dynamical sense, and not just as a
result of the regulation of their star formation rate.

the nature of the IGL and rule out faint cluster galaxies, nebular continuum
emission, synchrotron, inverse Compton emission and scattering of galactic
stellar light as possible sources of the IGL. Dust scattered quasar light is an
unlikely possibility that cannot be ruled out entirely. We conclude that the
source of the IGL is most likely to be a young stellar population distributed
in a halo encompassing the radio and satellite galaxies, undergoing star
formation at a rate greater than 57 Msun/yr. Within 70kpc of the radio core,
approximately 44% of the star formation that is traced by UV light occurs in
this diffuse mode. The average UV colour of the IGL is bluer than the average
galaxy colour, and there is a trend for the IGL to become bluer with increasing
radius from the radio galaxy. Both the galaxies and the IGL show a UV
colour--surface brightness relation which can be obtained by variations in
either stellar population age or extinction. These observations show a
different, but potentially important mode of star formation, that is diffuse in
nature. Star formation, as traced by UV light, occurs in two modes in the high
redshift universe: one in the usual Lyman break galaxy clump-like mode on kpc
scales, and the other in a diffuse mode over a large region surrounding massive
growing galaxies. Such a mode of star formation can easily be missed by high
angular resolution observations that are well suited for detecting high surface
brightness compact galaxies. Extrapolating from these results, it is possible
that a significant amount of star formation occurs in large extended regions
within the halos of the most massive galaxies forming at high redshift.

samples. Specifically, we investigate the impact on the Y-M relation of energy
feedback, variations in the host halo concentration and substructure
populations, and projection effects due to unresolved clusters along the line
of sight (the SZ background). Furthermore, we investigate at what radius (or
overdensity) one should measure the integrated SZE and define cluster mass so
as to achieve the tightest possible scaling. We find that the measure of Y with
the least scatter is always obtained within a smaller radius than that at which
the mass is defined; e.g. for M_{200} (M_{500}) the scatter is least for
Y_{500} (Y_{1100}). The inclusion of energy feedback in the gas model
significantly increases the intrinsic scatter in the Y-M relation due to larger
variations in the gas mass fraction compared to models without feedback. We
also find that variations in halo concentration for clusters of a given mass
may partly explain why the integrated SZE provides a better mass proxy than the
central decrement. Substructure is found to account for approximately 20% of
the observed scatter in the Y-M relation. Above M_{200} = 2x10^{14} h^{-1}
msun, the SZ background does not significantly effect cluster mass
measurements; below this mass, variations in the background signal reduce the

real-time dynamics within the 8-nm step is still lacking. For instance, the
rate of power stroke (or conformational change), that leads to the
undocked-to-docked transition of neck-linker, is not known, and the existence
of a substep during the 8-nm step still remains a controversial issue in the
kinesin community. By using explicit structures of the kinesin dimer and the MT
consisting of 13 protofilaments (PFs), we study the stepping dynamics with
varying rates of power stroke (kp). We estimate that 1/kp <~ 20 microsec to
avoid a substep in an averaged time trace. For a slow power stroke with 1/kp>20
microsec, the averaged time trace shows a substep that implies the existence of
a transient intermediate, which is reminiscent of a recent single molecule
experiment at high resolution. We identify the intermediate as a conformation
in which the tethered head is trapped in the sideway binding site of the
neighboring PF. We also find a partial unfolding (cracking) of the binding
motifs occurring at the transition state ensemble along the pathways prior to
binding between the kinesin and MT.

arm of M31. In this region we find six giant molecular clouds that have a mean
diameter of 57$\pm$13 pc, a mean velocity width of 6.5$\pm$1.2 \kms, and a mean
molecular mass of 3.0 $\pm$ 1.6 $\times$ 10$^5$\Msun. The peak brightness
temperature of these clouds ranges from 1.6--4.2 K. We compare these clouds to
clouds in M33 observed by \citet{wilson90} using the OVRO millimeter array, and
some cloud complexes in the Milky Way observed by \cite{dame01} using the CfA
1.2m telescope. In order to properly compare the single dish data to the
spatially filtered interferometric data, we project several well-known Milky
Way complexes to the distance of Andromeda and simulate their observation with
the BIMA interferometer. We compare the simulated Milky Way clouds with the M31
and M33 data using the same cloud identification and analysis technique and
find no significant differences in the cloud properties in all three galaxies.
Thus we conclude that previous claims of differences in the molecular cloud
properties between these galaxies may have been due to differences in the
choice of cloud identification techniques. With the upcoming CARMA array,
individual molecular clouds may be studied in a variety of nearby galaxies.
With ALMA, comprehensive GMC studies will be feasible at least as far as the
Virgo cluster. With these data, comparative studies of molecular clouds across
galactic disks of all types and between different galaxy disks will be
possible. Our results emphasize that interferometric observations combined with
the use of a consistent cloud identification and analysis technique will be
essential for such forthcoming studies that will compare GMCs in the Local
Group galaxies to galaxies in the Virgo cluster.

dissipative energy losses and star formation. The dissipative effects are
evaluated from the initial gas fractions and from the orbital parameters via an

the progenitor properties, the model predicts the remnant stellar mass,
half-mass radius, and velocity dispersion to an accuracy of 25%. The model is

of the magnetic field in the filaments. From the mathematical point of view,the
presence of Frenet torsion in the filament is actually shown to be fundamental
for the breaking of conservation of magnetic helicity in the case of helicoidal

Actually the presence of torsion enhances the breaking of magnetic field
helicity conservation. A similar formula of the one obtained here without

Ramond-Ramond field radiation can dominate by many orders of magnitude over the
energy radiation via gravitational wave emission. The ratio of these two energy
loss mechanisms depends on the energy scale of inflation, the mass scale of
string theory and whether it is a single-throat or a multi-throat inflationary
scenario. This can have important consequences for the detection of cosmic
superstrings in the near future. It is argued that the bounds from cosmic
microwave background anisotropies and big bang nucleosynthesis are the dominant
cosmological sources to constrain the physical parameters of the network of
cosmic superstrings, whereas the role of the gravitational wave-based
experiments may be secondary.

of a dipole oscillation as a function of the lattice depth and temperature. The
damping rate increases with increasing lattice depth, which is consistent with
experimental observations. The magnitude of the damping rate is in reasonable

nonequilibrium entropy evolution equation we proved that a new entropy decrease
could spontaneously emerge in nonequilibrium system with internal attractive
interaction. This new entropy decrease coexists with the traditional law of
entropy increase, both of them countervail each other, so that the total
entropy of isolated system can be able to decrease. It not only makes isolated
system but also helps open system to produce self-organizing structure. We
first derived a statistical formula for this new entropy decrease rate, and
compared it both in mathematical form and in microscopic physical foundation
with the statistical formula for the law of entropy increase which was derived
by us some years ago. Furthermore, we gave the formulas for the time rate of
change of total entropy in isolated system and open system. The former is equal
to the sum of the formula for the law of entropy increase and the formula for
the new entropy decrease rate, the latter is the algebraic sum of the formulas

  Allemagne (2005)",,,"cs.AR",,"  As feature sizes shrink, it will be necessary to use AAPSM
(Alternating-Aperture Phase Shift Masking) to image critical features,
especially on the polysilicon layer. This imposes additional constraints on the
layouts beyond traditional design rules. Of particular note is the requirement
that all critical features be flanked by opposite-phase shifters, while the
shifters obey minimum width and spacing requirements. A layout is called
phase-assignable if it satisfies this requirement. If a layout is not
phase-assignable, the phase conflicts have to removed to enable the use of
AAPSM for the layout. Previous work has sought to detect a suitable set of
phase Conflicts to be removed, as well as correct them. The contribution of
this paper are the following: (1) a new approach to detect a minimal set of
phase conflicts (also referred to as AAPSM conflicts), which when corrected
will produce a phase-assignable layout; (2) a novel layout modification scheme
for correcting these AAPSM conflicts. The proposed approach for conflict
detection shows significant improvements in the quality of results and runtime
for real industrial circuits, when compared to previous methods. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first time layout modification results are presented
for bright-field AAPSM. Our experiments show that the percentage area increase

More importantly, we augment such EMM to providing correctness proofs, in

the correctness of a property up to a certain analysis depth of SAT-based BMC,

inductive proofs using SAT-based BMC for embedded memory systems. Similar to
the previous approach, we construct a verification model by eliminating memory

adding constraints on those signals at every analysis depth to preserve the
data forwarding semantics. The size of these EMM constraints depends
quadratically on the number of memory accesses and the number of read and write

characterize bars and disks by ellipse-fitting r-band images and applying
quantitative criteria. After excluding highly inclined ($>60^{\circ}$) systems,
we find the following results. (1) The optical r-band fraction (f_opt-r) of
barred galaxies, when averaged over the whole sample, is ~48%-52%. (2) When
galaxies are separated according to half light radius (r_e), or normalized
r_e/R_24, which is a measure of the bulge-to-disk (B/D) ratio, a remarkable

realized by formulating the problem as a Non-Linear Programming (NLP)

continued her career at the National Center for Education Statistics (1969 to
1974). She was active in starting international comparisons of education
outcomes in different countries, which has influenced educational policy in the
United States. Dorothy went on to serve in many capacities at the National

The particles perform undulator motion inside the crystals following the

operational principles are similar to those of the optical klystron. A more
simple one-crystal scheme is considered as well for the sake of comparison. It
is shown that the gamma ray amplification in the klystron scheme can be reached
at considerably lower particle densities than in the one-crystal scheme,

phenomenon. Three-dimensional radiation (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations
exhibit a mesh-like pattern of hot shock fronts and cool expanding post-shock
regions in the sub-canopy part of the inter-network. This domain might be
called ""fluctosphere"". The pattern is produced by propagating shock waves,
which are excited at the top of the convection zone and in the photospheric
overshoot layer. New high-resolution observations reveal a ubiquitous
small-scale pattern of bright structures and dark regions in-between. Although
it qualitatively resembles the picture seen in models, more observations - e.g.
with the future ALMA - are needed for thorough comparisons with present and
future models. Quantitative comparisons demand for synthetic intensity maps and
spectra for the three-dimensional (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations. The
necessary radiative transfer calculations, which have to take into account
deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium, are computationally very
involved so that no reliable results have been produced so far. Until this task
becomes feasible, we have to rely on careful qualitative comparisons of
simulations and observations. Here we discuss what effects have to be
considered for such a comparison. Nevertheless we are now on the verge of
assembling a comprehensive picture of the solar chromosphere in inter-network
regions as dynamic interplay of shock waves and structuring and guiding

contributes to the drug development process, especially in early phase studies.
This paper focuses on kinetic modeling in DCE-MRI, inspired by mixed-effects
models that are frequently used in the analysis of clinical trials. Instead of
summarizing each scanning session as a single kinetic parameter -- such as
median $\ktrans$ across all voxels in the tumor ROI -- we propose to analyze
all voxel time courses from all scans and across all subjects simultaneously in
a single model. The kinetic parameters from the usual non-linear regression
model are decomposed into unique components associated with factors from the
longitudinal study; e.g., treatment, patient and voxel effects. A Bayesian
hierarchical model provides the framework in order to construct a data model, a
parameter model, as well as prior distributions. The posterior distribution of
the kinetic parameters is estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods. Hypothesis testing at the study level for an overall treatment effect
is straightforward and the patient- and voxel-level parameters capture random
effects that provide additional information at various levels of resolution to
allow a thorough evaluation of the clinical trial. The proposed method is
validated with a breast cancer study, where the subjects were imaged before and
after two cycles of chemotherapy, demonstrating the clinical potential of this
method to longitudinal oncology studies.

account for the dynamic power expanded as a result of cache misses. Our results
show that one can often reduce overall power by increasing the size of the L2

that a two-level cache system with smaller L2's will yield less total leakage.
We further show that two Vth's and two T_{ox}'s are sufficient to get close to
an optimal solution, and that Vth is generally a better design knob than T_{ox}
for leakage optimization, thus it is better to restrict the number of T_{ox}'s

pi(+)p->pi(+)pi(+)n. Available data violate all three constraints for S, D^0,

asymptotic giant branch (AGB) evolutionary phase show significant orbital
eccentricities whereas current binary interaction models predict their orbits
to be circularised. We analyse how the orbital parameters in a system are
modified under mass loss and mass exchange among its binary components and
propose a model for enhanced mass-loss from the AGB star due to tidal
interaction with its companion, which allows a smooth transition between the
wind and Roche-lobe overflow mass-loss regimes. We explicitly follow its effect
along the orbit on the change of eccentricity and orbital semi-major axis, as
well as the effect of accretion by the companion. We calculate timescales for
the variation of these orbital parameters and compare them to the tidal
circularisation timescale. We find that in many cases, due to the enhanced mass
loss of the AGB component at orbital phases closer to the periastron, the net
eccentricity growth rate in one orbit is comparable to the rate of tidal
circularisation. We show that with this eccentricity enhancing mechanism it is
possible to reproduce the orbital period and eccentricity of the Sirius system,
which under the standard assumptions of binary interaction is expected to be
circularised. We also show that this mechanism may provide an explanation for
the eccentricities of most barium star systems, which are expected to be
circularised due to tidal dissipation. By proposing a tidally enhanced model of
mass loss from AGB stars we find a mechanism which efficiently works against
the tidal circularisation of the orbit, which explains the significant
eccentricities observed in binary systems containing a white dwarf and a less
evolved companion, such as Sirius and systems with barium stars.

the properties of the host galaxy, found to be consistent with those of massive
elliptical galaxies of M(R) ~ -24.7 for the one radio loud quasar, and M(R) ~
-23.8 for the two radio quiet quasars. When combined with existing data at
lower redshift, these new observations depict a scenario where the host
galaxies of radio loud quasars are seen to follow the expected trend of
luminous (~5L*) elliptical galaxies undergoing passive evolution. This trend is
remarkably similar to that followed by radio galaxies at z > 1.5. Radio quiet
quasars hosts also follow a similar trend but at a lower average luminosity
(~0.5 mag dimmer). The data indicate that quasar host galaxies are already
fully formed at epochs as early as ~2 Gyr after the Big Bang and then passively
fade in luminosity to the present epoch.

new massive gauge bosons, some of which mix with gauge bosons of the Standard
Model. For a range of mixing angles the coupling of gauge bosons to scalars can
become strong, ultimately resulting in a breakdown of perturbative calculation.
This phenomenon is studied in the Littlest Higgs model, where the approach to
strong dynamics is characterized by increasing tree-level decay widths of the
neutral Z_H boson to lighter gauge bosons plus multiple scalars. These
increasing widths suggest a distinctive qualitative collider signature for the
approach to the strong coupling regime of large Higgs and other scalar
multiplicities. In this work we catalog the kinematically allowed three-body
decays of the Z_H, and calculate the partial width of the process Z_H to Z_L H
H. This partial width is found to be larger than the comparable two-body decay
Z_H to Z_L H for values of the SU(2) mixing angle cosine(theta) less than 0.13,
indicating divergence of the littlest Higgs sigma field expansion at values of
cosine(theta) larger than a simple parametric calculation would suggest.
Additionally, we present analytical expressions for all two-body decays of the
Littlest Higgs Z_H gauge boson, including the effects of all final-state
masses.

multidimensional theories. Contrary to the usual perturbative expansion it is
renormalizable and contains only logarithmic divergencies. The price for it is
the presence of ghost states which, however, in certain cases do not contribute
to physical amplitudes. In this case the theory is unitary and one can
calculate the cross-sections. As an example we consider the differential cross
section of elastic $eq \to eq$ scattering in $D=7,11,...$-dimensional world. We
look also for the unification of the gauge couplings in multidimensional
Standard Model and its SUSY extension which takes place at energies lower than
in 4 dimensions.

  Internal State Selection",,,"10.1063/1.2800658",,"physics.chem-ph",,"  Calculations have been carried out for the vibrational quenching of excited
H$_2$ molecules which collide with Li$^+$ ions at ultralow energies. The
dynamics has been treated exactly using the well known quantum coupled-channel
expansions over different initial vibrational levels. The overall interaction
potential has been obtained from the calculations carried out earlier in our
group using highly correlated ab initio methods. The results indicate that
specific features of the scattering observables, e.g. the appearance of
Ramsauer-Townsend minima in elastic channel cross sections and the marked
increase of the cooling rates from specific initial states, can be linked to
potential properties at vanishing energies (sign and size of scattering
lengths) and to the presence of either virtual states or bound states. The
suggestion is made that by selecting the initial state preparation of the
molecular partners, the ionic interactions would be amenable to controlling
quenching efficiency at ultralow energies.

  Septembeer 2007, 4 pages",,,,"astro-ph",,"  There is a large body of work that has used the excellent Chandra
observations of nearby galaxies with neglible low mass X-ray binary (LMXB)
populations. This has culminated in a ``Universal'' X-ray luminosity function
(XLF) for high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). However, a number of methods have
been used to convert from source intensities to luminosities when creating
these XLFs. We have taken advantage of the XMM-Newton observations of the
nearby starbursting spiral galaxy NGC 253 to test some of these methods. We
find the luminosities derived from these various methods to vary by a factor of
$\sim$3. We also find the most influential factor in the conversion from
intensity to luminosity to be the absorption. We therefore conclude that a more
consistent approach is required for determining the true Universal XLF for
HMXBs. Ideally, this would involve individual spectral fitting of each X-ray
source. Certainly, the line-of-sight absorption should be determined from the
observations rather than assuming Galactic absorption. We find the best
approach for obtaining an XLF from low-count data to be the splitting of the
X-ray sources into two or more intensity intervals, and obtaining a conversion
from intensity to flux for each group from spectral modelling of the summed
spectrum of that group.

  Communications Journal",,,,"physics.comp-ph",,"  LAPACK and ScaLAPACK are arguably the defacto standard libraries among the
scientific community for solving linear algebra problems on sequential,

major design goal for the ScaLAPACK project; with respect to its predecessor
LAPACK; it is still a non-trivial exercise to develop a new code or modify an
existing LAPACK code to exploit processor grids, distributed-array descriptors
and the associated distributed-memory ScaLAPACK/PBLAS routines. In this paper,
we introduce what we believe will be an invaluable development tool for the
scientific code developer, which exploits ad-hoc polymorphism, derived-types,
optional arguments, overloaded operators and conditional compilation in Fortran
95, to provide wrappers to a subset of common linear algebra kernels. These
wrappers are introduced to facilitate the abstraction of low-level details
which are irrelevant to the science being performed, such as target platform
and execution model. By exploiting this high-level library interface, only a
single code source is required with mapping onto a diverse range of execution
models performed at link-time with no user modification. We conclude with a
case study whereby we describe application of the LAW library in the
implementation of the well-known Chebyshev Matrix Exponentiation algorithm for
Hermitian matrices.

the Dq/Dp model gives a holographic description of it. The rotational symmetry
of directions transverse to both of the Dq and Dp-branes can be identified with
a chiral symmetry, which is non-Abelian for certain cases. The asymptotic
distance between the Dq-branes and the Dp-brane corresponds to a quark mass. By
studying the probe Dp-brane dynamics in a Dq-brane background in the near
horizon and large N_c limit we find that the chiral symmetry is spontaneously
broken and there appear (pseudo-)Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We also discuss the
