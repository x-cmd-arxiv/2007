2000). Even for a flat Ewald sphere, we show how the ambiguities due to
Friedel's Law may be overcome. The method breaks down for photon counts below
about 10 per detector pixel, almost 3 orders of magnitude higher than expected
for scattering by a 500 kDa protein with an XFEL beam focused to a 0.1 micron
diameter spot. Even if 10**3 orientationally similar diffraction patterns could
be identified and added to reach the requisite photon count per pixel, the need
for about 10**6 orientational classes for high-resolution structure
determination suggests that about ~ 10**9 diffraction patterns must be
recorded. Assuming pulse and read-out rates of 100 Hz, such measurements would
require ~ 10**7 seconds, i.e. several months of continuous beam time.

comparing the measured ellipticity distributions with those obtained from Monte
Carlo simulations of projected, triaxial dark matter haloes with different axis
ratios. We find that the halo shape has a strong dependence on the halo mass.
While the haloes of low-mass groups are nearly spherical, those of massive
groups tend to be prolate. For groups containing at least four members, the
statistical distribution of their measured ellipticities does not have a strong
dependence on the colors of their central galaxies. Our analysis further shows
that the average three-dimensional axis ratio for haloes with $12<{\rm
log}[M/(h^{-1}M_{\odot})]\leq15$ is about $1:0.46:0.46$, resulting in a
projected axis ratio of $\sim 0.77$. Our results for the alignment between the

high-z. However, interpretation of data drawn from Lya alone hinges on the Lya
escape fraction which, due to the complex radiative transport, may vary
greatly. Here we map the Lya emission from local starburst Haro 11, a Lya
emitter and the only known candidate for low-z Lyman continuum emission (LyC).
To aid in the interpretation we perform a detailed multi-wavelength analysis
and model the stellar population, dust distribution, ionising photon budget,
and star-cluster population. We use archival X-ray observations to further
constrain properties of the starburst and estimate the HI column density.
  The Lya morphology is found to be strongly decoupled from stellar and nebular
(H-alpha) morphologies. General surface photometry finds only very slight
correlation between Lya and H-halpha, E(B-V), and stellar age. Only around the
central Lya-bright cluster do we find the Lya/Ha ratio at values predicted by
recombination theory. The total Lya escape fraction is found to be just 3%. We
compute that ~90% of the Lya photons that escape do so after undergoing
multiple resonance scattering events, masking their point of origin. This leads
to a largely symmetric distribution and, by increasing the distance that
photons must travel to escape, decreases the escape probability significantly.
While dust must ultimately be responsible for the destruction of Lya, it plays
little role in governing the observed morphology, which is regulated more by
ISM kinematics and geometry. We find tentative evidence for local Lya
equivalent width in the immediate vicinity of star-clusters being a function of
cluster age, consistent with hydrodynamic studies. We estimate the ionising
photon production and further constrain the escape fraction at 900 AA to <~9% .

part of the large scale (~15000 AU) E-W outflow. On the other hand, there is no
clear counterpart of the large scale NE-SW outflow in our SMA maps. Comparing
analytical models to the data suggests that the morphology and kinematics of
the small scale outflow can be explained by a wide-angle wind with an
inclination angle of ~30-40 degrees with respect to the plane of the sky. The
high resolution CO maps show that there are two compact, bright spots in the
blueshifted velocity range. An LVG analysis shows that the one located 1"" to

well as in certain branches of theoretical physics. We recall some of the
connections between the past and the present developments. Higher homotopies
were isolated within algebraic topology at least as far back as the 1940's.
Prompted by the failure of the Alexander-Whitney multiplication of cocycles to
be commutative, Steenrod developed certain operations which measure this
failure in a coherent manner. Dold and Lashof extended Milnor's classifying
space construction to associative H-spaces, and a careful examination of this
extension led Stasheff to the discovery of An-spaces and Ainfty-spaces as
notions which control the failure of associativity in a coherent way so that
the classifying space construction can still be pushed through. Algebraic
versions of higher homotopies have, as we all know, led Kontsevich eventually
to the proof of the formality conjecture. Homological perturbation theory
(HPT), in a simple form first isolated by Eilenberg and Mac Lane in the early
1950's, has nowadays become a standard tool to handle algebraic incarnations of
higher homotopies. A basic observation is that higher homotopy structures
behave much better relative to homotopy than strict structures, and HPT enables
one to exploit this observation in various concrete situations which, in
particular, leads to the effective calculation of various invariants which are
otherwise intractable. Higher homotopies abound but they are rarely recognized
explicitly and their significance is hardly understood; at times, their
appearance might at first glance even come as a surprise, for example in the
Kodaira-Spencer approach to deformations of complex manifolds or in the theory
of foliations.

groupoid upon choosing a basepoint. A combinatorial model for this, the mapping
class groupoid, arises from the invariant cell decomposition of Teichm\""uller

rationally and integrally. The techniques of proof include several algorithms

explicit formulae depending upon six essential cases, and the kernel and image

resolution over a broad energy range, is produced mainly by two methods: the
Modified High-Pressure Bridgman (MHB) and the High-Pressure Bridgman (HPB)
process. This study is based on MHB CZT substrates from the company Orbotech
Medical Solutions Ltd. with a detector size of 2.0x2.0x0.5 cm^3, 8x8 pixels and
a pitch of 2.46 mm. Former studies have emphasized only on the cathode material
showing that high-work-function improve the energy resolution at lower
energies. Therfore, we studied the influence of the anode material while
keeping the cathode material constant. We used four different materials:
Indium, Titanium, Chromium and Gold with work-functions between 4.1 eV and 5.1
eV. The low work-function materials Indium and Titanium achieved the best
performance with energy resolutions: 2.0 keV (at 59 keV) and 1.9 keV (at 122
keV) for Titanium; 2.1 keV (at 59 keV) and 2.9 keV (at 122 keV) for Indium.
These detectors are very competitive compared with the more expensive ones
based on HPB material if one takes the large pixel pitch of 2.46 mm into
account. We present a detailed comparison of our detector response with 3-D
simulations, from which we determined the mobility-lifetime-products for
electrons and holes. Finally, we evaluated the temperature dependency of the
detector performance and mobility-lifetime-products, which is important for
many applications. With decreasing temperature down to -30C the breakdown
voltage increases and the electron mobility-lifetime-product decreases by about
30% over a range from 20C to -30C. This causes the energy resolution to
deteriorate, but the concomitantly increasing breakdown voltage makes it
possible to increase the applied bias voltage and restore the full performance.

structure containing bright, compact features embedded in a comparatively weak,
extended base can be further improved using a difference-mapping method, which
requires a generalization of MEM for the reconstruction of sign-variable
functions.We draw conclusions based on the results of numerical simulations for
a number of model radio sources with various morphologies.

arises by linearizing the geodesic equation around some chosen geodesic, where
the linearization is done with respect to the coordinates and the velocities.
The generalized Jacobi equation, introduced by Hodgkinson in 1972 and further
developed by Mashhoon and others, arises if the linearization is done only with
respect to the coordinates, but not with respect to the velocities. The
resulting equation has been studied by several authors in some detail for
timelike geodesics in a Lorentzian manifold. Here we begin by briefly
considering the generalized Jacobi equation on affine manifolds, without a
metric; then we specify to lightlike geodesics in a Lorentzian manifold. We
illustrate the latter case by considering particular lightlike geodesics (a) in
Schwarzschild spacetime and (b) in a plane-wave spacetime.

non-thermal energy spectra, and most of them have point-like features at their

measured X-ray flux from an individual filament in the 2-10 keV band is $\sim
2.8\times10^{-14}$ to $10^{-13}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and the
absorption-corrected X-ray luminosity is $\sim 10^{32}-10^{33}$ ergs s$^{-1}$

filaments by morphologies and by comparing their X-ray images with the
corresponding radio and infrared images. On the basis of combined information
available, we suspect that these X-ray filaments might be pulsar wind nebulae
(PWNe) associated with pulsars of age $10^3 \sim 3\times 10^5$ yr. The fact
that most of the filament tails point outward may further suggest a high
velocity wind blowing away form the GC.

as the Leggett's collective mode arising from the fluctuation in the relative
phase between two superconducting condensates residing on corresponding bands.
The temperature and field dependencies of the superconducting features have
been established. A phononic Raman scattering study of the E2g boron stretching
mode anharmonicity and of superconductivity induced self-energy effects is
presented. We show that anharmonic two phonon decay is mainly responsible for
the unusually large linewidth of the E2g mode. We observe ~2.5% hardening of
the E2g phonon frequency upon cooling into the superconducting state and
estimate the electron-phonon coupling strength associated with this
renormalization.

longstanding H-Tc-superconductivity problem using a non-perturbative method,
the Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT), capable to go beyond standard
perturbation-theory techniques. DMFT is by construction a local theory which
neglects spatial correlation. Experiments have however shown that the latter is
a fundamental property of cuprate materials. In a first step, we approach the
problem of spatial correlation in the normal state of cuprate materials using a
phenomenological Fermi-Liquid-Boltzmann model. We then introduce and develop in
detail an extension to DMFT, the Cellular Dynamical Mean Field Theory (CDMFT),
capable of considering short-ranged spatial correlation in a system, and we
implement it using the exact diagonalization algorithm . After benchmarking
CDMFT with the exact one-dimensional solution of the Hubbard Model, we employ
it to study the density-driven Mott metal-insulator transition in the
two-dimensional Hubbard Model, focusing in particular on the anomalous
properties of the doped normal state close to the Mott insulator. We finally
study the superconducting state. We show that within CDMFT the one-band Hubbard
Model supports a d-wave superconductive state, which strongly departs from the
standard BCS theory. We conjecture a link between the instabilities found in
the normal state and the onset of superconductivity.
