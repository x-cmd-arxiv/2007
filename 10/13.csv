in high energy physics since they are excellently suited to study the internal
hadronic structure. To analyze such processes the knowledge of the hadron
distribution amplitudes, which are universal for different reactions, is
essential. Only rather indirect information on these nonperturbative functions
can be obtained from measurements. In this work we report on a lattice QCD
computation of moments of nucleon distribution amplitudes using suitable
three-quark operators. However, these operators have to be renormalized and the
mixing is even more complicated than in the continuum. Using the symmetry group
of the hypercubic lattice we therefore derive and implement irreducibly
transforming three-quark operators, which allow us to control the mixing
pattern and will finally lead to quantitative predictions in the MSbar scheme.
We present preliminary results for leading-twist and next-to-leading twist
nucleon distribution amplitudes based on the QCDSF/UKQCD simulations with 2
flavors of dynamical clover fermions.

much attention in recent years. A large amount of work focused on the impact
that the inertia and the dissipative dynamics of the particles have on their
dynamical and statistical properties. Substantial progress followed from the
study of suspensions in model flows which, although much simpler, reproduce
most of the important mechanisms observed in real turbulence. This paper
presents recent developments made on the relative motion of a pair of particles
suspended in time-uncorrelated and spatially self-similar Gaussian flows. This
review is complemented by new results. By introducing a time-dependent Stokes
number, it is demonstrated that inertial particle relative dispersion recovers
asymptotically Richardson's diffusion associated to simple tracers. A
perturbative (homogeneization) technique is used in the small-Stokes-number
asymptotics and leads to interpreting first-order corrections to tracer
dynamics in terms of an effective drift. This expansion implies that the
correlation dimension deficit behaves linearly as a function of the Stokes
number. The validity and the accuracy of this prediction is confirmed by
numerical simulations.

structure of two magnetospheric disk segments of the prototypical Bp star sigma
Ori E (B2p) as these segments occult portions of the star during the rotational
cycle. High-resolution spectra of the Balmer lines >H9 and Balmer edge were
obtained on seven nights in January-February 2007 at an average sampling of
0.01 cycles. We measured equivalent width variations due to the star
occultations by two disk segments 0.4 cycles apart and constructed differential
spectra of the migrations of the corresponding absorptions across the Balmer
line profiles. We first estimated the rotational and magnetic obliquity angles.
We then simulated the observed Balmer jump variation using the model atmosphere
codes synspec/circus and evaluated the disk geometry and gas thermodynamics. We
find that the two occultations are caused by two disk segments. The first of
these transits quickly, indicating that the segment resides in a range of
distances, perhaps 2.5-6R_star, from the star. The second consists of a more
slowly moving segment situated closer to the surface and causing two
semi-resolved absorbing maxima. During its transit this segment brushes across
the star's ""lower"" limb. Judging from the line visibility up to H23-H24 during
the occultations, both disk segments have mean densities near 10^{12} cm^{-3}
and are opaque in the lines and continuum. They have semiheights less than 1/2
of a stellar radius, and their temperatures are near 10500K and 12000K,
respectively. In all, the disks of Bp stars have a much more complicated
geometry than has been anticipated, as evidenced by their (sometimes)
non-coplanarity, de-centerness, and from star to star, differences in disk
height.

reliable broadcast on a radio network under the following popular model. Each
node in the network is located on a point in a two dimensional grid, and
whenever a node sends a message, all awake nodes within distance r receive the
message. In the broadcast problem, some node wants to successfully send a
message to all other nodes in the network even when up to a 1/2 fraction of the
nodes within every neighborhood can be deleted by an adversary. The set of
deleted nodes is carefully chosen by the adversary to foil our algorithm and
moreover, the set of deleted nodes may change periodically. This models
worst-case behavior due to mobile nodes, static nodes losing power or simply
some points in the grid being unoccupied. A trivial solution requires each node
in the network to be awake roughly 1/2 the time, and a trivial lower bound
shows that each node must be awake for at least a 1/n fraction of the time. Our
first result is an algorithm that requires each node to be awake for only a
1/sqrt(n) fraction of the time in expectation. Our algorithm achieves this
while ensuring correctness with probability 1, and keeping optimal values for
other resource costs such as latency and number of messages sent. We give a
lower-bound that shows that this reduction in power consumption is
asymptotically optimal when latency and number of messages sent must be
optimal. If we can increase the latency and messages sent by only a log*n
factor we give a Las Vegas algorithm that requires each node to be awake for
only a (log*n)/n expected fraction of the time; we give a lower-bound showing
that this second algorithm is near optimal. Finally, we show how to ensure
energy-efficient broadcast in the presence of Byzantine faults.

fourfold and of certain related surfaces. We present the physical argument
leading to the identity, and a mathematical derivation of a Chern class
identity which confirms it, after taking into account singularities of the
relevant loci. This identity of Chern classes holds in arbitrary dimension, and
for varieties that are not necessarily Calabi-Yau. Singularities are essential
in both the physics and the mathematics arguments: the tadpole relation may be
interpreted as an identity involving stringy invariants of a singular
hypersurface, and corrections for the presence of pinch-points. The
mathematical discussion is streamlined by the use of Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson
classes of singular varieties. We also show how the main identity may be
obtained by applying `Verdier specialization' to suitable constructible
functions.

predictions, thermally induced magnetization reversal can have one of two
intermediate states: either constant or soliton-like saddle configurations,
depending on ring size and externally applied magnetic field. The results
confirm analytical predictions of a transition in thermally activated reversal
behavior as magnetic field is varied at constant ring size. Simulations also
show that the analytic one dimensional model continues to hold even for wide

mind uploading. That process suggested as a way to achieve resurrection of

core mental functions, which migrate from a human brain to an artificial
environment. To simulate the process, I suggest a topological approach which is
based on a formalism of information geometry. Geometrical formalism lets us
simulate the toy mind as geometrical structures as well as gives us powerful
geometrical and topological methods for analysis of the information system.
This approach leads to the insight about using holographic model as an analogy
for the mind migration to an artificial environment. This model represents the
toy mind functionality in terms of information geometry (as a geometrical
shape) on information manifold. Such shape can have distributed holographic
representation. This representation gives us delocalized representation of the
system. At the same time, the process of creating the holographic
representation gives us a strategy to migrate from original to an artificial
environment and back. The interface between brain and an environment is modeled
as an entropy flow which is defined as a geometrical flow on information
manifold. Such flow is an analogy of holography recording for the toy mind. The
opposite process of holography reconstruction is modeled by none-local
Hamiltonians defined on the information manifold.

recently formed. From the magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch, we
measure a distance to CGCG 269-049 of only 4.9 +/- 0.4 Mpc. The spectral energy
distribution of the galaxy between ~3.6 - 70 microns is also best fitted by

irradiated close-in giant planets. The atmospheres of these planets naturally
fall into two classes that are somewhat analogous to the M- and L-type dwarfs.
Those that are warm enough to have appreciable opacity due to TiO and VO gases
we term the ``pM Class'' planets, and those that are cooler we term ``pL
Class'' planets. We calculate model atmospheres for these planets, including
pressure-temperature profiles, spectra, and characteristic radiative time
constants. We show that pM Class planets have hot stratospheres $\sim$2000 K
and appear ``anomalously'' bright in the mid infrared secondary eclipse, as was
recently found for planets HD 149026b and HD 209458b. This class of planets
absorbs incident flux and emits thermal flux from high in their atmospheres.
Consequently, they will have large day/night temperature contrasts and
negligible phase shifts between orbital phase and thermal emission light
curves, because radiative timescales are much shorter than possible dynamical
timescales. The pL Class planets absorb incident flux deeper in the atmosphere
where atmospheric dynamics will more readily redistribute absorbed energy. This
will lead to cooler day sides, warmer night sides, and larger phase shifts in
thermal emission light curves. Around a Sun-like primary this boundary occurs
at $\sim$0.04-0.05 AU. The eccentric transiting planets HD 147506b and HD
17156b alternate between the classes. Thermal emission in the optical from pM
Class planets is significant red-ward of 400 nm, making these planets
attractive targets for optical detection. The difference in the observed
day/night contrast between ups Andromeda b (pM Class) and HD 189733b (pL Class)
is naturally explained in this scenario. (Abridged.)

generates spurious stylized facts, fat tails and a Hurst exponent H_s=1/2, when

nonstationarity arises from systematic uneveness in noise traders' behavior.
Spurious results arise mathematically from using a log increment with a
'sliding window'. We explain why a hard to beat market demands martingale
dynamics , and martingales with nonlinear variance generate nonstationary
increments. The nonstationarity is exhibited directly for Euro/Dollar FX data.
We observe that the Hurst exponent H_s generated by the using the sliding
window technique on a time series plays the same role as does Mandelbrot's
Joseph exponent. Finally, Mandelbrot originally assumed that the 'badly

purpose of this paper is to show that, as long as the laser-detector system is
strictly stationary, quantization of the optical field is not required to
explain such phenomena. The theory presented here is semi-classical, yet exact.
Previous theories considering excited-state atoms regularly-injected in
resonators, on the other hand, do require in principle light quantization.
Specifically, we consider a laser involving a single electron permanently
interacting with the field and driven by a constant-potential battery, and
point out a similarity with reflex klystrons. The detected noise is found to be
only 7/8 of the shot-noise level. It is therefore sub-Poissonian. Our
calculations are related to resonance-fluorescence treatments but with
different physical interpretations.

the cases for $\Xi^0_{bb}, \Xi_{bb}^-$ which have not been observed yet, but
one can expect to find them when LHCb begins running. Our numerical results

therefore if such modes are observed at LHCb, there must be a new physics other

derived from the dissociation rate of vortex-antivortex pairs in a 2D film,

model for two-arm experimental studies with possible non-compliance in which
the effect of the treatment is measured by a binary response variable. We show
that, when non-compliance may only be observed in the treatment arm, the effect
(measured on the logit scale) of the treatment on compliers and that of the
control on non-compliers can be identified and consistently estimated under
mild conditions. The same does not happen for the effect of the control on
compliers. A simple correction of the conditional logistic estimator is then
proposed which allows us to considerably reduce its bias in estimating this
quantity and the causal effect of the treatment over control on compliers. A
two-step estimator results whose asymptotic properties are studied by
exploiting the general theory on maximum likelihood estimation of misspecified
models. Finite-sample properties of the estimator are studied by simulation and
the extension to the case of missing responses is outlined. The approach is
illustrated by an application to a dataset deriving from a study on the
efficacy of a training course on the practise of breast self examination.

the Russian astronomer E.V. Pitjeva in a global fit of almost one century of
data with the EPM2004 ephemerides, in order to put on the test the expression
for the perihelion precession induced by an uniform cosmological constant
Lambda in the framework of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (or Kottler) space-time.
We compare such an extra-rate to the estimated corrections to the planetary
perihelion precessions by taking their ratio for different pairs of planets
instead of using one perihelion at a time for each planet separately, as done
so far in literature. The answer is neatly negative, even by further re-scaling
by a factor 10 (and even 100 for Saturn) the errors in the estimated
extra-precessions of the perihelia released by Pitjeva. Our conclusions hold
also for any other metric perturbation having the same dependence on the
spatial coordinates, as those induced by other general relativistic
cosmological scenarios and by many modified models of gravity. Currently
ongoing and planned interplanetary spacecraft-based missions should improve our
knowledge of the planets' orbits allowing for more stringent constraints.
