chiral supergravity. The conical 3-brane singularities are resolved by
introducing cylindrical codimension one 4-branes whose interiors are capped by
a regular spacetime. The effective theory is described by the Brans-Dicke (BD)
theory with the BD parameter given by $\omega_{\rm BD}=1/2$. The BD field is
originated from a modulus which is associated with the scaling symmetry of the
system. If the dilaton potentials on the branes preserve the scaling symmetry,
the scalar field has an exponential potential in the Einstein frame. We show
that the time dependent solutions driven by the modulus in the four-dimensional
effective theory can be lifted up to the six-dimensional exact solutions found
in the literature. Based on the effective theory, we discuss a possible way to
stabilize the modulus to recover standard cosmology and also study the
implication for the cosmological constant problem.

the coupling constant relevant for the decay of a preheat matter field into
Fermions. The resulting power spectrum is scale invariant if $\xi$ remains
close to a scaling solution in new ekpyrotic models of the universe; by
construction the spectrum is independent of the detailed physics near the
bounce. The process differs from the curvaton mechanism, which has been used
recently to revive the ekpyrotic scenario, in that no peculiar behavior of
$\xi$ shortly before or during the bounce is needed. In addition, a concrete
and efficient realization of reheating after ekpyrosis is provided; this
mechanism is not tied to ekpyrotic models, but could equally well be used in
other setups, for instance inflationary ones. We estimate non-Gaussianities and
find no additional contributions in the most simple realizations, in contrast
to models using the curvaton mechanism.

stable under the new parity becoming a new dark matter candidate. Up to three
massive particles can be stable in the presence of the R-parity and the

motion which then produces a trace, a continuous fractal curve connecting the
singular points of the motion. If jumps are added to the driving function, the
trace branches. In a recent publication [1] we introduced a generalized SLE
driven by a superposition of a Brownian motion and a fractal set of jumps
(technically a stable L\'evy process). We then discussed the small-scale
properties of the resulting L\'evy-SLE growth process. Here we discuss the same
model, but focus on the global scaling behavior which ensues as time goes to
infinity. This limiting behavior is independent of the Brownian forcing and
depends upon only a single parameter, $\alpha$, which defines the shape of the
stable L\'evy distribution. We learn about this behavior by studying a
Fokker-Planck equation which gives the probability distribution for endpoints
of the trace as a function of time. As in the short-time case previously
studied, we observe that the properties of this growth process change
qualitatively and singularly at $\alpha =1$. We show both analytically and
numerically that the growth continues indefinitely in the vertical direction
for $\alpha > 1$, goes as $\log t$ for $\alpha = 1$, and saturates for $\alpha<
1$. The probability density has two different scales corresponding to
directions along and perpendicular to the boundary. In the former case, the
characteristic scale is $X(t) \sim t^{1/\alpha}$. In the latter case the scale
is $Y(t) \sim A + B t^{1-1/\alpha}$ for $\alpha \neq 1$, and $Y(t) \sim \ln t$
for $\alpha = 1$. Scaling functions for the probability density are given for
various limiting cases.

reemission/scattering is that a pressure is applied to the disc surface where
the local optical depth is of order unity, we determine the response of the
vertical structure and the influence it has on the possibility of instability
to warping. We derive a pair of equations describing the evolution of a small
tilt as a function of radius in the small amplitude regime that applies to both
the diffusive and bending wave regimes. We also study the non linear vertical
response of the disc numerically using an analogous one dimensional slab model.
For global warps, we find that in order for the disc vertical structure to
respond as a quasi uniform shift or tilt, as has been assumed in previous work,
the product of the ratio of the external radiation momentum flux to the local
disc mid plane pressure, where it is absorbed, with the disc aspect ratio
should be significantly less than unity. Namely, this quantity should be of the
order of or smaller than the ratio of the disc gas density corresponding to the
layer intercepting radiation to the mid plane density, $\lambda \ll 1$. When
this condition is not satisfied the disc surface tends to adjust so that the
local normal becomes perpendicular to the radiation propagation direction. In
this case dynamical quantities determined by the disc twist and warp tend to
oscillate with a large characteristic period $T_{*}\sim \lambda^{-1}T_{K}$,
where $T_{K}$ is some 'typical' orbital period of a gas element in the disc.
The possibility of warping instability then becomes significantly reduced. In
addition, when the vertical response is non uniform, the possible production of
shocks may lead to an important dissipation mechanism.

matter at finite temperature within a self-consistent coupled-channel approach.
The meson-baryon interactions are adopted from a type of broken SU(4) s-wave
Tomozawa-Weinberg terms supplemented by an attractive scalar-isoscalar
attraction. The in-medium solution at finite temperature incorporates Pauli
blocking effects, mean-field binding on all the baryons involved, and $\pi$ and
open-charm meson self-energies in a self-consistent manner. In the $DN$ sector,
the $\Lambda_c$ and $\Sigma_c$ resonances, generated dynamically at 2593 MeV
and 2770 MeV in free space, remain close to their free-space position while
acquiring a remarkable width due to the thermal smearing of Pauli blocking as
well as from the nuclear matter density effects. As a result, the $D$ meson
spectral density shows a single pronounced peak for energies close to the $D$
meson free-space mass that broadens with increasing matter density with an
extended tail particularly towards lower energies. The $\bar D$ potential shows
a moderate repulsive behavior coming from the dominant I=1 contribution of the
$\bar D N$ interaction. The low-density theorem is, however, not a good
approximation for the $\bar D$ self-energy in spite of the absence of
resonance-hole contributions close to threshold in this case. We speculate the
possibility of $D$-mesic nuclei as well as discuss some consequences for the
$J/\Psi$ suppression in heavy-ion collisions, in particular for the future CBM
experiment at FAIR.

is an oscillatory function of the barrier width. Spin filtering is most
effective, if the Fermi energy is close to the barrier height.

influencing the mean zonal motion is studied. We found an evidence that the
emergence of compact magnetic regions locally accelerates the rotation of

show that active regions in the equatorial region emerge exhibiting a constant

caused by the tearing instability forming the blob. The electric field reaches
into the fast solar wind and interacts with it, causing a viscous drag that is
global in nature rather than local across fluid layers as it is the case in
normal uncharged fluids (like water). Second, the presence of a magnetic cusp
at the tip of a coronal helmet streamer causes a converging of the flows on the

solar wind, resulting in a more efficient momentum exchange.

  NO. 1, MARCH 2009 pp.59-69","10.1109/TIFS.2008.2012201",,"cs.IT cs.CR math.IT",,"  This work adopts an information theoretic framework for the design of
collusion-resistant coding/decoding schemes for digital fingerprinting. More
specifically, the minimum distance decision rule is used to identify 1 out of t
pirates. Achievable rates, under this detection rule, are characterized in two
distinct scenarios. First, we consider the averaging attack where a random
coding argument is used to show that the rate 1/2 is achievable with t=2
pirates. Our study is then extended to the general case of arbitrary $t$
highlighting the underlying complexity-performance tradeoff. Overall, these
results establish the significant performance gains offered by minimum distance
decoding as compared to other approaches based on orthogonal codes and
correlation detectors. In the second scenario, we characterize the achievable
rates, with minimum distance decoding, under any collusion attack that
satisfies the marking assumption. For t=2 pirates, we show that the rate
$1-H(0.25)\approx 0.188$ is achievable using an ensemble of random linear
codes. For $t\geq 3$, the existence of a non-resolvable collusion attack, with
minimum distance decoding, for any non-zero rate is established. Inspired by
our theoretical analysis, we then construct coding/decoding schemes for
fingerprinting based on the celebrated Belief-Propagation framework. Using an
explicit repeat-accumulate code, we obtain a vanishingly small probability of
misidentification at rate 1/3 under averaging attack with t=2. For collusion
attacks which satisfy the marking assumption, we use a more sophisticated
accumulate repeat accumulate code to obtain a vanishingly small
misidentification probability at rate 1/9 with t=2. These results represent a
marked improvement over the best available designs in the literature.

the present paper, we assume that the spacetime has symmetries corresponding to
the isometries of an $(n-2)$-dimensional maximally symmetric space and the
Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant is non-negative. Depending on the existence or
absence of the general relativistic limit, solutions are classified into GR and
non-GR branches, respectively. Assuming the null energy condition on matter
fields, we show that a future outer trapping horizon in the GR branch possesses
the same properties as that in general relativity. In contrast, that in the
non-GR branch is shown to be non-spacelike with its area non-increasing into
the future. We can recognize this peculiar behavior to arise from a fact that
the null energy condition necessarily leads to the null convergence condition
for radial null vectors in the GR branch, but not in the non-GR branch. The
energy balance law yields the first law of a trapping horizon, from which we
can read off the entropy of a trapping horizon reproducing Iyer-Wald's
expression. The entropy of a future outer trapping horizon is shown to be
non-decreasing in both branches along its generator.

controlled by two phases alpha and beta. The similar consideration is extended
to N blind to the mu-tau symmetry. It is argued that N subject (blind) to the

restrict ourselves to mu-tau symmetric textures giving the tri-bimaximal mixing
and calculate flavor neutrino masses to estimate CP-violating Dirac and
Majorana phases as well as neutrino mixing angles as functions of alpha and
beta. Since alpha and beta are generated by mu-tau symmetry breaking

to be at most O(0.1) radian. On the other hand, CP-violating Dirac phase tends
to show a proportionality to alpha or to beta.

periodic signal and noise in a bistable system. A periodic signal produces
switching between two stable states by lowering the potential barrier. Even if
the amplitude of the signal is not large enough to make the potential barrier
disappear, the switching can occur with the help of noise. As a result, an
output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which shows how much the switching is
synchronized with the signal, can be enhanced by increasing the noise. We have
formulated the SR in a single electron turnstile into the adiabatic two-state
theory of McNamara-Wiesenfeld and confirmed its manifestation by numerical
simulation. These results could be applied to detection of the periodic motion
of very small electric charge under noisy environment.

help explain the structure dependence of the minimum conductivity observed
experimentally even if the samples were purely ballistic. Contact induced
states are similar to the well-known metal induced gap states (MIGS) in
metal-semiconductor Schottky junctions, which typically penetrate only a few
atomic lengths into the semiconductor, while the depth of penetration decreases
with increasing band gap. However, in graphene we find that these states
penetrate a much longer distance of the order of the width of the contacts. As
a result, ballistic graphene samples with a length less than their width can
exhibit a resistance proportional to length that is not Ohmic in origin, but
arises from a reduced role of contact-induced states. While actual samples are
probably not ballistic and involve scattering processes, our results show that
these contact induced effects need to be taken into account in interpreting
experiments and minimum conductivity depends strongly on the structure and
configuration (two- vs. four-terminal) used.

addressed, where better synchronizability means that the network synchronizes

equilibrium synchronization case, it is shown that there is a close
relationship between the L2 norm of the error vector e and the H2 norm of the

drive the whole network to its equilibrium point and meanwhile minimize the L2

requires multiple mutations. The intermediate steps in such evolutionary
trajectories are likely to be selectively neutral or deleterious. Therefore,
large populations and long times may be required to evolve such traits. We
propose that errors in transcription and translation may allow selection for
the intermediate mutations if the final trait provides a large enough selective
advantage. We test this hypothesis using a population based model of protein
evolution. If an individual acquires one of two mutations needed for a novel
trait, the second mutation can be introduced into the phenotype due to
transcription and translation errors. If the novel trait is advantageous
enough, the allele with only one mutation will spread through the population,
even though the gene sequence does not yet code for the complete trait. The
first mutation then has a higher frequency than expected without phenotypic
mutations giving the second mutation a higher probability of fixation. Thus,
errors allow protein sequences to ''look-ahead'' for a more direct path to a
complex trait.

  additional item of discussion added, typos corrected",,,"Report of Theory Group of LNGS No 3, 2007","astro-ph",,"  The transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays is discussed. One
of critical indications for transition is given by the Standard Model of
Galactic cosmic rays, according to which the maximum energy of acceleration for
iron nuclei is of order of $E_{\rm Fe}^{\rm max} \approx 1\times 10^{17}$ eV.
At $E > E_{\rm Fe}^{\rm max}$ the spectrum is predicted to be very steep and
thus the Standard Model favours the transition at energy not much higher than
$E_{\rm Fe}^{\rm max}$. As observations are concerned there are two signatures
of transition: change of energy spectra and elongation rate (depth of shower
maximum in the atmosphere $X_{\rm max}$ as function of energy). Three models of
transition are discussed: dip-based model, mixed composition model and ankle
model. In the latter model the transition occurs at the observed spectral
feature, ankle, which starts at $E_a \approx 1\times 10^{19}$ eV and is
characterised by change of mass compostion from galactic iron to extragalactic
protons. In the dip model the transition occures at the second knee observed at
energy $(4 -8)\times 10^{17}$ eV and is characterised by change of mass
composition from galactic iron to extragalactic protons. The mixed composition
model describes transition at $E \sim 3\times 10^{18}$ eV with mass composition
changing from galactic iron to extragactic mixed composition of different
nuclei. These models are confronted with observational data on spectra and
elongation rates from different experiments, including Auger.

Livermore Atomic Code) suite for the transitions rates, in the zero-temperature
radiation field hypothesis. Two variants of the model are presented: the first
one is configuration averaged, while the second one is a detailed level
version. Comparisons are made between them in the case of a carbon plasma; they
show that the configuration-averaged code gives correct results for an
electronic temperature Te=10 eV (or higher) but fails at lower temperatures
such as Te=1 eV. The validity of the configuration-averaged approximation is
discussed: the intuitive criterion requiring that the average
configuration-energy dispersion must be less than the electron thermal energy
turns out to be a necessary but far from sufficient condition. Another
condition based on the resolution of a modified rate-equation system is
proposed. Its efficiency is emphasized in the case of low-temperature plasmas.
Finally, it is shown that near-threshold autoionization cascade processes may
induce a severe failure of the configuration-average formalism.

morphologies from spirals to mergers over the entire infrared luminosity range.
The present study is based on optical IFS obtained with the VIMOS instrument on
the VLT. The first results of this survey are presented here with the study of
two galaxies representative of the two major morphological types observed in
(U)LIRGs, interacting pairs and morphologically- regular, weakly-interacting
spirals, respectively. We have found that IRAS 06076-2139 consists of two
low-intermediate mass (0.15 and 0.4 m*) galaxies with relative velocities of ~
550 km/s and, therefore, it is unlikely that they will merge. The VIMOS IFS has
also discovered the presence of a rapidly expanding and rotating ring of gas in
the southern galaxy (Gs), likely due to a nearly central head-on passage of an
intruder about 140 million years ago. IRASF 12115-4656 is a spiral for which we
have found a mass of 1.2 m*. The neutral gas (traced by the NaI doublet) and
ionized gas components are spatially and kinematically decoupled. The analysis
presented here illustrates the full potential of IFS in two important aspects:
(i) the study of the kinematics and ionization structure of complex
interacting/merging systems, and (2i) the study of the kinematics of the
different gas phases, neutral (cool) and ionized (warm), traced by the NaD and
Halpha lines, respectively. (abbreviated)

temperature. The effects of site diagonal disorder on the above properties have
been investigated. The disorder is found to suppress the kinetic energy and the
Drude weight, reduces the spatial extension of the polaron, and makes the
large-to-small polaron crossover smoother. Increasing temperature also plays
similar role. For strong coupling the kinetic energy arises mainly from the
incoherent hopping processes owing to the motion of electrons within the
polaron and is almost independent of the disorder strength. From the coherent

the incoherent part dominates is determined as a function of e-ph coupling

the terminal value of a cumulative gains process. The problem of modelling and
pricing such an asset and associated derivatives is important, for example, in
the determination of optimal insurance claims reserve policies, and in the
pricing of reinsurance contracts. In the insurance setting, the aggregate
claims play the role of the cumulative gains, and the terminal cash flow
represents the totality of the claims payable for the given accounting period.
A similar example arises when we consider the accumulation of losses in a
credit portfolio, and value a contract that pays an amount equal to the
totality of the losses over a given time interval. An explicit expression for
the value process is obtained. The price of an Arrow-Debreu security on the
cumulative gains process is determined, and is used to obtain a closed-form
expression for the price of a European-style option on the value of the asset.
The results obtained make use of various remarkable properties of the gamma
bridge process, and are applicable to a wide variety of financial products
based on cumulative gains processes such as aggregate claims, credit portfolio
losses, defined-benefit pension schemes, emissions, and rainfall.

the direction of the young sigma Orionis cluster, is still under debate. We
intend to disentangle whether it is a field brown dwarf or a 3-Myr old
planetary-mass member of the cluster. We report on near-infrared JHK_s and
mid-infrared [3.6] and [4.5] IRAC/Spitzer photometry recently obtained for S
Ori 70. The new near-infrared images (taken 3.82 yr after the discovery data)
have allowed us to derive a very small proper motion (11.0 +/- 5.9 mas/yr) for
this object, which is consistent with the proper motion of the cluster within
1.5 sigma the astrometric uncertainty. The colors (H-K_s), (J-K_s) and
K_s-[3.6] appear discrepant when compared to T4-T7 dwarfs in the field. This
behavior could be ascribed to a low-gravity atmosphere or alternatively to an
atmosphere with a metallicity significantly different than solar. Taking into
account the small proper motion of S Ori 70 and its new near- and mid-infrared
colors, a low-gravity atmosphere remains as the most likely explanation to
account for our observations. This supports S Ori 70's membership in sigma
Orionis, with an estimated mass in the interval 2-7 Mjup, in agreement with our
previous derivation.

and Small Magellanic Clouds (SMC) are presented. The PL diagrams are plotted in
three planes: logP-K_S, logP-W_{JK}, and logP-W_I. Fourteen PL sequences are
distinguishable, and some of them consist of three closely spaced ridges. Each
of the sequences is fitted with a linear or quadratic function. The
similarities and differences between the PL relations in both galaxies are
discussed for four types of red giant variability: OGLE Small Amplitude Red
Giants (OSARGs), Miras and Semiregular Variables (SRVs), Long Secondary Periods
(LSPs) and ellipsoidal variables. We propose a new method of separating OSARGs
from non-variable stars and SRVs. The method employs the position in the
reddening-free PL diagrams and the characteristic period ratios of these
multiperiodic variables. The PL relations for the LMC OSARG are compared with
the calculated relations for RGB models along isochrones of relevant ages and
metallicities. We also compare measured periods and amplitudes of the OSARGs
with predictions based on the relations valid for less luminous solar-like
pulsators. Miras and SRVs seem to follow PL relation of the same slopes in the
LMC and SMC, while for LSP and ellipsoidal variables slopes in both galaxies
are different. The PL sequences defined by LSP variables and binary systems
overlap in the whole range of analyzed wavebands. We put forward new arguments
for the binary star scenario as an explanation of the LSP variability and
elaborate on it further. The measured pulsation to orbital period ratio implies
nearly constant ratio of the star radius to orbital distance, R/A=0.4, as we
find. Combined effect of tidal friction and mass loss enhanced by the low-mass
companion may explain why such a value is preferred.

not shown to be much improved by clustering, except for some simple multimodal
problems. This work proposes and evaluates a combination operator guided by a

depression of the number of red sequence galaxies. There is an indication of a
slight blue shift of the blue cloud. Furthermore, we find that galaxies in void

degeneracy, arranged in an antiferromagnetic triangular lattice with frustrated
spin and orbital order. A structural transition occurs upon cooling below 365 K
to a tripled hexagonal unit cell containing three crystallographically-distinct

spontaneous charge order on the Ni triangular layers. No Jahn-Teller

be mediated by charge fluctuations at the Ni sites coupled to a soft oxygen

sublattice (assigned to a valence close to Ni2+ with S = 1) orders magnetically
into a collinear stripe structure of ferromagnetic rows ordered

thin warm gas mass are smaller than the amount of warm gas in the interior

the surface layer. We present a calculation of the expected thermal H2 emission

lower than the detection limits of our observations (5*10^-15 erg/s/cm2). H2
emission levels are very sensitive to departures from the thermal coupling
between the molecular gas and dust. Additional sources of heating of gas in the
disk's surface layer could have a major impact on the expected H2 disk
emission. In the observed sources the molecular gas and dust in the surface

early convection, differential rotation, and magnetic instabilities. The
equilibrium field configuration, established within hours (at most) of the
formation of the star, is likely to be roughly axisymmetric, involving both
poloidal and toroidal components. The stable stratification of the neutron star
matter (due to its radial composition gradient) probably plays a crucial role
in holding this magnetic structure inside the star. The field can evolve on
long time scales by processes that overcome the stable stratification, such as
weak interactions changing the relative abundances and ambipolar diffusion of
charged particles with respect to neutrons. These processes become more
effective for stronger magnetic fields, thus naturally explaining the magnetic
energy dissipation expected in magnetars, at the same time as the longer-lived,
weaker fields in classical and millisecond pulsars.

modification of standard emission models of TeV blazars appears necessary to
account for the gamma-ray observations despite this misalignment. We explain
TeV gamma-ray spectra and fast variability of M87 by invoking an emission zone
close to the central supermassive black hole, which is filled with several
plasma blobs moving in the large opening angle of the jet formation zone. We
develop a new multi-blob synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model with emitting
blobs beyond the Alfven surface in the jet, at a distance of about 100 r_g from
the central engine. This model is explicitly adapted to deal with large viewing
angles and moderate values of the Lorentz factor inferred from (general
relativistic) magnetohydrodynamic models of jet formation. This scenario can
account for the recent gamma-ray observations of M87 made by the High Energy
Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) telescope array. We find individual blob radii
of about 10^{14} cm, which is compatible with the variability on timescales of
days recently reported by the H.E.S.S. collaboration and is of the order of the
black hole gravitational radius. Predictions of the very high energy emission

Polish to illustrate our discussion because it has an interesting aspectual
system, but the points we wish to make are not language specific. Rather, our
goal is to develop theoretical and computational tools for temporal model
building tasks in computational semantics. To this end, we present a
first-order theory of time and events which is rich enough to capture
interesting semantic distinctions, and an algorithm which takes minimal models
for first-order theories and systematically attempts to ``perturb'' their
temporal component to provide non-minimal, but semantically significant,
models.

scattering of hadrons. The s-wave scattering amplitude of an arbitrary hadron
with the Nambu-Goldstone boson is constructed so as to satisfy the unitarity
condition and the chiral low energy theorem. We find that the chiral
interaction for the exotic channels is in most cases repulsive, and that the
strength of the possible attractive interaction is uniquely determined. We show
that the attractive interaction in exotic channels is not strong enough to
generate a bound state, while the interaction in nonexotic channel generate
bound states which are considered to be the origin of some resonances observed
in nature.

  flow in barred galaxies","5 pages, accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20078180",,"astro-ph",,"  Context: One of the ways to determine the contribution of the dark halo to
the gravitational potential of a galaxy is the study of non-circular
(streaming) motions and the associated gas shocks in the bar region. These
motions, determined by the potential in the inner parts, can break the
disk-halo degeneracy. Here, two main fluid dynamical approaches have been
chosen to model the non-circular motions in the bar region; a 2-D Eulerian grid
code for an isothermal gas (FS2) and a 3-D smoothed particle hydrodynamic code
(N-body/SPH). Aims: The aim of this paper is to compare and quantify the
differences of the gas flows in rotating barred potential obtained using two
different fluid dynamical approaches. We analyse the effect of using 2-D and a
3-D codes in the calculation of gas flow in barred galaxies and to which extend
the results are affected by the code. To do this, we derive the velocity field
and density maps for the mass model of NGC 4123 using a 3-D N-body/SPH code and
compare the results to the previous 2-D Eulerian grid code results. Methods:
Numerical modelling, 3-D N-body/SPH simulations Results: The global velocity
field and the gas distribution is very similar in both models. The study shows
that the position and strength of the shocks developed in the SPH simulations
do not vary significantly compared to the results derived from the 2-D FS2
code. The largest velocity difference across the shock is 20\kms between the
2-D and 3-D fluid dynamical models. Conclusions: The results obtained in the
studies deriving the dark matter content of barred galaxies using the bar
streaming motions and strength and position of shocks are robust to the fluid
dynamical model used. The effect of 2-D and 3-D modelling can be neglected in
this type of studies.
