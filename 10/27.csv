Superconductor -Graphene-Superconductor (SGS) Josephson junctions with
coherence lengths comparable to the distance between the superconducting leads.
By comparing the measured temperature and doping dependence of the supercurrent
and the proximity induced sub-gap features (multiple Andreev reflections) to
theoretical predictions we find that, contrary to expectations, the ballistic
transport model fails to describe the SGS junctions. In contrast, the diffusive
junction model yields close quantitative agreement with the results. This
conclusion is consistent with transport measurements in the normal state, which
yield mean free paths in the graphene link that are much shorter than the
junction length. We show that all devices fabricated on SiO2 substrates so far
(our own as well as those reported by other groups) fall in the diffusive

counterterms in perturbative renormalization. Contrary to the usual approach,
the devised version of the Bogoliubov recursion does not follow a linear
induction on the number of loops. It is well-behaved with respect to the
Connes-Kreimer approach: that is, the recursion takes place inside the group of
Hopf algebra characters with values in regularized Feynman amplitudes.
(Paradigmatically, we use dimensional regularization in the minimal subtraction
scheme, although our procedure is generalizable to other schemes.) The new
method is related to Zassenhaus' approach to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff
formula for computing products of exponentials. The decomposition of
counterterms is parametrized by a family of Lie idempotents known as the
Zassenhaus idempotents. It is shown, inter alia, that the corresponding Feynman
rules generate the same algebra as the graded components of the Connes-Kreimer
beta-function. This further extends previous work of ours (together with Jose
M. Gracia-Bondia) on the connection between Lie idempotents and renormalization
procedures, where we constructed the Connes-Kreimer beta-function by means of
the classical Dynkin idempotent.

through open chaotic ballistic conductors in the semiclassical limit of small
Fermi wavelength to system size ratio, $\lambda_F/L << 1$. We use the
trajectory-based semiclassical theory to study a two-terminal chaotic dot with
decoherence originating from:
  (i) an external closed quantum chaotic environment,
  (ii) a classical source of noise,
  (iii) a voltage probe, i.e. an additional current-conserving terminal.
  We focus on the pure dephasing regime, where the coupling to the external
source of dephasing is so weak that it does not induce energy relaxation. In
addition to the universal algebraic suppression of weak localization, we find
an exponential suppression of weak-localization $\propto
\exp[-\tilde{\tau}/\tau_\phi]$, with the dephasing rate $\tau_\phi^{-1}$. The
parameter $\tilde{\tau}$ depends strongly on the source of dephasing. For a
voltage probe, $\tilde{\tau}$ is of order the Ehrenfest time $\propto \ln
[L/\lambda_F ]$. In contrast, for a chaotic environment or a classical source
of noise, it has the correlation length $\xi$ of the coupling/noise potential
replacing the Fermi wavelength $\lambda_F $. We explicitly show that the Fano
factor for shot noise is unaffected by decoherence. We connect these results to
earlier works on dephasing due to electron-electron interactions, and
numerically confirm our findings.

algorithm for finding the balanced minimum evolution (BME) tree associated to a
dissimilarity map. From this point of view, NJ is ``optimal'' when the
algorithm outputs the tree which minimizes the balanced minimum evolution
criterion. We use the fact that the NJ tree topology and the BME tree topology
are determined by polyhedral subdivisions of the spaces of dissimilarity maps
${\R}_{+}^{n \choose 2}$ to study the optimality of the neighbor-joining

spherical polytopes in high dimension, which we obtain using a combination of
Monte Carlo methods and polyhedral algorithms. We show that highly unrelated

conjecture that the ability of the neighbor-joining algorithm to recover the

describe the evolution of the probability distribution for finding a particle

integral equations are solved numerically with a pseudospectral method that is
based on the expansion of the unknown functions in terms of Chebyshev
polynomials. In parallel, Monte-Carlo simulation are performed. Through the
inclusion of momentum space, the combined CTRW is able to yield results on
density and temperature profile evolution, on particle and heat fluxes and
diffusivities, and on kinetic energy distributions. Depending on the choice of
the probability distributions of the particle displacements in position and
momentum space, the combined CTRW is able to model phenomena of anomalous
transport in position as well as in momentum (or energy or velocity) space. An
application is made to a toroidally confined plasma that undergoes off-center
injection of cold plasma (off-axis fueling), using two variants of the model,
the mixed model and the critical gradient model. The phenomenon of profile
stiffness is addressed, both for the density and for the temperature profile,

existence of bound states between CHAMPs and nuclei, including possible
late-time destruction of Li6 and Li7 are included. The study sets conservative
bounds on CHAMP abundances in the decay time range 3x10^2 sec - 10^12 sec. It
is stressed that the production of Li6 at early times T ~ 10keV is
overestimated by a factor ~ 10 when the approximation of the Saha equation for
the He4 bound state fraction is utilised. To obtain conservative limits on the
abundance of CHAMPs, a Monte-Carlo analysis with ~ 3x10^6 independent BBN runs,
varying reaction rates of nineteen different reactions, is performed (see
attached erratum, however). The analysis yields the surprising result that
except for small areas in the particle parameter space conservative constraints
on the abundance of decaying charged particles are currently very close to
those of neutral particles. It is shown that, in case a number of heretofore
unconsidered reactions may be determined reliably in future, it is conceivable
that the limit on CHAMPs in the early Universe could be tightened by orders of
magnitude. An ERRATUM gives limits on primordial CHAMP densities when the by

quasiequilibrium circular orbits by solving Einstein's constraint equations in
the conformal thin-sandwich decomposition together with the relativistic
equations of hydrostationary equilibrium. We adopt maximal slicing, assume
spatial conformal flatness, and impose equilibrium boundary conditions on an
excision surface (i.e., the apparent horizon) to model the black hole. In our
previous treatment we adopted a ""leading-order"" approximation for a parameter
related to the black-hole spin in these boundary conditions to construct
approximately nonspinning black holes. Here we improve on the models by
computing the black hole's quasilocal spin angular momentum and setting it to
zero. As before, we adopt a polytropic equation of state with adiabatic index
Gamma=2 and assume the neutron star to be irrotational. In addition to
recomputing several sequences for comparison with our earlier results, we study
a wider range of neutron star masses and binary mass ratios. To locate the
innermost stable circular orbit we search for turning points along both the
binding energy and total angular momentum curves for these sequences. Unlike
for our previous approximate boundary condition, these two minima now coincide.
We also identify the formation of cusps on the neutron star surface, indicating
the onset of tidal disruption. Comparing these two critical binary separations
for different mass ratios and neutron star compactions we distinguish those
regions that will lead to a tidal disruption of the neutron star from those
that will result in the plunge into the black hole of a neutron star more or
less intact, albeit distorted by tidal forces.

types of shape measurement systematics: (i) additive systematic with no
redshift evolution; (ii) additive systematic with redshift evolution; and (iii)
multiplicative systematic. In each case, we consider a wide range of scale
dependence and redshift evolution of the systematics signal. For a future
DUNE-like full sky survey, we find that, for cases with mild redshift
evolution, the variance of the additive systematic signal should be kept below
10^-7 to ensure biases on cosmological parameters that are sub-dominant to the
statistical errors. For the multiplicative systematics, which depends on the
lensing signal, we find the multiplicative calibration m0 needs to be
controlled to an accuracy better than 10^-3. We find that the impact of
systematics can be underestimated if their assumes redshift dependence is too
simplistic. We provide simple scaling relations to extend these requirements to
any survey geometry and discuss the impact of our results for current and

that of oxygen, are solar. As a result, we show that ices formed in the outer
Solar Nebula are composed of a mix of clathrate hydrates, hydrates formed above
50 K and pure condensates produced at lower temperatures. We then consider the
inward migration of solids initially produced in the outer Solar Nebula and
show that a significant fraction may have drifted to the current position of
the Main Belt without encountering temperature and pressure conditions high
enough to vaporize the ices they contain. We propose that, through the
detection and identification of initially buried ices revealed by recent
impacts on the surfaces of asteroids, it could be possible to infer the
thermodynamic conditions that were present within the Solar Nebula during the
accretion of these bodies, and during the inward migration of icy
planetesimals. We also investigate the potential influence that the
incorporation of ices in asteroids may have on their porosities and densities.

density of a given body, and consequently modifies its macro-porosity from that

galaxies in the Milky Way (dShps), the DM density today and $N$-body

particles is bound in the few keV range. If chemical freeze out occurs before
thermal decoupling, light bosonic particles can Bose-condense. Such

on the relation between the critical($T_c$)and decoupling($T_d$)temperatures, a

of normally hyperbolic laminations and the theorem of Robinson on the
structural stability of diffeomorphisms that satisfy Axiom A and the strong
transversality condition (SA). We generalize these results by introducing a
geometric object: the stratification of laminations. It is a stratification
whose strata are laminations. Our main theorem implies the persistence of some
stratifications whose strata are normally expanded. The dynamics is a
$C^r$-endomorphism of a manifold (which is possibly not invertible). The
persistence means that for any $C^r$-perturbation of the dynamics, there exists
a close $C^r$-stratification preserved by the perturbation. This theorem in its
elementary statement (the stratification is constituted by a unique stratum)
gives the persistence of normally expanded laminations by endomorphisms,
generalizing HPS theory. Another application of this theorem is the
persistence, as stratifications, of submanifolds with boundary or corners
normally expanded. Moreover, we remark that SA diffeomorphism gives a canonical
stratifications: the stratification whose strata are the stable sets of basic
pieces of the spectral decomposition. Our Main theorem then implies the
persistence of some ``normally SA'' laminations which are not normally
hyperbolic.

fundamental way the cosmological redshift that a direct computation within a

the class of NLED Lagrangian, the effective redshift turns out to be $1 +

always much higher then the standard redshift, but recovers such limit when the
NLED correction $\Delta(\Phi_e, \Phi_o) \longrightarrow 1$. This result may

  If the total width of the X(3872) is 2-3 MeV, the peak position in the

orbital angular momentum because of the proximity of the X(3872) to D^{*0}

  Interference-Limited and Noise-Limited Regimes","Submitted to IEEE Trans. Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  A network of $n$ wireless communication links is considered in a Rayleigh
fading environment. It is assumed that each link can be active and transmit
with a constant power $P$ or remain silent. The objective is to maximize the
number of active links such that each active link can transmit with a constant
rate $\lambda$. An upper bound is derived that shows the number of active links
scales at most like $\frac{1}{\lambda} \log n$. To obtain a lower bound, a
decentralized link activation strategy is described and analyzed. It is shown
that for small values of $\lambda$, the number of supported links by this
strategy meets the upper bound; however, as $\lambda$ grows, this number
becomes far below the upper bound. To shrink the gap between the upper bound
and the achievability result, a modified link activation strategy is proposed
and analyzed based on some results from random graph theory. It is shown that
this modified strategy performs very close to the optimum. Specifically, this
strategy is \emph{asymptotically almost surely} optimum when $\lambda$
approaches $\infty$ or 0. It turns out the optimality results are obtained in
an interference-limited regime. It is demonstrated that, by proper selection of
the algorithm parameters, the proposed scheme also allows the network to
operate in a noise-limited regime in which the transmission rates can be
adjusted by the transmission powers. The price for this flexibility is a
decrease in the throughput scaling law by a multiplicative factor of $\log \log
n$.

protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, are a frequent mechanism in signal transduction
pathways. There has been much speculation as to the role of these pathways, and
how their structure is related to their function. A common conclusion is that
the cascades serve to amplify biochemical signals so that a single bound ligand
molecule might produce a multitude of second messengers. Some recent work has
focused on a particular feature present in some MAPK pathways -- a negative
feedback loop which spans the length of the cascade. This is a feature that is
shared by a man-made engineering device, the feedback amplifier. We propose a
novel interpretation: that by wrapping a feedback loop around an amplifier,
these cascades may be acting as biochemical feedback amplifiers which imparts
i) increased robustness with respect to internal perturbations; ii) a linear
graded response over an extended operating range; iii) insulation from external
perturbation, resulting in functional modularization. We also report on the
growing list of experimental evidence which supports a graded response of MAPK
with respect to Epidermal Growth Factor. This evidence supports our hypothesis
that in these circumstances MAPK cascade, may be acting as a feedback
amplifier.

asymptotically constant Verblunsky coefficients. We demonstrate that an
orthonormal system in a certain ""weighted'' Hilbert space, which we call the
Fadeev-Marchenko (FM) space, behaves asymptotically as the system in the
standard (free) case. The duality between the two types of Hardy subspaces in
it plays the key role in the proof of all asymptotics involved. We show that
the traditional (Faddeev-Marchenko) condition is too restrictive to define the
class of CMV matrices for which there exists a unique scattering
representation. The main results are: 1) Szeg\""o-Blaschke class: the class of
twosided CMV matrices acting in $l^2$, whose spectral density satisfies the
Szeg\""o condition and whose point spectrum the Blaschke condition, corresponds
precisely to the class where the scattering problem can be posed and solved.
That is, to a given CMV matrix of this class, one can associate the scattering
data and related to them the FM space. The CMV matrix corresponds to the
multiplication operator in this space, and the orthonormal basis in it
(corresponding to the standard basis in $l^2$) behaves asymptotically as the
basis associated with the free system. 2) $A_2$-Carleson class: from the point
of view of the scattering problem, the most natural class of CMV matrices is
that one in which a) the scattering data determine the matrix uniquely and b)
the associated Gelfand- Levitan- Marchenko transformation operators are
bounded. Necessary and sufficient conditions for this class can be given in
terms of an $A_2$ kind condition for the density of the absolutely continuous
spectrum and a Carleson kind condition for the discrete spectrum. Similar close
to the optimal conditions are given directly in terms of the scattering data.

internetwork as a Network-like scenario. The magnetic elements of internetwork
areas seem to be isotropically distributed when observed at our spatial

circumstellar envelopes of oxygen-rich red giant and supergiant stars.
Multi-maser transition studies can be used to put constraints on the density
and temperature of the emission regions.
  Aims: A number of known H2O maser lines were observed toward the long period
variables R Leo and W Hya and the red supergiant VY CMa. A search for a new,
not yet detected line near 475 GHz was conducted toward these stars.
  Methods: The Atacama Pathfinder Experiment telescope was used for a
multi-transition observational study of submillimeter H2O lines.
  Results: The 5_33-4_40 transition near 475 GHz was clearly detected toward VY
CMa and W Hya. Many other H2O lines were detected toward all three target
stars. Relative line intensity ratios and velocity widths were found to vary
significantly from star to star.
  Conclusions: Maser action is observed in all but one line for which it was
theoretically predicted. In contrast, one of the strongest maser lines, in R
Leo by far the strongest, the 437 GHz 7_53-6_60 transition, is not predicted to
be inverted. Some other qualitative predictions of the model calculations are
at variance with our observations. Plausible reasons for this are discussed.
Based on our findings for W Hya and VY CMa, we find evidence that the H2O
masers in the AGB star W Hya arise from the regular circumstellar outflow,
while shock excitation in a high velocity flow seems to be required to excite
masers far from the red supergiant VY CMa.

decoding, to cascade with the belief propagation (BP) or enhanced min-sum
decoding. The OSD is invoked only when the decoding failures are obtained for
the preceded iterative decoding method. With respect to the existing OSD which
is based on the accumulated log-likelihood ratio (LLR) metric, we extend the
accumulative metric to the situation where the BP decoding is in the
probability domain. Moreover, after generalizing the accumulative metric to the
context of the normalized or offset min-sum decoding, the OSD shows appealing
tradeoff between performance and complexity. In the OSD implementation, when
deciding the true error pattern among many candidates, an alternative proposed
proves to be effective to reduce the number of real additions without
performance loss. Simulation results demonstrate that the cascade connection of
enhanced min-sum and OSD decodings outperforms the BP alone significantly, in
terms of either performance or complexity.

varying some parameters characterizing the solutions from one set of values to

we show that the interpolation implies a possible transition from black
$p$-branes to KK BON only for $p\leq 4$, as in these cases there exist locally
stable static bubbles under certain conditions. However, for $p>4$, black
branes always decay into dynamical bubbles. Contrary to what is known in the
literature, we argue that under certain conditions, the mechanism causing this
transition to stable static bubbles can be the closed string tachyon
condensation for all $p\leq 4$. We also show that the configurations indeed
contain (chargeless) F-strings required for the closed string tachyons to
appear causing the transitions to occur.
