is shown that, under such relaxation of locality, the symmetries of the theory
cannot be described within the usual framework of Lie algebras but rather in
terms of non-co-commutative Hopf algebras or ""quantum groups"". Similar
""quantizations"" of space-time symmetries are expected to emerge in the
low-energy limit of certain quantum gravity models and have been used to
describe the symmetries of various non-commutative space-times. Our result
provides an intuitive characterization of the mechanism that could lead to the

the axial triangle anomaly. We show that, in vacuum, above a value of B ~
m_pi^2/e, a metastable object appears - the pi^0 domain wall. Because of the
axial anomaly, the wall carries a baryon number surface density proportional to
B. As a result, for B ~ 10^{19} G a stack of parallel pi^0 domain walls is
energetically more favorable than nuclear matter at the same density.
Similarly, at higher densities, somewhat weaker magnetic fields of order B ~
10^{17}-10^{18} G transform the color-superconducting ground state of QCD into
new phases containing stacks of axial isoscalar (eta or eta') domain walls. We
also show that a quark-matter state known as ``Goldstone current state,'' in
which a gradient of a Goldstone field is spontaneously generated, is
ferromagnetic due to the axial anomaly. We estimate the size of the fields
created by such a state in a typical neutron star to be of order
10^{14}-10^{15} G.

we work in SU(3), using the Schrodinger Functional coupling scheme as a

estimate will lead to biased estimates of these correlations, thus compromising
the ability of photometric redshift surveys to constrain galaxy formation

generalization of the V_max method, and the other is a maximum likelihood
approach. We illustrate their effectiveness by studying the size-luminosity

decisive approximation relation between the entropy structures of information

This approximation extends the approximation for joint entropies carried out
previously by Chan and Yeung. As a consequence of our approximation result, we
show that any continuous law holds in general for the entropies of information
elements if and only if the same law holds in general for the log-indices of
subgroups. As an application, by constructing subgroup counterexamples we find
surprisingly that common information, unlike joint information, obeys neither
the submodularity nor the supermodularity law. We emphasize that the notion of
information elements is conceptually significant--formalizing it helps to
reveal the deep connection between information theory and group theory. The
parallelism established in this paper admits an appealing group-action

at evaluation of the surface tension through its thermodynamic definition. For
all methods explored, the surface tension is calculated by approximating the
change in Helmholtz free energy associated with a change in interfacial area
through simulation of a liquid slab at constant particle number, volume, and
temperature. The methods explored fall within three general classes:
free-energy perturbation, the Bennett acceptance-ratio scheme, and the expanded
ensemble technique. Calculations are performed for both the truncated
Lennard-Jones and square-well fluids at select temperatures spaced along their
respective liquid-vapor saturation lines. Overall, we find that Bennett and
expanded ensemble approaches provide the best combination of accuracy and
precision. All of the methods, when applied using sufficiently small area
perturbation, generate equivalent results for the Lennard-Jones fluid. However,
single-stage free-energy-perturbation methods and the closely related test-area
technique recently introduced by Gloor et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 123, 134703
(2005)], generate surface tension values for the square-well fluid that are not
consistent with those obtained from the more robust expanded ensemble and
Bennett approaches, regardless of the size of the area perturbation.
Single-stage perturbation methods fail also for the Lennard-Jones system when
applied using large area perturbations. Here an analysis of phase-space overlap
produces a quantitative explanation of the observed inaccuracy, and shows that
the satisfactory results obtained in these cases from the test-area method
arise from a cancellation of errors that cannot be expected in general.

on a simple scheme of exchange of space-time information between the atomistic
and mesoscopic scales and is capable of describing self-consistent hydrodynamic
effects on molecular motion at a computational cost which scales linearly with
both solute size and solvent volume. For an application of our multiscale
method, we consider the much studied problem of biopolymer translocation
through nanopores: we find that the method reproduces with remarkable accuracy
the statistical scaling behavior of the translocation process and provides
valuable insight into the cooperative aspects of biopolymer and hydrodynamic
motion.

acceleration in the outer 3.4 kpc of the jet is likely to be dominated by an
unknown distributed acceleration mechanism. In addition to several compact
counterjet features we detect probable extended emission from a counterjet out

defined and generated by four emitters (satellites, pulsars) broadcasting their
proper time by radio signals. They are the main ingredient of the simplest
conceivable relativistic positioning system. The emission coordinates are
independent of any observer. Receiving directly the proper time at emission of
four satellites, any user or observer can measure the values of the emission
coordinates, from which he/she can obtain his trajectory and hence, in
particular, his position. Moreover, if and only if the four satellites also
broadcast to the users the proper times they are receiving by cross-link
autonavigation from the other emitters, the positioning system is called
autolocated or autonomous. In an autolocated positioning system the
trajectories of the satellites of the constellation can also be known by the
users and they can also obtain the metric of the spacetime (the gravitational
field) on the constellation.
  The study of autolocated relativistic positioning systems has been initiated
by Coll and coll. several years ago and it has been aimed for developing an
exact fully relativistic theory of positioning systems and gravimetry, based on
the framework and concepts of General Relativity. This exact relativistic
framework is the alternative to considering post-newtonian relativistic
corrections in a classical Newtonian framework, which is the customary approach

of nebular quantities, including line fluxes, physical conditions and ionic
abundances at a spatial resolution of about 1"". We find that protoplanetary
disks (proplyds) show prominent spikes of T([N II]) probably produced by
collisional deexcitation due to the high electron densities found in these
objects. Herbig-Haro objects show also relatively high T([N II]) but probably
produced by local heating due to shocks. We also find that the spatial
distribution of pure recombination O II and [O III] lines is fairly similar, in
contrast to that observed in planetary nebulae. The abundance discrepancy
factor (ADF) of O^{++} remains rather constant along the slit positions, except
in some particular small areas of the nebula where this quantity reaches
somewhat higher values, in particular at the location of the most conspicuous
Herbig-Haro objects: HH 202, HH 203, and HH 204. There is also an apparent
slight increase of the ADF in the inner 40"" around theta^1 Ori C. We find a
negative radial gradient of T([O III]) and T([N II]) in the nebula based on the
projected distance from theta^1 Ori C. We explore the behavior of the ADF of
O^{++} with respect to other nebular quantities, finding that it seems to
increase very slightly with the electron temperature. Finally, we estimate the
value of the mean-square electron temperature fluctuation, the so-called t^2
parameter. Our results indicate that the hypothetical thermal inhomogeneities
--if they exist-- should be smaller than our spatial resolution element.

members. We show that the existence of fossil systems is primarily driven by
the relatively early infall of massive satellites, and that we do not find a
strong environmental dependence for these systems. In addition, we find
tentative evidence for fossil group satellites falling in on orbits with
typically lower angular momentum, which might lead to a more efficient merger
onto the host. We find a population of groups at higher redshifts that go
through a ``fossil phase'': a stage where they show a large magnitude-gap,
which is terminated by renewed infall from their environment.

nanotubes in response to binding of charged molecules provide a novel sensing
modality which is generally denoted as nanoFET sensors. In this paper, we study
the scaling laws of nanoplate FET sensors by simplifying nanoplates as random
resistor networks with molecular receptors sitting on lattice sites.
Nanowire/tube FETs are included as the limiting cases where the device width
goes small. Computer simulations show that the field effect strength exerted by
the binding molecules has significant impact on the scaling behaviors. When the
field effect strength is small, nanoFETs have little size and shape dependence.
In contrast, when the field-effect strength becomes stronger, there exists a
lower detection threshold for charge accumulation FETs and an upper detection
threshold for charge depletion FET sensors. At these thresholds, the nanoFET
devices undergo a transition between low and large sensitivities. These
thresholds may set the detection limits of nanoFET sensors, while could be
eliminated by designing devices with very short source-drain distance and large
width.

galaxies is reviewed, in the context of recent observational studies of their
ultra-violet (UV) properties. Combination of UV and optical spectro-photometric
data indicates that the bulk of the stellar mass in the early-type population
forms at high redshift (z > 2), typically over short timescales (< 1 Gyr).
Nevertheless, early-types of all luminosities form stars over the lifetime of
the Universe, with most luminous (-23 < M(V) < -21) systems forming 10-15% of
their stellar mass after z = 1 (with a scatter to higher value), while their
less luminous (M(V) > -21) counterparts form 30-60% of their mass in the same
redshift range. The large scatter in the (rest-frame) UV colours in the
redshift range 0 < z < 0.7 indicates widespread low-level star formation in the
early-type population over the last 8 billion years. The mass fraction of young
(< 1 Gyr old) stars in luminous early-type galaxies varies between 1% and 6% at
z~0 and is in the range 5-13% at z~0.7. The intensity of recent star formation
and the bulk of the UV colour distribution is consistent with what might be
expected from minor mergers (mass ratios < 1:6) in an LCDM cosmology.

The appropriate phenomenological equation modeling cell-mediated immune
surveillance against cancer is of the predator-prey form and exhibits
bistability within a given choice of the immune response-related parameters.
Under the influence of weak external fluctuations, the model may be analyzed in
terms of a stochastic differential equation bearing the form of an overdamped
Langevin-like dynamics in the external quasi-potential represented by a double
well. We analyze properties of the system within the range of parameters for
which the potential wells are of the same depth and when the additional
perturbation, modeling a periodic treatment, is insufficient to overcome the
barrier height and to cause cancer extinction. In this case the presence of a
small amount of noise can positively enhance the treatment, driving the system
to a state of tumor extinction. On the other hand, however, the same noise can
give rise to return effects up to a stochastic resonance behavior. This
observation provides a quantitative analysis of mechanisms responsible for
optimization of periodic tumor therapy in the presence of spontaneous external
noise. Studying the behavior of the extinction time as a function of the
treatment frequency, we have also found the typical resonant activation effect:
For a certain frequency of the treatment, there exists a minimum extinction
time.

rotating magnetar and the surrounding progenitor. In the first few seconds
after core collapse the magnetar inflates a bubble of plasma and magnetic
fields behind the supernova shock, which expands asymmetrically because of the
pinching effect of the toroidal magnetic field, as in PWNe, even if the host
star is spherically symmetric. The degree of asymmetry depends on the ratio of
the magnetic energy to the total energy in the bubble. We assume that the wind
by newly formed magnetars inflating these bubbles is more magnetized than for
PWNe. We show that for a magnetic to total power supplied by the central
magnetar $\sim 0.1$ the bubble expands relatively spherically while for values
greater than 0.3, most of the pressure in the bubble is exerted close to the
rotation axis, driving a collimated outflow out through the host star. This can
account for the collimation inferred from observations of long-duration
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Given that the wind magnetization increases in time,
we thus suggest that the magnetar-driven bubble initially expands relatively
spherically (enhancing the energy of the associated supernova) while at late
times it becomes progressivelymore collimated (producing the GRB). Similar
processes may operate in more modestly rotating neutron stars to produce
asymmetric supernovae and lower energy transients such as X-ray flashes.

by the BeppoSAX/PDS instrument (15-200 keV), of hard X-ray emission from a GRB

seriously challenged the standard scenario in which the dominant mechanism is
synchrotron radiation produced in the shock of a ultra-relativistic fireball
with the ISM, showing the need of a substantial revision of present models. In
this respect, thanks to its unprecedented sensitivity in the 10-80 keV energy

spiral substructure in the gaseous disk of a galaxy. The obtained gaseous
response is driven by a self-consistent non-axisymmetric potential obtained
from an imposed spiral mass distribution. We highlight the importance of
ultraharmonic resonances in generating these features. The temporal evolution
of the system is followed with the parallel ZEUS-MP code, and we follow the
steepening of perturbations induced by the spiral potential until large-scale
shocks emerge. These shocks exhibit bifurcations that protrude from the gaseous
arms and continue to steepen until new shocks are formed. When the contribution
from the spiral potential relative to the axisymmetric background is increased
from our default value, spurs protrude from the main arms after several
revolutions of the gaseous disk. Such spurs overlap on top of the
aforementioned shocks. These results support the hypothesis that a complicated
gaseous response can coexist with an orderly spiral potential term, in the
sense that the underlying background potential can be smooth yet drive a
gaseous response that is far more spatially complex.

receive high-rate/high-quality feedback from a smaller number of (randomly

diversity to be exploited, while high-rate feedback allows for very precise

of a cooling-dominated optically thin two-temperature inner disk may explain
the 23-day quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) period observed in the TeV and
X-ray light curves of Mkn~501 during its 1997 high state. In our model the
relativistic jet electrons Compton upscatter the disk soft X-ray photons to TeV
energies, so that the instability-driven X-ray periodicity will lead to a
corresponding quasi-periodicity in the TeV light curve and produce correlated
variability. We analyse the dependence of the instability-driven
quasi-periodicity on the mass (M) of the central black hole, the accretion rate
($\rm{\dot{M}}$) and the viscous parameter ($\alpha$) of the inner disk. We
show that in the case of Mkn~501 the first two parameters are constrained by
various observational results, so that for the instability occurring within a
two-temperature disk where $\alpha=0.05-1.0$, the quasi-period is expected to
lie within the range of 8 to 100 days, as indeed the case. In particular, for
the observed 23-day QPO period our model implies a viscosity coefficient
$\alpha \leq 0.28$, a sub-Eddington accretion rate $\dot{M} \simeq 0.02
\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ and a transition radius to the outer standard disk of $r_0
\sim 60 r_g$, and predicts a period variation $\delta P/P \sim 0.23$ due to the
motion of the instability region.

interferometry as part of the GHASP survey. The main aim of obtaining high
resolution H alpha 2D velocity fields is to define more accurately the rising
part of the rotation curves which should allow to better constrain the
parameters of the mass distribution. The H alpha velocities were combined with
low resolution HI data from the literature, when available. Combining the
kinematical data with photometric data, mass models were derived from these
rotation curves using two different functional forms for the halo: an
isothermal sphere and an NFW profile. For the galaxies already modeled by other
authors, the results tend to agree. Our results point at the existence of a
constant density core in the center of the dark matter halos rather than a
cuspy core, whatever the type of the galaxy from Sab to Im. This extends to all
types the result already obtained by other authors studying dwarf and LSB
galaxies but would necessitate a larger sample of galaxies to conclude more
strongly. Whatever model is used (ISO or NFW), small core radius halos have
higher central densities, again for all morphological types. We confirm
different halo scaling laws, such as the correlations between the core radius
and the central density of the halo with the absolute magnitude of a galaxy:
low luminosity galaxies have small core radius and high central density. We
find that the product of the central density with the core radius of the dark
matter halo is nearly constant, whatever the model and whatever the absolute
magnitude of the galaxy. This suggests that the halo surface density is
independent from the galaxy type.

associations, being hosts of significant numbers of early-type stars, are the
loci where these mechanisms act. In this part of our photometric study of the
star-forming region NGC346/N66 in the Small Magellanic Cloud, we present
evidence based on previous and recent detailed studies, that it hosts at least
two different events of triggered star formation and we reveal the complexity
of its recent star formation history. In our earlier studies of this region
(Papers I, III) we find that besides the central part of N66, where the bright
OB stellar content of the association NGC346 is concentrated, an arc-like
nebular feature, north of the association, hosts recent star formation. This
feature is characterized by a high concentration of emission-line stars and
Young Stellar Objects, as well as embedded sources seen as IR-emission peaks
that coincide with young compact clusters of low-mass pre-main sequence stars.
All these objects indicate that the northern arc of N66 encompasses the most
current star formation event in the region. We present evidence that this star
formation is the product of a different mechanism than that in the general area
of the association, and that it is triggered by a wind-driven expanding HII
region (or bubble) blown by a massive supernova progenitor, and possibly other
bright stars, a few Myr ago. We propose a scenario according to which this
mechanism triggered star formation away from the bar of N66, while in the bar
of N66 star formation is introduced by the photo-ionizing OB stars of the
association itself.

a tendency toward phase separation.

numerical experiments of supersonic isothermal turbulence, driven by the
usually adopted solenoidal (divergence-free) forcing and by compressive
(curl-free) forcing. We find that for the same rms Mach number, compressive
forcing produces much stronger density enhancements and larger voids compared
to solenoidal forcing. Consequently, the Fourier spectra of density
fluctuations are significantly steeper. This result is confirmed using the
Delta-variance analysis, which yields power-law exponents beta~3.4 for
compressive forcing and beta~2.8 for solenoidal forcing. We obtain fractal
dimension estimates from the density spectra and Delta-variance scaling, and by
using the box counting, mass size and perimeter area methods applied to the
volumetric data, projections and slices of our turbulent density fields. Our
results suggest that compressive forcing yields fractal dimensions
significantly smaller compared to solenoidal forcing. However, the actual
values depend sensitively on the adopted method, with the most reliable
estimates based on the Delta-variance, or equivalently, on Fourier spectra.
Using these methods, we obtain D~2.3 for compressive and D~2.6 for solenoidal
forcing, which is within the range of fractal dimension estimates inferred from
observations (D~2.0-2.7). The velocity dispersion to size relations for both
solenoidal and compressive forcing obtained from velocity spectra follow a
power law with exponents in the range 0.4-0.5, in good agreement with previous
studies.

trapped surface for timelike particles but the outer as a classical barrier for
ingoing particles. The lightlike signals can escape from or reach the smeared

spin-glass system breaks into many separated domains, each of which is referred
to as a macroscopic state. The system is able to visit all spin configurations
of the same macroscopic state, while it can not spontaneously jump between two
different macroscopic states. Ergodicity of the whole configurational phase
space of the system, however, can be recovered if a temperature-annealing
process is repeated an infinite number of times. In a heating-annealing cycle,
the environmental temperature is first elevated to a high level and then
decreased extremely slowly until a final low temperature $T$ is reached.
Different macroscopic states may be reached in different rounds of the
annealing experiment; while the probability of finding the system in
macroscopic state $\alpha$ decreases exponentially with the free energy
$F_\alpha(T)$ of this state. For finite-connectivity spin glass systems, we use
this free energy Boltzmann distribution to formulate the cavity approach of
M{\'{e}}zard and Parisi [Eur. Phys. J. B {\bf 20}, 217 (2001)] in a slightly
different form. For the $\pm J$ spin-glass model on a random regular graph of

ergodic sub-spaces (thermodynamic states). Previous theoretical studies assumed
that the equilibrium collective behavior of such a system is determined by its
ground thermodynamic states of the minimal free-energy density, and that the
equilibrium free energies follow the distribution of exponential decay. Here we
show that these assumptions are not necessarily valid. For some complex
systems, the equilibrium free-energy values may follow a Gaussian distribution
within an intermediate temperature range, and consequently their equilibrium
properties are contributed by {\em excited} thermodynamic states. This work
will help improving our understanding of the equilibrium statistical mechanics
of spin-glasses and other complex systems.
