equipped with an evolutionarily selected learning ability. Such a coupling of
biological and linguistic ingredients results in an abrupt transition: upon a
small change of a model control parameter a poorly communicating group of
linguistically unskilled agents transforms into almost perfectly communicating
group with large learning abilities. When learning ability is kept fixed, the
transition appears to be continuous. Genetic imprinting of the learning
abilities proceeds via Baldwin effect: initially unskilled communicating agents
learn a language and that creates a niche in which there is an evolutionary
pressure for the increase of learning ability.Our model suggests that when
linguistic (or cultural) processes became intensive enough, a transition took
place where both linguistic performance and biological endowment of our species
experienced an abrupt change that perhaps triggered the rapid expansion of
human civilization.

water employing a recently introduced Adaptive Resolution Scheme (AdResS). The
spatially adaptive molecular resolution procedure allows for changing from a
coarse-grained to an all-atom representation and vice-versa on-the-fly. In
order to find the most appropriate coarse-grained water model to be employed
with AdResS we first study the accuracy of different coarse-grained water
models in reproducing the structural properties of the all-atom system.
Typically, coarse-grained molecular models have a higher diffusion constant
than the corresponding all-atom models due to the reduction in degrees of
freedom (DOFs) upon coarse-graining that eliminates the fluctuating forces
associated with those integrated-out molecular DOFs. Here, we introduce the
methodology to obtain the same diffusional dynamics across different
resolutions. We show that this approach leads to the correct description of
essential thermodynamic, structural and dynamical properties of liquid water at
ambient conditions.

low values of the four-momentum transfer are achieved by making use of twisted

role of their annihilation on the temperature of diffuse gas in the high
redshift universe. We consider neutralinos of particle mass 36 GeV and 100 GeV,
respectively. The former is able to produce ~7 electron/positron particles per
annihilation through the fremionic channel, and the latter ~53 particles
assuming a purely bosonic channel. High energy electron/positron particles
up-scatter the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons into higher energies
via the inverse-Compton scattering. The process produces a power-law
electron/positron energy spectrum of index -1 in the energy range of interest,
independent of the initial energy distribution. The corresponding energy
spectrum of the up-scattered photons is a power-law of index -1/2, if
absorption by the gas is not included. The scattered photons photo-heat the gas
by releasing electrons which deposit a fraction (14%)of their energy as heat
into the ambient medium. For uniformly distributed neutralinos the heating is
insignificant. The effect is greatly enhanced by the clumping of neutralinos
into dense haloes. We use a time-dependent clumping model which takes into
account the damping of density fluctuations on mass scales smaller than
~10^{-6}M_sol. With this clumping model, the heating mechanism boosts the gas
temperature above that of the CMB after a redshift of z 30. By z\approx 10 the
gas temperature is nearly 100 times its temperature when no heating is invoked.
Similar increase is obtained for the two neutralino masses considered.

polar surface gravities to investigate the physical and evolutionary factors

associated with a particular stage of main-sequence evolution, but they are a
population of rapidly rotating stars with a velocity distribution generally
consistent with rotation at 70-80% of the critical velocity, although
systematic effects probably underestimate the true rotational velocities so
that the rotation is much closer to critical. Our measurements of the changing
disk sizes are consistent with the idea that transitory, nonradial pulsations
contribute to the formation of these highly variable disks.

cumulative phase uncertainty of these comparisons is about 0.05 radians,
dominated by effects arising from the small residual spins of the black holes
and the small residual orbital eccentricity in the simulations. Matching
numerical results to PN waveforms early in the run yields excellent agreement
(within 0.05 radians) over the first $\sim 15$ cycles, thus validating the
numerical simulation and establishing a regime where PN theory is accurate. In
the last 15 cycles to merger, however, {\em generic} time-domain Taylor
approximants build up phase differences of several radians. But, apparently by
coincidence, one specific post-Newtonian approximant, TaylorT4 at 3.5PN order,
agrees much better with the numerical simulations, with accumulated phase
differences of less than 0.05 radians over the 30-cycle waveform.
Gravitational-wave amplitude comparisons are also done between numerical
simulations and post-Newtonian, and the agreement depends on the post-Newtonian
order of the amplitude expansion: the amplitude difference is about 6--7% for
zeroth order and becomes smaller for increasing order. A newly derived 3.0PN
amplitude correction improves agreement significantly ($<1%$ amplitude
difference throughout most of the run, increasing to 4% near merger) over the

of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6946 made with the BIMA and CARMA
interferometers. Using the BIMA SONG CO map, we investigate the change in the
I_HCN/I_CO and I_ HCO/I_CO integrated intensity ratios as a function of radius
in the central kiloparsec of the galaxy, and find that they are strongly
concentrated at the center. We use the 2MASS K_S band image to find the stellar
surface density, and then construct a map of the hydrostatic midplane pressure.
We apply a PDR model to the observed I_HCN/I_HCO+ integrated intensity ratio to
calculate the number density of molecular hydrogen in the dense gas tracer
emitting region, and find that it is roughly constant at 10^5 cm^-3 across our
map. We explore two hypotheses for the distribution of the dense gas. If the
HCN and HCO+ emission comes from self-gravitating density peaks inside of a
less dense gas distribution, there is a linear proportionality between the
internal velocity dispersion of the dense gas and the size of the density peak.
Alternatively, the HCN and HCO+ emission could come from dense gas
homogeneously distributed throughout the center and bound by ambient pressure,
similar to what is observed toward the center of the Milky Way. We find both of
these hypotheses to be plausible. We fit the relationships between I_HCN,
I_HCO+, and I_CO. Correlations between the hydrostatic midplane pressure and
I_HCN and I_HCO+ are demonstrated, and power law fits are provided. We confirm
the validity of a relation found by Blitz & Rosolowsky (2006) between pressure
and the molecular to atomic gas ratio in the high hydrostatic midplane pressure
regime (10^6-10^8 cm^-3 K).

remnant, when the density distribution is described by $n_{\rm GC}\propto
r^{-\alpha}$. We also study how our results depend on the merger orbit and the
size of the core radius of the initial GC density distribution. We find that a
major dry merger makes the GC profile flatter, and the steeper initial GC
profile leads to more significant flattening, especially if the initial slope
is steeper than $\alpha\sim3.5$. Our result suggests that if there is a major
dry merger of elliptical galaxies whose red GCs have a steeper radial profile
than the blue GCs, as currently observed, and their slopes are steeper than
$\alpha\sim3.5$, the difference in the slopes between two populations becomes
smaller after dry mergers. Therefore, the observed slopes of red and blue GCs
can be a diagnostic of the importance of dry merger. The current observational
data show that the red and blue GCs have more comparable and shallower slopes
in some luminous galaxies, which may indicate that they have experienced dry
mergers.

space to date. However, their radio-metric tracking data received from the
distances between 20--70 astronomical units from the Sun has consistently
indicated the presence of a small, anomalous, Doppler frequency drift. The
drift is a blue frequency shift that can be interpreted as a sunward
acceleration of a_P = (8.74 +/- 1.33) x 10^{-10} m/s^2 for each particular
spacecraft. This signal has become known as the Pioneer anomaly; the nature of
this anomaly remains unexplained.
  Recently new Pioneer 10 and 11 radio-metric Doppler and flight telemetry data
became available. The newly available Doppler data set is significantly
enlarged when compared to the data used in previous investigations and is
expected to be the primary source for the investigation of the anomaly. In
addition, the flight telemetry files, original project documentation, and newly
developed software tools are now used to reconstruct the engineering history of
both spacecraft. With the help of this information, a thermal model of the
Pioneer vehicles is being developed to study possible contribution of thermal
recoil force acting on the two spacecraft. The ultimate goal of these physics
engineering efforts is to evaluate the effect of on-board systems on the
spacecrafts' trajectories.

behavior of micromechanical resonators. We analyze the dissipation mechanism
that arises in nanomechanical beam-structures due to the tunneling of
mesoscopic phonons between the beam and its supports (known as clamping
losses). We derive the environmental force spectral density that determines the
quantum Brownian motion of a given resonance. Our treatment is valid for low
frequencies and provides the leading contribution in the aspect ratio. This
yields fundamental limits for the Q-values which are described by simple
scaling laws and are relevant for state of the art experimental structures. In
this context, for resonant frequencies in the 0.1-1GHz range, while this
dissipation mechanism can limit flexural resonators it is found to be
negligible for torsional ones. In the case of structureless 3D supports the
corresponding environmental spectral densities are Ohmic for flexural
resonators and super-Ohmic for torsional ones, while for 2D slab supports they
yield 1/f noise. Furthermore analogous results are established for the case of
suspended semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes. Finally, we provide a
general expression for the spectral density that allows to extend our treatment
to other geometries and illustrate its use by applying it to a microtoroid. Our
analysis is relevant for applications in high precision measurements and for
the prospects of probing quantum effects in a macroscopic mechanical degree of

compare the derived planet mass upper limits to the minimum planet mass

single giant planets are responsible for clearing out the inner debris disks,
our observations constrain the parameter space available for such planets. The
non-detection of massive planets in these evacuated debris disks further
reinforces the notion that the giant planet population is confined to the inner

magnetism offers a hierarchy of features: primordial multicellularity; phase

extensively studied. Equivariant quantization and dequantization establish a
tight link between invariant operators connecting modules of differential
operators on tensor densities, and module morphisms that connect the
corresponding dequantized spaces. In this paper, we investigate dequantized
differential operators as modules over a Lie subalgebra of vector fields that
preserve an additional structure. More precisely, we take an interest in
invariant operators between dequantized spaces, viewed as modules over the Lie
subalgebra of infinitesimal contact or projective contact transformations. The
principal symbols of these invariant operators are invariant tensor fields. We
first provide full description of the algebras of such affine-contact- and
contact-invariant tensor fields. These characterizations allow showing that the
algebra of projective-contact-invariant operators between dequantized spaces
implemented by the same density weight, is generated by the vertical cotangent
lift of the contact form and a generalized contact Hamiltonian. As an
application, we prove a second key-result, which asserts that the Casimir
operator of the Lie algebra of infinitesimal projective contact
transformations, is diagonal. Eventually, this upshot entails that invariant
operators between spaces induced by different density weights, are made up by a
small number of building bricks that force the parameters of the source and
target spaces to verify Diophantine-type equations.

cosmological models characterizing the main features of the power-spectrum, of
the two-point correlation function and of the mass variance. Both the
real-space statistics have a very well defined behavior on large enough scales,
where their amplitudes become smaller than unity. The correlation function, in
the range 0<\xi(r)<1, is characterized by a typical length-scale r_c, at which
\xi(r_c)=0, which is fixed by the physics of the early universe: beyond this
scale it becomes negative, going to zero with a tail proportional to -(r^{-4}).
These anti-correlations represent thus an important observational challenge to
verify models in real space. The same length scale r_c characterizes the
behavior of the mass variance which decays, for r>r_c, as r^{-4}, the fastest
decay for any mass distribution. The length-scale r_c defines the maximum
extension of (positively correlated) structures in these models. These are the
features expected for the dark matter field: galaxies, which represent a biased
field, however may have differences with respect to these behaviors, which we
analyze. We then discuss the detectability of these real space features by
considering several estimators of the two-point correlation function. By making
tests on numerical simulations we emphasize the important role of finite size
effects which should always be controlled for careful measurements.

the help of {\it one single} type of mathematical entities, namely, the scalars
given by the usual continuum of the field $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers, or by
the usual mathematical structures built upon $\mathbb{R}$, such as the scalars
given by the complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$, or the vectors in finite dimensional
Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$, infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, etc.
  This paper argues for {\it progressing deeper and wider} in furthering the
Principle of Relativity, not by mere covariance with respect to reference
frames, but by studying the possible covariance with respect to a {\it large
variety} of algebras of scalars which extend significantly $\mathbb{R}$ or
$\mathbb{C}$, variety of scalars in terms of which various theories of Physics
can equally well be formulated.
  First directions in this regard can be found naturally in the simple
Mathematics of Special Relativity, the Bell Inequalities in Quantum Mechanics,
or in the considerable amount of elementary Mathematics in finite dimensional
vector spaces which occurs in Quantum Computation.

The laser threshold decreases for increasing refractive index $n$ and is
smaller for TM polarization than for TE polarization, but is almost independent
of the number of out-coupling modes $N$. The Petermann factor in the line width
of the longest-living resonance also decreases for increasing $n$ and scales as
$\sqrt{N}$, but is less sensitive to polarization. For resonances of
intermediate lifetime, the Petermann factor scales linearly with $N$. These
qualitative parametric dependencies are consistent with the random-matrix
theory of resonators with small openings. However, for a small refractive index
where the resonators are very open, the details of the statistics become
non-universal. This is demonstrated by comparison with a particular dynamical
model.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking is treated in a purely fermionic setting via
anomalous propagators and anomalous effective interactions. In addition to the
anomalous interactions arising already in the reduced BCS model, effective
interactions with three incoming legs and one outgoing leg (and vice versa)
occur. We accomplish their integration into the usual diagrammatic formalism by
introducing a Nambu matrix for the effective interactions. From a random-phase
approximation generalized through use of this matrix we conclude that the
impact of the 3+1 effective interactions is limited, especially considering the
effective interactions important for the determination of the order parameter.
The exact hierarchy of flow equations for one-particle irreducible vertex
functions is truncated on the two-particle level, with higher-order self-energy
corrections included in a scheme proposed by Katanin. Using a parametrization
of effective interactions by patches in momentum space, the flow equations can
be integrated numerically to the lowest scales without encountering
divergences. Momentum-shell as well as interaction-flow cutoff functions are
used, including a small external field or a large external field and a
counterterm, respectively. Both approaches produce momentum-resolved order
parameter values directly from the microscopic model. The size of the
superconducting gap is in reasonable agreement with expectations from other

fibrils (DFs) in the Ca {\small{II}} 8662 {\AA} line. These data show clear
Doppler shifts in the identified DFs, which demonstrates that at least a subset
of DFs are actual mass motions in the chromosphere. A statistical analysis of
26 DFs reveals a strong and statistically significant correlation between the
maximal velocity and the deceleration. The range of the velocities and the
decelerations are substantially lower, about a factor two, in our spectroscopic
observations compared to the earlier results based on proper motion in narrow
band images. There are fundamental differences in the different observational
methods; when DFs are observed spectroscopically the measured Doppler shifts
are a result of the atmospheric velocity, weighted with the response function
to velocity over an extended height. When the proper motion of DFs is observed
in narrow band images, the movement of the top of the DF is observed. This
point is sharply defined because of the high contrast between the DF and the
surroundings. The observational differences between the two methods are
examined by several numerical experiments using both numerical simulations and
a time series of narrow band H$\alpha$ images. With basis in the simulations we
conclude that the lower maximal velocity is explained by the low formation
height of the Ca IR line. We conclude that the present observations support the
earlier result that DFs are driven by magneto-acoustic shocks exited by
convective flows and p-modes.

that there is no universal Schmidt law SFR \rho_{gas}^n, common to all

requires the Lipschitz continuity of the flux function; and entropy solutions
even for the Riemann problem are not unique under the classical entropy
conditions. On the other hand, it is known that, in statistical mechanics, some
microscopic interacting particle systems with discontinuous speed parameter
lambda(x), in the hydrodynamic limit, formally lead to scalar hyperbolic
conservation laws with discontinuous fluxes of the form:
\partial_t\rho+\partial_x(\lambda(x)h(\rho))=0. The natural question arises
which entropy solutions the hydrodynamic limit selects, thereby leading to a
suitable, physical relevant notion of entropy solutions of this class of

identify the entropy condition for our PDE and proceed to show the
well-posedness by combining our existence result with a uniqueness result of

several research groups reporting slowing down of the optical pulses down to
speeds of a few metres per second encourage us to examine the intriguing
possibility of detecting a deflection or fall of the ultra slow light under
Earth's gravity, i.e., on the laboratory length scale. In the absence of a
usable general relativistic theory of light waves propagating in such a
strongly dispersive optical medium in the presence of a gravitational field, we
present a geometrical optics based derivation that combines {\it the effective
gravitational refractive index} additively with the usual optical dispersion.
It gives a deflection, or the vertical fall $\Delta$ for a horizontal traversal
$L$ as \[ \Delta = \frac{L^2}{2}\big(\frac{R_{\oplus G}}{R_\oplus^2}\big) n_g
\big(\frac{1}{1+n_g\frac{R_{\oplus G}}{R_\oplus}}\big), \] where $R_{\oplus
G}/R_\oplus$ is the ratio of the gravitational Earth radius($R_{\oplus G}$) to
its geometrical radius $R_\oplus$, and $n_g$ is the group refractive index of
the strongly dispersive optical medium. The expression is essentailly that for
the Newtonian fall of an object projected horizontally with the group speed
$v_g=c/n_g$, and is tunable refractively through the index $n_g$. For $L \sim 1
m$ and $n_g = c/v_g \sim 10^8$ (corresponding to the ultra-slow pulse speed

equality and decoupling occur at correct temperatures. We find that with a
continuous, time-independent interaction, a small initial curvaton density is
naturally preferred along with a low reheating temperature. Allowing for a
time-dependent interaction, this constraint can be relaxed. In both cases, a
purely adiabatic final state can be generated, but not without fine-tuning.
Unlike in the two fluid system, the time-dependent interactions are found to

effective theory (HOBET) in next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO). As
the included space in a HOBET (as in the shell model) is defined by the
oscillator energy, both long-distance (low-momentum) and short-distance
(high-momentum) degrees of freedom reside in the high-energy excluded space. A
HOBET effective interaction is developed in which a short-range
contact-gradient expansion is combined with an exact summation of the relative
kinetic energy. By this means the very strong coupling of the included (P) and
excluded (Q) spaces by the kinetic energy is removed. One finds that the
interplay of QT and QV is governed by a single parameter kappa, the ratio of an
observable, the binding energy |E|, to a parameter in the effective theory, the
oscillator energy. Once the functional dependence on kappa is identified, the
remaining order-by-order subtraction of the short-range physics residing in Q
becomes systematic and rapidly converging. Numerical calculations are used to
demonstrate how well the resulting expansion reproduces the running of Heff
from high scales to a typical shell-model scale of 8 hbar omega. At N3LO
various global properties of Heff are reproduced to a typical accuracy of
0.01%, or about 1 keV.
  The state-dependence of the effective interaction has been a troubling
problem in nuclear physics, and is embodied in the energy dependence of
Heff(|E|) in the Bloch-Horowitz formalism. It is shown that almost all of this
state dependence is also extracted in the procedures followed here, isolated in
the analytic dependence of Heff on kappa. Thus there exists a simple, Hermitian
Heff that can be use in spectral calculations.

wideband slow-fading channel, modeled as an (asymptotically) large number of
independent identically distributed parallel channels, with the random channel
fading realizations remaining constant over the entire coding block. On the one
hand, in the wideband limit the minimum achievable energy per nat required for
reliable transmission, as a random variable, converges in probability to
certain deterministic quantity. On the other hand, the exponential decay rate
of the outage probability, termed as the wideband outage exponent,
characterizes how the number of parallel channels, {\it i.e.}, the
``bandwidth'', should asymptotically scale in order to achieve a targeted
outage probability at a targeted energy per nat. We examine two scenarios: when
the transmitter has no channel state information and adopts uniform transmit
power allocation among parallel channels; and when the transmitter is endowed
with an one-bit channel state feedback for each parallel channel and
accordingly allocates its transmit power. For both scenarios, we evaluate the
wideband minimum energy per nat and the wideband outage exponent, and discuss
their implication for system performance.

ELAIS-S1 field (1 sq. deg.). Galaxies with the 1.6 microns stellar peak

Stellar masses were derived by means of spectro-photometric fitting and used to
compute the stellar mass function (MF) at z=1-2 and 2-3. A parametric fit to
the MF was performed, based on a Bayesian formalism, and the stellar mass
density of massive galaxies above z=2 determined. We present the first
systematic study of the very-massive tail of the galaxy stellar mass function
at high redshift. A total of 326 sources were selected. The majority of these
galaxies have stellar masses in excess of 1e11 Msun and lie at z>1.5. The
availability of mid-IR data turned out to be a valuable tool to constrain the
contribution of young stars to galaxy SEDs, and thus their M(stars)/L ratio.
The influence of near-IR data and of the chosen stellar library on the SED
fitting are also discussed. A significant evolution is found not only for
galaxies with M~1e11 Msun, but also in the highest mass bins considered. The
comoving number density of these galaxies was lower by more than a factor of 10
at z=2-3, with respect to the local estimate. SWIRE 5.8 micron peakers more
massive than 1.6x1e11 Msun provide 30-50% of the total stellar mass density in
galaxies at z=2-3.

interpreted as a model for the electron-positron system, in which the concepts
of mass, charge and spin emerge from the spacetime geometry. According to this
model, therefore, instead of a simple arena, spacetime must have a concrete
existence, being responsible -- through its highly non-trivial topological
structures -- for the building blocks of (at least some of) the existing matter

fit solution is that of an oblate ellipsoid $\bar{\beta}=0.22$ and
$\sigma=0.1$. Previously only prolate distributions were thought compatible
with the data, this being interprated as evidence of filamentary collapse at
nodes. We also find that even after allowing for the sampling effects, the
corrected data is better fit using separate multiplicity bins, which display a
trend towards more spherical halos in higher multiplicity groups. Finally, we
find that all results in the real data are in good agreement with the mock data
from $\Lambda$CDM simulations, KS tests showing that all comparative data have
been drawn from the same distributions within the $1\sigma$ confidence limits.

the very early Universe stability and on the dynamics associated to the extreme

is related to the energy density $\rho$ via a power-law of the form
$\zeta=\zeta_0 \rho^s$ (where $\zeta_0, s=const.$) and the behavior of the
density contrast in analyzed.
  In the first case, matter filling the isotropic and homogeneous background is
described by an ultra-relativistic equation of state. The analytic expression
of the density contrast shows that its growth is suppressed forward in time as
soon as $\zeta_0$ overcomes a critical value. On the other hand, in such a
regime, the asymptotic approach to the initial singularity admits an unstable
collapsing picture.
  In the second case, we investigate the top-down fragmentation process of an
uniform and spherically symmetric gas cloud within the framework of a Newtonian
approach, including the negative pressure contribution associated to the bulk
viscous phenomenology. In the extreme regime toward the singularity, we show
that the density contrast associated to an adiabatic-like behavior of the gas
(which is identified by a particular range of the politropic index) acquire,
for sufficiently large viscous contributions, a vanishing behavior which
prevents the formation of sub-structures. Such a feature is not present in the
isothermal-like collapse. We also emphasize that in the adiabatic-like case
bulk viscosity is also responsible for the appearance of a threshold scale
(equivalent to a Jeans length) beyond which perturbations begin to increase.

a model is an accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of
its intended uses. Validation is crucial as industries and governments depend
increasingly on predictions by computer models to justify their decisions. In
this article, we survey the model validation literature and propose to
formulate validation as an iterative construction process that mimics the
process occurring implicitly in the minds of scientists. We thus offer a formal
representation of the progressive build-up of trust in the model, and thereby
replace incapacitating claims on the impossibility of validating a given model
by an adaptive process of constructive approximation. This approach is better
adapted to the fuzzy, coarse-grained nature of validation. Our procedure
factors in the degree of redundancy versus novelty of the experiments used for
validation as well as the degree to which the model predicts the observations.
We illustrate the new methodology first with the maturation of Quantum
Mechanics as the arguably best established physics theory and then with several
concrete examples drawn from some of our primary scientific interests: a
cellular automaton model for earthquakes, an anomalous diffusion model for
solar radiation transport in the cloudy atmosphere, and a computational fluid
dynamics code for the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability. This article is an

optimization problem. The double-tree shortcutting method for Metric TSP yields
an exponentially-sized space of TSP tours, each of which approximates the
optimal solution within at most a factor of 2. We consider the problem of
finding among these tours the one that gives the closest approximation, i.e.\
the \emph{minimum-weight double-tree shortcutting}. Burkard et al. gave an
algorithm for this problem, running in time $O(n^3+2^d n^2)$ and memory $O(2^d
n^2)$, where $d$ is the maximum node degree in the rooted minimum spanning
tree. We give an improved algorithm for the case of small $d$ (including planar
Euclidean TSP, where $d \leq 4$), running in time $O(4^d n^2)$ and memory
$O(4^d n)$. This improvement allows one to solve the problem on much larger
instances than previously attempted. Our computational experiments suggest that
in terms of the time-quality tradeoff, the minimum-weight double-tree
shortcutting method provides one of the best known tour-constructing
heuristics.

there also are a few permitted lines of species from low to intermediate
ionization. Ton 34 (z=1.928) exhibits the steepest far-UV continuum decline
known (Fnu propto nu^{-5.3}) shortward of 1050A. This object also emits
unusually strong low to intermediate excitation permitted lines shortward of
the Lyman limit. Using archive spectra of Ton 34 from HST, IUE and Palomar, we
measure the fluxes of all the lines present in the spectra and compare their
relative intensities with those observed in composite quasar spectra. Our
analysis reveals unusual strengths with respect to Ly_alpha of the following
low to intermediate excitation permitted lines: OII+OIII (835A), NIII+OIII

strengths of these far-UV lines. Shocks with Vs ~ 100 km/s turn out to be
extremely efficient emitters of these lines and are favored as excitation
mechanism.
