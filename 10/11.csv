  unresolved point sources","9 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables. Submitted to ApJ",,"10.1086/592030",,"astro-ph",,"  Precision measurement of the scalar perturbation spectral index, n_s, from
the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe temperature angular power spectrum
requires the subtraction of unresolved point source power. Here we reconsider
this issue. First, we note a peculiarity in the WMAP temperature likelihood's
response to the source correction: Cosmological parameters do not respond to
increased source errors. An alternative and more direct method for treating
this error term acts more sensibly, and also shifts n_s by ~0.3 sigma closer to
unity. Second, we re-examine the source fit used to correct the power spectrum.
This fit depends strongly on the galactic cut and the weighting of the map,
indicating that either the source population or masking procedure is not
isotropic. Jackknife tests appear inconsistent, causing us to assign large
uncertainties to account for possible systematics. Third, we note that the WMAP
team's spectrum was computed with two different weighting schemes: uniform
weights transition to inverse noise variance weights at l = 500. The fit
depends on such weighting schemes, so different corrections apply to each
multipole range. For the Kp2 mask used in cosmological analysis, we prefer
source corrections A = 0.012 +/- 0.005 muK^2 for uniform weighting and A =
0.015 +/- 0.005 muK^2 for N_obs weighting. Correcting WMAP's spectrum
correspondingly, we compute cosmological parameters with our alternative
likelihood, finding n_s = 0.970 +/- 0.017 and sigma_8 = 0.778 +/- 0.045 . This
n_s is only 1.8 sigma from unity, compared to the ~2.6 sigma WMAP 3-year
result. Finally, an anomalous feature in the source spectrum at l<200 remains,
most strongly associated with W-band.

transformations of four-component Majorana spinors GL(4,M) which is isomorphic
to GL(4,R) and is the covering of an extended Lorentz group in a 6D Minkowski
space M(3,3) including superluminal and scaling transformations. Physical
space-time is assumed to be a 4D pseudo-Riemannian manifold. To connect the
extended Lorentz symmetry in the M(3,3) space with the physical space-time, a
fiber bundle over the 4D manifold is introduced with M(3,3) as a typical fiber.
The action is constructed which is invariant with respect to both general 4D
coordinate and local GL(4,M) spinor transformations. The components of the
metric on the 6D fiber are expressed in terms of the 4D pseudo-Riemannian
metric and two extra complex fields: 4D vector and scalar ones. These extra
fields describe in the general case massive particles interacting with an extra
U(1) gauge field and weakly interacting with ordinary particles, i.e.
possessing properties of invisible (dark) matter.

that some heating process must work to suppress the cooling. The most likely
heating source is the heating by AGNs. There are many heating mechanisms, but
we will adopt the effervescent heating model which is a result of the
interaction of the bubbles inflated by AGN with the intra-cluster medium(ICM).
  Using the FLASH code, we have carried out time dependent simulations to
investigate the effect of the heating on the suppression of the cooling in
cooling flow clusters. We have found that the effervescent heating model can
not balance the radiative cooling and it is an artificial model. Furthermore,
the effervescent heating is a function of the ICM pressure gradient but the
cooling is proportional to the gas density square and square root of the gas
temperature.

Similarly to the classical two-user interference channel, the cognitive
interference channel consists of two transmitters whose signals interfere at
the two receivers. It is assumed that there is a common message source (message
1) known to both transmitters, and an additional independent message source
(message 2) known only to the cognitive transmitter (transmitter 2). The
cognitive receiver (receiver 2) needs to decode both messages, while the
non-cognitive receiver (receiver 1) should decode only the common message.
Furthermore, message 2 is assumed to be a confidential message which needs to
be kept as secret as possible from receiver 1, which is viewed as an
eavesdropper with regard to message 2. The level of secrecy is measured by the
equivocation rate. A single-letter expression for the capacity-equivocation
region of the discrete memoryless cognitive interference channel is established
and is further explicitly derived for the Gaussian case. Moreover,
particularizing the capacity-equivocation region to the case without a secrecy
constraint, establishes a new capacity theorem for a class of interference
channels, by providing a converse theorem.

assuming that the gauge fields and fermions of the Standard Model (SM)

(KK) signatures and indicate that discovering gauge KK modes is likely
possible, yet challenging, while graviton KK modes are unlikely to be
accessible at the LHC, even with a luminosity upgrade. We show that direct
evidence for bulk SM fermions, {\it i.e.} their KK modes, is likely also beyond
the reach of a luminosity-upgraded LHC. Thus, neither the spin-2 KK graviton,
the most distinct RS signal, nor the KK SM fermions, direct evidence for bulk
flavor, seem to be within the reach of the LHC. We then consider hadron
colliders with $\sqrt{s} =$ 21, 28, and 60 TeV. We find that discovering the
first KK modes of SM fermions and the graviton typically requires the Next

ab$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. If the LHC yields hints of these warped
models, establishing that Nature is described by them, or their 4D CFT duals,
requires an NHC-class machine in the post-LHC experimental program.

superconformal field theory duals of AdS_5 x X geometries from first principles
is proposed. The main idea is that at strong coupling the configurations that
dominate the low energy dynamics of the field theory compactified on a three
sphere are given by certain non-trivial semi-classical configurations in the
moduli space of vacua.
  We show that this approach is self-consistent and permits one to express most
of the dynamics in terms of an effective N=4 SYM dynamics. This has the
advantage that some degrees of freedom that move the configurations away from
moduli space can be treated perturbatively, unifying the essential low energy
dynamics of all of these theories. We show that with this formalism one can
compute the energies of strings in the BMN limit in the Klebanov-Witten theory
from field theory considerations, matching the functional form of results found
using AdS geometry. This paper also presents various other technical results

electrons in a metallic wire in the presence of impurities, and phase-separated

stellar mass and photometric redshift estimates (where necessary) are robust to
the possible contamination from AGNs in our X-ray selected sample. Accounting
for the photometric and X-ray sensitivity limits of the survey, we construct
the stellar mass function of X-ray selected AGN host galaxies and find that
their abundance decreases by a factor of ~2 since z~1, but remains roughly flat
as a function of stellar mass. We compare the abundance of AGN hosts to the
rate of star formation quenching observed in the total galaxy population. If
the timescale for X-ray detectable AGN activity is roughly 0.5-1 Gyr--as
suggested by black hole demographics and recent simulations--then we deduce
that the inferred AGN ""trigger"" rate matches the star formation quenching rate,
suggesting a link between these phenomena. However, given the large range of
nuclear accretion rates we infer for the most massive and red hosts, X-ray
selected AGNs may not be directly responsible for quenching star formation.

accurate densitometer for the active star formation environments found in

emission and absorption from both H2CO transitions, our technique is applied to
a sample of nineteen IR-bright galaxies which exhibit various forms of
starburst activity. In the five galaxies of our sample where both H2CO
transitions were detected we have derived spatial densities. We also use H2CO
to estimate the dense gas mass in our starburst galaxy sample, finding similar
mass estimates for the dense gas forming stars in these objects as derived
using other dense gas tracers. A related trend can be seen when one compares
L_IR to our derived n(H2) for the five galaxies within which we have derived
spatial densities. Even though our number statistics are small, there appears
to be a trend toward higher spatial density for galaxies with higher infrared
luminosity. This is likely another representation of the L_IR-M_dense

rise to near tri-bimaximal leptonic mixing as well as realistic CKM matrix
elements for the quarks. The Georgi-Jarlskog relations for three generations
are also obtained. Due to the (d)T transformation property of the matter
fields, the b-quark mass can be generated only when the (d)T symmetry is
broken, giving a dynamical origin for the hierarchy between m_b and m_t. There
are only nine operators allowed in the Yukawa sector up to at least mass
dimension seven due to an additional Z12 x Z12' symmetry, which also forbids,
up to some high orders, operators that lead to proton decay. The resulting
model has a total of nine parameters in the charged fermion and neutrino
sectors, and hence is very predictive. In addition to the prediction for
theta13 ~ theta_c/3sqrt{2}, the model gives rise to a sum rule,
tan^2(theta_{solar}) ~ tan^2(theta_{solar,TBM}) - 1/2*theta_c*cos(beta), which
is a consequence of the Georgi-Jarlskog relations in the quark sector. This
deviation could account for the difference between the experimental best fit
value for the solar mixing angle and the value predicted by the tri-bimaximal
mixing matrix.

transition from an infinite-range to a long-range interaction at $\sigma=0.5$

signaled by a change in the scaling behavior of the average avalanche size

analysis of the way auto-correlations evolve during the optimization procedure
confirm that the search of phase space is less efficient, with the system

nuclei crash into each other, and form compressed and energetically excited
nuclear matter, resembling in its key features the stuff which filled the early
Universe. In these experiments we further explore the physics of the vacuum
structure of strongly interacting gauge theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).
The common beginning for both, heavy ion collisions, and vacuum structure

the presence of the supercritical external field that is formed when two highly
charged heavy ions are brought together near to the Coulomb barrier in a

  figures, Supplementary Information",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con",,"  Despite over two decades of intense research efforts, the origin of
high-temperature superconductivity in the copper oxides remains elusive.
Angle-resolved photoemission experiments (ARPES) revealed a kink in the
dispersion relations (energy vs. wavevector) of electronic states in the
cuprates at binding energies of 50-80 meV, and raised the hope that this
anomaly could be key to understanding high-temperature superconductivity. The
kink is often interpreted in terms of interactions between the electrons and a
bosonic field. While there is no consensus on the nature of the bosons or even
whether a boson model is appropriate, phonons and spin fluctuations have
alternatively been proposed as possible candidates. Here we report
state-of-the-art first-principles calculations of the role of phonons and the
electron-phonon interaction in the photoemission spectra of La2-xSrxCuO4
(LSCO). Our study demonstrates that the phonon-induced renormalization of the
electron energies and the Fermi velocity is almost one order of magnitude
smaller than the effect observed in photoemission experiments. Hence, the
present finding rules out electron-phonon interaction in bulk LSCO as the
possible origin of the measured kink. This result should bear on several
proposed theories of high temperature superconductivity in addition to theories
concerning the origin of kinks in cuprate photoemission data.

investigated, and the results are compared with those for superconducting

non-photonic electrons in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s) = 200 GeV. This R_AA
exhibits a large suppression for pt > 2 GeV/c which is commonly attributed to
heavy-quark energy loss. It is expected that the heavy-quark radiative energy
loss is smaller than the light quark one because of the so-called dead-cone
effect. An enhancement of the charm baryon yield with respect to the charm
meson yield, as it is observed for light and strange hadrons, can explain part
of the suppression. This phenomenon has been put forward in a previous work. We
present in this paper a more complete study based on a detailed simulation
which includes electrons from charm and bottom decay, charm and bottom quark
realistic energy loss as well as a more realistic modeling of the Lambda_c/D
enhancement. We show that a Lambda_c/D ratio close to unity, as observed for
light and strange quarks, could explain 20-25% of the suppression of
non-photonic electrons in central Au+Au collisions. This effect remains
significant at relatively high non-photonic electron transverse momenta of 8-9

images of each galaxy pair as the line-of-sight projection of symmetric models
and identify mergers by the presence of residual asymmetries around each
progenitor, such as off-center isophotes, broad tidal tails, and dynamical
friction wakes. At the resolution and sensitivity of the SDSS, such mergers are
found in 16% of high-mass, galaxy-galaxy pairs with magnitude differences of
<1.5 and <30 kpc projected separations. We find that 90% of these mergers have
nearly equal-mass progenitors with red-sequence colors and
centrally-concentrated morphologies, the hallmarks of dissipationless merger
simulations. Mergers at group centers are more common than between 2
satellites, but both are morphologically indistinguishable and we tentatively
conclude that the latter are likely located at the dynamical centers of
recently accreted subhalos. The frequency of central and satellite merging
diminishes with group mass consistent with dynamical friction expectations.
Based on reasonable assumptions, the centers of these massive halos are growing
in stellar mass by 1-9% per Gyr, on average. Compared to all LRG-LRG mergers,
we find a 2-9 times higher rate for their merging when restricted to these
dense environments. Our results imply that the massive end of the galaxy
population continues to evolve hierarchically at a measurable level, and that
the centers of massive groups are the preferred environment for merger-driven
galaxy assembly. (abridged)

under projection. Thus, starting from an arbitrary neighborly simplicial
(d-2)-polytope Q on n-1 vertices we construct a deformed n-cube, whose
projection to the last dcoordinates yields a neighborly cubical d-polytope. As
an extension of thecubical case, we construct matrix representations of
deformed products of(even) polygons (DPPs), which have a projection to d-space
that retains the complete (\lfloor \tfrac{d}{2} \rfloor - 1)-skeleton. In both
cases the combinatorial structure of the images under projection is completely
determined by the neighborly polytope Q: Our analysis provides explicit
combinatorial descriptions. This yields a multitude of combinatorially
different neighborly cubical polytopes and DPPs. As a special case, we obtain

optical axis up to 2''.2 at the edge of the field (6.2-10.7 mcm); the
corresponding range of the D_80 diameter for the design B is 1''.5-1''.9

define two invariants called a characteristic pair and an Euler class of the
orbit map, and prove that local torus actions are classified topologically by
them. As a corollary, we obtain a topological classification of locally
standard torus actions, which is a generalization of the topological
classification of quasi-toric manifolds by Davis and Januszkiewicz and of
effective two-dimensional torus actions on four-dimensional manifolds without
nontrivial finite stabilizers by Orlik and Raymond. We investigate locally
toric Lagrangian fibrations from the viewpoint of local torus actions. We give
a necessary and sufficient condition in order that a local torus action becomes
a locally toric Lagrangian fibration. Locally toric Lagrangian fibrations are
classified by Boucetta and Molino up to fiber-preserving symplectomorphisms. We
shall reprove the classification theorem of locally toric Lagrangian fibrations
by refining the proof of the classification theorem of local torus actions. We
also investigate the topology of a manifold equipped with a local torus action

Several
recent surveys have found evidence for the existence of large-scale structure
at high redshifts as well. We present analytic estimates of galaxy void sizes

narrow-band surveys at z ~ 5 - 6.5 should find voids with characteristic scales
of roughly 20 comoving Mpc and maximum diameters approaching 40 Mpc. This is
consistent with existing surveys, but a precise comparison is difficult because
of the relatively small volumes probed so far. At z ~ 7 - 10, we expect
characteristic void scales of ~ 14 - 20 comoving Mpc assuming that all galaxies
within dark matter haloes more massive than 10^10 M_sun are observable. We find
that these characteristic scales are similar to the sizes of empty regions
resulting from purely random fluctuations in the galaxy counts. As a result,
true large-scale structure will be difficult to observe at z ~ 7 - 10, unless
galaxies in haloes with masses less than ~ 10^9 M_sun are visible. Galaxy
surveys must be deep and only the largest voids will provide meaningful
information. Our model provides a convenient picture for estimating the
""worst-case"" effects of cosmic variance on high-redshift galaxy surveys with
limited volumes.

acoustic metric for quasiparticles. In the rotating frame this metric has an
ergosurface, which is similar to the ergosurface in the metric of a rotating
black hole. In a finite size BEC, the quasiparticle creation takes place when
the ergosurface is within the condensate and occurs via quantum tunneling from
the object into the ergoregion. The dependence of the radiation rate on the

earlier by Gattringer with the help of eight-vertex-models, the Boltzmann
weight is essentially positive. While standard local updates are possible in

residing on plaquettes. For this model a Swendsen-Wang type cluster algorithm

various parameters, including the impacting velocity $v$, cavity size $R$, etc,
to the dynamical and thermodynamical behaviors of the material. For the
colliding of two bodies with a cavity in each, a secondary impacting is
observed. Correspondingly, the separation distance $D$ of the two bodies has a
maximum value $D_{\max}$ in between the initial and second impacts. When the
initial impacting velocity $v$ is not large enough, the cavity collapses in a
nearly symmetric fashion, the maximum separation distance $D_{\max}$ increases
with $v$. When the initial shock wave is strong enough to collapse the cavity
asymmetrically along the shock direction, the variation of $D_{\max}$ with $v$
does not show monotonic behavior. Our numerical results show clear indication

coupled at high temperature, the zero modes remain strongly coupled. We find,
however, that the integration over the zero modes that remains after
integrating out all the non-zero modes perturbatively, reduces to the
evaluation of connected Green's functions in the bosonic IKKT model. We perform
Monte Carlo simulation to compute these Green's functions, which are then used
to obtain the coefficients of the high temperature expansion for various
quantities up to the next-leading order. Our results nicely reproduce the
asymptotic behaviors of the recent simulation results at finite temperature. In
particular, the fermionic matrices, which decouple at the leading order, give
rise to substantial effects at the next-leading order, reflecting finite

Technibaryon asymmetry generated in the early Universe is related to baryon

\emph{techni-O-helium} $tOHe$ ``atoms'', as soon as $^4He$ is formed in Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis. The interaction of techni-O-helium with nuclei opens new
paths to the creation of heavy nuclei in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. Due to the
large mass of technibaryons, the $tOHe$ ``atomic'' gas decouples from the
baryonic matter and plays the role of dark matter in large scale structure
formation, while structures in small scales are suppressed. Nuclear
interactions with matter slow down cosmic techni-O-helium in Earth below the
threshold of underground dark matter detectors, thus escaping severe CDMS
constraints. On the other hand, these nuclear interactions are not sufficiently
strong to exclude this form of Strongly Interactive Massive Particles by
constraints from the XQC experiment. Experimental tests of this hypothesis are
possible in search for $tOHe$ in balloon-borne experiments (or on the ground)
and for its charged techniparticle constituents in cosmic rays and

matter and might form anomalous isotopes, offering possible ways to exclude (or

This unperturbed model is supposed to represent approximately the typical

Not only axisymmetric but non-axisymmetric perturbations have been also

rates of SASI are degenerate with respect to the azimuthal index m of the
spherical harmonics Y_l^m, just as expected for a spherically symmetric

axisymmetric perturbations, whereas m=!0 modes are also generated in the
non-axisymmetric cases according to the selection rule for the quadratic

for 3D than for 2D because a larger number of modes are contributing to

thermal equilibrium, causing it to expand. This can lead to a contact system,
strong mass loss from the system and possibly merging of the two stars. In low
metallicity stars the timescale for heat transport is shorter due to the lower
opacity. The accreting star can therefore restore thermal equilibrium more
quickly and possibly avoid contact.
  We investigate the effect of accretion onto main sequence stars with
radiative envelopes with different metallicities. We find that a low
metallicity (Z<0.001), 4 solar mass star can endure a 10 to 30 times higher
accretion rate before it reaches a certain radius than a star at solar
metallicity. This could imply that up to two times fewer systems come into
contact during rapid mass transfer when we compare low metallicity. This factor
is uncertain due to the unknown distribution of binary parameters and the
dependence of the mass transfer timescale on metallicity. In a forthcoming
paper we will present analytic fits to models of accreting stars at various

barrier causes the system to decay faster in general. However, avoided

then it is possible to stabilize a metastable state by adiabatically increasing

Recently, Feigel has predicted that such a medium may ``extract momentum from

the feasibility of this effect. The crucial point in our study is an assumption
of the finite size of the magnetoelectric sample, which allows us to reduce the
calculation of the momenta and forces of the electromagnetic waves acting on
the sample to the vacuum region outside of the medium. In this framework, we
demonstrate that, in contrast to Feigel, the total force caused by the virtual
is zero, with an appropriate count of the modes that should be taken into
account in this effect. Furthermore, we find that the two irreducible parts of
the magnetoelectric matrix behave differently in the possible Feigel effect.
Going beyond the original scheme of the virtual electromagnetic waves, we
propose an experimental scheme which is suitable for the measurement of the

have significant implications on burst physics, giving constraints on

QCD. We start from a small volume, where one can use a standard O(a)-improved
relativistic action for the b-quark, and compute two step scaling functions
which relate the observables to the large volume ones. In all steps we
extrapolate to the continuum limit, separately in HQET and in QCD for masses
below m_b. The physical point m_b is then reached by an interpolation of the

the step scaling fuctions have a weak mass-dependence resulting in an easy
interpolation to the physical point. With r_0=0.5fm and the experimental B_s

  Methods: A simple phenomenological model of CO formation as the immediate
descendant of quiescently-recombining HCO+ is used to study the accumulation,
fractionation and rotational excitation of CO in more explicit and detailed
models of H2-bearing diffuse/H I clouds
  Results: The variation of N(CO) with N(H2) is explained by quiescent
recombination of a steady fraction n(HCO+)/n(H2) = 2 x 10^{-9}. Observed
N(12CO))/N(13CO) ratios generally do not require a special chemistry but result
from competing processes and do not provide much insight into the local gas
properties, especially the temperature. J=1-0 CO line brightnesses directly
represent N(CO), not N(H2), so the CO-H2 conversion factor varies widely; it
attains typical values at N(12CO) \la 10^{16}cm^{-2}. Models of CO rotational
excitation account for the line brightnesses and CO-H2 conversion factors but
readily reproduce the observed excitation temperatures and optical depths of
the rotational transitions only if excitation by H-atoms is weak -- as seems to
be the case for the very most recent calculations of these excitation rates.

galaxies is sensitive to the amplitude of the external shear and convergence
produced by nearby mass condensations. In current wide field surveys, it is now
possible to find out a large number of rings, typically 10 gravitational rings
per square degree. We propose here, to systematically study gravitational rings
around galaxy clusters to probe the cluster mass profile beyond the cluster
strong lensing regions. For cluster of galaxies with multiple arc systems, we
show that rings found at various distances from the cluster centre can improve
the modelling by constraining the slope of the cluster mass profile. We outline
the principle of the method with simple numerical simulations and we apply it
to 3 rings discovered recently in Abell~1689. In particular, the lens modelling
of the 3 rings confirms that the cluster is bimodal, and favours a slope of the
mass profile steeper than isothermal at a cluster radius $\sim 300 \kpc$. These
results are compared with previous lens modelling of Abell~1689 including weak
lensing analysis. Because of the difficulty arising from the complex mass
distribution in Abell~1689, we argue that the ring method will be better
implemented on simpler and relaxed clusters.

the population of reactive species per grain may be very small and strongly
fluctuating. Under these conditions rate equations fail and the simulation of
surface-reaction networks requires stochastic methods such as the master
equation. However, the master equation becomes infeasible for complex networks
because the number of equations proliferates exponentially. Here we introduce a
method based on moment equations for the simulation of reaction networks on
small grains. The number of equations is reduced to just one equation per
reactive specie and one equation per reaction. Nevertheless, the method
provides accurate results, which are in excellent agreement with the master
equation. The method is demonstrated for the methanol network which has been
recently shown to be of crucial importance.

approach restricts attention to procedures that control the probability of even
one false rejection, the familywise error rate (FWER). If $s$ is large, one
might be willing to tolerate more than one false rejection, thereby increasing
the ability of the procedure to correctly reject false null hypotheses. One
possibility is to replace control of the FWER by control of the probability of
$k$ or more false rejections, which is called the $k$-FWER. We derive both
single-step and step-down procedures that control the $k$-FWER in finite
samples or asymptotically, depending on the situation. We also consider the
false discovery proportion (FDP) defined as the number of false rejections
divided by the total number of rejections (and defined to be 0 if there are no
rejections). The false discovery rate proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg [J.
Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 57 (1995) 289--300] controls $E(FDP)$. Here, the goal
is to construct methods which satisfy, for a given $\gamma$ and $\alpha$,
$P\{FDP>\gamma\}\le \alpha$, at least asymptotically. In contrast to the
proposals of Lehmann and Romano [Ann. Statist. 33 (2005) 1138--1154], we
construct methods that implicitly take into account the dependence structure of
the individual test statistics in order to further increase the ability to
detect false null hypotheses. This feature is also shared by related work of

map shows a bimodal feature in the central $4'\times 4'$ region of the cluster.
The major, pronounced peak is associated with the brightest cluster galaxy and
central cluster members, while the secondary mass peak is associated with a
local concentration of bright galaxies. The refined, high-resolution mass map

reactions. Typically, such surface reactions involve billions of molecules
which diffuse and react over macroscopic areas. Therefore, stochastic
fluctuations are negligible and the reaction rates can be evaluated using rate
equations, which are based on the mean-field approximation. However, in case
that the surface is partitioned into a large number of disconnected microscopic
domains, the number of reactants in each domain becomes small and it strongly
fluctuates. This is, in fact, the situation in the interstellar medium, where
some crucial reactions take place on the surfaces of microscopic dust grains.
In this case rate equations fail and the simulation of surface reactions
requires stochastic methods such as the master equation. However, in the case
of complex reaction networks, the master equation becomes infeasible because
the number of equations proliferates exponentially. To solve this problem, we
introduce a stochastic method based on moment equations. In this method the
number of equations is dramatically reduced to just one equation for each
reactive species and one equation for each reaction. Moreover, the equations
can be easily constructed using a diagrammatic approach. We demonstrate the
method for a set of astrophysically relevant networks of increasing complexity.
It is expected to be applicable in many other contexts in which problems that
exhibit analogous structure appear, such as surface catalysis in nanoscale
systems, aerosol chemistry in stratospheric clouds and genetic networks in
cells.

populations of reactive species, stochastic fluctuations are negligible and the
reaction rates can be evaluated using rate equations. However, many physical
systems are partitioned into microscopic domains, where the number of molecules
in each domain is small and fluctuations are strong. Under these conditions,
the simulation of reaction networks requires stochastic methods such as direct
integration of the master equation. However, direct integration of the master
equation is infeasible for complex networks, because the number of equations
proliferates as the number of reactive species increases. Recently, the
multiplane method, which provides a dramatic reduction in the number of
equations, was introduced [A. Lipshtat and O. Biham, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93,
170601 (2004)]. The reduction is achieved by breaking the network into a set of
maximal fully connected sub-networks (maximal cliques). Lower-dimensional
master equations are constructed for the marginal probability distributions
associated with the cliques, with suitable couplings between them. In this
paper we test the multiplane method and examine its applicability. We show that
the method is accurate in the limit of small domains, where fluctuations are
strong. It thus provides an efficient framework for the stochastic simulation
of complex reaction networks with strong fluctuations, for which rate equations
fail and direct integration of the master equation is infeasible. The method
also applies in the case of large domains, where it converges to the rate
equation results.

conductivity of graphene, we determine the electronic density dependence of the
electronic transport coefficients -- conductivity, thermal conductivity and
thermopower -- of doped graphene. Also the electronic density dependence of the
optical conductivity is obtained. Finally we show that the classical Hall
effect (low field) in graphene has the same form as for the independent
electron case, characterized by a parabolic dispersion, as long as the
relaxation time is proportional to the momentum.

  Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20054773",,"astro-ph",,"  Using STIS and VLT UVES observations we have examined the ionization,
abundances, and differential dust depletion of metals, the kinematic structure,
and the physical conditions in the molecular hydrogen-bearing sub-damped Ly
alpha system toward HE 0515-4414 at z = 1.15. The velocity interval of
associated metal lines extends for 700 km/s. In addition, saturated H I
absorption is detected in the blue damping wing of the main component. The
column density ratios of associated Al II, Al III, and Fe II lines indicate
that the absorbing material is ionized. 19 of in total 31 detected metal line
components are formed within peripheral H II regions, while only 12 components
are associated with the predominantly neutral main absorber. For the main
absorber the observed abundance ratios of refractory elements to Zn range from
Galactic warm disk [Si/Zn] = - 0.40, [Fe/Zn] = -1.10 to halo-like and
essentially undepleted patterns. The dust-corrected metal abundances indicate a
nucleosynthetic odd-even effect and might imply an anomalous depletion of Si
relative to Fe for two components, but otherwise do correspond to solar ratios.
The intrinsic average metallicity is almost solar [Fe/H] = -0.08, whereas the
uncorrected average is [Zn/H] = -0.38. The ion abundances in the periphery
conform with solar element composition. The detection of H II as well as the
large variation in dust depletion for this sight line raises the question
whether in future studies of damped Ly alpha systems ionization and depletion
effects have to be considered in further detail. Ionization effects, for
instance, may pretend an enrichment of alpha elements. An empirical recipe for
detecting H II regions is provided.
