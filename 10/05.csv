that can naturally solve the supersymmetric flavour and CP problems. At leading
order in the g_s and \alpha' expansions, the hidden sector factorises. The
moduli space splits into two mirror parts that depend on Kahler and complex
structure moduli. Holomorphy implies the flavour structure of the Yukawa
couplings arises in only one part. In type IIA string theory flavour arises
through the Kahler moduli sector and in type IIB flavour arises through the
complex structure moduli sector. This factorisation gives a simple solution to
the supersymmetric flavour and CP problems: flavour physics is generated in one
sector while supersymmetry is broken in the mirror sector. This mechanism does
not require the presence of gauge, gaugino or anomaly mediation and is
explicitly realised by phenomenological models of IIB flux compactifications.

This coding scheme is in the form of a block Markov code. The transmitter uses
a superposition Markov code. The relay compresses the received signal and maps
the compressed version of the received signal into a codeword conditioned on
the codeword of the previous block. The receiver performs joint decoding after
it has received all of the B blocks. We show that this coding scheme can be
viewed as a generalization of the well-known Compress-And-Forward (CAF) scheme
proposed by Cover and El Gamal. Our coding scheme provides options for
preserving the correlation between the channel inputs of the transmitter and
the relay, which is not possible in the CAF scheme. Thus, our proposed scheme
may potentially yield a larger achievable rate than the CAF scheme.

High-angular-degree p modes","12 pages, accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20077775",,"astro-ph",,"  Turbulent motions in stellar convection zones generate acoustic energy, part
of which is then supplied to normal modes of the star. Their amplitudes result
from a balance between the efficiencies of excitation and damping processes in
the convection zones. We develop a formalism that provides the excitation rates
of non-radial global modes excited by turbulent convection. As a first
application, we estimate the impact of non-radial effects on excitation rates
and amplitudes of high-angular-degree modes which are observed on the Sun. A
model of stochastic excitation by turbulent convection has been developed to
compute the excitation rates, and it has been successfully applied to solar
radial modes (Samadi & Goupil 2001, Belkacem et al. 2006b). We generalize this
approach to the case of non-radial global modes. This enables us to estimate
the energy supplied to high-($\ell$) acoustic modes. Qualitative arguments as
well as numerical calculations are used to illustrate the results. We find that
non-radial effects for $p$ modes are non-negligible:
  - for high-$n$ modes (i.e. typically $n > 3$) and for high values of $\ell$;
the power supplied to the oscillations depends on the mode inertia.
  - for low-$n$ modes, independent of the value of $\ell$, the excitation is
dominated by the non-diagonal components of the Reynolds stress term. We
carried out a numerical investigation of high-$\ell$ $p$ modes and we find that
the validity of the present formalism is limited to $\ell < 500$ due to the
spatial separation of scale assumption. Thus, a model for very high-$\ell$
$p$-mode excitation rates calls for further theoretical developments, however
the formalism is valid for solar $g$ modes, which will be investigated in a
paper in preparation.

crashed into comet 9P/Tempel 1 with a velocity of about 10 km/s. The material
ejected by the impact expanded into the normal coma, produced by ordinary
cometary activity.
  The characteristics of the non-impact coma and cloud produced by the impact
were studied by observations in the visible wavelengths and in the near-IR. The
scattering characteristics of the ""normal"" coma of solid particles were studied
by comparing images in various spectral regions, from the UV to the near-IR.
  For the non-impact coma, a proxy of the dust production has been measured in
various spectral regions. The presence of sublimating grains has been detected.
Their lifetime was found to be about 11 hours. Regarding the cloud produced by
the impact, the total geometric cross section multiplied by the albedo was
measured as a function of the color and time. The projected velocity appeared
to obey a Gaussian distribution with the average velocity of the order of 115
m/s. By comparing the observations taken about 3 hours after the impact, we
have found a strong decrease in the cross section in J filter, while that in Ks
remained almost constant. This is interpreted as the result of sublimation of
grains dominated by particles of sizes of the order of some microns.

giant increases linearly with stellar mass from 0.4 M_sun to 3 M_sun. Stars
more massive than 3 M_sun evolve quickly to the main-sequence, which pushes the
snow line to 10-15 AU before protoplanets form and limits the range of disk
masses that form giant planet cores. If the frequency of gas giants around
solar-mass stars is 6%, we predict occurrence rates of 1% for 0.4 M_sun stars

subset of its parameter space. We identify three distinct frequency regimes
which we call the hydrodynamic regime, the perturbative regime and the
collisionless regime. In the lowest frequency regime (the hydrodynamic regime)
heat is transported ballistically by long wavelength sound modes. The model
that we use to describe this behaviour predicts that as the frequency goes to
zero the frequency dependent bulk viscosity and the frequency dependent thermal
conductivity should diverge with the same power law dependence on frequency.
Thus, we can define the bulk Prandtl number as the ratio of the bulk viscosity
to the thermal conductivity (with suitable prefactors to render it
dimensionless). This dimensionless ratio should approach a constant value as
frequency goes to zero. We use mode-coupling theory to predict the zero
frequency limit. Values of the bulk Prandtl number from simulations are in
agreement with these predictions over a wide range of system parameters. In the
middle frequency regime, which we call the perturbative regime, heat is
transported by sound modes which are damped by four-phonon processes. We call
the highest frequency regime the collisionless regime since at these
frequencies the observing times are much shorter than the characteristic
relaxation times of phonons. The perturbative and collisionless regimes are
discussed in detail in the appendices.

updating from a prior to a posterior probability distribution is tackled
through an eliminative induction process that singles out the logarithmic
relative entropy as the unique tool for inference. The resulting method of
Maximum relative Entropy (ME), which is designed for updating from arbitrary
priors given information in the form of arbitrary constraints, includes as
special cases both MaxEnt (which allows arbitrary constraints) and Bayes' rule
(which allows arbitrary priors). Thus, ME unifies the two themes of these
workshops -- the Maximum Entropy and the Bayesian methods -- into a single
general inference scheme that allows us to handle problems that lie beyond the
reach of either of the two methods separately. I conclude with a couple of
simple illustrative examples.

Our method, based on the combination of gravitational lensing and dynamical
data, is uniquely capable of separating the distribution of dark and baryonic
components at scales below 100 kpc. We find a variety of strong lensing models
fit the available data, including some with dark matter profiles as steep as
expected from recent simulations. However, when combined with stellar velocity
dispersion data for the brightest member, shallower inner slopes than predicted
by numerical simulations are preferred. For Abell 383, the preferred shallow
inner slopes are statistically a good fit only when the multiple image position
uncertainties associated with our lens model are assumed to be 0\farcs5, to
account for unknown substructure. No statistically satisfactory fit was
obtained matching both the multiple image lensing data and the velocity
dispersion profile of the brightest cluster galaxy in MS2137-23. This suggests
that the mass model we are using, which comprises a pseudo-elliptical
generalized NFW profile and a brightest cluster galaxy component may
inadequately represent the inner cluster regions. This may plausibly arise due
to halo triaxiality or by the gravitational interaction of baryons and dark
matter in cluster cores. However, the progress made via this detailed study
highlights the key role that complementary observations of lensed features and
stellar dynamics offer in understanding the interaction between dark and
baryonic matter on non-linear scales in the central regions of clusters.

the great part of the astrophysical studies the Minkowski metric is the best
choice to the background metric, it is not possible to consider this metric in
cosmology. In order to keep the Minkowski metric as background in this case, we
suggest an interpretation of the energy-momentum conservation in Visser's
theory, which is in accordance with the equivalence principle and recovers
naturally the special relativity in the absence of gravitational sources.
Although we do not present a general proof of our hypothesis we show its
validity in the simple case of a plane and dust-dominated universe, in which
the `massive term' appears like an extra contribution for the energy density.

phenomenon, suggesting a dense gas trigger for OHMs. We identify three physical
properties that differentiate OHM hosts from other starburst galaxies: (1) OHMs
have the highest mean molecular gas densities among starburst galaxies; nearly
all OHM hosts have <n(H2)> = 10^3-10^4 cm^-3 (OH line-emitting clouds likely
have n(H2) > 10^4 cm^-3). (2) OHM hosts are a distinct population in the
nonlinear part of the IR-CO relation. (3) OHM hosts have exceptionally high
dense molecular gas fractions, L(HCN)/L(CO)>0.07, and comprise roughly half of
this unusual population. OH absorbers and kilomasers generally follow the
linear IR-CO relation and are uniformly distributed in dense gas fraction and
L(HCN), demonstrating that OHMs are independent of OH abundance. The fraction
of non-OHMs with high mean densities and high dense gas fractions constrains
beaming to be a minor effect: OHM emission solid angle must exceed 2 pi
steradians. Contrary to conventional wisdom, IR luminosity does not dictate OHM
formation; both star formation and OHM activity are consequences of tidal
density enhancements accompanying galaxy interactions. The OHM fraction in
starbursts is likely due to the fraction of mergers experiencing a temporal
spike in tidally driven density enhancement. OHMs are thus signposts marking
the most intense, compact, and unusual modes of star formation in the local
universe. Future high redshift OHM surveys can now be interpreted in a star
formation and galaxy evolution context, indicating both the merging rate of
galaxies and the burst contribution to star formation.

a phase gradient to the atoms that limits the arm separation of the

that it can be alleviated by having the atoms undergo a more symmetric motion
in the guide. This can be achieved by either using additional laser pulses or
by allowing the atoms to freely oscillate in the potential. Using these
techniques, we demonstrate interferometer measurement times up to 72 ms and arm
separations up to 0.42 mm with a well controlled phase, or times of 0.91 s and

M_r=-13.5= M^*+8 and has a slope of alpha=-1.28+/-0.06. The red sequence of
cluster members is prominent in both clusters, and almost no cluster galaxies
are redder than this sequence. We show that selecting objects on the red
sequence and blueward produces a steeply rising faint-end. A large fraction of
photometric red-sequence galaxies lie behind the cluster. We compare our
results to previous estimates and find poor agreement with estimates based on
statistical background subtraction but good agreement with estimates based on
photometric membership classifications (e.g., colors, morphology, surface
brightness). We conclude that spectroscopic data are critical for estimating
the faint end of the luminosity function in clusters. The faint-end slope we
find is consistent with values found for field galaxies, weakening any argument
for environmental evolution in the relative abundance of dwarf galaxies.
However, dwarf galaxies in clusters are significantly redder than field
galaxies of similar luminosity or mass, indicating that star formation
processes in dwarfs do depend on environment.

peak of g_eff. By using a spectral formulation we show that, the anti-Zeno

the resonance energy and width such that a destructive interference can occur.

  Early-type cluster galaxies show a type Ia SN rate (0.066 SNuM) similar to
that obtained by Sharon et al. (2007) and more than 3 times larger than that in
field early-type galaxies (0.019 SNuM). This difference has a 98% statistical
confidence level. We examine many possible observational biases which could
affect the rate determination, and conclude that none of them is likely to
significantly alter the results. We investigate how the rate is related to
several properties of the parent galaxies, and find that cluster membership,
morphology and radio power all affect the SN rate, while galaxy mass has no
measurable effect. The increased rate may be due to galaxy interactions in
clusters, inducing either the formation of young stars or a different evolution
of the progenitor binary systems.

late-type galaxies, which turns out to be comparable to the rate in field
galaxies. This suggests that no large systematic difference in the initial mass

well-covered multifrequency spectrum from radio to hard X-ray energies could be

synchrotron and inverse-Compton (IC) emission from a relativistic jet. By the
significant exposure times of INTEGRAL and Chandra, the IC spectrum (0.3 - 100

bending. A comparison of this 2006 SED to the one observed in 2003, also
centered on an INTEGRAL observation, during an optical low-state, reveals the
surprising fact that - despite a significant change at the high-energy
synchrotron emission (near-IR/optical/UV) - the rest of the SED remains
unchanged. In particular, the low-energy IC emission (X- and hard X-ray

algorithms, including Milne-Eddington, LTE with 1 and 2 components, and MISMA

not sufficiently reliable to provide a direct magnetic diagnostic in the
presence of thermal fluctuations and variable line broadening. In general, one
needs to resort to inversion algorithms, ideally with realistic
magneto-hydrodynamical constrains. When this is done, the 5250 \AA lines do not
seem to provide any significant advantage over those at 6302 \AA . In fact, our
results point towards a better performance with the latter (in the presence of
turbulent line broadening). In any case, for very weak flux concentrations,
neither spectral region alone provides sufficient constraints to fully
disentangle the intrinsic field strengths. Instead, we advocate for a combined
analysis of both spectral ranges, which yields a better determination of the
quiet Sun magnetic properties. Finally, we propose the use of two other

on how the conductance of such a network vanishes as the percolation threshold
is approached from above. We also discuss the more microscopic current
distribution within each resistor of a large network. At the percolation
threshold, this distribution is multifractal in that all moments of this
distribution have independent scaling properties. We will discuss the meaning
of multifractal scaling and its implications for current flows in networks,

consistent with that of a normal L4.5 dwarf with notably enhanced FeH

with strong H2O and weak CO bands similar in character to several recently

guided by trends in the condensate cloud models of Burrows et al. and Marley et

adequately explained by the presence of thin and/or large-grained condensate
clouds as compared to normal field L dwarfs. Atypical surface gravities or
metallicities alone cannot reproduce the observed peculiarities, although they
may be partly responsible for the unusual condensate properties. We also rule
out unresolved multiplicity as a cause for the spectral peculiarities of 2MASS

spectral data from Cushing et al. which show that bluer L dwarfs tend to have
weaker 10 micron absorption, a feature tentatively associated with silicate

NpPd_{5}Al_{2} which transform directly from Curie paramagnets into
superconductors, reveals a new class of superconductor where local moments
quench directly into a superconducting condensate. A powerful tool in the
description of heavy fermion metals is the large N expansion, which expands the
physics in powers of 1/N about a solvable limit where particles carry a large
number (N) of spin components. As it stands, this method is unable to jointly
describe the spin quenching and superconductivity which develop in PuCoGa_{5}
and NpPd_{5}Al_{2}. Here, we solve this problem with a new class of large N
expansion that employs the symplectic symmetry of spin to protect the odd
time-reversal parity of spin and sustain Cooper pairs as well-defined singlets.
With this method we show that when a lattice of magnetic ions exchange spin
with their metallic environment in two distinct symmetry channels, they are
able to simultaneously satisfy both channels by forming a condensate of
composite pairs between between local moments and electrons. In the tetragonal
crystalline environment relevant to PuCoGa_{5} and NpPd_{5}Al_{2} the lattice
structure selects a natural pair of spin exchange channels, giving rise to the
prediction of a unique anisotropic paired state with g-wave symmetry. This
pairing mechanism predicts a large upturn in the NMR relaxation rate above
T_{c}, a strong enhancement of Andreev reflection in tunneling measurements and
an enhanced superconducting transition temperature T_{c} in Pu doped
Np_{1-x}Pu_{x}Pd_{5}Al_{2}.

  The purpose of this lecture is first, to briefly review a proposal for a
holographic cosmology by Freivogel, Sekino, Susskind, and Yeh (FSSY), and then
to develop a physical interpretation in terms of a ""Cosmic Census Taker:"" an
idea introduced in reference [1]. The mathematical structure--a hybrid of the
Wheeler DeWitt formalism and holography--is a boundary ""Liouville"" field
theory, whose UV/IR duality is closely related to the time evolution of the
Census Taker's observations. That time evolution is represented by the
renormalization-group flow of the Liouville theory.
  Although quite general, the Census Taker idea was originally introduced in
\cite{shenker}, for the purpose of counting bubbles that collide with the
Census Taker's bubble. The ""Persistence of Memory"" phenomenon discovered by
Garriga, Guth, and Vilenkin, has a natural RG interpretation, as does slow roll
inflation. The RG flow and the related C-theorem are closely connected with
generalized entropy bounds.

and velocity fields are close to Gaussian. On the other hand, the measured PDF
of injected power is very sharply peaked at zero, suggestive of a singularity
there, with tails which are exponential but asymmetric. Large positive
fluctuations are more probable than large negative fluctuations. It is this
asymmetry of the tails, which leads to a net positive mean value for the energy
input despite the most probable value being zero. The main features of the
power distribution are well described by Craig's XY distribution for the PDF of
the product of two correlated normal variables. We show that the power
distribution should exhibit a logarithmic singularity at zero and decay
exponentially for large absolute values of the power. We calculate the
asymptotic behavior and express the asymmetry of the tails in terms of the
correlation coefficient of the force and velocity. We compare the measured pdfs

be well fitted either by a one-component non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) model
or by a two-component NEI model. The rim regions can be well fitted by a
one-component model with relatively low \kTe whose metal abundances are
sub-solar (0.1--0.2). The major part of the paths requires a two-component
model. Due to projection effects, we concluded that the low kTe (about 0.2 keV)
component surrounds the high kTe (about 0.6 keV) component, with the latter
having relatively high metal abundances (about 5 times solar). Since the Cygnus
Loop is thought to originate in a cavity explosion, the low-kTe component
originates from the cavity wall while the high-kTe component originates from
the ejecta. The flux of the cavity wall component shows a large variation along
our path. We found it to be very thin in the south-west region, suggesting a
blowout along our line of sight. The metal distribution inside the ejecta shows
non-uniformity, depending on the element. O, Ne and Mg are relatively more
abundant in the outer region while Si, S and Fe are concentrated in the inner
region, with all metals showing strong asymmetry. This observational evidence
implies an asymmetric explosion of the progenitor star. The abundance of the
ejecta also indicates the progenitor star to be about 15 M_sun.

even very important to constraint the physics of circumstellar environment, is
still far to be completely exploited. To estimate the millimetre and
sub-millimetre fluxes, we extrapolated and summed together the ionized gas
(free-free radio emission) and dust (thermal emission) contributions at this

sensitivity we investigate the possible detection of such source for all the

higher frequency channels, where there is a good combination of brighter
intrinsic flux from the sources and reduced extended Galactic foregrounds
contamination despite a worst instrumental sensitivity. From the new 43 GHz,

of the star, as briefly reported in the previous paper, and (2) faint emission
in the southwest counterflow, which has been revealed through careful analysis.
The emission on both sides of the star show an arc 1"".0 away from the star,
exhibiting a bipolar symmetry. Different brightness and morphologies in the
northeast and southwest flows are attributed to absorption and obscuration of
the latter by a flattened envelope and a circumstellar disk. The H2 emission
shows a remarkably different morphology from the collimated jet seen in [Fe II]
emission. The positions of some features coincide with scattering continuum,
indicating that these are associated with cavities in the dusty envelope. Such
properties are similar to millimeter CO outflows, although the spatial scale of
the H2 outflow in our image (~150 AU) is strikingly smaller than the mm
outflows, which often extend over 1000-10000 AU scales. The position-velocity
diagram of the H2 and [Fe II] emission do not show any evidence for kinematic
interaction between these flows. All results described above support the
scenario that the jet is surrounded by an unseen wide-angled wind, which
interacts with the ambient gas and produce the bipolar cavity and shocked H2
emission.

considerable interest. Although much progress has been made in recent years,
some open questions remain. Even at zero density, the order of the transition
for two light flavors of fermions has not yet been conclusively established.
While considerable evidence exists in favor of a second-order transition for
massless quarks and a crossover for massive quarks, some recent results with
two flavors of staggered fermions suggest a transition of first order.
  Since lattice simulations are performed in finite simulation volumes, actual
phase transitions cannot be observed directly. Thus, finite-size scaling is a
very useful tool in the analysis of lattice data. By comparing the scaling
behavior of observables to the expected scaling properties, values of critical
exponents can be confirmed and the order as well as the universality class of a
transition can be established. In the comparison to lattice QCD results, the
critical exponents and the universal scaling functions have been obtained
mainly by means of lattice simulations of O(N) spin models, and results are
usually restricted to the critical temperature or the point at which the
susceptibilities peak.
  We propose to use a non-perturbative Renormalization Group method for this
purpose. We have calculated the critical finite-size scaling behavior and the
universal scaling functions for the three-dimensional O(4)-model for a wide
range of temperatures and values of the symmetry breaking parameter. Our
results are suitable for a comparison to lattice QCD results for the chiral
susceptibility and the order parameter and can be used to check the consistency
of the finite-size scaling behavior with that of the O(N) universality class.

on arbitrary categories thus providing the possibility to transfer the
essentials of the theory of Hopf algebras in vector spaces to more general
settings. There are several extensions of this theory to {\em monoidal}
categories which in a certain sense follow the classical trace. Here we do not
pose any conditions on our base category but we do refer to the monoidal
structure of the category of endofunctors on any category $\A$ and by this we
retain some of the combinatorial complexity which makes the theory so
interesting. As a basic tool we use distributive laws between monads and
comonads (entwinings) on $\A$: we define a {\em bimonad} on $\A$ as an
endofunctor $B$ which is a monad and a comonad with an entwining $\lambda:BB\to
BB$ satisfying certain conditions. This $\lambda$ is also employed to define
the category $\A^B_B$ of (mixed) $B$-bimodules. In the classical situation, an
entwining $\lambda$ is derived from the twist map for vector spaces. Here this
need not be the case but there may exist special distributive laws $\tau:BB\to
BB$ satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation ({\em local prebraidings}) which induce
an entwining $\lambda$ and lead to an extension of the theory of {\em braided
Hopf algebras}. An antipode is defined as a natural transformation $S:B\to B$
with special properties and for categories $\A$ with limits or colimits and
bimonads $B$ preserving them, the existence of an antipode is equivalent to $B$
inducing an equivalence between $\A$ and the category $\A^B_B$ of
$B$-bimodules. This is a general form of the {\em Fundamental Theorem} of Hopf
algebras.

quark masses corresponding to a pion mass in the range of 690-300 MeV on
lattices of size 2.1 fm and 2.7 fm. We check for cutoff effects by evaluating
these baryon masses on lattices of spatial size 2.1 fm with lattice spacings
$a(\beta=3.9)=0.0855(6)$ fm and $a(\beta=4.05)=0.0666(6)$ fm, determined from
the pion sector and find them to be within our statistical errors. Lattice
results are extrapolated to the physical limit using continuum chiral
perturbation theory.
  The nucleon mass at the physical point provides a determination of the
lattice spacing. Using heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory at ${\cal
O}(p^3)$ we find $a(\beta=3.9)=0.0879(12)$ fm, with a systematic error due to
the chiral extrapolation estimated to be about the same as the statistical
error. This value of the lattice spacing is in good agreement with the value
determined from the pion sector. We check for isospin breaking in the
$\Delta$-system. We find that $\Delta^{++,-}$ and $\Delta^{+,0}$ are almost
degenerate pointing to small flavor violating effects.

recently recognized class of High Mass X-ray Binaries, the Supergiant Fast
X-ray Transients (SFXTs), is still unknown. Two main hypotheses have been
proposed to date: the sudden accretion by the compact object of small ejections
originating in a clumpy wind from the supergiant donor, or outbursts produced
at (or near) the periastron passage in wide and eccentric orbits, in order to
explain the low (1E32 erg/s) quiescent emission.Neither proposed mechanisms
seem to explain the whole phenomenology of these sources. Here we propose a new
explanation for the outburst mechanism, based on new X-ray observations of the
unique SFXT known to display periodic outbursts, IGRJ11215-5952. We performed
three Target of Opportunity observations with Swift, XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL at
the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 February 9. Swift observations
of the February 2007 outburst have been reported elsewhere. Another ToO with
Swift was performed in July 2007, in order to monitor the supposed ``apastron''
passage. A second unexpected outburst was discovered on 2007 July 24, after
about 165 days from the February 2007 outburst. The new X-ray observations
allow us to propose an alternative hypothesis for the outburst mechanism in
SFXTs, linked to the possible presence of a second wind component,in the form
of an equatorial disk from the supergiant donor. We discuss the applicability
of the model to the short outburst durations of all other SFXTs, where a clear
periodicity in the outbursts has not been found yet. The new outburst from
IGRJ11215-5952 observed in July suggests that the true orbital period is
~165days, instead of 329days, as previously thought.

For an array of multiple quantum wells, they can create and control an

Q_B/H= 1.25 which factor is nearly independent of the morphological type. We
show that Q_B/H > 1 is mostly due to reduced bulge dilution of radial forces in
the B-band. The bar torque method needs an estimate for the vertical scale
height of the galaxy, based on the radial scale length of the disk and the
galaxy's morphological type. Since these two might not always be possible to
determine at high redshifts in a reliable manner, we also checked that similar
results are obtained with vertical scale heights estimated from the radii
corresponding to the K-band surface brightness of 20 mag/arcsec^2. Also, we
made a simple test of the usability of the bar torque method at high redshifts
by checking the effects of image degradation (nearest neighbour sampling
without any adjustment of noise levels): we found that the estimated bar
strengths varied by +/- 10% at most as long as the total extent of the bar was
at least 10 pixels. Overall, we show that the gravitational bar torque method

are unlikely to be the result of runaway stellar collisions in the cores of
young clusters.

determine the heavy quark mass dependence of heavy-light meson observables in

of the radio-loud Seyfert galaxy IC5063, the first galaxy in which a fast (~
600 km/s) outflow of neutral hydrogen was discovered. The new radio data
confirm the triple radio structure with a central core and two resolved radio
lobes. This implies that the previously detected fast outflow of neutral gas is
occurring off-nucleus, near a radio lobe about 0.5 kpc from the core. The
ionised gas shows complex kinematics in the region co-spatial with the radio
emission. Broad and blueshifted (~ 500 km/s) emission is observed in the region
of the radio lobe, at the same location as the blueshifted HI absorption. The
velocity of the ionised outflow is similar to the one found in HI. The first
order correspondence between the radio and optical properties suggests that the
outflow is driven by the interaction between the radio jet and the ISM. Despite
the high outflow velocities, no evidence is found for the ionisation of the gas
being due to fast shocks in the region of the outflow, indicating that
photoionisation from the AGN is likely to be the dominant ionisation mechanism.
The outflow rate of the warm (ionised) gas is small compared to that of the
cold gas. The mass outflow rate associated with the HI is in the same range as
for ``mild'' starburst-driven superwinds in ULIRGs. However, in IC5063, the
AGN-driven outflow appears to be limited to the inner kpc region of the galaxy.
The kinetic power associated with the HI outflow is a small fraction (a few x
10^-4) of the Eddington luminosity of the galaxy but is a significant fraction
(~ 0.1) of the nuclear bolometric luminosity. In IC5063, the outflows may have
sufficient kinetic power to have a significant impact on the evolution of the
ISM in the host galaxy.

that the system statistics are unknown, i.e., the probability distributions of
the user arrivals and channel states are unknown. The problem has the structure
of a Constrained Markov Decision Problem (CMDP). Determining an optimal policy
under for the CMDP faces the problems of state space explosion and unknown
system statistics. To tackle the problem of state space explosion, we suggest
determining the transmission rate of a particular user in each slot based on
its channel condition and buffer occupancy only. The rate allocation algorithm
for a particular user is a learning algorithm that learns about the buffer
occupancy and channel states of that user during system execution and thus
addresses the issue of unknown system statistics. Once the rate of each user is
determined, the proposed algorithm schedules the user with the best rate. Our
simulations within an IEEE 802.16 system demonstrate that the algorithm is
indeed able to satisfy the user specified delay constraints. We compare the
performance of our algorithm with the well known M-LWDF algorithm. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the power expended by the users under our algorithm is quite

selected by automated algorithms and subsequently individually inspected by
eye. We report the detection of 84 nova candidates. We found 55 nova candidates

plates. An additional 29 known novae could be confirmed by the detailed
investigation of single detections. One of our newly discovered nova candidates
shows a high position coincidence with a nova detected about 30 years earlier.
Therefore, this object is likely to be a recurrent nova. Furthermore, we
re-investigated all 41 nova candidates previously found on Tautenburg plates
and confirm all but two. Positions are given for all nova candidates with a
typical accuracy of ~ 0.4 arcsec. We present light curves and finding charts as

weak trend, from undetectable values inside R = 3.7 kpc and increasing rapidly
to values around 3 x 10^21 cm^-2 near R ~ 7.5 kpc. This trend is similar to
that of the radially-averaged HI distribution in this galaxy, and implies a
constant area covering factor of ~ 0.21 for GMCs throughout M81. The incident
UV fluxes G0 of our sample of candidate PDRs decrease radially.
  A simple equilibrium model of the photodissociation-reformation process
connects the observed values of the incident UV flux, the HI column density,
and the relative dust content, permitting an independent estimate to be made of
the total gas density in the GMC. Within the GMC this gas will be predominantly
molecular hydrogen. Volume densities of 1 < n < 200 cm^-3 are derived, with a
geometric mean of 17 cm^-3. These values are similar to the densities of GMCs
in the Galaxy, but somewhat lower than those found earlier for M101 with
similar methods. Low values of molecular density in the GMCs of M81 will result
in low levels of collisional excitation of the CO(1-0) transition, and are
consistent with the very low surface brightness of CO(1-0) emission observed in
the disk of M81.

theorem, using line-of-sight velocity dispersion measurements and half-light

stars exhibit orbital motion, which increases the measured velocity dispersion,
resulting in a dynamical mass overestimation. In this article we quantify the
effect of neglecting the binary population on the derivation of the dynamical
mass of a star cluster. We find that the presence of binaries plays an
important role for clusters with total mass M < 10^5 Msun; the dynamical mass
can be significantly overestimated (by a factor of two or more). For the more
massive clusters, with Mcl > 10^5 Msun, binaries do not affect the dynamical
mass estimation significantly, provided that the cluster is significantly

pairs of stations, using Wiener filtering. Secondly, the average dispersion
curve was calculated by combining observations from all events in order to
reduce diffraction effects. The inversion of the mean phase velocity yielded a
crustal model for the volcano which is consistent with previous models of the

therefore not different from the surrounding area, and the velocities in the

applying the same procedure to each sub-array. No well-defined anomalies
appeared for the two sub-arrays for which it was possible to measure a

have predicted a (\mu,T)-phase diagram according to general expectations, with
an analytic quark-hadron crossover at \mu=0 turning into a first order
transition at some critical chemical potential \mu_E. By contrast, recent
simulations using imgainary \mu followed by analytic continuation obtained a
critical structure in the {m_{u,d},m_s,T,\mu} parameter space favouring the
absence of a critical point and first order line. I review the evidence for the
latter scenario, arguing that the various raw data are not inconsistent with
each other. Rather, the discrepancy appears when attempting to extract
continuum results from the coarse (N_t=4) lattices simulated so far, and can be
explained by cut-off effects. New (as yet unpublished) data are presented,
which for N_f=3 and on N_t=4 confirm the scenario without a critical point.
Moreover, simulations on finer N_t=6 lattices show that even if there is a
critical point, continuum extrapolation moves it to significantly larger values
of \mu_E than anticipated on coarse lattices.

calculate the dissipated power $Q(B_0,\omega)$, and the transient time scales
of vortex motion for the linear Bardeen-Stephen viscous drag force, which
results in unphysically high vortex velocities during vortex penetration
through the oscillating surface barrier. It is shown that penetration of a
single vortex through the ac surface barrier always involves penetration of an
antivortex and the subsequent annihilation of the vortex antivortex pairs.
Using the nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO) viscous drag force at higher vortex
velocities $v(t)$ results in a jump-wise vortex penetration through the surface
barrier and a significant increase of the dissipated power. We calculate the
effect of dissipation on nonlinear vortex viscosity $\eta(v)$ and the rf vortex
dynamics and show that it can also result in the LO-type behavior,
instabilities, and thermal localization of penetrating vortex channels. We
propose a thermal feedback model of $\eta(v)$, which not only results in the LO
dependence of $\eta(v)$ for a steady-state motion, but also takes into account
retardation of temperature field around rapidly accelerating vortex, and a
long-range interaction with the surface. We also address the effect of pinning
on the nonlinear rf vortex dynamics and the effect of trapped magnetic flux on
the surface resistance $R_s$ calculated as a function or rf frequency and
field. It is shown that trapped flux can result in a temperature-independent
residual resistance $R_i$ at low $T$, and a hysteretic low-field dependence of
$R_i(B_0)$, which can {\it decrease} as $B_0$ is increased, reaching a minimum

0114+650 made with the pointed instruments onboard the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer. The spectral and temporal behaviour of this source was examined over
the pulse, orbital, and super-orbital timescales, covering $\sim$2 cycles of
the 30.7 d super-orbital modulation. Marginal evidence for variability of the
power law photon index over the pulse period was identified, similar to that
observed from other X-ray pulsars. If this variability is real it can be
attributed to a varying viewing geometry of the accretion region with the spin
of the neutron star. Variability of the neutral hydrogen column density over
the orbital period was observed, which we attribute to the line of sight motion
of the neutron star through the dense circumstellar environment. A reduction in
the power law photon index was observed during the orbital maximum, which we
speculate is due to absorption effects as the neutron star passes behind a
heavily absorbing region near the base of the supergiant companion's wind. No
significant variability of the column density was observed over the
super-orbital period, indicating that variable obscuration by a precessing warp
in an accretion disc is not the mechanism behind the super-orbital modulation.
In contrast, a significant increase in the power law photon index was observed
during the super-orbital minimum. We conclude that the observed super-orbital
modulation is tied to variability in the mass accretion rate due to some as yet
unidentified mechanism.

address the three-dimensional behavior of spiral shocks in protoplanetary disks

this work, I discuss characteristics of gravitational instabilities (GIs) in
bursting and asymptotic phase disks; outline a theory for the three-dimensional
structure of spiral shocks, called shock bores, for isothermal and adiabatic
gases; consider convection as a source of cooling for protoplanetary disks;
investigate the effects of opacity on disk cooling; use multiple analyses to
test for disk stability against fragmentation; test the sensitivity of GI
behavior to radiation boundary conditions; measure shock strengths and
frequencies in GI-bursting disks; evaluate temperature fluctuations in unstable
disks; and investigate whether spiral shocks can form chondrules when GIs
activate. The numerical methods developed for these studies are discussed,
including a radiation transport routine that explicitly couples the low and
high optical depth regimes and a routine that models ortho and parahydrogen.
Finally, I explore the hypothesis that chondrule formation and the FU Ori
phenomenon are driven by GI activation in dead zones.

The extension involves projecting the spatial dependence of the perturbations

Galerkin method). To test this algorithm in the homogeneous case, we derive an
analytical expression for the growth rate of the Weibel instability for a
relativistic Maxwellian distribution and compare it with the numerical results.
In the inhomogeneous case, we present solutions of the dispersion relation for
the relativistic tearing mode, making no assumption about the thickness of the

avoided, it forms a glass. This phenomenon, called glass transition, is
characterized by a marked increase of viscosity, about 14 orders of magnitude,
in a narrow temperature interval. The microscopic mechanism behind the glass
transition is still poorly understood. However, recently, great advances have
been made in the identification of cooperative rearranging regions, or
dynamical heterogeneities, i.e. domains of the liquid whose relaxation is
highly correlated. The growth of the size of these domains is now believed to
be the driving mechanism for the increase of the viscosity. Recently a tool to
quantify the size of these domains has been proposed. We apply this tool to a
wide class of materials to investigate the correlation between the size of the
heterogeneities and their configurational entropy, i.e. the number of states
accessible to a correlated domain. We find that the relaxation time of a given
system, apart from a material dependent pre-factor, is a universal function of
the configurational entropy of a correlated domain. As a consequence, we find
that at the glass transition temperature, the size of the domains and the
configurational entropy per unit volume are anti-correlated, as originally
predicted by the Adam-Gibbs theory. Finally, we use our data to extract some
exponents defined in the framework of the Random First Order Theory, a recent
quantitative theory of the glass transition.

particular, adding a single--ion anisotropy to the XXZ antiferromagnet, one
observes, depending on the sign of that anisotropy, either an intervening
biconical phase or a direct transition of first order separating the two
phases. In case of the anisotropic XY model, the degeneracy of the ground
state, at a critical field, in antiferromagnetic, spin--flop, and bidirectional
structures seems to result, as in the case of the XXZ model, in a narrow
disordered phase between the antiferromagnetic and spin--flop phases, dominated

normalised cumulative number of objects counting from the cluster centre to
several power-law, exponential and King radial distributions. The cluster seems
to have two components: a dense core that extends from the centre to r ~ 20
arcmin and a rarified halo at larger separations. The radial distribution in
the core follows a power-law proportional to r^1, which corresponds to a volume
density proportional to r^(-2). This is consistent with the collapse of an
isothermal spherical molecular cloud. The stars more massive than 3.7 Msol
concentrate, however, towards the cluster centre, where there is also an
apparent deficit of very low-mass objects (M < 0.16 Msol). Last, I demonstrated
through Monte Carlo simulations that the cluster is azimuthally asymmetric,

solution of a set of functional differential equations arising from the
Schwinger action principle. In fact these equations have a multitude of

We discuss properties of the additional solutions which, although generally
disregarded, may be physical with known examples including spontaneous symmetry
breaking and theta vacua. We show that a consideration of the full set of
solutions yields a description of phase transitions in quantum field theories
which complements the usual description in terms of the accumulation of
Lee-Yang zeroes. In particular we argue that non-analyticity due to the
accumulation of Lee-Yang zeros is related to Stokes phenomena and the collapse
of the solution set in various limits including but not restricted to, the
thermodynamic limit. A precise demonstration of this relation is given in terms
of a zero dimensional model. Finally, for zero dimensional polynomial actions,
we prove that Borel resummation of perturbative expansions, with several
choices of singularity avoiding contours in the complex Borel plane, yield
inequivalent solutions of the action principle equations.
