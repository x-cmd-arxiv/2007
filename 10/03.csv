the usual field theory global vortices when the kinetic term is DBI. Such
vortices can result from the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the potential
felt by a D3-brane. In a previous paper (0706.0485), the DBI instanton solution
was constructed which develops a ""wrinkle"" for stringy heights of the
potential. A similar effect is also seen for the DBI vortex solution. The
wrinkle develops for stringy heights of the potential. One recovers the usual
field theory global string for substringy potentials. As an example of the
symmetry breaking, we consider a mobile D3-brane on the warped deformed
conifold. Symmetry breaking can occur if the structure of the vacuum manifold
of the potential for the D3-brane changes as it moves through the throat
region.

Yangs-Mills vacuum has been recently advocated by Gonzalez-Arroyo and Kirchner.
The construction relies on the use of the super-symmetric zero mode which, for
classical configurations, provides a direct estimate of the gauge action
density. In the lattice implementation of this idea, we show how the results
improve considerably if the overlap operator is used instead of the
Wilson-Dirac one. Before proceeding to the detailed study of Monte Carlo
ensembles, we studied here a series of potentially complicated situations which
can be encountered. In particular, we study the case of instanton
anti-instanton pairs and analyse how the results depend upon separation. The
effect of lattice artifacts is also of concern. Indeed, a statistical analysis
of zero modes of thermalised SU(2) configurations at beta=2.57 shows a
significant fraction having 4N+2 adjoint zero modes, in contradiction with the
index theorem. This violation must be associated to the roughness of the
lattice configurations. Indeed, we show that this situation occurs for
instantons of size of the order of the lattice spacing.

mixing matrix. Under this assumption it turns out that the situation is very
constrained when a hierarchical heavy right-handed (RH) neutrino spectrum is
considered: the allowed regions are small and the final asymmetry depends on
the initial conditions. On the other hand, for a quasi-degenerate spectrum of
RH neutrinos, the {\em CP} asymmetry can be enhanced and the situation becomes
much more favorable, with no dependence on the initial conditions.
Interestingly, in the extreme case of resonant leptogenesis, in order to match
the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe, we obtain a lower bound on \sin

the top of the valence band, located at the $\Gamma$ point, has p character in
these materials. As a result, an effective model in which the holes hop between

  Methods. We have obtained high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra
of eight previously-classified Am stars, two normal A-type stars and one Blue
Straggler, considered to be members of the Praesepe cluster. For all of these
stars we have determined fundamental parameters and photospheric abundances for
a large number of chemical elements, with a higher precision than was ever
obtained before for this cluster. For seven of these stars we also obtained
spectra in circular polarization and applied the LSD technique to constrain the
longitudinal magnetic field.
  Results. No magnetic field was detected in any of the analysed stars. HD
73666, a Blue Straggler previously considered as an Ap (Si) star, turns out to
have the abundances of a normal A-type star. Am classification is not confirmed
for HD 72942. For HD 73709 we have also calculated synthetic Delta-a photometry
that is in good agreement with the observations. There is a generally good
agreement between abundance predictions of diffusion models and values that we
have obtained for the remaining Am stars. However, the observed Na and S
abundances deviate from the predictions by 0.6 dex and >0.25 dex respectively.

by direct supersymmetric flavor-changing neutral-current (FCNC) processes at
the LHC. The total cross section for pp(gg)->t\bar{c}+\bar{t}c is computed at
the 1-loop order within the unconstrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(MSSM). The present study extends the results of the supersymmetric strong
effects (SUSY-QCD), which were advanced by some of us in a previous work, and
includes the computation of the full supersymmetric electroweak corrections
(SUSY-EW). Our analysis of pp(gg)->t\bar{c}+\bar{t}c in the MSSM has been
performed in correspondence with the stringent low-energy constraints from b->s
gamma. In the most favorable scenarios, the SUSY-QCD contribution can give rise
to production rates of around 10^5 events per 100 fb^{-1} of integrated
luminosity. Furthermore, we show that there exist regions of the MSSM parameter
space where the SUSY-EW correction becomes sizeable. In the SUSY-EW favored
regions, one obtains lower, but still appreciable, event production rates that
can reach the 10^3 level for the same range of integrated luminosity. We study
also the possible reduction in the maximum event rate obtained from the full
MSSM contribution if we additionally include the constraints from
B^0_s-\bar{B}^0_s. In view of the fact that the FCNC production of heavy quark
pairs of different flavors is extremely suppressed in the SM, the detection of
a significant number of these events could lead to evidence of new physics --
of likely supersymmetric origin.

to be important from a variety of perspectives: as an agent of chemical
enhancement of the interstellar and intergalactic media, as an agent of angular
momentum removal from the accreting central engine, and as an agent limiting
star formation in starbursting systems by blowing out gas and dust from the
host galaxy. To understand these processes, we must determine what fraction of
AGNs feature outflows and understand what forms they take. We examine recent
surveys of quasar absorption lines, reviewing the best means to determine if
systems are intrinsic and result from outflowing material, and the limitations
of approaches taken to date. The surveys reveal that, while the fraction of
specific forms of outflows depends on AGN properties, the overall fraction
displaying outflows is fairly constant, approximately 60%, over many orders of
magnitude in luminosity. We emphasize some issues concerning classification of
outflows driven by data type rather than necessarily the physical nature of
outflows, and illustrate how understanding outflows probably requires more a
comprehensive approach than has usually been taken in the past.

believed to trace non-equilibrium situations in the luminous and/or dark matter
component. These may arise in the aftermath of events like mergers, accretion,
and tidal interactions. These events are key in the evolution of galaxies. In
this paper we quantify the large-scale lopsidedness of light distributions in
25155 galaxies at z < 0.06 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4
using the m = 1 azimuthal Fourier mode. We show that the lopsided distribution
of light is primarily due to a corresponding lopsidedness in the stellar mass
distribution. Observational effects, such as seeing, Poisson noise, and
inclination, introduce only small errors in lopsidedness for the majority of
this sample. We find that lopsidedness correlates strongly with other basic
galaxy structural parameters: galaxies with low concentration, stellar mass,
and stellar surface mass density tend to be lopsided, while galaxies with high
concentration, mass, and density are not. We find that the strongest and most
fundamental relationship between lopsidedness and the other structural
parameters is with the surface mass density. We also find, in agreement with
previous studies, that lopsidedness tends to increase with radius. Both these
results may be understood as a consequence of several factors. The outer
regions of galaxies and low-density galaxies are more susceptible to tidal
perturbations, and they also have longer dynamical times (so lopsidedness will
last longer). They are also more likely to be affected by any underlying
asymmetries in the dark matter halo.

the time-distance helioseismology measurements of the mean speed of the
meridional flows at the depth of 3.5--12 Mm shows a generally good agreement,
but the speeds of the flux transport and the meridional flow are significantly
different in areas occupied by the magnetic field. The local circulation flows
around active regions, especially the strong equatorward flows on the
equatorial side of active regions affect the mean velocity profile derived by
helioseismology, but do not influence the magnetic flux transport. The results
show that the mean longitudinally averaged meridional flow measurements by

the magnetic flux transport, and that it is necessary to take into account the
longitudinal structure of these flows.

distributions for these solid state features all peak at, and are distributed
around, the location of HW2, the protostar believed to power one of the
outflows observed in this star-forming region. A correlation between the column
density distributions of CO2 and water ice with that of total hydrogen
indicates that the solid state features we mapped mostly arise from the same
molecular clumps along the probed sight lines. We therefore derive average CO2
ice and water ice abundances with respect to the total hydrogen column density
of X(CO2)_ice~1.9x10^-5 and X(H2O)_ice~7.5x10^-5. Within errors, the abundances
for both ices are relatively constant over the mapped region exhibiting both
ice absorptions. The fraction of CO2 ice with respect to H2O ice is also
relatively constant at a value of 22% over that mapped region. A clear
triple-peaked structure is seen in the CO2 ice profiles. Fits to those profiles
using current laboratory ice analogs suggest the presence of both a
low-temperature polar ice mixture and a high-temperature methanol-rich ice
mixture along the probed sightlines. Our results further indicate that thermal

two-level open quantum systems, whose evolution is described by general
completely positive trace preserving maps (i.e., Kraus maps), are investigated
in details. The objective function, which is the expectation value of a target
system operator, is defined on the Stiefel manifold representing the space of
Kraus maps. Three practically important properties of the objective function
are found: (a) the absence of local maxima or minima (i.e., false traps); (b)
the existence of multi-dimensional sub-manifolds of optimal solutions
corresponding to the global maximum and minimum; and (c) the connectivity of
each level set. All of the critical values and their associated critical
sub-manifolds are explicitly found for any initial system state. Away from the
absolute extrema there are no local maxima or minima, and only saddles may
exist, whose number and the explicit structure of the corresponding critical
sub-manifolds are determined by the initial system state. There are no saddles
for pure initial states, one saddle for a completely mixed initial state, and
two saddles for other initial states. In general, the landscape analysis of
critical points and optimal manifolds is relevant to the problem of explaining
the relative ease of obtaining good optimal control outcomes in the laboratory,

continua are formulated phenomenologically, the convective derivatives of the
first, second, etc. orders being taken into account. The master equations for
the gravity field contain a modified effective (symmetric) stress-energy tensor
of the electromagnetic field in a material medium, the use of this tensor being
motivated both by historical analogies and direct variational procedure. By way
of example we consider the exact solution of the extended Einstein-Maxwell
model, describing the isotropic cosmological model with hidden non-vanishing
electromagnetic field, electric polarization and magnetization.

in high magnetic fields and low temperatures have ushered in a new era. These
experiments explore the normal state from which superconductivity arises and
provide evidence of a reconstructed Fermi surface consisting of electron and
hole pockets in a regime in which such a possibility was previously considered
to be remote. More specifically, the Hall coefficient has been found to
oscillate according to the Onsager quantization condition, involving only
fundamental constants and the areas of the pockets, but with a sign that is
negative. Here we explain the observations with the theory that the alleged
normal state exhibits a hidden order, the $d$-density wave, which breaks
symmetries signifying time reversal, translation by a lattice spacing, and a
rotation by an angle $\pi/2$, while the product of any two symmetry operations
is preserved. The success of our analysis underscores the importance of
spontaneous breaking of symmetries, Fermi surface reconstruction, and
conventional quasiparticles. We primarily focus on the version of the order
that is commensurate with the underlying crystalline lattice, but also touch
upon the consequences if the order were to incommensurate. It is shown that
while commensurate order results in two independent oscillation frequencies as
a function of the inverse of the applied magnetic field, incommensurate order
leads to three independent frequencies. The oscillation amplitudes, however,
are determined by the mobilities of the charge carriers comprising the Fermi
pockets.

constant cancellation in the post-inflationary vacuum strongly affects
supersymmetric inflation. It is important to note the crucial difference
between freezing of the modulus and actually stabilising it - the first
approach misses parts of the scalar potential which turn out to be relevant for
inflation. We argue, that it is more likely that the low scale supersymmetric

photosphere through scattering and photoionization events. While reprocessed
X-ray spectra reaching a distant observer are at a flux level of only a few
percent of that of the corona itself, characteristic lines formed by inner
shell photoionization of some abundant elements can be significantly stronger.
The emergent photospheric spectra are sensitive to the distance and location of
the fluorescing radiation and can provide diagnostics of coronal geometry and
abundance. Here we present Monte Carlo simulations of the photospheric Kalpha
doublet arising from quasi-neutral Fe irradiated by a coronal X-ray source.
Fluorescent line strengths have been computed as a function of the height of
the radiation source, the temperature of the ionising X-ray spectrum, and the
viewing angle. We also illustrate how the fluorescence efficiencies scale with
the photospheric metallicity and the Fe abundance. Based on the results we make
three comments: (1) fluorescent Fe lines seen from pre-main sequence stars
mostly suggest flared disk geometries and/or super-solar disk Fe abundances;
(2) the extreme ~1400 mA line observed from a flare on V1486 Ori can be
explained entirely by X-ray fluorescence if the flare itself were partially
eclipsed by the limb of the star; and (3) the fluorescent Fe line detected by
Swift during a large flare on II Peg is consistent with X-ray excitation and
does not require a collisional ionisation contribution. There is no convincing
evidence supporting the energetically challenging explanation of electron
impact excitation for observed stellar Fe Kalpha lines.

accreting material, and that the fluid is in stable, nearly circular motion
near this maximum rather than moving rapidly towards the star or out of the
disk plane into funnel flows. It is presently not known if these conditions
occur, but we are exploring this with 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations and
will report the results elsewhere. The first mode is a corotation mode which is
radially trapped in the vicinity of the maximum of the disk rotation rate and
is unstable. The second mode, relevant to relatively slowly rotating stars, is
a magnetically driven eccentric ($m=1$) oscillation of the disk excited at a
Lindblad radius in the vicinity of the maximum of the disk rotation. The third
mode, relevant to rapidly rotating stars, is a magnetically coupled eccentric
($m=1$) and an axisymmetric ($m=0$) radial disk perturbation which has an inner
Lindblad radius also in the vicinity of the maximum of the disk rotation. We
suggest that the first mode is associated with the upper QPO frequency,
$\nu_u$, the second with the lower QPO frequency, $\nu_\ell =\nu_u-\nu_*$, and
the third with the lower QPO frequency, $\nu_\ell=\nu_u-\nu_*/2$, where $\nu_*$
is the star's rotation rate.

galaxies exhibit a tight CMR in clusters up to at least z ~ 1. The faint end of
the relation, however, has been much less explored especially at high redshifts
primarily due to limited depths of the data. Some recent papers have reported a
deficit of the faint red galaxies on the CMR at 0.8 < z < 1, but this has not
been well confirmed yet and is still controversial. Using a deep, multi-colour,
panoramic imaging data set of the distant cluster RXJ1716.4+6708 at z=0.81,
newly taken with the Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam) on the Subaru Telescope,
we carry out an analysis of faint red galaxies with a care for incompleteness.
We find that there is a sharp decline in the number of red galaxies toward the
faint end of the CMR below M*+2. We compare our result with those for other
clusters at z ~ 0.8 taken from the literature, which show or do not show the
deficit. We suggest that the ""deficit"" of faint red galaxies is dependent on
the richness or mass of the clusters, in the sense that poorer systems show
stronger deficits. This indicates that the evolutionary stage of less massive
galaxies depends critically on environment.

of the ECDL is lowest at the optimum laser diode temperature or injection
current. Thus, keeping the diode current at the level where the noise is lowest
ensures mode-hop free operation within one of the stable regions of the mode
chart, even if these should drift due to external influences. This method can
be applied directly to existing laser systems without modifying the optical
setup. We demonstrate the method in two ECDLs stabilized to vapor cells at 852

conserved scalar density field $\phi$ driven by diffusive dynamics. The
interesting feature of the dynamics is that the {\it bare} diffusion
coefficient $D$ is density dependent. In the simplest case
$D=\bar{D}+D_{1}\delta \phi $ where $\bar{D}$ is the constant average diffusion
constant. In the case where the driving effective Hamiltonian is quadratic the
model can be treated using perturbation theory in terms of the single nonlinear
coupling $D_{1}$. We develop perturbation theory to fourth order in $D_{1}$.
The are two ways of analyzing this perturbation theory. In one approach,
developed by Kawasaki, at one-loop order one finds mode coupling theory with an
ergodic-nonergodic transition. An alternative more direct interpretation at
one-loop order leads to a slowing down as the nonlinear coupling increases.
Eventually one hits a critical coupling where the time decay becomes algebraic.
Near this critical coupling a weak peak develops at a wavenumber well above the
peak at $q=0$ associated with the conservation law. The width of this peak in
Fourier space decreases with time and can be identified with a characteristic
kinetic length which grows with a power law in time. For stronger coupling the
system becomes metastable and then unstable. At two-loop order it is shown that
the ergodic-nonergodic transition is not supported. It is demonstrated that the
{\it critical} properties of the direct approach survive going to higher order
in perturbation theory.

direction and the initial nanowire size. The proportion of monomers, dimers and
more complex structures at the latest stages of the breaking process are
calculated, finding important differences among results obtained for different

stretching direction and large nanowire sizes: the wire evolves from more
complex structures to monomers and dimers prior its rupture; well ordered
structures is presented during the breaking process. (B) Large nanowires
stretched along the [100] and [110] directions: the system mainly breaks from
complex structures (low probability of finding monomers and dimers), having
disordered regions during their breakage; at room temperature, a huge histogram
peak around Sm=5 appears, showing the presence of long staggered pentagonal Ni
wires with ...-5-1-5-... structure. (C) Initial wire size is small: strong size
effects independently on the temperature and stretching direction. Finally, the
local structure around monomers and dimmers do not depend on the stretching
direction. These configurations differ from those usually chosen in static

representation in terms of three parameters: the amount of spare capacity and
the coefficients of variation of interarrival and service times. Interestingly,
it matches an analogous exponent corresponding to a single-server queue in the

investigate the efficient and accurate representation of structures in

image from the background variation, as in the classical signal-plus-noise
model, we present a model for individual vortices using the non-decimated
discrete wavelet transform. A template image, supplied by the user, provides
the features to be extracted from the vorticity field. By transforming the
vortex template into the wavelet domain, specific characteristics present in
the template, such as size and symmetry, are broken down into components
associated with spatial frequencies. Multivariate multiple linear regression is
used to fit the vortex template to the vorticity field in the wavelet domain.
Since all levels of the template decomposition may be used to model each level
in the field decomposition, the resulting model need not be identical to the
template. Application to a vortex census algorithm that records quantities of
interest (such as size, peak amplitude, circulation, etc.) as the vorticity
field evolves is given. The multiresolution census algorithm extracts coherent
structures of all shapes and sizes in simulated vorticity fields and is able to
reproduce known physical scaling laws when processing a set of voriticity
fields that evolve over time.

it requires that many counters be updated at a very high speed; however, the

that is, to detect large elephant flows and then measure their sizes.
  Recently the authors and their collaborators have developed [1] a novel
method for per-flow traffic measurement that is fast, highly memory efficient
and accurate. At the core of this method is a novel counter architecture called
""counter braids.'' In this paper, we analyze the performance of the counter
braid architecture under a Maximum Likelihood (ML) flow size estimation
algorithm and show that it is optimal; that is, the number of bits needed to
store the size of a flow matches the entropy lower bound. While the ML
algorithm is optimal, it is too complex to implement. In [1] we have developed
an easy-to-implement and efficient message passing algorithm for estimating

of the SAURON relationship for flattened ellipticals with epsilon >= 0.25 is

feedback does not strongly affect this result. Subsequent dry merging of merger

are characterized by low ellipticities epsilon < 0.25 and low anisotropies.

stellar spheroids resulting from multiple, hierarchical mergers of

turns out to not depend on the choice of the map under rather mild smoothness
conditions. The existence of a unique renormalization fixed point which is also
hyperbolic among generic smooth enough maps plays a crucial role in the
corresponding renormalization theory. The uniqueness and hyperbolicity of the
renormalization fixed point were first shown in the holomorphic context, by
means that generalize to other renormalization operators. It was then proved
that in the space of $C^{2+\alpha}$ unimodal maps, for $\alpha$ close to one,
the period doubling renormalization fixed point is hyperbolic as well. In this
paper we study what happens when one approaches from below the minimal
smoothness thresholds for the uniqueness and for the hyperbolicity of the
period doubling renormalization generic fixed point. Indeed, our main results
states that in the space of $C^2$ unimodal maps the analytic fixed point is not
hyperbolic and that the same remains true when adding enough smoothness to get
a priori bounds. In this smoother class, called $C^{2+|\cdot|}$ the failure of
hyperbolicity is tamer than in $C^2$. Things get much worse with just a bit
less of smoothness than $C^2$ as then even the uniqueness is lost and other
asymptotic behavior become possible. We show that the period doubling
renormalization operator acting on the space of $C^{1+Lip}$ unimodal maps has
infinite topological entropy.

for the purely translational case is to apply the Fourier transform and use the
classical convolution theorem together with a Weiner filter to invert. In the
case of purely rotational deblurring, the similar Fourier analysis is applied.

Fourier series and the convolution theorem for the series can be applied. In
the case of combinations of translational and rotational errors, the
motion-group Fourier transform is used. In addition, for the three cases we
present the alternative method using Hermite and Laguerre-Fourier expansion,

conversion gain fluctuations by monitoring the physical temperature of the

for use at the Submillimeter Array (SMA), a submillimeter interferometer

of 1 part in 6,000 (rms to mean). This is an order of magnitude improvement
over the typical uncorrected stability of 1 part in a few hundred. Our gain

hydrostatic starless core and collapses to form a low-mass protostar. The
results of a one-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics calculation are adopted as
a physical model of the core. We first derive radii at which CO and large
organic species sublimate. CO sublimation in the central region starts shortly
before the formation of the first hydrostatic core. When the protostar is born,
the CO sublimation radius extends to 100 AU, and the region inside $\lesssim
10$ AU is hotter than 100 K, at which some large organic species evaporate. We
calculate the temporal variation of physical parameters in infalling shells, in
which the molecular evolution is solved using an updated gas-grain chemical
model to derive the spatial distribution of molecules in a protostellar core.
The shells pass through the warm region of $10 -100$ K in several $\times$
$10^4$ yr, and fall into the central star $\sim 100$ yr after they enter the
region where $T \gtrsim 100$ K. We find that large organic species are formed
mainly via grain-surface reactions at temperatures of $20 -40$ K and then
desorbed into the gas-phase at their sublimation temperatures. Carbon-chain
species can be formed by a combination of gas-phase reactions and grain-surface
reactions following the sublimation of CH$_4$. Our model also predicts that
CO$_2$ is more abundant in isolated cores, while gas-phase large organic
species are more abundant in cores embedded in ambient clouds.

two different results were reported. Some authors claim that gravitational

works universally in the direction of asymptotic freedom no matter how the
gauge coupling behaves without gravity, while others reject the presence of
gravitational correction at the one-loop level at all. Being these calculations
done in the framework of an effective field theory approach to general
relativity, we wanted to draw attention to a recently discovered profound
quantum-gravitational effect of space-time dimension running that inevitably
affects the running of gauge couplings. The running of space-time dimension
indicating gradual reduction of dimension as one gets into smaller scales acts
on the coupling constants in the direction of asymptotic freedom and therefore
in any case manifests the plausibility of this quantum-gravitational effect.

$\delta$, which, in general, has the expression $\delta=2[\gamma]:[S]$, with
the tensor $[\gamma]$ describing the TLS ``deformability'' and $[S]$ being the
symmetric strain tensor. We construct $[\gamma]$ on very general grounds, by
associating to the TLS two objects: a direction, $\hat\bt$, and a forth rank
tensor of coupling constants, $[[R]]$. Based on the method of construction and
on the invariance of the expression of $\delta$ with respect to the symmetry
transformation of the solid, we conclude that $[[R]]$ has the same structure as
the tensor of stiffness constants, $[[c]]$, from elasticity theory. In
particular, if the solid is isotropic, $[[R]]$ has only two independent
parameters, which are the equivalent of the Lam\'e constants. Employing this
model we calculate the absorption and emission rates of phonons on TLSs and
show that in isotropic solids, on average, the longitudinal phonons interact
stronger with the TLSs than the transversal ones, as it is observed in
experiments. We also show that in isotropic solids, a transversal wave leaves
unperturbed all the TLSs with the direction contained in one of the two planes
that are perpendicular either to the wave propagation direction or to the
polarization direction and that a longitudinal strain applied to the solid
polarises the TLS ensemble.

determination of $\Gamma_0$ have so far failed or provided ambiguous results.
As a matter of fact, the shape of the early-time afterglow light curve is
strongly sensitive on $\Gamma_0$ which determines the time of the afterglow
peak, i.e. when the outflow and the shocked circumburst material share a
comparable amount of energy. We now comment early-time observations of the
near-infrared afterglows of GRB 060418 and GRB 060607A performed by the REM
robotic telescope. For both events, the afterglow peak was singled out and
allowed us to determine the initial fireball Lorentz, $\Gamma_0\sim 400$.

that all moments $z^{n}$ with $n>\mu$ diverge. For the wetting transition, the
first moment diverges $\bar{z}=+\infty$ (case $0<\mu<1$), and the critical

philosophical optimist having written: ""Since the fabric of universe is the
most perfect and is the work of the most wise Creator, nothing whatsoever take
place in this universe in which some relation of maximum or minimum does not
appear. Wherefore, there is absolutely no doubt that every effect in universe
can be explained as satisfactory from final causes themselves the aid of the
method of Maxima and Minima, as can from the effective causes"". Having in mind
this kind of optimism, in the papers [1-16] we introduced and investigated the
possibility to construct a predictive analytic theory of the elementary
particle interaction based on the principle of minimum distance in the space of
quantum states (PMD-SQS). So, choosing the partial transition amplitudes as the
system variational variables and the distance in the space of the quantum
states as a measure of the system effectiveness, we obtained the results
[1-16]. These results proved that the principle of minimum distance in space of
quantum states (PMD-SQS) can be chosen as variational principle by which we can
find the analytic expressions of the partial transition amplitudes. In this
paper we present a description of hadron-hadron scattering via principle of
minimum distance PMD-SQS when the distance in space of states is minimized with
two directional constraints. Then by using the available experimental
(pion-nucleon and kaon-nucleon) phase shifts we obtained not only consistent
experimental tests of the PMD-SQS optimality, but also strong experimental
evidences for new principles in hadronic physics such as: Principle of
nonextensivity conjugation via the Riesz-Thorin relation (1/2p+1/2q=1) and a

effects of pairs from charged pion decays inside the jets and the emission from

We aim at predicting the broadband spectrum from a general hadronic microquasar
model, taking into account the emission from secondaries created by charged
pion decay inside the jet. Methods: The particle energy distribution for
secondary leptons injected along the jets is consistently derived taking the
energy losses into account. We also compute the spectral energy distribution
resulting from these leptons is calculated after assuming different values of
the magnetic field inside the jets. The spectrum of the gamma-rays produced by
neutral pion-decay and processed by electromagnetic cascades under the stellar

electromagnetic cascades. These effects are phase-dependent, and some

rods (candles) and probe world models and galaxy evolution via the classical

testing strategy using a sample of 30 rotators spanning the redshift range
0.2<z<1 with high resolution spectra and images obtained by the VIMOS/VLT Deep
Redshift Survey (VVDS) and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODs).
We show that by applying at the same time the angular diameter-redshift and
Hubble diagrams to the same sample of objects (i.e. velocity selected galactic
discs) one can derive a characteristic chart, the cosmology-evolution diagram,
mapping the relation between global cosmological parameters and local
structural parameters of discs such as size and luminosity. This chart allows
to put constraints on cosmological parameters when general prior information
about discs evolution is available. In particular, by assuming that equally
rotating large discs cannot be less luminous at z=1 than at present (M(z=1) <
M(0)), we find that a flat matter dominated cosmology (Omega_m=1) is excluded
at a confidence level of 2sigma and an open cosmology with low mass density
(Omega_m = 0.3) and no dark energy contribution is excluded at a confidence
level greater than 1 sigma. Inversely, by assuming prior knowledge about the
cosmological model, the cosmology-evolution diagram can be used to gain useful
insights about the redshift evolution of the structural parameters of baryonic
discs hosted in dark matter halos of nearly equal masses.

Kolmogorov's power law $f^{-5/3}$ below the ion cyclotron frequency $f_{ci}$.
Above this frequency, the observed steeper power law is usually interpreted in
two different ways: a dissipative range of the solar wind turbulence or another
turbulent cascade, the nature of which is still an open question. Using the
Cluster magnetic data we show that after the spectral break the intermittency
increases toward higher frequencies, indicating the presence of non-linear
interactions inherent to a new inertial range and not to the dissipative range.
At the same time the level of compressible fluctuations raises. We show that
the energy transfer rate and intermittency are sensitive to the level of
compressibility of the magnetic fluctuations within the small scale inertial
range. We conjecture that the time needed to establish this inertial range is
shorter than the eddy-turnover time, and is related to dispersive effects. A
simple phenomenological model, based on the compressible Hall MHD, predicts the

the spectrum of the monodromy operator U(T,0) is pure point then there exists a
dense subspace of initial conditions for which the mean value of energy is
uniformly bounded in the course of time. Further we show that if the propagator
admits a differentiable Floquet decomposition then || H(t) psi(t) || is bounded
in time for any initial condition psi(0), and one employs the quantum KAM
algorithm to prove the existence of this type of decomposition for a fairly
large class of H(t). In addition, we derive bounds uniform in time on
transition probabilities between different energy levels, and we also propose
an extension of this approach to the case of a higher order of
differentiability of the Floquet decomposition. The procedure is demonstrated

We investigate the origin of the observed broadening of the pre-main sequence

presence of differential reddening or an age spread among the young stars.
Assuming the latter, simulations indicate that we cannot exclude the
possibility that stars in NGC 346 might have formed in two distinct events
occurring about 10 and 5 Myr ago, respectively. We find that the PMS stars are
not homogeneously distributed across NGC 346, but instead are grouped in at
least five different clusters. On spatial scales from 0.8$''$ to 8$''$ (0.24 to
2.4 pc at the distance of the SMC) the clustering of the PMS stars as computed
by a two-point angular correlation function is self-similar with a power law
slope $\gamma \approx -0.3$. The clustering properties are quite similar to
Milky Way star forming regions like Orion OB or $\rho$ Oph. Thus molecular
cloud fragmentation in the SMC seems to proceed on the same spatial scales as
in the Milky Way. This is remarkable given the differences in metallicity and
hence dust content between SMC and Milky Way star forming regions.

from a stellar companion. To this purpose, we run N-body/SPH simulations of the
galaxy interaction which might have led to the formation of Cartwheel, tracking
the dynamical evolution of two different IMBH populations: halo and disc IMBHs.
Halo IMBHs cannot account for the observed X-ray sources, as only a few of them
cross the outer ring. Instead, more than half of the disc IMBHs are pulled in
the outer ring as a consequence of the galaxy collision. However, also in the
case of disc IMBHs, accretion from surrounding gas clouds cannot account for
the high luminosities of the observed sources. Finally, more than 500 disc
IMBHs are required to produce <~15 X-ray sources via mass transfer from very
young stellar companions. Such number of IMBHs is very large and implies
extreme assumptions. Thus, the hypothesis that all the observed X-ray sources
in Cartwheel are associated with IMBHs is hardly consistent with our
simulations, even if it is still possible that IMBHs account for the few
(<~1-5) brightest ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs).

properties and the spectroscopic signatures obtained from time-dependent
simulations, investigating different ejecta configurations, and covering their
evolution from one day to six weeks after shock breakout. Compared to
equivalent steady-state models, our time-dependent models produce SN ejecta
that are systematically over-ionized, affecting helium at one week after
explosion, but ultimately affecting all ions after a few weeks. While the
continuum remains essentially unchanged, time-dependence effects on observed
spectral lines are large. At the recombination epoch, HI lines and NaID are
considerably stronger and broader than in equivalent steady-state models, while
CaII8500A is weakened. If time dependence is allowed for, the HeI lines at
5875A and 10830A appear about 3 times stronger at one week, and HeI10830A
persists as a blue-shifted absorption feature even at 6 weeks after explosion.
Time dependence operates through the energy gain from changes in ionization and
excitation, and, perhaps more universally across SN types, from the competition
between recombination and expansion, which in-turn, can be affected by
optical-depth effects. Our time-dependent models compare well with observations
of the low-luminosity low-velocity SN 1999br and the more standard SN 1999em,
reproducing the Halpha line strength at the recombination epoch, and without

mission after the Suzaku satellite. NeXT aims to perform wide band imaging
spectroscopy. Due to the successful development of a multilayer coated mirror,
called a supermirror, NeXT can focus X-rays in the energy range from 0.1 keV up
to 80 keV. To cover this wide energy range, we are in the process of developing
a hybrid X-ray camera, Wideband X-ray Imager (WXI) as a focal plane detector of
the supermirror. The WXI consists of X-ray CCDs (SXI) and CdTe pixelized
detectors (HXI), which cover the lower and higher X-ray energy bands of 0.1-80
keV, respectively. The X-ray CCDs of the SXI are stacked above the CdTe
pixelized detectors of the HXI. The X-ray CCDs of the SXI detect soft X-rays
below $\sim$ 10 keV and allow hard X-rays pass into the CdTe detectors of the
HXI without loss. Thus, we have been developing a ""back-supportless CCD"" with a
thick depletion layer, a thinned silicon wafer, and a back-supportless
structure. In this paper, we report the development and performances of an
evaluation model of CCD for the SXI, ""CCD-NeXT1"". We successfully fabricated
two types of CCD-NeXT1, unthinned CCDs with 625-um thick wafer and 150-um thick
thinned CCDs. By omitting the polishing process when making the thinned CCDs,
we confirmed that the polishing process does not impact the X-ray performance.
In addition, we did not find significant differences in the X-ray performance
between the two types of CCDs. The energy resolution and readout noise are
$\sim$ 140 eV (FWHM) at 5.9 keV and $\sim$5 electrons (RMS), respectively. The
estimated thickness of the depletion layer is $\sim$80 um. The performances
almost satisfy the requirements of the baseline plan of the SXI.

(WLAN) enjoys unique advantages in providing high-speed and low-cost wireless
services in hot spots and indoor environments. Traditional WLAN
medium-access-control (MAC) protocols assume that only one station can transmit
at a time: simultaneous transmissions of more than one station causes the
destruction of all packets involved. By exploiting recent advances in PHY-layer
multiuser detection (MUD) techniques, it is possible for a receiver to receive
multiple packets simultaneously. This paper argues that such multipacket
reception (MPR) capability can greatly enhance the capacity of future WLANs. In
addition, it provides the MAC-layer and PHY-layer designs needed to achieve the
improved capacity. First, to demonstrate MUD/MPR as a powerful
capacity-enhancement technique, we prove a ""super-linearity"" result, which
states that the system throughput per unit cost increases as the MPR capability
increases. Second, we show that the commonly deployed binary exponential
backoff (BEB) algorithm in today's WLAN MAC may not be optimal in an MPR
system, and that the optimal backoff factor increases with the MPR capability:
the number of packets that can be received simultaneously. Third, based on the
above insights, we design a joint MAC-PHY layer protocol for an IEEE

theory methods. It is found that two order parameters with the symmetries $X_3$
and $\Delta_5$ induce the structural transformation from the high-temperature
cubic to the low-temperature monoclinic phase. The coupling between the order
parameters is described by the Landau free energy functional. The electronic
and crystal structure for the cubic and monoclinic phases were optimized using
the {\it ab initio} density functional method. The electronic structure
calculations were performed within the generalized gradient approximation
including the on-site interactions between 3d electrons at iron ions -- the
Coulomb element $U$ and Hund's exchange $J$. Only when these local interactions
are taken into account, the phonon dispersion curves, obtained by the direct
method for the cubic phase, reproduce the experimental data. It is shown that
the interplay of local electron interations and the coupling to the lattice
drives the phonon order parameters and is responsible for the opening of the
gap at the Fermi energy. Thus, it is found that the metal-insulator transition
in magnetite is promoted by local electron interactions, which significantly
amplify the electron-phonon interaction and stabilize weak charge order
coexisting with orbital order of the occupied $t_{2g}$ states at Fe ions. This
provides a scenario to understand the fundamental problem of the origin of the

dwarf galaxies in the core of the Perseus Cluster, down to a magnitude of M_B =
-12.5. Spectra were obtained for twenty-three dwarf-galaxy candidates, from
which we measure radial velocities and stellar population characteristics from
absorption line indices. From radial velocities obtained using these spectra we
confirm twelve systems as cluster members, with the remaining eleven as
non-members. Using these newly confirmed cluster members, we are able to extend
the confirmed colour-magnitude relation for the Perseus Cluster down to M_B =
-12.5. We confirm an increase in the scatter about the colour magnitude
relationship below M_B = -15.5, but reject the hypothesis that very red dwarfs
are cluster members. We measure the faint-end slope of the luminosity function
between M_B = -18 and M_B = -12.5, finding alpha = -1.26 \pm 0.06, which is
similar to that of the field. This implies that an overabundance of dwarf
galaxies does not exist in the core of the Perseus Cluster. By comparing metal
and Balmer absorption line indices with alpha-enhanced single stellar
population models, we derive ages and metallicities for these newly confirmed
cluster members. We find two distinct dwarf elliptical populations: an old,
metal poor population with ages ~ 8 Gyr and metallicities [Fe/H] < -0.33, and a
young, metal rich population with ages < 5 Gyr and metallicities [Fe/H] >

with an oblique dipolar magnetic field. The continuum radio emission has been
interpreted as gyrosyncrotron emission arising from a thin magnetospheric
layer. Previous radio observations at 1.4 GHz showed that a 100% circular
polarized and highly directive emission component overlaps to the continuum
emission two times per rotation, when the magnetic axis lies in the plane of
the sky. This sort of radio lighthouse has been proposed to be due to cyclotron
maser emission generated above the magnetic pole and propagating
perpendicularly to the magnetic axis. Observations carried out with the
Australia Telescope Compact Array at 1.4 and 2.5 GHz one year after this
discovery show that this radio emission is still present, meaning that the
phenomenon responsible for this process is steady on a timescale of years. The
emitted radiation spans at least 1 GHz, being observed from 1.4 to 2.5 GHz. On
the light of recent results on the physics of the magnetosphere of this star,
the possibility of plasma radiation is ruled out. The characteristics of this
radio lighthouse provides us a good marker of the rotation period, since the
peaks are visible at particular rotational phases. After one year, they show a
delay of about 15 minutes. This is interpreted as a new abrupt spinning down of
the star. Among several possibilities, a quick emptying of the equatorial
magnetic belt after reaching the maximum density can account for the magnitude
of the breaking. The study of the coherent emission in stars like CU Vir, as
well as in pre main sequence stars, can give important insight into the angular
momentum evolution in young stars. This is a promising field of investigation
that high sensitivity radio interferometers such as SKA can exploit.
