sensitive frequency band of second generation ground based gravitational wave
detectors. Reshaping the beam to a flatter wider profile which probes more of
the mirror surface reduces this noise. The ""Mesa"" beam shape has been proposed
for this purpose and was subsequently generalized to a family of hyperboloidal
beams with two parameters: twist angle alpha and beam width D. Varying alpha
allows a continuous transition from the nearly-flat to the nearly-concentric
Mesa beam configurations. We analytically prove that in the limit of infinite D
hyperboloidal beams become Gaussians. The Advanced LIGO diffraction loss design
constraint is 1 ppm per bounce. In the past the diffraction loss has often been
calculated using the clipping approximation that, in general, underestimates
the diffraction loss. We develop a code using pseudo-spectral methods to
compute the diffraction loss directly from the propagator. We find that the
diffraction loss is not a strictly monotonic function of beam width, but has
local minima that occur due to finite mirror effects and leads to natural
choices of D. For the Mesa beam a local minimum occurs at D = 10.67 cm and
leads to a diffraction loss of 1.4 ppm. We find that if one requires a
diffraction loss of strictly 1 ppm, the alpha = 0.91 pi hyperboloidal beam is
optimal, leading to the coating thermal noise being lower by about 10% than for
a Mesa beam while other types of thermal noise decrease as well. We then
develop an iterative process that reconstructs the mirror to specifically
account for finite mirror effects. This allows us to increase the D parameter
and lower the coating noise by about 30% compared to the original Mesa
configuration.

subset of wireless sensor networks (WSN) applications. As a result, the
performance of the WSN degrades significantly when misbehaving nodes report
false location and distance information in order to fake their actual location.
In this paper we propose a general distributed deterministic protocol for
accurate identification of faking sensors in a WSN. Our scheme does \emph{not}
rely on a subset of \emph{trusted} nodes that are not allowed to misbehave and
are known to every node in the network. Thus, any subset of nodes is allowed to
try faking its position. As in previous approaches, our protocol is based on
distance evaluation techniques developed for WSN. On the positive side, we show
that when the received signal strength (RSS) technique is used, our protocol
handles at most $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor-2$ faking sensors. Also, when the
time of flight (ToF) technique is used, our protocol manages at most $\lfloor
\frac{n}{2} \rfloor - 3$ misbehaving sensors. On the negative side, we prove
that no deterministic protocol can identify faking sensors if their number is
$\lceil \frac{n}{2}\rceil -1$. Thus our scheme is almost optimal with respect
to the number of faking sensors. We discuss application of our technique in the
trusted sensor model. More precisely our results can be used to minimize the
number of trusted sensors that are needed to defeat faking ones.

component (dark energy), or a modification to general relativity (modified
gravity). If dark energy models and modified gravity models are required to
predict the same cosmic expansion history H(z), they will predict different
growth rate for cosmic large scale structure, f_g(z)=d\ln \delta/d\ln a
(\delta=(\rho_m-\bar{\rho_m})/\bar{\rho_m}), a is the cosmic scale factor). If
gravity is not modified, the measured H(z) leads to a unique prediction for
f_g(z), f_g^H(z). Comparing f_g^H(z) with the measured f_g(z) provides a
transparent and straightforward test of gravity. We show that a simple \chi^2
test provides a general figure-of-merit for our ability to distinguish between
dark energy and modified gravity given the measured H(z) and f_g(z). We study a
magnitude-limited NIR galaxy redshift survey covering >10,000 (deg)^2 and the
redshift range of 0.5<z<2. The resultant data can be divided into 7 redshift
bins, and yield the measurement of H(z) to the accuracy of 1-2% via baryon
acoustic oscillation measurements, and f_g(z) to the accuracy of a few percent
via the measurement of redshift space distortions and the bias factor which
describes how light traces mass. We find that if the H(z) data are fit by both
a DGP gravity model and an equivalent dark energy model that predict the same
expansion history, a survey area of 11,931 (deg)^2 is required to rule out the
DGP gravity model at the 99.99% confidence level. It is feasible for such a
galaxy redshift survey to be carried out by the next generation space missions

different epigenetic states. We also study the dynamics of the boundary between
the two locally stable states of chromatin: silenced and unsilenced. The model
could be of use in guiding the discussion on chromatin silencing in general. In
the context of silencing in budding yeast, it helps us understand the phenotype
of various mutants, some of which may be non-trivial to see without the help of
a mathematical model. One such example is a mutation that reduces the rate of
background acetylation of particular histone side-chains that competes with the
deacetylation by Sir2p. The resulting negative feedback due to a Sir protein

(SNLS). We introduce a new method for removing host galaxy contamination in our
spectra, exploiting the comprehensive photometric coverage of the SNLS SNe and
their host galaxies, thereby providing the first quantitative view of the UV
spectral properties of a large sample of distant SNe Ia. Although the mean SN
Ia spectrum has not evolved significantly over the past 40% of cosmic history,
precise evolutionary constraints are limited by the absence of a comparable
sample of high quality local spectra. Within the high-redshift sample, we
discover significant UV spectral variations and exclude dust extinction as the
primary cause by examining trends with the optical SN color. Although
progenitor metallicity may drive some of these trends, the variations we see
are much larger than predicted in recent models and do not follow expected
patterns. An interesting new result is a variation seen in the wavelength of
selected UV features with phase. We also demonstrate systematic differences in
the SN Ia spectral features with SN light curve width in both the UV and the
optical. We show that these intrinsic variations could represent a statistical
limitation in the future use of high-redshift SNe Ia for precision cosmology.
We conclude that further detailed studies are needed, both locally and at
moderate redshift where the rest-frame UV can be studied precisely, in order
that future missions can confidently be planned to fully exploit SNe Ia as
cosmological probes [ABRIDGED].

Markovian state transition model characterizing the behavior of the IEEE 802.11
protocol at the Medium Access Control layer which accounts for packet
transmission failures due to channel errors modeling both saturated and
non-saturated traffic conditions. Second, it provides a throughput analysis of
the IEEE 802.11 protocol at the data link layer in both saturated and
non-saturated traffic conditions taking into account the impact of both the
physical propagation channel and multirate transmission in Rayleigh fading
environment. The general traffic model assumed is M/M/1/K. Finally, it shows
that the behavior of the throughput in non-saturated traffic conditions is a
linear combination of two system parameters; the payload size and the packet
rates, $\lambda^{(s)}$, of each contending station. The validity interval of
the proposed model is also derived.
  Simulation results closely match the theoretical derivations, confirming the
effectiveness of the proposed models.

the use of a standard t copula is often criticized due to its restriction of
having a single parameter for the degrees of freedom (dof) that may limit its
capability to model the tail dependence structure in a multivariate case. To
overcome this problem, grouped t copula was proposed recently, where risks are
grouped a priori in such a way that each group has a standard t copula with its
specific dof parameter. In this paper we propose the use of a grouped t copula,
where each group consists of one risk factor only, so that a priori grouping is
not required. The copula characteristics in the bivariate case are studied. We
explain simulation and calibration procedures, including a simulation study on
finite sample properties of the maximum likelihood estimators and Kendall's tau

t copula in terms of risk measures such as tail dependence, value at risk and

NP-hard problems. To address the situation we suggest to use self-organization
processes of prime integer relations for information processing.
Self-organization processes of prime integer relations define correlation
structures of a complex system and can be equivalently represented by
transformations of two-dimensional geometrical patterns determining the
dynamics of the system and revealing its structural complexity. Computational
experiments raise the possibility of an optimality condition of complex systems
presenting the structural complexity of a system as a key to its optimization.
  From this perspective the optimization of a system could be all about the
control of the structural complexity of the system to make it consistent with
the structural complexity of the problem. The experiments also indicate that
the performance of a complex system may behave as a concave function of the
structural complexity. Therefore, once the structural complexity could be
controlled as a single entity, the optimization of a complex system would be
potentially reduced to a one-dimensional concave optimization irrespective of
the number of variables involved its description. This might open a way to a
new type of information processing for efficient management of complex systems.

altered by the cores coalescence before they collapse to form stars. With
appropriate, yet realistic parameters, this model based on the competition
between cores coalescence and collapse reproduces the mass spectra of the well
studied Arches cluster. Namely, the slopes at the intermediate and high mass
ends are reproduced, as well as the peculiar bump observed at 6 M_sol. This
coalescence-collapse process occurs on short timescale of the order of one
fourth the free fall time of the proto-cluster cloud (i.e., a few 10^{4}
years), suggesting that mass segregation in Arches and similar clusters is
primordial. The best fitting model implies the total mass of the Arches cluster
is 1.45 10^{5} M_sol, which is slightly higher than the often quoted, but
completeness affected, observational value of a few 10^{4} M_sol. The derived

optimised instead of entropy rate.

name it Entropy Rank. We introduce a more general version, able to deal with

properties of those centrality measures with the classic PageRank and HITS on
both toy and real-life examples, in particular their robustness to small

[0,1] using N sensors deployed at regular intervals. The goal is to quantify
the total data rate required for the reconstruction of the field with a given
mean square distortion. We consider a class of two-stage mechanisms which a)
send information to allow the reconstruction of the sensor's samples within
sufficient accuracy, and then b) use these reconstructions to estimate the
entire field. To implement the first stage, the heavy correlation between the
sensor samples suggests the use of distributed coding schemes to reduce the
total rate. We demonstrate the existence of a distributed block coding scheme
that achieves, for a given fidelity criterion for the reconstruction of the
field, a total information rate that is bounded by a constant, independent of
the number $N$ of sensors. The constant in general depends on the
autocorrelation function of the field and the desired distortion criterion for
the sensor samples. We then describe a scheme which can be implemented using
only scalar quantizers at the sensors, without any use of distributed source
coding, and which also achieves a total information rate that is a constant,
independent of the number of sensors. While this scheme operates at a rate that
is greater than the rate achievable through distributed coding and entails
greater delay in reconstruction, its simplicity makes it attractive for
implementation in sensor networks.

is assumed to be found in a thin layer on the surface of a ball). The energy of
the microscopic electrostatic field around the ions is taken into account and
calculated. It is shown in the framework of the model that charged hydrogen
plasma ball can be stable as a metastable state, when subjected to external
(atmospheric) pressure. Equilibrium radius of a ball, the barrier and the
enthalpy of the equilibrium ball are calculated. It looks like the charged
plasma ball in a metastable equilibrium should be used to conduct controllable
nuclear fusion. Changes in the electric charge can be used to control the
volume of a plasma ball.

external magnetic field is considered. Particular attention is paid to the
low-frequency case, when the frequencies of incident radiation are much less
than the electron gyrofrequency. The spectral and polarization features of the
scattering cross-section are analyzed in detail. It is found that the
scattering transfers the low-frequency photons to high harmonics of the
gyrofrequency, into the range of the synchrotron emission of the electron. The
total scattering cross-section appears much larger than that for the particle
at rest. The problem studied is directly applicable to the radio wave
scattering in the magnetosphere of a pulsar. The particles acquire relativistic
rotational energies as a result of resonant absorption of the high-frequency
radio waves and concurrently scatter the low-frequency radio waves, which are
still below the resonance. It is shown that the scattering can affect the radio
intensity and polarization at the lowest frequencies and can compete with the
resonant absorption in contributing to the low-frequency turnover in the pulsar
spectrum. Moreover, the scattering can be an efficient mechanism of the pulsar
high-energy emission, in addition to the synchrotron re-emission of the
particles. Other astrophysical applications of the scattering by gyrating
particles are pointed out as well.

(WD0433+270) and a main-sequence star (BD+26 730) that apparently has been
classified as a member of the Hyades open cluster. Previous studies of the
white dwarf component yielded a cooling time of ~4 Gyr. Although it has not
been pointed out before explicitly, this result is 6 times larger than the age
of the Hyades cluster, giving rise to an apparent conflict between the physics
of white dwarfs and cluster main-sequence fitting. We investigate whether this
system belongs to the Hyades cluster and, accordingly, give a plausible
explanation to the nature of the white dwarf member. From kinematic and
chemical composition considerations we believe that the system was a former
member of the Hyades cluster and therefore has an evolutionary link with it.
However, the evidence is not conclusive. With regards to the nature of the
white dwarf component, we find that two core compositions (C/O and Fe) are
compatible with the observed effective temperature and radius. These
compositions yield very different cooling times of ~4 Gyr and ~1 Gyr,
respectively. We distinguish two posssible scenarios. If the pair does not
belong to the Hyades cluster but only to the Hyades stream, this would indicate
that such stream contains rather old objects and definitely not coeval with the
cluster. This has interesting consequences for Galactic dynamics. On the
contrary, if the white dwarf has an Fe core, it will have a cooling time
compatible with the Hyades age. This is a tantalizing result that would have
implications for the thermonuclear explosion of white dwarfs and explosion
theories of degenerate nuclei.

very sensitive to targeted attacks, we show that for a particular type of
structure such networks surprisingly remain very robust even under removal of a
large fraction of their nodes, which in some cases can be up to 70%. The degree
distribution $P(k)$ of these structures is such that for small values of the
degree $k$ the distribution is constant with $k$, up to a critical value $k_c$,
and thereafter it decays with $k$ with the usual power law. We describe in
detail a model for such a scale-free network with this modified degree

these attacks. We have found several experimental networks with such features,

using ultra-strong (of the order of 10^9 V/m) electrostatic fields varying on a

Suitably shaped targets result in a reduction in the proton beam divergence,

target characteristics, allowing for the collimation of the inherently highly

apply PCA to the optical data of Planetary Nebulae (PNe) with the aim of
extracting information about their morphological differences. Preliminary
analysis of a sample of 55 PNe with known abundances and morphology shows that
the second component (PC2), which results from a relation produced by the
parameters log(N/O), initial and final mass of PNe, is depending on the
morphology of PNe. It has been found that when log(N/O) < -0.18 the PNe's
nitrogen is low independently on the oxygen abundance for either Bipolar (B),
Elliptical (E) or Round (R) PNe. An interesting result is that both E and R PNe
have log(N/O) < 0 while only B PNe show negative and positive values.
Consequently, B PNe are expected to have higher nitrogen values than the E and
R PNe. Following that and a second sample of 35 PNe, n_{e} is also found to be
higher in B PNe. Also, in all PNe morphologies PC2 appears to have a minimum at
0.89 and PNe's initial mass at 2.6 solar masses. 5-D diagrams between PCAs
components and physical parameters are also presented. More results will follow
while simple models will be applied in order to try to give a physical meaning

triaxial dark matter haloes which contain notable amounts of substructure.
However, analytical halo models with smooth, spherically symmetric density
profiles are routinely adopted in the modelling of light propagation effects
through such objects. In this paper, we address the biases introduced by this
procedure by comparing the surface mass densities of actual N-body haloes
against the widely used analytical model suggested by Navarro, Frenk and White
(1996) (NFW).
  We conduct our analysis in the redshift range of 0.0 - 1.5. In cluster sized
haloes, we find that triaxiality can cause scatter in the surface mass density
of the haloes up to sigma_+ = +60% and sigma_- = -70%, where the 1-sigma limits
are relative to the analytical NFW model given value. Subhaloes can increase
this scatter to sigma_+ = +70% and sigma_- = -80%. In galaxy sized haloes, the
triaxial scatter can be as high as sigma_+ = +80% and sigma_- = -70%, and with
subhaloes the values can change to sigma_+ = +40% and sigma_- = -80%.
  We present an analytical model for the surface mass density scatter as a
function of distance to the halo centre, halo redshift and halo mass. The
analytical description enables one to investigate the reliability of results
obtained with simplified halo models. Additionally, it provides the means to
add simulated surface density scatter to analytical density profiles. As an
example, we discuss the impact of our results on the calculation of
microlensing optical depths for MACHOs in CDM haloes.

unprecedented exposure time, giving us an unique opportunity to study the hard
X-ray behavior also for weak objects. The spectral results are based on the
systematic analysis of all INTEGRAL observations covering the source position
performed between February 2003 and October 2006. SAXJ1712.6-3739 did not shows
any flux variation along this period as well as compared to previous BeppoSAX

established explanation of the Type 1/Type 2 dichotomy through orientation
based effects. The generalization of this unification model to the higher
luminosity AGNs that are the quasars remains a key question. The recent
detection of Type 2 Radio-Quiet quasars seems to support such an extension. We
propose to further test this scenario.
  On the basis of a compilation of quasar host galaxy position angles
consisting of previously published data and of new measurements performed using
HST Archive images, we investigate the possible existence of a correlation
between the linear polarization position angle and the host galaxy/extended
emission position angle of quasars.
  We find that the orientation of the rest-frame UV/blue extended emission is
correlated to the direction of the quasar polarization. For Type 1 quasars, the
polarization is aligned with the extended UV/blue emission while these two
quantities are perpendicular in Type 2 objects. This result is independent of
the quasar radio-loudness. We interpret this (anti-)alignment effect in terms
of scattering in a two-component polar+equatorial model which applies to both
Type 1 and Type 2 objects. Moreover the orientation of the polarization -and
then of the UV/blue scattered light- does not appear correlated to the major
axis of the stellar component of the host galaxy measured from near-IR images.

perturbations drastically alters the dynamical behaviour of the oscillator:
noise can wash out a global attractor but can also have a constructive role by
stabilizing an unstable fixed point. The random oscillator displays a rich
phenomenology but remains elementary enough to allow for exact calculations:
this system is thus a useful paradigm for the study of noise-induced
bifurcations and is an ideal testing ground for various mathematical
techniques. We show that the phase is determined by the sign of the Lyapunov
exponent (which can be calculated non-perturbatively for white noise), and we
derive the full phase diagram of the system. We also investigate the effect of
time-correlations of the noise on the phase diagram and show that a smooth
random perturbation is less efficient than white noise. We study the critical
behaviour near the transition and explain why noise-induced transitions often
exhibit intermittency and multiscaling: these effects do not depend on the
amplitude of the noise but rather on its power spectrum. By increasing or
filtering out the low frequencies of the noise, intermittency and multiscaling
can be enhanced or eliminated.

light when viewed from the perspective of the multiverse. Most importantly the
two great ``fine tuning'' problems that motivate the field are far less serious
when one accounts for the required anthropic constraints which exist in a
multiverse. However, the challenge then becomes to construct a realistic
physical theory of the multiverse and test it. I describe some phenomenology of
the quark and lepton masses that may provide a window to the theory that
underlies the multiverse.

requires detailed understanding of physical factors that may cause offsets
between the positions of the same object measured in different spectral bands.
Opacity in compact extragalactic jets (due to synchrotron self-absorption and
external free-free absorption) is one of the key physical phenomena producing
such an offset, and this effect is well-known in radio astronomy (""core
shift""). We have measured the core shifts in a sample of 29 bright compact
extragalactic radio sources observed using very long baseline interferometry
(VLBI) at 2.3 and 8.6 GHz. We report the results of these measurements and
estimate that the average shift between radio and optical positions of distant
quasars would be of the order of 0.1-0.2 mas. This shift exceeds positional
accuracy of GAIA and SIM. We suggest two possible approaches to carefully
investigate and correct for this effect in order to align accurately the radio
and optical positions. Both approaches involve determining a Primary Reference
Sample of objects to be used for tying the radio and optical reference frames
together.

minimization of an $\ell_1$-penalized least-squares functional, for a range of
penalty parameters, is investigated. A criterion that uses the idea of
`approximation isochrones' is introduced. Five different iterative minimization
algorithms are tested and compared, as well as two warm-start strategies. Both
well-conditioned and ill-conditioned problems are used in the comparison, and
the contrast between these two categories is highlighted.

considered on a ring. Its integrability is proved and the Nested Algebraic
Bethe Ansatz is used to derive the Bethe Equations for states with arbitrary

Evans. We present also formulas for the total velocity of particles of a given
type and their limit for large size of the system and finite densities of the
particles.

quantum minimal Fano varieties (a minimal natural (with respect to
Gromov-Witten theory) class of varieties). In particular, we consider ``the
minimal Gromov-Witten ring'', i. e. a commutative algebra with generators and
relations of the form used in the Gromov-Witten theory of Fano variety (of
unspecified dimension). Gromov-Witten theory of any quantum minimal variety is
a homomorphism of this ring to $\mathbb C$. We prove the Abstract
Reconstruction Theorem which states the particular isomorphism of this ring
with a free commutative ring generated by ``prime two-pointed invariants''. We
also find the solutions of the differential equations of type DN for a Fano
variety of dimension N in terms of generating series of one-pointed
Gromov-Witten invariants.

  cosmic sources""; ChJAA in press (6 pages, 4 figures)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Based on the results of applying the extended ADC emission model to three
Z-track sources: GX340+0, GX5-1 and CygX-2, we propose an explanation of the
Z-track sources in which the Normal and Horizontal Branches are dominated by
the increasing radiation pressure of the neutron star. The emitted flux becomes
several times super-Eddington at the Hard Apex and Horizontal Branch and we
suggest that the inner accretion disk is disrupted by this and that part of the
accretion flow is diverted vertically. This position on the Z-track is exactly
the position where radio emission is detected showing the presence of jets. We
thus propose that high radiation pressure is a necessary condition for the
launching of jets. We also show that flaring must consist of unstable nuclear
burning and that the mass accretion rate per unit emitting area of the neutron
star mdot at the onset of flaring agrees well with the critical theoretical
value at which burning becomes unstable.
