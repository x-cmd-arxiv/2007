galaxies and their host halos, we show that the lensing subsample of halos that
produces doubles is preferentially aligned along the lines of sight, whereas
halos that produce quads tend to be projected along their middle axes. These
preferred orientations result in different projected ellipticity distributions
for quad, doubles, and random galaxies. We show that ~300 lens systems must be
discovered to detect this effect at the 95% confidence level. We also
investigate the importance of halo shape for predicting the quad-to-double
ratio and find that the latter depends quite sensitively on the distribution of
the short-to-long axis ratio, but is otherwise nearly independent of halo
shape. Finally, we estimate the impact of the preferred orientation of lensing

why a relatively luminous hard X-ray source does not leave any significant
signature of its presence in terms of optical emission lines, the nature of
XBONGs is still subject of debate. We aim to a better understanding of their
nature by means of a multiwavelength and morphological analysis of a small
sample of these sources. Good-quality photometric near-infrared data
(ISAAC/VLT) of four low-redshift (z=0.1-0.3) XBONGs, selected from the

allows us to reveal a nuclear point-like source, likely to be responsible of
the X-ray emission, in two out of the four sources. The results indicate that
moderate amounts of gas and dust, covering a large solid angle (possibly 4pi)
at the nuclear source, combined with the low nuclear activity, may explain the
lack of optical emission lines. The third XBONG is associated with an X-ray
extended source and no nuclear excess is detected in the near infrared at the
limits of our observations. The last source is associated to a close (d< 1

effects of small perturbations that may be present in the gravitational field.
The theory of Macroscopic Gravity characterizes the effects of the
inhomogeneities through a non-perturbative and covariant averaging procedure.
With similar assumptions on the geometry and matter content, a solution to the
averaged field equations as dictated by Macroscopic Gravity are derived. The
resulting solution provides a possible explanation for the flattening of

observations are the first simultaneous detection of 1-0 S(1) and 1-0 S(0) H2
emission from a protoplanetary disk. 49 Cet does not exhibit H2 emission in any
of the three observed lines. There are a few lunar masses of optically thin hot
H2 in the inner disk (~0.1 AU) of LkHa 264, and less than a tenth of a lunar
mass of hot H2 in the inner disk of 49 Cet. The measured 1-0 S(0)/1-0 S(1) and
2-1 S(1)/1-0 S(1) line ratios in LkHa 264 indicate that the H2 emitting gas is
at T<1500 K and that the H2 is most likely thermally excited by UV photons.
Modeling of the shape of the line suggests that the disk should be seen close
to face-on (i<35). A comparative analysis of the physical properties of CTTS in
which the H2 1-0 S(1) line has been detected and non-detected indicates that
the presence of H2 emission is correlated with the magnitude of the UV excess
and the strength of the Halpha line. The lack of H2 emission in the NIR spectra
of 49 Cet and the absence of Halpha emission suggest that the gas in the inner
disk of 49 Cet has dissipated. The disk surrounding 49 Cet should have an inner
hole.

In the distant universe, black hole mass is commonly estimated using the MgII,
Hbeta, or Halpha emission line widths and the optical/UV continuum or line
luminosities, as proxies for the characteristic velocity and size of the
broad-line region. Although they all have a common calibration in the local
universe, a number of different recipes are currently used in the literature.
It is important to verify the relative accuracy and consistency of the recipes,
as systematic changes could mimic evolutionary trends when comparing various
samples. At z=0.36, all three lines can be observed at optical wavelengths,
providing a unique opportunity to compare different empirical recipes. We use
spectra from the Keck Telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to compare
black hole mass estimators for a sample of nineteen AGNs at this redshift. We
compare popular recipes available from the literature, finding that mass
estimates can differ up to 0.38+-0.05 dex in the mean (or 0.13+-0.05 dex, if
the same virial coefficient is adopted). Finally, we provide a set of 30
internally self consistent recipes for determining black hole mass from a
variety of observables. The intrinsic scatter between cross-calibrated recipes
is in the range 0.1-0.3 dex. This should be considered as a lower limit to the
uncertainty of the black hole mass estimators.

Lyr stars are available on a time baseline exceeding 100 years. Therefore, we
can exploit the possibility of investigating period changes, continuing the
pioneering work started by V. P. Tsesevich in 1969. We collected the available
times of maximum brightness of the galactic RR Lyr stars in the GEOS RR Lyr
database. Moreover, we also started new observational projects, including
surveys with automated telescopes, to characterise the O-C diagrams better. The
database we built has proved to be a very powerful tool for tracing the period
variations through the ages. We analyzed 123 stars showing a clear O-C pattern
(constant, parabolic or erratic) by means of different least-squares methods.
Clear evidence of period increases or decreases at constant rates has been
found, suggesting evolutionary effects. The median values are beta=+0.14
day/Myr for the 27 stars showing a period increase and beta=-0.20 day/Myr for
the 21 stars showing a period decrease. The large number of RR Lyr stars
showing a period decrease (i.e., blueward evolution) is a new and intriguing
result. There is an excess of RR Lyr stars showing large, positive $\beta$
values. Moreover, the observed beta values are slightly larger than those
predicted by theoretical models.

investigated in the context of the bundle of connections and is shown to fail

of the scalar product on pseudo-tensorial forms restricted to the space of
symmetric variations of an invariant connection. In the exceptional case where
PSC is valid, there is a unique G-invariant connection which is moreover
universal, i.e. it is the solution of the Euler-Lagrange equations associated
to any G-invariant Lagrangian on the bundle of connections. This solution is a
canonical connection associated with a weaker notion of reductivity which we

responsible for the resulting flavor structure and mass hierarchy in the low
energy theory. An interesting result of this set-up is that at low energies the
theory flows to next to MFV model where flavor violation is dominantly coming
from the third generation. Low energy flavor violation is further suppressed by
a single parameter that dials the amount of violation in the up or down sector.
There is therefore a sharp limit in which there is no flavor violation in the
down type quark sector which, remarkably, is favored when we fit for the flavor
parameters. This mechanism is used to eliminate the current RS flavor and CP

to model discrete datasets composed of velocities of individual kinematic
tracers in a dynamical system. This constitutes an extension of previous
implementations that can only address continuous data in the form of (the
moments of) velocity distributions, thus avoiding potentially important losses
of information due to data binning. Furthermore, the code can handle any
combination of available velocity components, i.e., only line-of-sight
velocities, only proper motions, or a combination of both. It can also handle a
combination of discrete and continuous data. The code finds the distribution
function (DF, a function of the three integrals of motion E, Lz, and I3) that
best reproduces the available kinematic and photometric observations in a given
axisymmetric gravitational potential. The fully numerical approach ensures
considerable freedom on the form of the DF f(E,Lz,I3). This allows a very
general modeling of the orbital structure, thus avoiding restrictive
assumptions about the degree of (an)isotropy of the orbits. We describe the
implementation of the discrete code and present a series of tests of its
performance based on the modeling of simulated datasets generated from a known
DF. We find that the discrete Schwarzschild code recovers the original orbital
structure, M/L ratios, and inclination of the input datasets to satisfactory
accuracy, as quantified by various statistics. The code will be valuable, e.g.,
for modeling stellar motions in Galactic globular clusters, and those of
individual stars, planetary nebulae, or globular clusters in nearby galaxies.
This can shed new light on the total mass distributions of these systems, with
central black holes and dark matter halos being of particular interest.

achieve smaller total complexities than previously proposed CFFTs and other

another story. Its dynamic spectrum cannot easily be explained by any current
emission model; its excess dispersion must come from propagation through the
star's magnetosphere. We suspect the high-frequency interpulse does not follow
the ``standard model'', but rather comes from some unexpected region within the

exponential number of experiments are needed to gain complete information about
the quantum process, and known algorithmic methods for finding correctable
encodings involve operations on exponentially large matrices. However, we show
that in some cases it is possible to find such encodings with only partial
information about the quantum process. Such useful partial information can be
systematically extracted by averaging the channel under the action of a set of
unitaries in a process known as ""twirling"". In this paper we prove that
correctable encodings for a twirled channel are also correctable for the
original channel. We investigate the particular case of twirling over the set
of Pauli operators and qubit permutations, and show that the resulting quantum
operation can be characterized experimentally in a scalable manner. We also
provide a postprocessing scheme for finding unitarily correctable codes for
these twirled channels which does not involve exponentially large matrices.

hole soft X-ray transient (BHSXT) through the spallation of CNO nuclei by
neutrons which are ejected from a hot (> 10 MeV) advection-dominated accretion
flow (ADAF) around the black hole. Using updated binary parameters, cross
sections of neutron-induced spallation reactions, and mass accretion rates in
ADAF derived from the spectrum fitting of multi-wavelength observations of
quiescent BHSXTs, we obtain the equilibrium abundances of Li by equating the
production rate of Li and the mass transfer rate through accretion to the black
hole. The resulting abundances are found to be in good agreement with the
observed values in seven BHSXTs. We note that the abundances vary in a
timescale longer than a few months in our model. Moreover, the isotopic ratio
Li6/Li7 is calculated to be about 0.7--0.8 on the secondaries, which is much
higher than the ratio measured in meteorites. Detection of such a high value is
favorable to the production of Li via spallation and the existence of a hot
accretion flow, rather than an accretion disk corona system in quiescent BHSXT.

wavefunction; this establishes a robust causal relationship between the
lengthscale of the fluctuations and the superconducting coherence length. It is
suggested that the spin fluctuations are driven by the Fermi surface, which is
prone to nesting; they couple to the itinerant holes via the on-site Coulomb
correlation energy, which inhibits double occupancy of spins or holes. The
maximum energy of the fluctuations gives an appropriate energy scale for the
superconducting $T_{\rm c}$. Based on this model, one can specify the design of
solids that will exhibit ``high $T_{\rm c}$'' superconductivity.

Extensive Air Shower (EAS) arrays. They benefit from a close to 90% duty cycle
and a very large field of view (about 2 sr), but the sensitivity is limited by
their angular resolution and their poor cosmic ray background discrimination.
Above 10 TeV the standard technique for rejecting the hadronic background
consists in looking for ""muon-poor"" showers.
  In this paper we discuss the capability of a large muon detector (A=2500 m2)
operated with an EAS array at very high altitude (>4000 m a.s.l.) to detect
gamma-ray fluxes around 100 TeV. Simulation-based estimates of energy ranges
and sensitivities are presented.

survey at 90 cm. The survey area consists of two overlapping 28 deg^2 fields

of 618 sources were targeted in these fields, based on identifications from

observation of the Rho-Oph star-forming region (the Deep Rho-Oph X-ray
Observation, named Droxo). The data were subdivided into six homogeneous time
intervals, and the six resulting spectra were individually analysed. RESULTS.
We detect significant variability in the equivalent width of the Fe 6.4 keV
emission line from Elias 29. The 6.4 keV line is absent during the first time
interval of observation and appears at its maximum strength during the second
time interval (90 ks after Elias 29 undergoes a strong flare). The X-ray
thermal emission is unchanged between the two observation segments, while line
variability is present at a 99.9% confidence level. Given the significant line
variability in the absence of variations in the X-ray ionising continuum and
the weakness of the photoionising continuum from the star's thermal X-ray
emission, we suggest that the fluorescence may be induced by collisional
ionisation from an (unseen) population of non-thermal electrons. We speculate
on the possibility that the electrons are accelerated in a reconnection event
of a magnetically confined accretion loop, connecting the young star to its
circumstellar disk.

significantly the pulsar wind kinetical pressure. Moreover, the post-shock flow
propagates in a rather narrow region, with very high bulk Lorentz factor

very good approximation the cross-tie density scales with the inverse of the
distance between the main wall and the element edge. The experiments show that

expected, while states with B=0 remain unaffected until the onset of non-zero
baryon density at mu=m_pi/2. Post onset the pi-meson mass increases in
accordance with chiral perturbation theory while the rho becomes lighter. In
the diquark sector a Goldstone state associated with a superfluid ground state

degeneracy between mesons and baryons with the same spacetime and isospin
quantum numbers. Finally we find tentative evidence for the binding of states
with kaon quantum numbers within the baryonic medium.

a given grid pattern of dots? The simplest way is to draw possible patterns of

single-particle level is studied in the cotunneling regime at low temperatures.
The Coulomb diamond can be subdivided into parts differing in at least one of
two respects: what kind of tunneling processes (i) determine the
single-particle occupations and (ii) mainly contribute to the current. No
finite systematic perturbation expansion of the occupations and the current can
be found that is valid within the entire Coulomb diamond. We therefore
construct a non-systematic solution, which is physically correct and
perturbative in the whole cotunneling regime, while smoothly crossing-over
between the different regions. With this solution the impact of an intrinsic
spin-flip relaxation on the transport is investigated. We focus on peaks in the
differential conductance that mark the onset of cotunneling-mediated sequential
transport. It is shown that these peaks are maximally pronounced at a
relaxation roughly as fast as sequential tunneling. The approach as well as the
presented results can be generalized to quantum dots with few levels.

Given a random sample from a bivariate distribution function, the problem is to
estimate the unknown parameter. A method of moments estimator is proposed where
a certain integral of a nonparametric, rank-based estimator of the stable tail
dependence function is matched with the corresponding parametric version. Under
very weak conditions, the estimator is shown to be consistent and
asymptotically normal. Moreover, a comparison between the parametric and
nonparametric estimators leads to a goodness-of-fit test for the semiparametric
model. The performance of the estimator is illustrated for a discrete spectral
measure that arises in a factor-type model and for which likelihood-based
methods break down. A second example is that of a family of stable tail
dependence functions of certain meta-elliptical distributions.

from an ideal triangulation with no use of additional combinatorial topology.
In particular, the Chern-Simons invariant is computed just as easily as the
volume.

respectively) and DTA/TG measurements with Fe2+ containing olivines
(fayalite--forsterite solid solution) and with FeO (wustite) are performed. For
both substances the oxygen partial pressure p_O2 of the growth atmosphere had
to be adjusted within the stability region of Fe2+ for all temperatures ranging
from room temperature to the melting point. The formation of Fe3+ (Fe3O4,
Fe2O3) had to be avoided. The adjustment of p_O2 could be obtained by a mixture
of argon, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Thermodynamic equilibrium
calculations show, that mixtures of an inert gas (e.g. argon) with another gas
or gas mixture that supplies oxygen at elevated temperature (e.g. CO2/CO) are
superior to the use of inert gases with constant oxygen admixture. The reason
is that the Ar/CO2/CO mixture adjusts its oxygen concentration with temperature
in a way similar to that needed for the stabilization of Fe2+.

different definitions of equilibrium and entropy. The problems associated with
this are discussed and it is suggested that they can be resolved, to produce a
version of statistical mechanics incorporating both approaches, by redefining
equilibrium not as a binary property (being/not being in equilibrium) but as a
continuous property (degrees of equilibrium) measured by the Boltzmann entropy
and by introducing the idea of thermodynamic-like behaviour for the Boltzmann
entropy. The Kac ring model is used as an example to test the proposals.

functions can be generalized by fractional integrals. The interpretation of the
fractional analog of phase space as a space with noninteger dimension is
discussed. A fractional (power) system is described by the fractional powers of
coordinates and momenta. These systems can be considered as non-Hamiltonian
systems in the usual phase space. The generalizations of the Bogoliubov
equations are derived from the Liouville equation for fractional (power)
systems. Using these equations, the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation is
obtained.

probing the electronic states at or near the surface of the bilayer CMR
materials La$_{2-2x}$Sr$_{1+2x}$Mn$_2$O$_7$ using angle-resolved photoemission
or scanning probe microscopy. Here we report new, temperature dependent, angle
resolved photoemission data from single crystals with a doping level of
$x=0.36$. The first important result is that there is no sign of a pseudogap in
the charge channel of this material for temperatures below the Curie
temperature $T_C$. The second important result concerns the temperature
dependence of the electronic states. The temperature dependent changes in the
Fermi surface spectra both at the zone face and zone diagonal regions in
$k$-space indicate that the coherent quasiparticle weight disappears for
temperatures significantly above $T_C$, and that the $k$-dependence of the
T-induced changes in the spectra invalidate an interpretation of these data in
terms of the superposition of a `universal' metallic spectrum and an insulating
spectrum whose relative weight changes with temperature. In this sense, our
data are not compatible with a phase separation scenario.

the competition between the pairing and the neutron-proton particle-particle

double-beta decay matrix element to nearly vanish at internucleon distances of
more than 2 or 3 fermis. As a result, the matrix element is more sensitive to
short-range/high-momentum physics than one naively expects. We analyze various
ways of treating that physics and quantify the uncertainty it produces in the
matrix elements, with three different treatments of short-range correlations.
