  ""Extreme Solar Systems"", Santorini, Greece, June 25-29, 2007, slightly
  extended version with bigger figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We review recent results of SPH simulations of gravitational instability in
gaseous protoplanetary disks,emphasizing the role of thermodynamics in both
isolated and binary systems. Contradictory results appeared in the literature
regarding disk fragmentation at tens of AU from the central star are likely due
to the different treatment of radiation physics as well as reflecting different
initial conditions. Further progress on the subject requires extensive
comparisons between different codes with the requirement that the same initial
conditions are adopted. It is discussed how the local conditions of the disks
undergoing fragmentation at $R < 25$ AU in recent SPH simulations are in rough
agreement with the prediction of analytical models, with small differences
being likely related to the inability of analytical models to account for the
dynamics and thermodynamics of three-dimensional spiral shocks. We report that
radically different adaptive hydrodynamical codes, SPH and adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR), yield very similar results on disk fragmentation at
comparable resolution in the simple case of an isothermal equation of state. A
high number of refinements in AMR codes is necessary but not sufficient to
correctly follow fragmentation, rather an initial resolution of the grid high
enough to capture the wavelength of the strongest spiral modes when they are
still barely nonlinear is essential. These tests represent a useful benchmark
and a starting point for a forthcoming code comparison with realistic radiation
physics.

variations in the base parameters and show how the wind's properties vary with
changes in gas pressure, cosmic-ray pressure and density. We demonstrate the
importance of cosmic rays in launching winds, and the effect cosmic rays have
on wind dynamics. In addition, this model adds support to the hypothesis of
Breitschwerdt and collaborators that such a wind may help explain the
relatively small gradient observed in gamma-ray emission as a function of

we demonstrate that the instantaneous peak flux or equivalent isotropic peak
luminosity, L_iso ergs s^-1, rather than the integrated fluence or equivalent
isotropic energy, E_iso ergs, underpins the known high-energy correlations.
Using new spectral/temporal parameters calculated for 101 bursts with redshifts
from BATSE, BeppoSAX, HETE-II and Swift we describe a parameter space which
characterises the apparently diverse properties of the prompt emission. We show
that a source frame characteristic-photon-energy/peak luminosity ratio, K_z,
can be constructed which is constant within a factor of 2 for all bursts
whatever their duration, spectrum, luminosity and the instrumentation used to
detect them. The new parameterization embodies the Amati relation but indicates
that some correlation between E_peak and E_iso follows as a direct mathematical
inference from the Band function and that a simple transformation of E_iso to
L_iso yields a universal high energy correlation for GRBs. The existence of K_z
indicates that the mechanism responsible for the prompt emission from all GRBs
is probably predominantly thermal.

uniform mixture of the two components, the second is that of two pure phases of
two components without any overlap between them. In addition, a mixed and a
pure phase, impossible in 1D and 2D, can be created in 3D. We also obtain the
conditions under which the uniform mixture is stable from an energetic
consideration. The same conditions are obtained from a modulational instability
analysis of the dynamical equations in 1D. Finally, the 1D dynamical equations
for the system are solved numerically and by variational approximation (VA) to
study the bright solitons of the system for attractive interspecies Fermi-Fermi
interaction in 1D. The VA is found to yield good agreement to the numerical
result for the density profile and chemical potential of the bright solitons.
The bright solitons are demonstrated to be dynamically stable. The experimental

parallelism with a maximum variation between 600 - 720 nm that arises because
of the complex structure of the broadband multi-layer dielectric coatings. We
also report an unanticipated optical effect of this multi-layer coating
structure that produces a significant, and wavelength dependent, change in the
apparent shape of the etalon plates. This change is caused by two effects: the
physical non-uniformities or thickness variations in the coating layers, and
the wavelength dependence of the phase change upon refection that can amplify
these non-uniformities. We discuss the impact of these coating effects on the
resolving power, finesse, and throughput of the system. This Fabry-Perot system

Southern inTermediate Redshift ESO Supernova Search (STRESS). Unlike most of
the current high redshift SN searches, this survey was specifically designed to
estimate the rate for both type Ia and core collapse (CC) SNe. We counted the
SNe discovered in a selected galaxy sample measuring SN rate per unit blue band
luminosity. Our analysis is based on a sample of ~43000 galaxies and on 25
spectroscopically confirmed SNe plus 64 selected SN candidates. Our approach is
aimed at obtaining a direct comparison of the high redshift and local rates and
at investigating the dependence of the rates on specific galaxy properties,
most notably their colour. The type Ia SN rate, at mean redshift z=0.3, amounts
to 0.22^{+0.10+0.16}_{-0.08 -0.14} h_{70}^2 SNu, while the CC SN rate, at
z=0.21, is 0.82^{+0.31 +0.30}_{-0.24 -0.26} h_{70}^2 SNu. The quoted errors are
the statistical and systematic uncertainties. With respect to local value, the
CC SN rate at z=0.2 is higher by a factor of ~2 already at redshift, whereas
the type Ia SN rate remains almost constant. This implies that a significant
fraction of SN Ia progenitors has a lifetime longer than 2-3 Gyr. We also
measured the SN rates in the red and blue galaxies and found that the SN Ia
rate seems to be constant in galaxies of different colour, whereas the CC SN
rate seems to peak in blue galaxies, as in the local Universe. SN rates per
unit volume were found to be consistent with other measurements showing a
steeper evolution with redshift for CC SNe with respect to SNe Ia. Finally we
have exploited the link between star formation (SF) and SN rates to predict the
evolutionary behaviour of the SN rates and compare it with the path indicated
by observations.

describe how a broad class of previously-static compactifications from 6D to 4D
(sourced by two 3-branes) respond to waves moving along one of the
uncompactified directions. Because our methods are generally applicable to any
higher dimensional supergravity they are likely to be of use for finding the
supergravity limit of time-dependent solutions in string theory. The 6D
solutions are interesting in their own right, describing 6D shock waves induced
by high energy particles on the branes, and as descriptions of the near-brane
limit of the transient wavefront arising from a local bubble-nucleation event
on one of the branes, such as might occur if a tension-changing phase
transition were to occur.

single flavour scalar electrodynamics, the emergent period is Q = 1. In the
general case of N complex scalars with a U(1)^{N-1} global symmetry, the period

ages and different mass fractions of hydrogen in the core pass, within the
errors, through the observed position of Procyon A in the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram. For more than 15 years several different groups have studied the
solar-like oscillations in Procyon A to determine its evolutionary state.
Although several studies independently detected power excess in the

This is probably due to either insufficient high-quality data (i.e., aliasing)
or due to intrinsic properties of the star (i.e., short mode lifetimes). Now a
spectroscopic multi-site campaign using 10 telescopes world-wide (minimizing
aliasing effects) with a total time span of nearly 4 weeks (increase the

surface brightness and disk opacity. In the Spitzer era, SED models of spiral
disks add a new perspective on the role of dust in spiral disks. Combined with
the overall opacity from galaxy counts, they yield a typical optical depth of
the dusty ISM clouds: 0.4 that implies a size of ~60 pc. Work on galaxy counts
is currently ongoing on the ACS fields of M51, M101 and M81. Occulting galaxies
offer the possibility of probing the history of disk opacity from higher

tensors fluctuations, specifically fluctuations of the Casimir force and
radiation pressure fluctuations. We next discuss passive fluctuations of
spacetime geometry and some of their operational signatures. These include
luminosity fluctuations, line broadening, and angular blurring of a source
viewed through a fluctuating gravitational field. Finally, we discuss the
possible role of quantum stress tensor fluctuations in the early universe,
especially in inflation. The fluctuations of the expansion of a congruence of
comoving geodesics grows during the inflationary era, due to non-cancellation
of anticorrelations that would have occurred in flat spacetime. This results in
subsequent non-Gaussian density perturbations and allows one to infer an upper
bound on the duration of inflation. This bound is consistent with adequate
inflation to solve the horizon and flatness problems.

gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as {\it LISA}. GW measurements can
localize the position of a coalescing binary on the sky to an ellipse with a
major axis of a few tens of arcminutes to a few degrees, depending on source
redshift, and a minor axis which is $2 - 4$ times smaller. Neglecting weak
gravitational lensing, the GWs would also determine the source's luminosity
distance to better than percent accuracy for close sources, degrading to
several percent for more distant sources. Weak lensing cannot, in fact, be
neglected and is expected to limit the accuracy with which distances can be
fixed to errors no less than a few percent. Assuming a well-measured cosmology,
the source's redshift could be inferred with similar accuracy. GWs alone can
thus pinpoint a binary to a three-dimensional ``pixel'' which can help guide
searches for the hosts of these events. We examine the time evolution of this
pixel, studying it at merger and at several intervals before merger. One day
before merger, the major axis of the error ellipse is typically larger than its
final value by a factor of $\sim 1.5-6$. The minor axis is larger by a factor
of $\sim 2-9$, and, neglecting lensing, the error in the luminosity distance is
larger by a factor of $\sim 1.5-7$. This large change over a short period of
time is due to spin-induced precession, which is strongest in the final days
before merger. The evolution is slower as we go back further in time. For $z =

channels is considered. The problem is to choose a linear equalizer and a
partial response target filter such that the combination produces the best
detection performance. Instead of using the traditional approach of MMSE
equalization, we directly seek all equalizer and target pairs that yield
optimal detection performance in terms of the sequence or symbol error rate.
This leads to a new notion of a posteriori equivalence between the equalized
and target channels with a simple characterization in terms of their underlying
probability distributions. Using this characterization we show the surprising
existence an infinite family of equalizer and target pairs for which any
maximum a posteriori (MAP) based detector designed for the target channel is
simultaneously MAP optimal for the equalized channel. For channels whose input
symbols have equal energy, such as q-PSK, the MMSE equalizer designed with a
monic target constraint yields a solution belonging to this optimal family of
designs. Although, these designs produce IIR target filters, the ideas are
extended to design good FIR targets. For an arbitrary choice of target and
equalizer, we derive an expression for the probability of sequence detection
error. This expression is used to design optimal FIR targets and IIR equalizers
and to quantify the FIR approximation penalty.

an irreversible process, fibrillization, occurs. The tightly bound amyloid form
of the lysozyme molecule, identified by circular dichroism spectra and dynamic

theoretical studies of these patterns are developed without concerning a noise.

the inlet concentrations are perturbed by a small noise. When the flow rate is
small, the FDS is linearly sensitive to noise at the inlet. Even weak
fluctuations destroy the stationary pattern and an oscillatory solution appears

make adjoints configurations to the same system. R fluids are defined and mean

expressed, by weighting on the moment of inertia and the mass, respectively.
The definition of figure rotation is extended to R fluids. The generalized
tensor virial equations are formulated for R fluids and further attention is
devoted to axisymmetric configurations where, for selected coordinate axes, a
variation in figure rotation has to be counterbalanced by a variation in
anisotropy excess and vice versa. A microscopical analysis of systematic and
random motions is performed under a few general hypotheses, by reversing the
sign of tangential or axial velocity components of an assigned fraction of
particles, leaving the distribution function and other parameters unchanged
(Meza 2002). The application of the reversion process to tangential velocity
components, implies the conversion of random motion rotation kinetic energy
into systematic motion rotation kinetic energy. The application of the
reversion process to axial velocity components, implies the conversion of
random motion translation kinetic energy into systematic motion translation
kinetic energy, and the loss related to a change of reference frame is
expressed in terms of systematic (imaginary) motion rotation kinetic energy. A
procedure is sketched for deriving the spin parameter distribution (including
imaginary rotation) from a sample of observed or simulated large-scale
collisionless fluids i.e. galaxies and galaxy clusters.

parallel semitransparent plates, that is, $\delta$-function potentials, acting
on a massless scalar field, in a spacetime defined by Rindler coordinates. We
calculate the force on systems consisting of one or two such plates undergoing
acceleration perpendicular to the plates. In the limit of small acceleration we
recover (via the equivalence principle) the situation of weak gravity, and find
that the gravitational force on the system is just $M\mathbf{g}$, where
$\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration and $M$ is the total mass of the
system, consisting of the mass of the plates renormalized by the Casimir energy
of each plate separately, plus the energy of the Casimir interaction between
the plates. This reproduces the previous result in the limit as the coupling to
the $\delta$-function potential approaches infinity. Extension of this latter

infrared spectrograph onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. A spectral line map
of the $\nu_5$ vibration-rotation band at 13.7 microns carried out toward the
star-forming region Cepheus A East, shows that the C2H2 emission peaks in a few
localized clumps where gas-phase CO2 emission was previously detected with
Spitzer. The distribution of excitation temperatures derived from fits to the
C2H2 line profiles ranges from 50 to 200 K, a range consistent with that
derived for gaseous CO2 suggesting that both molecules probe the same warm gas
component. The C2H2 molecules are excited via radiative pumping by 13.7 microns
continuum photons emanating from the HW2 protostellar region. We derive column
densities ranging from a few x 10^13 to ~ 7 x 10^14 cm^-2, corresponding to
C2H2 abundances of 1 x 10^-9 to 4 x 10^-8 with respect to H2. The spatial
distribution of the C2H2 emission along with a roughly constant N(C2H2)/N(CO2)
strongly suggest an association with shock activity, most likely the result of
the sputtering of acetylene in icy grain mantles.
