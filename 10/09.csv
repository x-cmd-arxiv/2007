examine the effect of choosing an excited inflationary initial state built over
the Bunch-Davies state on the CMB bi-spectrum. We find that even for Hadamard
states, there are unexpected enhancements in the bi-spectrum for certain
configurations in momentum space due to interactions of modes in the early
stages of inflation. These enhancements can be parametrically larger than the
standard ones and are potentially observable in current and future data. These
initial state effects have a characteristic signature in $l$-space which
distinguishes them from the usual contributions, with the enhancement being
most pronounced for configurations corresponding to flattened triangles for
which two momenta are collinear.

dynamics is a pure Darwinian rule with both fundamental ingredients to drive
evolution: 1) random mutations and crossings which act in the sense of
increasing the entropy (or diversity); and 2) selection which acts in the
opposite sense by limiting the entropy explosion. Selection wins this
competition if mutations performed at birth are few enough. By slowly
increasing the average number m of mutations, however, the population suddenly
undergoes a mutational degradation precisely at a transition point mc. Above
this point, the ""bad"" alleles spread over the genetic pool of the population,
overcoming the selection pressure. Individuals become selectively alike, and
evolution stops. Only below this point, m < mc, evolutionary life is possible.
  The finite-size-scaling behaviour of this transition is exhibited for large
enough ""chromosome"" lengths L. One important and surprising observation is the
L-independence of the transition curves, for large L. They are also independent
on the population size. Another is that mc is near unity, i.e. life cannot be
stable with much more than one mutation per diploid genome, independent of the
chromosome length, in agreement with reality. One possible consequence is that
an eventual evolutionary jump towards larger L enabling the storage of more
genetic information would demand an improved DNA copying machinery in order to
keep the same total number of mutations per offspring.

H.E.S.S. and MAGIC have revealed a large number of new sources of
very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays from 100 GeV - 100 TeV, mostly concentrated
along the Galactic plane. At lower energies (100 MeV - 10 GeV) the
satellite-based instrument EGRET revealed a population of sources clustering
along the Galactic Plane. Given their adjacent energy bands a systematic
correlation study between the two source catalogues seems appropriate. Here,
the populations of Galactic sources in both energy domains are characterised on
observational as well as on phenomenological grounds. Surprisingly few common
sources are found in terms of positional coincidence and spectral consistency.
These common sources and their potential counterparts and emission mechanisms
will be discussed in detail. In cases of detection only in one energy band, for
the first time consistent upper limits in the other energy band have been
derived. The EGRET upper limits are rather unconstraining due to the
sensitivity mismatch to current VHE instruments. The VHE upper limits put
strong constraints on simple power-law extrapolation of several of the EGRET
spectra and thus strongly suggest cutoffs in the unexplored energy range from
10 GeV - 100 GeV. Physical reasons for the existence of cutoffs and for
differences in the source population at GeV and TeV energies will be discussed.
Finally, predictions will be derived for common GeV - TeV sources for the
upcoming GLAST mission bridging for the first time the energy gap between
current GeV and TeV instruments.

the conjecture that among many candidate error patterns in OSD reprocessing,
modulo 2 addition of the lightest error pattern with one of the left error
patterns may generate a light codeword. When the decoding syndrome changes to
all-zero state, the lightest error pattern reduces to all-zero, the lightest

relativity theory by a convention or definition. This definition leads to
different simultaneities across inertial frames and the well known principle of
relativity of simultaneity. The lack of a universal present implies the
existence of past, present and future as a collection of events on a four
dimensional manifold or continuum wherein three dimensions are space like and
one dimension is time like. However, such a continuum precludes the possibility
of evolution of future from the present as all events exist forever so to speak
on the continuum with the tenses past, present and future merely being
perceptions of different inertial frames. Such a far-reaching ontological
concept, created by a mere convention, is yet to gain full acceptance. In this
paper, we present arguments in favour of an absolute present, which means
simultaneous events are simultaneous in all inertial frames, and subscribe to
evolution of future from the present.

that increases with average SNR while maintaining a fixed outage probability.
This is in contrast to the classical Zheng-Tse diversity-multiplexing tradeoff
(DMT) that focuses on increasing rate and decreasing outage probability. Three
different systems are explored: antenna diversity systems, time/frequency
diversity systems, and automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems. In order to
accurately study performance in the fixed outage setting, it is necesary to go
beyond the coarse, asymptotic multiplexing gain metric. In the case of antenna
diversity and time/frequency diversity, an affine approximation to high SNR
outage capacity (i.e., multiplexing gain plus a power/rate offset) accurately
describes performance and shows the very significant benefits of diversity. ARQ
is also seen to provide a significant performance advantage, but even an affine
approximation to outage capacity is unable to capture this advantage and outage
capacity must be directly studied in the non-asymptotic regime.

substantial energy is lost to neutrinos via the convective Urca process. This

review paper as it covers and expands on the mathematical framework underlying
a series of more applied articles. In addition, this article also presents a
few key new theorems that make the treatment self-contained. Stochastic
processes with continuous time and continuous space variables are defined
constructively by establishing new convergence estimates for Markov chains on
simplicial sequences. We emphasize high precision computability by numerical
linear algebra methods as opposed to the ability of arriving to analytically
closed form expressions in terms of special functions. Path dependent processes
adapted to a given Markov filtration are associated to an operator algebra. If
this algebra is commutative, the corresponding process is named Abelian, a
concept which provides a far reaching extension of the notion of stochastic
integral. We recover the classic Cameron-Dyson-Feynman-Girsanov-Ito-Kac-Martin
theorem as a particular case of a broadly general block-diagonalization
algorithm. This technique has many applications ranging from the problem of
pricing cliquets to target-redemption-notes and volatility derivatives.
Non-Abelian processes are also relevant and appear in several important
applications to for instance snowballs and soft calls. We show that in these
cases one can effectively use block-factorization algorithms. Finally, we
discuss the method of dynamic conditioning that allows one to dynamically
correlate over possibly even hundreds of processes in a numerically noiseless

is underestimated and only two parameters (type and height of the building)
seem to be statistically significant. Moreover, we compared the linear part of

spectra of a single crystal are analyzed by an equivalent circuit description,
assuming two highly resistive layers in series to the bulk. Good fits could be
achieved, including the second relaxation, which also shows up in single

is sensitive to surface treatment and, in contrast to the main relaxation, also

un-stressed state the yeast protein-protein interaction network (interactome)
is highly compact, and the centrally organized modules have a large overlap.
During stress several original modules became more separated, and a number of
novel modules also appear. A few basic functions, such as the proteasome
preserve their central position. However, several functions with high energy
demand, such the cell-cycle regulation loose their original centrality during
stress. A number of key stress-dependent protein complexes, such as the
disaggregation-specific chaperone, Hsp104, gain centrality in the stressed
yeast interactome. Molecular chaperones, heat shock, or stress proteins form
complex interaction networks (the chaperome) with each other and their
partners. Here we show that the human chaperome recovers the segregation of
protein synthesis-coupled and stress-related chaperones observed in yeast
recently. Examination of yeast and human interactomes shows that (1) chaperones
are inter-modular integrators of protein-protein interaction networks, which
(2) often bridge hubs and (3) are favorite candidates for extensive

Starting from a Hamiltonian formulation of realistic noise models, and assuming
that QEC is indeed possible, we find formal expressions for the probability of
a faulty path and the residual decoherence encoded in the reduced density
matrix. Systems with non-zero gate times (``long gates'') are included in our
analysis by using an upper bound on the noise. In order to introduce the local
error probability for a qubit, we assume that propagation of signals through
the environment is slower than the QEC period (hypercube assumption). This
allows an explicit calculation in the case of a generalized spin-boson model
and a quantum frustration model. The key result is a dimensional criterion: If
the correlations decay sufficiently fast, the system evolves toward a
stochastic error model for which the threshold theorem of fault-tolerant
quantum computation has been proven. On the other hand, if the correlations
decay slowly, the traditional proof of this threshold theorem does not hold.
This dimensional criterion bears many similarities to criteria that occur in
the theory of quantum phase transitions.

and multihop routing can be increased from the $\Omega({1 \over \sqrt{n} \log

\over \sqrt{n}})$. The goal of the present paper is to understand the
dependence of this interesting result on the principal new features it
introduced relative to Gupta-Kumar: (1) a capacity-based formula for link
transmission bit-rates in terms of received signal-to-interference-and-noise
ratio (SINR); (2) hierarchical routing from sources to destinations through a
system of communal highways; and (3) cell-based routes constructed by
percolation. The conclusion of the present paper is that the improved
throughput scaling is principally due to the percolation-based routing, which
enables shorter hops and, consequently, less interference. This is established
by showing that throughput $\Omega({1 \over \sqrt{n}})$ can be attained by a
system that does not employ highways, but instead uses percolation to
establish, for each source-destination pair, a set of $\Theta(\log n)$ routes
within a narrow routing corridor running from source to destination. As a
result, highways are not essential. In addition, it is shown that throughput
$\Omega({1 \over \sqrt{n}})$ can be attained with the original threshold
transmission bit-rate model, provided that node transmission powers are
permitted to grow with $n$. Thus, the benefit of the capacity bit-rate model is
simply to permit the power to remain bounded, even as the network expands.

extrapolation scheme for the potential beyond the observable e-fold range, nor
on additional assumptions about initial conditions for the inflaton velocity.
This last feature represents the main improvement of this work, and is made
possible by the reconstruction of H(phi) prior to V(phi). Our results only rely
on the assumption that within the observable range, corresponding to ~ 10
e-folds, inflation is not interrupted and the function H(phi) is smooth enough
for being Taylor-expanded at order one, two or three. We conclude that the
variety of potentials allowed by the data is still large. However, it is clear
that the first two slow-roll parameters are really small while the validity of
the slow-roll expansion beyond them is not established.

properties differ from those in walls. AGN are more common in voids than in
walls, but only among moderately luminous and massive galaxies (M_r < -20, log
M_*/M_sun < 10.5), and this enhancement is more pronounced for the weakly
accreting systems (i.e., L_[O III] < 10^39 erg/s). Void AGN hosted by
moderately massive and luminous galaxies are accreting at equal or lower rates
than their wall counterparts, show less obscuration than in walls, and
similarly aged stellar populations. The very few void AGN in massive bright
hosts accrete more strongly, are more obscured, and are associated with younger
stellar emission than wall AGN. Thus, accretion strength is probably connected
to the availability of fuel supply, and accretion and star-formation co-evolve
and rely on the same source of fuel. Nearest neighbor statistics indicate that
the weak accretion activity (LINER-like) is not influenced by the local
environment. However, H IIs, Seyferts, and Transition objects prefer more
grouped small scale structures, indicating that the rate at which galaxies
interact with each other affects their activity. These trends support a
potential H II -> Seyfert/Transition Object -> LINER evolutionary sequence that
we show is apparent in many properties of actively line-emitting galaxies, in
both voids and walls. The subtle differences between void and wall AGN might be
explained by a longer, less disturbed duty cycle of these systems in voids.

electrons, the interference condition for Laughlin quasiparticles has a
non-vanishing statistical contribution that can be observed experimentally. Two
kinds of interferometer devices have been realized. In the primary-filling
interferometer, the entire device has filling 1/3, and the e/3 edge channel
quasiparticles encircle identical e/3 island quasiparticles. Here the flux
period is h/e, same as for electrons, but the back-gate charge period is e/3.

time, we report an internal structure within the h/e period: on the i = 3
spin-split plateau, two of the three resonant tunneling peaks are higher and/or
closer than the third. Puzzlingly, in this regime, when back gate voltage is
swept, the tunneling peaks are grouped in pairs. These results are attributed
to the dominance of the electron-electron Coulomb interaction, effectively
mixing Landau level occupation, and to the self-consistent electrostatics of
the antidot.

the affirmative with \epsilon=1/4. The previous best known bound was
\Omega((\log n / \log\log n)^{1/2}). We also consider untangling geometric

O(n\log n)^{2/3}. We answer a question of Spillner and Wolff [arXiv:0709.0170

infinitely many values of n, there is an n-vertex geometric tree that cannot be

improve the lower bound to (n/2)^{1/2}.

plane waves of wavevector $\bk$, respectively. The field impinging upon the
reflecting surface is modeled as a quasi-monochromatic fundamental Gaussian
beam suitably modified in order to satisfy Maxwell equations (Maxwell-Gaussian
beam). Analytical expressions, correct up to the second order in a perturbation

  The approach in this paper differs fundamentally from the logic behind known

reflect even the crucial bifurcation and hysteresis inherent in separation
phenomena. This new look at the problem naturally leads to several important
implications, such as, firstly, uncovering the physical mechanisms for

two-thirds of the way through the outburst with an associated phase shift of
0.50 +/- 0.06 cycles. The mean common superhump period before this transition
was 0.07685 +/- 0.00003 d and the mean late superhump period following the
transition was 0.07654 +/- 0.00002 d. The common superhump period decreased at
a rate dP/dt = -5.1 +/- 1.7 x10^-5 /cycle. At the onset of late superhumps,
there was a transient shift in power from the superhump fundamental frequency
to its first harmonic and back again. We detected an orbital period of 0.0740
+/- 0.0002 d giving a fractional superhump period excess of 0.038 +/- 0.003 and
a mass ratio of 0.167 +/- 0.010. A scalegram analysis of the flickering

candidates. Although any one of these candidates will be virtually impossible
to detect at the LHC, it is shown that they may be detected at future planned
direct detection experiments. For the real case, an irreducible radiative
coupling to quarks may allow a detection. The complex case in general has an
experimentally ruled out tree-level coupling to quarks via Z-boson exchange.
However, in the case of two SU(2)_L doublets, a higher dimensional coupling to
the Higgs can suppress this coupling, and a remaining irreducible radiative
coupling may allow a detection. Singlet dark matter could be detected through a
coupling to quarks via Higgs exchange. Since all non-chiral dark matter can
have a coupling to the Higgs, at least some of its mass can be obtained from
electroweak symmetry breaking, and this mass is a useful characterization of
its direct detection cross-section.

exponential form of the Schwinger process. We also consider a linear magnetic
field configuration as an example of inhomogeneous magnetic fields. We find
that the imaginary part of the effective potential is nonzero even below the

the inverse of the magnetic field gradient, which is the non-perturbative

the $\mathbb{R}^{3,1} \times S^{1}$ topology the heavy modes do not decouple in
the effective action, due to the zero mode of the 5-th component of the 5-d
gauge field $A_{5}$. Because $A_{5}$ is a scalar under 4-d Lorentz
transformations, there is no gauge symmetry protecting it from getting mass and
$A_{5}^{4}$ interaction terms after loop corrections. In addition, after
symmetry breaking, we find new divergences in the $A_{5}$ mass that did not
appear in the symmetric phase. The new divergences are traced back to the
gauge-goldstone mixing that occurs after symmetry breaking. The relevance of
these new divergences to Symanzik's theorem is discussed. In order to get a
more sensible theory we investigate the $S^{1}/\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
compactification. With this kind of compact topology, the $A_{5}$ zero mode
disappears. With no $A_{5}$, there are no new divergences and the heavy modes
decouple. We also discuss the dependence of the couplings and masses on the
compactification scale. We derive a set of RG-like equations for the running of
the effective couplings with respect to the compactification scale. It is found
that magnitudes of both couplings decrease as the scale $M$ increases. The
effective masses are also shown to decrease with increasing compactification
scale. All of this opens up the possibility of placing constraints on the size

the growth of organosilane SAMs at the surface of organic semiconductors, which

from the data with those expected from simulations using the exposure function
we find similar features. Additionally, confronting the large-angle

produced under the assumption of statistical isotropy we found that they are
incompatible at 95% confidence level. However, such differences are restricted
to the angular scales 36o - 45o, which are likely to be due to the non-uniform

2800 years (1 sigma). This maser lifetime applies to AGB stars with strong mass
loss leading to very red infrared colors. The velocities and mean flux density

sinusoidally modulated structure is realized with the modulation vector ${\bm

paramagnetic phase comprise significantly broad quasielastic and inelastic
peaks centered at $\hbar \omega \approx 0, 8$ and 65 meV.
Crystalline-electric-field (CEF) analysis satisfactorily reproduces the
observed spectra, confirming their CEF origin. The broadness of the
quasielastic peak indicates strong spin fluctuations due to coupling between
localized $4f$ spins and conduction electrons in the paramagnetic phase. A
prominent feature is suppression of the quasielastic fluctuations, and
concomitant growth of a sharp inelastic peak in a low energy region below
$T_{\rm N}$. This suggests dissociation of the conduction and localized $4f$
electrons on ordering, and contrasts the presently observed incommensurate
phase with spin-density-wave order frequently seen in heavy fermion compounds,
such as Ce(Ru$_{1-x}$La$_x$)$_2$Si$_2$.

stationary, equivalent to the Minkowski space-time, and that the universe with
positive energy density is always spatially closed and finite. In the closed

judged in the world reference frame, in which both cosmic expansion and

However, clearly separate parameter combinations yield the same dimensions. To
overcome this degeneracy and to further develop the understanding of

been successfully employed in cosmology, in order to quantify the global

interaction, reversibly and nondeterministically produces the solution of the
problem under the simultaneous influence of all the problem constraints. This
requires a perfectly accurate, rigid, and reversible relation between the
coordinates of the machine parts - the machine can be considered the many body
generalization of another perfect machine, the bounching ball model of
reversible computation. The mathematical description of the machine, as it is,
is applicable to quantum problem solving, an extension of the quantum
algorithms that comprises the physical representation of the problem-solution
interdependence. The perfect relation between the coordinates of the machine
parts is transferred to the populations of the reduced density operators of the
parts of the computer register. The solution of the problem is reversibly and
nondeterministically produced under the simultaneous influence of the state
before measurement and the quantum principle. At the light of the present
notion of simultaneous computation, the quantum speed up turns out to be
""precognition"" of the solution, namely the reduction of the initial ignorance

simplest method, the growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes on bare silicon
and on ultra-thin oxides is greatly inhibited due to the formation of a

silicide formation occurs on ultra-thin oxides due to thermally activated metal
diffusion through the oxide. Silicides affect the growth of single-walled
nanotubes more than multi-walled nanotubes due to the increased kinetics at the
higher single-walled nanotube growth temperature. We demonstrate that nickel
and iron catalysts, when deposited on clean silicon or ultra-thin silicon
dioxide layers, begin to form silicides at relatively low temperatures, and
that by 900C, all of the catalyst has been incorporated into the silicide,
rendering it inactive for subsequent single-walled nanotube growth. We further
show that a 4 nm silicon dioxide layer is the minimum diffusion barrier
thickness which allows for efficient single-walled nanotube growth.

absorption is detected at 6016 MHz toward W3(OH), while stronger, narrower

$F$ converts $F$ into adapted coordinates, $\Fbd(\tilde v, \overline u) =
(\tilde v, \overline v)$, where $\tilde v$ is a function of average zero and
both $\overline u$ and $\overline v$ are numbers. Thus, global geometric
aspects of $F$ reduce to the study of a family of one-dimensional maps: we use
this approach to obtain normal forms for several nonlinearities $f$. For
example, we characterize autonomous nonlinearities giving rise to global folds
and, in general, we show that $F$ is a global fold if all critical points are
folds. Also, $f(t,x) = x^3 - x$, or, more generally, the Cafagna-Donati
nonlinearity, yield global cusps; for $F$ interpreted as a map between
appropriate Hilbert spaces, the requested changes of variable to bring $F$ to
normal form can be taken to be diffeomorphisms. A key ingredient in the
argument is the contractibility of both the critical set and the set of
non-folds for a generic autonomous nonlinearity. We also obtain a numerical
example of a polynomial $f$ of degree 4 for which $F$ contains butterflies
(Morin singularities of order 4)---% it then follows that $F(u) = v$ has six

greatest challenges, today is to understand the origin of their magnetic field

magnetic field, in which the magnetic fields of Ap/Bp stars are relics of those
which existed in the parental molecular clouds during the formation. This
implies that the magnetic field must survive all the initial phases of the
stellar evolution and especially the pre-main sequence (PMS) phase. This is
consistent with the general belief that magnetic braking occurs during the PMS
phase, which sheds angular momentum and slows the rotation of these stars. In
this context, we proceeded with a survey of a sample of around 50 PMS Herbig
Ae/Be stars, using the new spectropolarimeter ESPaDOnS at the CFHT, in order to
study the magnetic field and the rotation velocity of these stars. This talk

check the sensitivity of our results to the inter--quark interaction we have

changing the interaction potential.
  Another source of theoretical uncertainty is the use of nonrelativistic
kinematics in the evaluation of the orbital wave functions and the construction
of our nonrelativistic states, although we think that a good part of these
relativistic effects are contained in an effective way in the parameters of the

the experimental spectra of mesons. Mesons wave functions have been evaluated
using a Numerov algorithm, while for baryons the three body problem has been
solved using a variational approach with ansatz wave functions that include
simplifications that arise from HQS and HQSS. To compute hadron decays we have
relied on the impulse approximation, which induces small axial and vector
current conservation violations due to binding effects. These binding effects,

were calculated in the $k_t$-factorization approach for the RHIC energy.
Several mechanisms were considered, including direct color-singlet mechanism,
radiative decays of $\chi_c$ mesons, decays of $\psi'$, open-charm associated
production of $J/\psi$ as well as weak decays of B mesons. Different
unintegrated gluon distributions from the literature were used. We find that
radiative $\chi_c$ decays and direct color-singlet contributions constitute the
dominant mechanism of $J/\psi$ production. These process cannot be consistently
treated within collinear-factorization approach. The results are compared with
recent RHIC data. The new precise data at small transverse momenta impose
stringent constraints on UGDFs. Some UGDFs are inconsistent with the new data.
The Kwieci\'nski UGDFs give the best description of the data. In order to
verify the mechanism suggested here we propose $J/\psi$ -- jet correlation
measurement and an independent measurement of $\chi_c$ meson production in
$\pi^+ \pi^-$ and/or $K^+ K^-$ decay channels. Finally, we address the issue of
\J spin alignment.

(QD) with a hybridization lambda to a non-interacting QD, which in turn is
coupled to a non-interacting conduction band. The system corresponds to an
impurity Anderson model in which the conduction band has a Lorentzian density
of states of width Delta2.
  We solved the model using perturbation theory in the Coulomb repulsion U
(PTU) up to second order and a slave-boson mean-field approximation (SBMFA).
The PTU works surprisingly well near the exactly solvable limit Delta2 -> 0.
For fixed U and large enough lambda or small enough Delta2, the Kondo peak in
rho(omega) splits into two peaks. This splitting can be understood in terms of
weakly interacting quasiparticles. Before the splitting takes place the
universal properties of the model in the Kondo regime are lost. Using the
SBMFA, simple analytical expressions for the occurrence of split peaks are
obtained. For small or moderate Delta2, the side bands of rho(omega) have the
form of narrow resonances, that were missed in previous studies using the
numerical renormalization group. This technique also has shortcomings for
describing properly the split Kondo peaks. As the temperature is increased, the
intensity of the split Kondo peaks decreases, but it is not completely
suppressed at high temperatures.

based on the weak Kerr effect. Two photonic qubits modulate the phase of a
coherent state, and a quadrature measurement of the coherent state reveals the
parity of the two qubits without destroying the photons. This can be used to
create so-called cluster states, a universal resource for quantum computing.
Here, the effect of self-phase modulation on the parity gate is studied,
introducing generating functions for the Wigner function of a modulated
coherent state. For materials with non-EIT-based Kerr nonlinearities, there is
typically a self-phase modulation that is half the magnitude of the cross-phase
modulation. Therefore, this effect cannot be ignored. It is shown that for a
large class of physical implementations of the phase modulation, the quadrature
measurement cannot distinguish between odd and even parity. Consequently, weak
nonlinear parity gates must be implemented with physical systems where the
self-phase modulation is negligable.
