Dirac fermion theories describing the quantum Hall transition (QHT) and spin
Quantum Hall transition (SQHT), which previously revealed no perturbative fixed
points at 1-loop and higher. The approach involves carrying out the flow in 2
stages, the first stage utilizing a new form of super spin-charge separation to
flow to gl(1|1)_N and osp(2|2)_{-2N} supercurrent algebra theories, where N is
the number of copies. This leads to the unconventional feature that at the
critical point the exponents depend on the original number of copies N. In the
second stage, additional forms of disorder are incorporated as dimension zero
logarithmic operators, and the resulting actions have explicit forms in terms
of two scalar fields and a symplectic fermion. Under some assumptions, the
multi-fractal exponents are computed with the result q(1-q)/4 and q(1-q)/8 for
the QHT and SQHT respectively, and are within a few percent of numerical
estimates.

the dataset allows us to make measurements in many bins of cluster richness,
radius and redshift. We find that, within r_200 of clusters with mass above
3e13 h-1 M_sun, the luminosity function of both red and blue satellites is only
weakly dependent on richness. We further find that the shape of the satellite
luminosity function does not depend on cluster-centric distance for magnitudes
brighter than ^{0.25}M_i - 5log(h) < -19. However, the mix of faint red and
blue galaxies changes dramatically. The satellite red fraction is dependent on
cluster-centric distance, galaxy luminosity and cluster mass, and also
increases by ~5% between redshifts 0.28 and 0.2, independent of richness. We
find that BCG luminosity is tightly correlated with cluster richness, scaling
as L_{BCG} ~ M_{200}^{0.3}, and has a Gaussian distribution at fixed richness,
with sigma_{log L} ~ 0.17 for massive clusters. The ratios of BCG luminosity to
total cluster luminosity and characteristic satellite luminosity scale strongly
with cluster richness: in richer systems, BCGs contribute a smaller fraction of
the total light, but are brighter compared to typical satellites. This study
demonstrates the power of cross-correlation techniques for measuring galaxy
populations in purely photometric data.

Apart from being a superfluid, the CCS phase has properties of a solid, such as
a lattice structure and a shear modulus, and hence the ability to sustain
multipolar deformations in gravitational equilibrium. We construct equilibrium
configurations of hybrid stars composed of nuclear matter at low, and CCS quark
matter at high, densities. Phase equilibrium between these phases is possible
only for rather stiff equations of state of nuclear matter and large couplings
in the effective Nambu--Jona-Lasinio Lagrangian describing the CCS state. We
identify a new branch of stable CCS hybrid stars within a broad range of
central densities which, depending on the details of the equations of state,
either bifurcate from the nuclear sequence of stars when the central density
exceeds that of the deconfinement phase transition or form a new family of
configurations separated from the purely nuclear sequence by an instability
region. The maximum masses of our non-rotating hybrid configurations are
consistent with the presently available astronomical bounds. The sequences of
hybrid configurations that rotate near the mass-shedding limit are found to be

response to imposed test fields is solved with turbulent and mean motions
calculated from the momentum and continuity equations. The corresponding
results for the electromotive force are used to calculate turbulent transport
coefficients. The diagonal components of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity
tensor are found to be very close together, but their values increase slightly
with increasing shear and decrease with increasing rotation rate. In the
presence of shear, the sign of the two off-diagonal components of the turbulent
magnetic diffusion tensor is the same and opposite to the sign of the shear.
This implies that dynamo action from the shear--current effect is impossible,
except perhaps for high magnetic Reynolds numbers. However, even though there
is no alpha effect on the average, the components of the alpha tensor display
Gaussian fluctuations around zero. These fluctuations are strong enough to
drive an incoherent alpha--shear dynamo. The incoherent shear--current effect,

papers by Erd\H{o}s and Purdy in the early 1970s. In this paper we present new
results on such problems, concerning the number of triangles of the same area
that are spanned by finite point sets in the plane and in 3-space, and the
number of distinct areas determined by the triangles.
  In the plane, our main result is an $O(n^{44/19}) =O(n^{2.3158})$ upper bound
on the number of unit-area triangles spanned by $n$ points, which is the first
breakthrough improving the classical bound of $O(n^{7/3})$ from 1992. We also
make progress in a number of important special cases: We show that (i) For
points in convex position, there exist $n$-element point sets that span
$\Omega(n\log n)$ triangles of unit area. (ii) The number of triangles of
minimum (nonzero) area determined by $n$ points is at most ${2/3}(n^2-n)$;
there exist $n$-element point sets (for arbitrarily large $n$) that span
$(6/\pi^2-o(1))n^2$ minimum-area triangles. (iii) The number of acute triangles
of minimum area determined by $n$ points is O(n); this is asymptotically tight.
(iv) For $n$ points in convex position, the number of triangles of minimum area
is O(n); this is asymptotically tight. (v) If no three points are allowed to be
collinear, there are $n$-element point sets that span $\Omega(n\log n)$
minimum-area triangles (in contrast to (ii), where collinearities are allowed
and a quadratic lower bound holds).
  In 3-space we prove an $O(n^{17/7}\beta(n))= O(n^{2.4286})$ upper bound on
the number of unit-area triangles spanned by $n$ points, where $\beta(n)$ is an
extremely slowly growing function related to the inverse Ackermann function.
The best previous bound, $O(n^{8/3})$, is an old result from 1971.

neighbours and subject to an anharmonic local potential. The chain is assumed
weakly inhomogeneous. We look for small amplitude discrete breathers. The
problem is reformulated as a nonautonomous recurrence in a space of
time-periodic functions, where the dynamics is considered along the discrete
spatial coordinate. We show that small amplitude oscillations are determined by
finite-dimensional nonautonomous mappings, whose dimension depends on the
solutions frequency. We consider the case of two-dimensional reduced mappings,
which occurs for frequencies close to the edges of the phonon band. For an
homogeneous chain, the reduced map is autonomous and reversible, and
bifurcations of reversible homoclinics or heteroclinic solutions are found for
appropriate parameter values. These orbits correspond respectively to discrete
breathers, or dark breathers superposed on a spatially extended standing wave.
Breather existence is shown in some cases for any value of the coupling
constant, which generalizes an existence result obtained by MacKay and Aubry at
small coupling. For an inhomogeneous chain the study of the nonautonomous
reduced map is in general far more involved. For the principal part of the
reduced recurrence, using the assumption of weak inhomogeneity, we show that
homoclinics to 0 exist when the image of the unstable manifold under a linear
transformation intersects the stable manifold. This provides a geometrical
understanding of tangent bifurcations of discrete breathers. The case of a mass
impurity is studied in detail, and our geometrical analysis is successfully

to make inferences about the underlying structure of the spike train itself. We
first examine a number of different parametric and nonparametric estimators
(some known and some new), including the ``plug-in'' method, several versions
of Lempel-Ziv-based compression algorithms, a maximum likelihood estimator
tailored to renewal processes, and the natural estimator derived from the
Context-Tree Weighting method (CTW). The theoretical properties of these
estimators are examined, several new theoretical results are developed, and all
estimators are systematically applied to various types of synthetic data and
under different conditions.
  Our main focus is on the performance of these entropy estimators on the
(binary) spike trains of 28 neurons recorded simultaneously for a one-hour
period from the primary motor and dorsal premotor cortices of a monkey. We show
how the entropy estimates can be used to test for the existence of long-term
structure in the data, and we construct a hypothesis test for whether the
renewal process model is appropriate for these spike trains. Further, by
applying the CTW algorithm we derive the maximum a posterior (MAP) tree model
of our empirical data, and comment on the underlying structure it reveals.

reconstruction of transcriptional networks. However, Bayesian networks and many
other current reconstruction methods rely on assumptions that conflict with the
differential equations that describe transcriptional kinetics. Practical
approximations of kinetic models would enable inferring causal relationships
between genes from expression data of microarray, tag-based and conventional
platforms, but conclusions are sensitive to the assumptions made.
  Results: The representation of a sufficiently large portion of genome enables
computation of an upper bound on how much confidence one may place in
influences between genes on the basis of expression data. Information about
which genes encode transcription factors is not necessary but may be
incorporated if available. The methodology is generalized to cover cases in
which expression measurements are missing for many of the genes that might
control the transcription of the genes of interest. The assumption that the
gene expression level is roughly proportional to the rate of translation led to
better empirical performance than did either the assumption that the gene
expression level is roughly proportional to the protein level or the Bayesian
model average of both assumptions.

model contains detailed calculations of the Galactic potential and of the
feedback from the central supermassive black hole, and the spectro-photometric
model covers a wide range of stellar ages and metallicities. We followed the
evolution of bulges in the mass range 10^9 - 10^{11} Msun by scaling the star
formation efficiency and the bulge scalelength as in the inverse-wind scenario
for elliptical galaxies, and considering an Eddington limited accretion onto
the central supermassive black hole. We successfully reproduced the observed
black hole-host bulge mass relation. The observed nuclear bolometric luminosity
is reproduced only at high redshift or for the most massive bulges; in the
other cases, at z = 0 a rejuvenation mechanism is necessary. The black hole
feedback is in most cases not significant in triggering the galactic wind. The
observed high star formation rates and metal overabundances are easily
achieved, as well as the constancy of chemical abundances with redshift and the
bulge present-day colours. Those results are not affected if we vary the index
of the stellar IMF from x=0.95 to x=1.35; a steeper IMF is instead required in
order to reproduce the colour-magnitude relation and the present K-band
luminosity of the bulge.

through intermediate excited states during their migration to the ground state.
This is similar to excited state boson stars. Ground state oscillatons are then
studied in full 3D numerical relativity. Finding the appropriate gauge
condition for the dynamic oscillatons is much more challenging than in the case
of boson stars. Different slicing conditions are explored, and a customized
gauge condition that approximates polar slicing in spherical symmetry is
implemented. Comparisons with 1D results and convergence tests are performed.

damp out on a short timescale, enabling us to obtain the complete waveform.

comparison of the shape of the CMR in low and high-density regions, (3) an
analysis of the scatter of the CMR, and (4) an interpretation of the observed
colors with ages and metallicities from population synthesis models. We find
that the CMRs of nucleated (dE(N)) and non-nucleated dEs (dE(nN)) are
significantly different from each other, with similar colors at fainter
magnitudes (r > 17 mag), but increasingly redder colors of the dE(N)s at
brighter magnitudes. We interpret this with older ages and/or higher
metallicities of the brighter dE(N)s. The dEs with disk features have similar
colors as the dE(N)s and seem to be only slightly younger and/or less
metal-rich on average. Furthermore, we find a small but significant dependence
of the CMR on local projected galaxy number density, consistently seen in all
of u-r, g-r, and g-i, and weakly i-z. We deduce that a significant intrinsic
color scatter of the CMR is present, even when allowing for a distance spread
of our galaxies. No increase of the CMR scatter at fainter magnitudes is
observed down to r = 17 mag (Mr = -14 mag). The color residuals, i.e., the
offsets of the data points from the linear fit to the CMR, are clearly
correlated with each other in all colors for the dE(N)s and for the full dE
sample. We conclude that there must be at least two different formation
channels for early-type dwarfs in order to explain the heterogeneity of this

imprint in the energy spectrum, peculiar anisotropy patterns are expected
compared to the case of a pure astrophysical origin of the CGB. We take into
account the uncertainties in the dark matter clustering properties on
sub-galactic scales, deriving two possible anisotropy scenarios. A clear dark
matter angular signature is achieved when the annihilation signal receives only
a moderate contribution from sub-galactic clumps and/or cuspy haloes.
Experimentally, if galactic foregrounds systematics are efficiently kept under
control, the angular differences are detectable with the forthcoming GLAST
observatory, provided that the annihilation signal contributes to the CGB for a
fraction >10-20%. If, instead, sub-galactic structures have a more prominent
role, the astrophysical and dark matter anisotropies become degenerate,
correspondingly diluting the DM signature. As complementary observables we also
introduce the cross-correlation between surveys of galaxies and the CGB and the
cross-correlation between different energy bands of the CGB and we find that
they provide a further sensitive tool to detect the dark matter angular
signatures.

observations of the blazar Mrk421 at 2-60 keV X-rays (RXTE) and TeV gamma-rays
(Whipple and HEGRA) in 2001. The unprecedented quality of this dataset enables
us to establish firmly the existence of the correlation between the TeV and
X-ray luminosities, and to start unveiling some of its more detailed
characteristics, in particular its energy dependence, and time variability. The
source shows strong, highly correlated variations in X-ray and gamma-ray. No
evidence of X-ray/gamma-ray interband lag is found on the full week dataset (<3
ks). However, a detailed analysis of the March 19 flare reveals that data are
not consistent with the peak of the outburst in the 2-4 keV X-ray and TeV band
being simultaneous. We estimate a 2.1+/-0.7 ks TeV lag. The amplitudes of the
X-ray and gamma-ray variations are also highly correlated, and the TeV
luminosity increases more than linearly w.r.t. the X-ray one. The strong
correlation supports the standard model in which a unique electrons population
produces the X-rays by synchrotron radiation and the gamma-ray component by
inverse Compton scattering. However, for the individual best observed flares
the gamma-ray flux scales approximately quadratically w.r.t. the X-ray flux,
posing a serious challenge to emission models for TeV blazars. Rather special
conditions and/or fine tuning of the temporal evolution of the physical
parameters of the emission region are required in order to reproduce the
quadratic correlation.

following assumptions. It is assumed the punctures are labeled and divided into
nonempty sets of inputs and outputs. The inputs are marked by a tangent
direction and the outputs are weighted by nonnegative real numbers adding to
unity. It is assumed the gluing of inputs to outputs lands on the
pseudomanifold boundary of the cell decomposition and the entire pseudomanifold
boundary is decomposed into pieces by all such factorings. It is further
assumed that the action is equivariant with respect to the toroidal action of
rotating the markings. A main result of compactified string topology is the
  Theorem (closed strings): Each oriented smooth manifold has a 2D field theory
with a closed string compactification on the equivariant chains of its free
loop space mod constant loops. The sum over all surface types of the top
pseudomanifold chain yields a chain X satisfying the master equation dX + X*X =
0 where * is the sum over all gluings. This structure is well defined up to
homotopy.
  The genus zero parts yields an infinity Lie bialgebra on the equivariant

provide further elements of algebraic structure called a ""quantum Lie
bialgebra"" partially resolving the involutive identity.

the first step to a more complete theory. We note a second step for knots.

accurate to about 10%. As such, it is comparable to the accuracy of near-IR

have triggered primordial inflation in the early Universe. This mechanism,
based on quantum conformal symmetry, induces a logarithmic,
asymptotically-free, running of the gravitational coupling. If this evolution

sources. High energy neutrino telescopes attempt to resolve the problem by
detecting neutrinos whose directions are not scrambled by magnetic fields. The
key issue is whether the neutrino flux produced in cosmic ray accelerators is
detectable. It is believed that the answer is affirmative, both for the
galactic and extragalactic sources, provided the detector has kilometer-scale
dimensions. We revisit the case for kilometer-scale neutrino detectors in a
model-independent way by focussing on the energetics of the sources. The real
breakthrough though has not been on the theory but on the technology front: the
considerable technical hurdles to build such detectors have been overcome.
  Where extragalactic cosmic rays are concerned an alternative method to probe
the accelerators consists in studying the arrival directions of neutrinos
produced in interactions with the microwave background near the source, i.e.
within a GZK radius. Their flux is calculable within large ambiguities but, in
any case, low. It is therefore likely that detectors that are larger yet by
several orders of magnitudes are required. These exploit novel techniques, such

sequences and structures, thermodynamic details are biophysical features
different from but as important as structural features. As a succession of
previous research which revealed the important relationships between
thermodynamic features and miRNA maturization, this article applies
interspecies conservation of miRNA thermodynamics and structures to study miRNA
maturization. According to a thermodynamic and structural consensus principle,
miRBase is categorized by conservation subgroups, which imply various
functions. These subgroups are divided without the introduction of functional
information. This suggests the consistency between the two processes of miRNA
maturization and functioning. Different from prevailing methods which predict
extended miRNA precursors, a learning-based algorithm is proposed to predict
~22bp mature parts of 2780 test miRNA genes in 44 species with a rate of 79.4%.
This is the first attempt of a general interspecies prediction of mature
miRNAs. Suboptimal structures that most fit the consensus thermodynamic and
structural profiles are chosen to improve structure prediction. Distribution of
miRNA locations on corresponding pri-miRNA stem-loop structures is then
studied. Existing research on Drosha cleavage site is not generally true across
species. Instead, the distance between mature miRNA and center loop normalized
by stem length is a more conserved structural feature in animals, and the
normalized distance between mature miRNA and ss-RNA tail is the counterpart in
plants. This suggests two possibly-updating mechanisms of miRNA maturization in
animals and plants. All in all, conservations of thermodynamics together with
other features are shown closely related to miRNA maturization.

dynamics for overdoped thin films from x=0.17 to 0.20, which is clearly
distinguished from the 2D-XY critical dynamics. Through the systematic
measurements by changing the film thickness or by applying small magnetic
field, it was confirmed that this unusual behavior, which is referred as 2D-""U""

  Review D","Phys.Rev.D77:063526,2008","10.1103/PhysRevD.77.063526",,"astro-ph",,"  In paper I of this series we discuss how magnification bias distorts the 3D
correlation function by enhancing the observed correlation in the line-of-sight
(LOS) orientation, especially on large scales. This lensing anisotropy is
distinctive, making it possible to separately measure the galaxy-galaxy,
galaxy-magnification {\it and} magnification-magnification correlations. Here
we extend the discussion to the power spectrum and also to redshift space. In
real space, pairs oriented close to the LOS direction are not protected against
nonlinearity even if the pair separation is large; this is because nonlinear
fluctuations can enter through gravitational lensing at a small transverse
separation (or i.e. impact parameter). The situation in Fourier space is
different: by focusing on a small wavenumber $k$, as is usually done, linearity
is guaranteed because both the LOS and transverse wavenumbers must be small.
This is why magnification distortion of the galaxy correlation appears less
severe in Fourier space. Nonetheless, the effect is non-negligible, especially
for the transverse Fourier modes, and should be taken into account in
interpreting precision measurements of the galaxy power spectrum, for instance
those that focus on the baryon oscillations. The lensing induced anisotropy of
the power spectrum has a shape that is distinct from the more well known
redshift space anisotropies due to peculiar motions and the Alcock-Paczynski
effect. The lensing anisotropy is highly localized in Fourier space while
redshift space distortions are more spread out. This means that one could
separate the magnification bias component in real observations, implying that
potentially it is possible to perform a gravitational lensing measurement
without measuring galaxy shapes.

prospectively test time-dependent earthquake probability forecasts on their

calibrated on earthquake catalog data. But catalogs contain much observational
uncertainty. We study the impact of magnitude uncertainties on rate estimates
in clustering models, on their forecasts and on their evaluation by CSEP's
consistency tests. First, we quantify magnitude uncertainties. We find that
magnitude uncertainty is more heavy-tailed than a Gaussian, such as a
double-sided exponential distribution, with scale parameter nu_c=0.1 - 0.3.
Second, we study the impact of such noise on the forecasts of a simple
clustering model which captures the main ingredients of popular short term
models. We prove that the deviations of noisy forecasts from an exact forecast
are power law distributed in the tail with exponent alpha=1/(a*nu_c), where a
is the exponent of the productivity law of aftershocks. We further prove that
the typical scale of the fluctuations remains sensitively dependent on the
specific catalog. Third, we study how noisy forecasts are evaluated in CSEP
consistency tests. Noisy forecasts are rejected more frequently than expected
for a given confidence limit. The Poisson assumption of the consistency tests
is inadequate for short-term forecast evaluations. To capture the
idiosyncrasies of each model together with any propagating uncertainties, the
forecasts need to specify the entire likelihood distribution of seismic rates.

represent an evolutionary sequence of GMCs in terms of density increase leading
to star formation.Type I and II GMCs (starless GMCs and GMCs with HII regions
only, respectively) are at the young phase of star formation where density does
not yet become high enough to show active star formation and Type III GMCs

The high kinetic temperature correlated with \Halpha flux suggests that FUV

hyperbolic group, or more generally a 'negatively curved' group. Another result
says that the image of a group, which is boundedly generated by a finite set of
amenable subgroups, in a Gromov hyperbolic group has to be virtually cyclic.
Moreover, we show that any homomorphic image of an analogue of a higher rank
lattices in a Gromov hyperbolic group must be finite. These results extend to a
certain class of randomorphisms in the sense of Monod. We study the class of
groups which admit proper quasi-1-cocycles and show that it is closed under
l2-orbit equivalence.

using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which can be roughly categorised into
marginal and conditional methods. The former integrate out analytically the

Conditional methods impute the Dirichlet process and update it as a component
of the Gibbs sampler. Since this requires imputation of an infinite-dimensional
process, implementation of the conditional method has relied on finite
approximations. In this paper we show how to avoid such approximations by
designing two novel Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms which sample from the

avoided by the new technique of retrospective sampling. We also show how the
algorithms can obtain samples from functionals of the Dirichlet process. The

signs are introduced here and the concepts of information control and
functional equivalence classes in those systems are rigorously defined and used
to characterise when top down causation by feedback control happens, in a way
that is testable. The causally significant elements we consider are equivalence

different operations having the same outcome within the context of information

found a velocity gradient along a linear structure which could be perpendicular
to one of the outflows from the vicinity of mm1a. Since the size of the

separable. This is equivalent to showing that a 2-dimensional natural
Hamiltonian system on the hyperbolic plane possesses a second integral of
motion which is a quadratic polynomial in the momenta associated with a
2nd-rank Killing tensor. We examine the possibility that the integral is
preserved by the Hamiltonian flow on a given energy hypersurface only (weak
integrability) and derive the additional requirement necessary to have
conservation at arbitrary values of the Hamiltonian (strong integrability).
Using null coordinates, we show that the leading-order coefficients of the
invariant are arbitrary functions of one variable in the case of weak
integrability. These functions are quadratic polynomials in the coordinates in
the case of strong integrability. We show that for $(1+1)$-dimensional systems
there are three possible types of conformal Killing tensors, and therefore,
three distinct separability structures in contrast to the single standard
Hamilton-Jacobi type separation in the positive definite case. One of the new
separability structures is the complex/harmonic type which is characterized by
complex separation variables. The other new type is the linear/null separation
which occurs when the conformal Killing tensor has a null eigenvector.

density correlations in 3D systems. We compare the results with those of the
undepleted molecular field approximation and argue that the latter is most
reliable in fermionic systems and in lower dimensions. In the bosonic case we
compare the pairing mean-field results with exact calculations using the
positive-$P$ stochastic method and estimate the range of validity of the
pairing mean-field theory. Comparisons with similar first-principle simulations
in the fermionic case are currently not available, however, we argue that the
range of validity of the present approach should be broader for fermions than
for bosons in the regime where Pauli blocking prevents complete depletion of
the molecular condensate.

usage and configuration cost. We investigate two approaches to the

various methods for spare capacity allocation (SCA) to reroute disrupted
traffic. The comparative analysis shows the influence of the offered traffic
granularity and the physical network structure on the survivability cost: for
high bandwidth LSPs, close to the optical channel capacity, the multilayer
survivability outperforms the single layer one, whereas for low bandwidth LSPs
the single layer survivability is more cost-efficient. On the other hand,
sparse networks of low connectivity parameter use more wavelengths for optical
path routing and increase the configuration cost, as compared with dense
networks. We demonstrate that by mapping efficiently the spare capacity of the
MPLS layer onto the resources of the optical layer one can achieve up to 22%
savings in the total configuration cost and up to 37% in the optical layer
cost. Further savings (up to 9 %) in the wavelength use can be obtained with
the integrated approach to network configuration over the sequential one,
however, at the increase in the optimization problem complexity. These results
are based on a cost model with different cost variations, and were obtained for
networks targeted to a nationwide coverage.

the presence of other ""confusing"" stars in the field of view (FOV). We use a
simple ""phasor"" model as an aid to understanding the main effects of this
""confusion bias"" in single observations with SIM. This analytic model has been
implemented numerically in a computer code and applied to a selection of
typical SIM target fields drawn from some of the Key Projects already accepted
for the Mission. We expect that less than 1% of all SIM targets will be
vulnerable to confusion bias; we show that for the present SIM design,
confusion may be a concern if the surface density of field stars exceeds 0.4
star/arcsec^2. We have developed a software tool as an aid to ascertaining the
possible presence of confusion bias in single observations of any arbitrary
field. Some a priori knowledge of the locations and spectral energy
distributions of the few brightest stars in the FOV is helpful in establishing
the possible presence of confusion bias, but the information is in general not
likely to be available with sufficient accuracy to permit its removal. We
discuss several ways of reducing the likelihood of confusion bias in crowded

reviewed, and their effects on the present results are estimated. The simple

architecture for QIP and also for spin electronics (spintronics) applications.
While the charge of an electron is easily manipulated by charged gates, the
spin degree of freedom is well isolated from charge fluctuations. Inherently
small spin-orbit coupling and the existence of a spin-zero Si isotope
facilitate long single spin qubit coherence times. Here we consider the
relaxation properties of localized electronic states in silicon due to donors,
quantum wells, and quantum dots, including effects due to phonons and Rashba
spin-orbit coupling. Our analysis is impeded by the complicated, many-valley
band structure of silicon and previously unaddressed physics in silicon quantum
wells. We find that electron spins in silicon and especially strained silicon
have excellent decoherence properties. Where possible we compare with
experiment to test our theories. We go beyond issues of coherence in a quantum
computer to problems of control and measurement. Precisely what makes spin
relaxation so long in semiconductor architectures makes spin measurement so
difficult. To address this, we propose a new scheme for spin readout which has
the added benefit of automatic spin initialization, a vital component of
quantum computing and quantum error correction. Our results represent important
practical milestones on the way to the design and construction of a

detect various GRBs at z>6, and likely at z>10 if the trigger threshold is
decreased by a factor of ~2. Furthermore, we find that INTEGRAL and GLAST are
not the best tool to detect bursts at z>6: the former being limited by the
small FOV, and the latter by its hard energy band and relatively low
sensitivity. Finally, future missions (SVOM, EDGE, but in particular EXIST)
will provide a good sample of GRBs at z>6 in a few years of operation.

singlet Higgs boson phenomenology within both the mnSSM and NMSSM. It is found
that the loop-induced couplings represent an appreciable effect for the singlet
pseudoscalar in particular, and may dominate its decay modes in some regions of

collisionless shocks of supernova remnants (SNRs) are a natural way of
producing broad Balmer, Lyman and other lines of hydrogen. We wish to quantify
the importance of shock-induced, non-thermal hydrogen emission from SNRs in
young galaxies. We present a method to estimate the luminosity of broad ($\sim
1000$ km s$^{-1}$) Ly$\alpha$, Ly$\beta$, Ly$\gamma$, H$\beta$ and P$\alpha$
lines, as well as the broad and narrow luminosities of the two-photon
(2$\gamma$) continuum, from existing measurements of the H$\alpha$ flux. The
expected broad Ly$\alpha$ luminosity per object is at most $\sim 10^{36}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. In principle, broad, ``non-radiative'' Ly$\alpha$ from SNRs in young
galaxies can be directly observed in the optical range of wavelengths. However,
by taking into consideration the different rates between core collapse and
thermonuclear supernovae, as well as the duration we expect to observe such
Ly$\alpha$ emission from SNRs, we expect their contribution to the total
Ly$\alpha$ luminosity from $z \sim 3$ to 5 galaxies to be negligibly small
($\sim 0.001 %$), compared to the radiative shock mechanism described by Shull
& Silk (1979). Though broad, non-thermal Ly$\alpha$ emission has never been
observed, these photons are produced in SNRs and hence the non-radiative
Ly$\alpha$ luminosity is a part of the intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ spectrum of young
galaxies.

energy and dark matter fluids have been previously proposed. Following these
ideas, we consider a particular relation between dark densities, which allows
the possibility of a time varying equation of state for dark energy that
crosses the phantom divide at a recent epoch. Moreover, these densities decay
during all the evolution of the Universe, avoiding a Big Rip. We find also a
scaling solution, i.e. these densities are asymptotically proportional in the
future, which contributes to the solution of the coincidence problem.

  International Congress on Acoustics, Madrid : Espagne (2007)",,,"physics.class-ph",,"  Voiced sounds involve self-sustained vocal folds oscillations due to the
interaction between the airflow and the vocal folds. Common vocal folds
pathologies like polyps and anatomical asymmetry degrade the mechanical vocal
fold properties and consequently disturb the normal oscillation pattern
resulting in an abnormal sound production. Treatment of voice abnormalities
would benefit from an improved understanding between the pathology and the
resulting oscillation pattern which motivates physical vocal folds modelling.
The current study applies a theoretical vocal folds model to vocal folds
pathologies. The theoretical vocal folds model is validated using an
experimental set-up simulating the human phonatory apparatus. It consists in a
pressure reservoir, a self-oscillating latex replica of the vocal folds and an
acoustical resonator. The effects of pathologies are simulated by modifying the
replica's geometry, elasticity, and homogeneity under controlled experimental
conditions. In general, we observed a close match between measurements and
theoretical predictions, which is all the more surprising considering the
crudeness of the theoretical model

set-up using a deformable vocal folds replica is presented. The replica is
shown to be able to produce self sustained oscillations under controlled
experimental conditions. Therefore different parameters, such as those related
to elasticity, to acoustical coupling or to the subglottal pressure can be
quantitatively studied. In this work we focused on the oscillation fundamental
frequency and the upstream pressure in order to start (on-set threshold) either
end (off-set threshold) oscillations in presence of a downstream acoustical
resonator. As an example, it is shown how this data can be used in order to
test the theoretical predictions of a simple one-mass model.
