  definition of diff. ops discussed, minor corrections made. Final version, to
  appear in Selecta Math",,,,"math.QA math.AG math.RA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new formalism of differential operators for a general
associative algebra A. It replaces Grothendieck's notion of differential
operator on a commutative algebra in such a way that derivations of the
commutative algebra are replaced by DDer(A), the bimodule of double
derivations. Our differential operators act not on the algebra A itself but
rather on F(A), a certain `Fock space' associated to any noncommutative algebra
A in a functorial way. The corresponding algebra D(F(A)), of differential
operators, is filtered and gr D(F(A)), the associated graded algebra, is
commutative in some `twisted' sense. The resulting double Poisson structure on
gr D(F(A)) is closely related to the one introduced by Van den Bergh.
Specifically, we prove that gr D(F(A))=F(T_A(DDer(A)), provided A is smooth.
  It is crucial for our construction that the Fock space F(A) carries an
extra-structure of a wheelgebra, a new notion closely related to the notion of
a wheeled PROP. There are also notions of Lie wheelgebras, and so on. In that
language, D(F(A)) becomes the universal enveloping wheelgebra of a Lie
wheelgebroid of double derivations.
  In the second part of the paper we show, extending a classical construction
of Koszul to the noncommutative setting, that any Ricci-flat, torsion-free
bimodule connection on DDer(A) gives rise to a second order (wheeled)
differential operator, a noncommutative analogue of the BV-operator.

of the separability function based on the (Euclidean, flat) Hilbert-Schmidt
(HS) metric for the 27-dimensional convex set of quaternionic two-qubit
systems. The estimated function appears to be strongly consistent with our
previously-formulated Dyson-index (beta = 1, 2, 4) ansatz, dictating that the
quaternionic (beta=4) separability function should be exactly proportional to
the square of the separability function for the 15-dimensional convex set of
two-qubit complex (beta=2) systems, as well as the fourth power of the
separability function for the 9-dimensional convex set of two-qubit real
(beta=1) systems. In particular, we conclude that S_{quat}(mu) =(6/71)^2
((3-mu^2) mu)^4 =(S_{complex}(mu))^2. Here, mu =(rho_{11} rho_{44}/(rho_{22}
rho_{33})^(1/2), where rho is a 4 x 4 two-qubit density matrix. We can, thus,
supplement (and fortify) our previous assertion that the HS separability

demanding testing ground for the physics of massive galaxy formation. We
present the first self-consistent predictions for the abundance and properties
of LRGs in hierarchical structure formation models. We test two published
models which use quite different mechanisms to suppress the formation of
massive galaxies: the Bower et al. (2006) model, which invokes ``AGN-feedback''
to prevent gas from cooling in massive haloes, and the Baugh et al. (2005)
model which relies upon a ``superwind'' to eject gas before it is turned into
stars. Without adjusting any parameters, the Bower et al. model gives an
excellent match to the observed luminosity function of LRGs in the SDSS (with a
median redshift of z=0.24) and to their clustering; the Baugh et al. model is
less successful in these respects. Both models fail to match the observed
abundance of LRGs at z=0.5 to better than a factor of ~2. In the models, LRGs
are typically bulge dominated systems with M* of ~2x10^11 h^{-1} M_sun and
velocity dispersions of ~250 km s^{-1}. Around half of the stellar mass in the
model LRGs is already formed by z~2.2 and is assembled into one main progenitor
by z~1.5; on average, only 25% of the mass of the main progenitor is added
after z~1. LRGs are predicted to be found in a wide range of halo masses, a
conclusion which relies on properly taking into account the scatter in the
formation histories of haloes. Remarkably, we find that the correlation
function of LRGs is predicted to be a power law down to small pair separations,
in excellent agreement with observational estimates. Neither the Bower et al.
nor the Baugh et al. model is able to reproduce the observed radii of LRGs.

performing 3D MHD simulations of galactic discs subject to a spiral potential.
Recent hydrodynamic simulations have demonstrated the formation of inter-arm
spurs as well as spiral arm molecular clouds provided the ISM model includes a
cold HI phase. We find that the main effect of adding a magnetic field to these
calculations is to inhibit the formation of structure in the disc. However,
provided a cold phase is included, spurs and spiral arm clumps are still
present if $\beta \gtrsim 0.1$ in the cold gas. A caveat to two phase
calculations though is that by assuming a uniform initial distribution, $\beta
\gtrsim 10$ in the warm gas, emphasizing that models with more consistent
initial conditions and thermodynamics are required. Our simulations with only
warm gas do not show such structure, irrespective of the magnetic field
strength. Furthermore, we find that the introduction of a cold HI phase
naturally produces the observed degree of disorder in the magnetic field, which
is again absent from simulations using only warm gas. Whilst the global
magnetic field follows the large scale gas flow, the magnetic field also
contains a substantial random component that is produced by the velocity
dispersion induced in the cold gas during the passage through a spiral shock.
Without any cold gas, the magnetic field in the warm phase remains relatively
well ordered apart from becoming compressed in the spiral shocks. Our results
provide a natural explanation for the observed high proportions of disordered
magnetic field in spiral galaxies and we thus predict that the relative
strengths of the random and ordered components of the magnetic field observed
in spiral galaxies will depend on the dynamics of spiral shocks.

model for this process, we consider bubble solutions with de Sitter interiors,
obtained by patching together dS and Schwarzschild-AdS solutions along a bubble
wall. For an interesting subclass of these solutions the bubble wall reaches
spacelike infinity in the black hole interior. Including the effects of
perturbations leads to a null singularity emanating from this point. Such
solutions are interpreted as states in a single CFT, and are shown to be

allows to test the assumption that GRBs trace the star formation in the
Universe. Some authors have claimed that the rate of GRBs increases with cosmic
redshift faster than the star formation rate, whose cause is not known yet. In
this paper, I investigate the possibility for interpreting the observed
discrepancy between the GRB rate history and the star formation rate history by
the cosmic metallicity evolution, motivated by the observation that the cosmic
metallicity evolves with redshift and GRBs prefer to occur in low metallicity
galaxies. First, I derive a star formation history up to redshift z=7.4 from an
updated sample of star formation rate densities obtained by adding the new UV
measurements of Bouwens et al. and the new UV and infrared measurements of
Reddy et al. to the existing sample compiled by Hopkins & Beacom. Then,
adopting a simple model for the relation between the GRB production and the
cosmic metallicity history as proposed by Langer & Norman, I show that the
observed redshift distribution of the Swift GRBs can be reproduced with a
fairly good accuracy. Although the results are limited by the small size of the
GRB sample and the poorly understood selection biases in detection and
localization of GRBs and in redshift determination, they suggest that GRBs
trace both the star formation and the metallicity evolution. If the star
formation history can be accurately measured with other approaches, which is
presumably achievable in the near future, it will be possible to determine the

reliably measured from the ground. Our ground-based shear catalog achieves
sub-percent calibration bias compared to high resolution space-based data, for
galaxies brighter than i'~24.5 and with half-light radii larger than 1.8"". This
selection corresponds to a surface density of ~15 galaxies per sq arcmin
compared to ~71 per sq arcmin from space. On the other hand the survey speed of
current ground-based facilities is much faster than that of HST, although this
gain is mitigated by the increased depth of space-based imaging desirable for
tomographic (3D) analyses. As an independent experiment, we also reconstruct
the projected mass distribution in the COSMOS field using both data sets, and
compare the derived cluster catalogs with those from X-ray observations. The
ground-based catalog achieves a reasonable degree of completeness, with minimal
contamination and no detected bias, for massive clusters at redshifts
0.2<z<0.5. The space-based data provide improved precision and a greater
sensitivity to clusters of lower mass or at higher redshift.

Incompatibility between certain assumed properties of a Lyapounov variable and
semiboundedness of the spectrum of the Hamiltonian generating the quantum
dynamics led MPC to formulate their theory in Liouville space. In the present
paper it is proved, in a constructive way, that a Lyapounov variable can be
found within the standard Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics and,
hence, the MPC assumptions are more restrictive than necessary for the
construction of such a quantity. Moreover, as in the MPC theory, the existence
of a Lyapounov variable implies the existence of a transformation mapping the
original quantum mechanical problem to an equivalent irreversible
representation. In addition, it is proved that in the irreversible
representation there exists a natural time observable splitting the Hilbert
space at each t>0 into past and future subspaces.

water vapor. Water molecules in the gas phase selectively absorb T-rays at
discrete frequencies corresponding to their molecular rotational transitions.
This results in prominent resonances spread over the T-ray spectrum, and in the
time domain the T-ray signal is observed as fluctuations after the main pulse.
These effects are generally undesired, since they may mask critical
spectroscopic data. So, ambient water vapor is commonly removed from the T-ray
path by using a closed chamber during the measurement. Yet, in some
applications a closed chamber is not applicable. This situation, therefore,
motivates the need for another method to reduce these unwanted artifacts. This
paper presents a study on a computational means to address the problem.
Initially, a complex frequency response of water vapor is modeled from a
spectroscopic catalog. Using a deconvolution technique, together with fine
tuning of the strength of each resonance, parts of the water-vapor response are
removed from a measured T-ray signal, with minimal signal distortion.

Iwasaki's improved action, the calculations of $G_{\beta}(t_m)$ are carried out

calculations are done on more than 16 million configurations. The shear
viscosities increase roughly with $T^3$, and $\eta/s$ ratios are close to the
KSS lower bound in the region where $1<T/T_c<25$. Using these data the bulk
viscosities are also determined in the region where $T/T_c < 2$. They are
roughly one order of magnitude smaller than the shear viscosities. Our next
target is to determine the transport coefficients more precisely by a
maximum-entropy method. For this purpose the most effective method may be to
adopt an anisotropic lattice. In this report, we study the possible systematic
error due to the deformation of the anisotropic lattice at short distances.
Near the critical temperature, it is found that the standard action suffers
from a large deformation on the anisotropic lattice at short distances, while
the deformation is slight for Iwasaki's improved action. To reduce the

Ia event SN 2002cx. The expansion velocity of the supernova ejecta is found to
be lower than normal Type Ia events. The spectra obtained $\gsim 200$ days
since explosion do not show the presence of forbidden [\ion{Fe}{ii}],
[\ion{Fe}{iii}] and [\ion{Co}{iii}] lines, but are dominated by narrow,
permitted \ion{Fe}{ii}, NIR \ion{Ca}{ii} and \ion{Na}{i} lines with P-Cygni
profiles. Thermonuclear explosion model with Chandrasekhar mass ejecta and a
kinetic energy smaller ($\KE = 0.3 \times 10^{51} {\rm ergs}$) than that of
canonical Type Ia supernovae is found to well explain the observed bolometric
light curve. The mass of \Nifs synthesized in this explosion is $0.18 \Msun$.
The early spectra are successfully modeled with this less energetic model with
some modifications of the abundance distribution. The late spectrum is
explained as a combination of a photospheric component and a nebular component.

stratified hydrodynamic Keplerian flows: (i) the occurrence of a vortex mode,
as a consequence of strato-rotational balance, with its transient dynamics;
(ii) the generation of spiral-density waves (also called inertia-gravity or
$g\Omega$ waves) by the vortex mode through linear mode coupling in shear
flows. Methods. Non-modal analysis of linearized Boussinesq equations written
in the shearing sheet approximation of accretion disk flows. Results. It is
shown that the combined action of rotation and stratification introduces a new
degree of freedom -- vortex mode perturbation -- which is linearly coupled with
the spiral-density waves. These two modes are jointly able to extract energy
from the background flow and they govern the disk dynamics in the small-scale
range. The transient behavior of these modes is determined by the non-normality
of the Keplerian shear flow. Tightly leading vortex mode perturbations undergo
substantial transient growth, then, becoming trailing, inevitably generate
trailing spiral-density waves by linear mode coupling. This course of events --
transient growth plus coupling -- is particularly pronounced for perturbation
harmonics with comparable azimuthal and vertical scales and it renders the
energy dynamics similar to the 3D unbounded plane Couette flow case.
Conclusions. Our investigation strongly suggests that the so-called bypass
concept of turbulence, which has been recently developed by the hydrodynamic
community for spectrally stable shear flows, can also be applied to Keplerian
disks. This conjecture may be confirmed by appropriate numerical simulations
that take in account the vertical stratification and consequent mode coupling
in the high Reynolds number regime.

competing aggregation procedures achieving optimal convergence rates for each
of the (MS), (C) and (L) cases separately. Since these procedures are not
directly comparable with each other, we suggest an alternative solution. We
prove that all three optimal rates, as well as those for the newly introduced
(S) aggregation (subset selection), are nearly achieved via a single
``universal'' aggregation procedure. The procedure consists of mixing the
initial estimators with weights obtained by penalized least squares. Two
different penalties are considered: one of them is of the BIC type, the second
one is a data-dependent $\ell_1$-type penalty.

s-weak Poncelet trajectories, s = -1,0,...,d-2. The interrelations between
billiard dynamics, linear subspaces of intersections of quadrics and

to nonrenormalizable theories, in the Wilsonian sense. An interesting question
to ask of such trajectories is, given some fixed starting point in parameter
space, how the effective action at the effective scale, Lambda, changes as the
bare scale (and hence the duration of the flow down to Lambda) is changed. When
the effective action satisfies Polchinski's version of the Exact
Renormalization Group equation, we prove, directly from the path integral, that
the dependence of the effective action on the bare scale, keeping the
interaction part of the bare action fixed, is given by an equation of the same
form as the Polchinski equation but with a kernel of the opposite sign. We then
investigate whether similar equations exist for various generalizations of the
Polchinski equation. Using nonperturbative, diagrammatic arguments we find that
an action can always be constructed which satisfies the Polchinski-like
equation under variation of the bare scale. For the family of flow equations in
which the field is renormalized, but the blocking functional is the simplest
allowed, this action is essentially identified with the effective action at
Lambda = 0. This does not seem to hold for more elaborate generalizations.

temperatures. The system is a modified Lorentz gas in which the fixed
scatterers exchange energy with the gas of particles, and the thermostats are
modelled by two Nos\'e-Hoover thermostats applied at the boundaries of the
system. The transient fluctuation relation, which holds only for a precise
choice of the initial ensemble, is verified at all times, as expected. Times
longer than the mesoscopic scale, needed for local equilibrium to be settled,
are required if a different initial ensemble is considered. This shows how the
transient fluctuation relation asymptotically leads to the steady state
relation when, as explicitly checked in our systems, the condition found in
[D.J. Searles, {\em et al.}, J. Stat. Phys. 128, 1337 (2007)], for the validity
of the steady state fluctuation relation, is verified. For the steady state
fluctuations of the phase space contraction rate $\zL$ and of the dissipation
function $\zW$, a similar relaxation regime at shorter averaging times is
found. The quantity $\zW$ satisfies with good accuracy the fluctuation relation
for times larger than the mesoscopic time scale; the quantity $\zL$ appears to
begin a monotonic convergence after such times. This is consistent with the
fact that $\zW$ and $\zL$ differ by a total time derivative, and that the tails
of the probability distribution function of $\zL$ are Gaussian.

applied economics. The basic motivation resides in their capability of reducing
a large set of time series to only few indicators (factors). If the number of
time series is large compared to the available number of observations then most
information may be conveyed to the factors. This way low dimension models may
be estimated for explaining and forecasting one or more time series of
interest. It is desirable that outlier free time series be available for
estimation. In practice, outlying observations are likely to arise at unknown
dates due, for instance, to external unusual events or gross data entry errors.
Several methods for outlier detection in time series are available. Most
methods, however, apply to univariate time series while even methods designed
for handling the multivariate framework do not include dynamic factor models
explicitly. A method for discovering outliers occurrences in a dynamic factor
model is introduced that is based on linear transforms of the observed data.
Some strategies to separate outliers that add to the model and outliers within
the common component are discussed. Applications to simulated and real data
sets are presented to check the effectiveness of the proposed method.

al. (2006), 11 emission lines have experienced increases in flux by factors ~ 3
to 10, with the 775 eV line of O VIII showing the greatest increase; we have
observed 6 lines of Fe XVII and Fe XVIII previously unreported by XMM-Newton. A
two-shock model representing plasmas in non-equilibrium ionization is fitted to
the EPIC-pn spectra, yielding temperatures of ~ 0.4 and ~ 3 keV, as well as
elemental abundances for N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S and Fe. We demonstrate that the
abundance ratio of N and O can be constrained to less than ~20% accuracy.
Within the same confidence interval, the same analysis suggests that the C+N+O
abundance varies from ~ 1.1 to 1.4 X 10^-4. Normalizing our obtained abundances
by the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) values of Hughes, Hayashi & Koyama (1998),
we find that O, Ne, Mg and Fe are under-abundant, while Si and S are
over-abundant, consistent with the findings of Aschenbach (2007). Such a result
has implications for both the single-star and binary accretion/merger models
for the progenitor of SNR 1987A. In the context of the binary merger scenario
proposed by Morris & Podsiadlowski (2006, 2007), material forming the inner,
equatorial ring was expelled after the merger, implying that either our derived

first been applied to the orthogonal group in [J. Math. Phys. 43, 3342 (2002)],
and is here used to obtain similar integration formulas for the unitary and the
unitary symplectic group. The integration formulas turn out to be of similar
form. They are all recursive, where the recursion parameter is the number of
column (row) vectors from which the elements in the monomial are taken. This is
an important difference to other integration methods. The integration formulas
are easily implemented in a computer algebra environment, which allows to
obtain analytical expressions very efficiently. Those expressions contain the
matrix dimension as a free parameter.

typical magnitude limits z<26 and Ks<23.5 for most of the sample. About 8% of
the galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts; the remaining have well calibrated
photometric redshifts derived from the extremely wide multi-wavelength coverage
in 14 bands (from the U band to the Spitzer 8 \mu m band). We have derived a
catalogue of galaxies complete in rest-frame B-band, which has been divided in
two subsamples according to their rest-frame U-V colour (or derived specific
star formation rate, SSFR) properties. We confirm a bimodality in the U-V
colour and SSFR of the galaxy sample up to z\sim 3. This bimodality is used to
compute the LFs of the blue/late and red/early subsamples. The LFs of the
blue/late and total samples are well represented by steep Schechter functions
evolving in luminosity with increasing redshifts. The volume density of the LFs
of the red/early populations decreases with increasing redshift. The shape of
the red/early LFs shows an excess of faint red dwarfs with respect to the
extrapolation of a flat Schechter function and can be represented by the sum of
two Schechter functions. Our model for galaxy formation in the hierarchical
clustering scenario, which also includes external feedback due to a diffuse UV
background, shows a general broad agreement with the LFs of both populations,
the larger discrepancies being present at the faint end for the red population.
Hints on the nature of the red dwarf population are given on the basis of their
stellar mass and spatial distributions.

varying the roughness of the counter body in the fretting experiments. As
expected, experimental results show a large effect of the contact roughness on
the crack nucleation conditions. Rationalisation of the crack nucleation
boundary independently of the studied roughnesses was successfully obtained by
introducing the concept of effective contact area. This does show that the
fretting crack nucleation of the studied material can be efficiently described
by the local effective loadings inside the contact. Analytical prediction of

taking the infimum along the transverse subsets. When we have a closed

  Letters","Appl Phys Lett (2007) vol. 91 pp. 213103","10.1063/1.2816331",,"cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  Single-electron occupation is an essential component to measurement and
manipulation of spin in quantum dots, capabilities that are important for
quantum information processing. Si/SiGe is of interest for semiconductor spin
qubits, but single-electron quantum dots have not yet been achieved in this
system. We report the fabrication and measurement of a top-gated quantum dot
occupied by a single electron in a Si/SiGe heterostructure. Transport through
the quantum dot is directly correlated with charge-sensing from an integrated
quantum point contact, and this charge-sensing is used to confirm
single-electron occupancy in the quantum dot.

disjoint paths. We improve a lower bound on the linkedness of polytopes
slightly, which results in exact values for the minimal linkedness of 7-, 10-
and 13-dimensional polytopes.
  We analyze in detail linkedness of polytopes on at most (6d+7)/5 vertices. In
that case, a sharp lower bound on minimal linkedness is derived, and examples
meeting this lower bound are constructed. These examples contain a class of
examples due to Gallivan.
