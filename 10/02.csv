equation of state is derived. Compressibility allows for sound modes, but the
eddy viscosity in the shear mode is found to be the same as for incompressible
fluids. For two space dimensions (which is the relevant case for the dynamics
of relativistic heavy-ion collisions) the eddy viscosity in the shear mode is
negative, reducing the effective viscosity below its microscopic value. This
could explain the tiny viscosity found at RHIC. Implications for the
experimentally accessible elliptic flow coefficient at the LHC are speculated
on.

impulsive and occurs on very small cross-field spatial scales. A single coronal
loop could contain a hundred or more individual strands that are heated
quasi-independently by nanoflares. It is therefore an enormous undertaking to
model an entire active region or the global corona. Three-dimensional MHD codes
have inadequate spatial resolution, and 1D hydro codes are too slow to simulate
the many thousands of elemental strands that must be treated in a reasonable
representation. Fortunately, thermal conduction and flows tend to smooth out
plasma gradients along the magnetic field, so ""0D models"" are an acceptable
alternative. We have developed a highly efficient model called Enthalpy-Based
Thermal Evolution of Loops (EBTEL) that accurately describes the evolution of
the average temperature, pressure, and density along a coronal strand. It
improves significantly upon earlier models of this type--in accuracy,
flexibility, and capability. It treats both slowly varying and highly impulsive
coronal heating; it provides the differential emission measure distribution,
DEM(T), at the transition region footpoints; and there are options for heat
flux saturation and nonthermal electron beam heating. EBTEL gives excellent
agreement with far more sophisticated 1D hydro simulations despite using four
orders of magnitude less computing time. It promises to be a powerful new tool
for solar and stellar studies.

introducing mass-stripping effect on a main-sequence (MS) or slightly evolved

mass-stripping attenuates the rate of mass transfer from the companion to the
WD. As a result, quite a massive MS companion can avoid forming a common
envelope and increase the WD mass up to the SN Ia explosion. Including the
mass-stripping effect, we follow binary evolutions of various WD + MS systems
and obtain the parameter region in the initial donor mass - orbital period
plane where SNe Ia occur. The newly obtained SN Ia region extends to donor
masses of 6-7 M_\sun, although its extension depends on the efficiency of
mass-stripping effect. The stripped matter would mainly be distributed on the
orbital plane and form very massive circumstellar matter (CSM) around the SN Ia
progenitor. It can explain massive CSM around SNe Ia/IIn(IIa) 2002ic and 2005gj

superconducting phase of quark matter, showing that this phase of dense, but
not asymptotically dense, quark matter responds to shear stress as a very rigid
solid. This phase is characterized by a gap parameter $\Delta$ that is
periodically modulated in space and therefore spontaneously breaks
translational invariance. We derive the effective action for the phonon fields
that describe space- and time-dependent fluctuations of the crystal structure
formed by $\Delta$, and obtain the shear modulus from the coefficients of the
spatial derivative terms. Within a Ginzburg-Landau approximation, we find shear
moduli which are 20 to 1000 times larger than those of neutron star crusts.
This phase of matter is thus more rigid than any known material in the
universe, but at the same time the crystalline color superconducting phase is
also superfluid. These properties raise the possibility that the presence of
this phase within neutron stars may have distinct implications for their
phenomenology. For example, (some) pulsar glitches may originate in crystalline
superconducting neutron star cores.

states which exactly reproduce the meson mass spectrum found at zero

real importance for graph theorists. The mathematical details of the paper are
as follows: There is a combinatorial description of the partition function of
bosonic string theory. In this combinatorial description the string world sheet
is thought as simplicial and it is considered as a combinatorial graph. It can
also be said that we have embeddings of graphs in closed surfaces. The discrete
partition function which results from this procedure gives a sum over
triangulations of closed surfaces. This is known as the vacuum partition
function. The precise calculation of the partition function depends on
combinatorial calculations involving counting all non-isomorphic triangulations

function turns out to be very complicated, however we show the exact

computation of the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix. In this talk we
present an iterative method, first proposed by us in Ref. [1], which allows for
an efficient computation of the operator, even on large lattices. The starting
point is a Krylov subspace approximation, based on the Arnoldi algorithm, for
the evaluation of a generic matrix function. The efficiency of this method is
spoiled when the matrix has eigenvalues close to a function discontinuity. To
cure this, a small number of critical eigenvectors are added to the Krylov
subspace, and two different deflation schemes are proposed in this augmented
subspace. The ensuing method is then applied to the sign function of the
overlap Dirac operator, for two different lattice sizes. The sign function has
a discontinuity along the imaginary axis, and the numerical results show how
deflation dramatically improves the efficiency of the method.

large dynamic phases and that helicity flip contributions are unsuppressed in

high-redshift intergalactic medium (IGM) is through the shape of the red
damping wing of the Lya absorption line. We examine this method's effectiveness
in light of recent models showing that the IGM neutral fraction is highly
inhomogeneous on large scales during reionization. Using both analytic models
and ""semi-numeric"" simulations, we show that the ""picket-fence"" absorption
typical in reionization models introduces both scatter and a systematic bias to
the measurement of x_H. In particular, we show that simple fits to the damping
wing tend to overestimate the true neutral fraction in a partially ionized
universe, with a fractional error of ~ 30% near the middle of reionization.
This bias is generic to any inhomogeneous model. However, the bias is reduced
and can even underestimate x_H if the observational sample only probes a subset
of the entire halo population, such as quasars with large HII regions. We also
find that the damping wing absorption profile is generally steeper than one
would naively expect in a homogeneously ionized universe. The profile steepens
and the sightline-to-sightline scatter increases as reionization progresses. Of
course, the bias and scatter also depend on x_H and so can, at least in
principle, be used to constrain it. Damping wing constraints must therefore be
interpreted by comparison to theoretical models of inhomogeneous reionization.

photospheres dominates in the near-IR through the 3.6 micron IRAC band.
Twenty-five of 46 (54%) galaxy nuclei show red, mid-IR continua characteristic
of hot dust powered by ongoing star formation and/or accretion onto a central
black hole. We introduce alpha_{IRAC}, the spectral index of a power-law fit to
the 4.5-8.0 micron IRAC data, and demonstrate that it cleanly separates the
mid-IR active and non-active HCG nuclei. This parameter is more powerful for
identifying low to moderate-luminosity mid-IR activity than other measures
which include data at rest-frame lambda<3.6 micron that may be dominated by
stellar photospheric emission. While the HCG galaxies clearly have a bimodal
distribution in this parameter space, a comparison sample from the Spitzer
Nearby Galaxy Survey (SINGS) matched in J-band total galaxy luminosity is
continuously distributed. A second diagnostic, the fraction of 24 micron
emission in excess of that expected from quiescent galaxies, f_{24D}, reveals
an additional 3 nuclei to be active at 24 micron. Comparing these two mid-IR
diagnostics of nuclear activity to optical spectroscopic identifications from
the literature reveals some discrepancies, and we discuss the challenges of
distinguishing the source of ionizing radiation in these and other lower
luminosity systems. We find a significant correlation between the fraction of
mid-IR active galaxies and the total HI mass in a group, and investigate
possible interpretations of these results in light of galaxy evolution in the

large scale Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization with very high
sensitivity and control of systematics. The instrument will map over half the
sky with degree angular resolution in I, Q and U Stokes parameters, in four
frequency bands from 96 to 275 GHz. Spider's ultimate goal is to detect the
primordial gravity wave signal imprinted on the CMB B-mode polarization. One of
the challenges in achieving this goal is the minimization of the contamination
of B-modes by systematic effects. This paper explores a number of instrument
systematics and observing strategies in order to optimize B-mode sensitivity.
This is done by injecting realistic-amplitude, time-varying systematics in a
set of simulated time-streams. Tests of the impact of detector noise
characteristics, pointing jitter, payload pendulations, polarization angle
offsets, beam systematics and receiver gain drifts are shown. Spider's default
observing strategy is to spin continuously in azimuth, with polarization
modulation achieved by either a rapidly spinning half-wave plate or a rapidly
spinning gondola and a slowly stepped half-wave plate. Although the latter is
more susceptible to systematics, results shown here indicate that either mode
of operation can be used by Spider.

(M*-SFR) provides key constraints on the stellar mass assembly histories of
galaxies. For star-forming galaxies, M*-SFR is observed to be fairly tight with
a slope close to unity from z~0-2. Simulations of galaxy formation reproduce
these trends owing to the generic dominance of smooth and steady cold accretion
in these systems. In contrast, the amplitude of the M*-SFR relation evolves
markedly differently than in models. Stated in terms of a star formation
activity parameter alpha=(M*/SFR)/(t_H-1 Gyr), models predict a constant
alpha~1 out to redshifts z=4+, while the observed M*-SFR relation indicates
that alpha increases by X3 from z~2 until today. The low alpha at high-z not
only conflicts with models, but is also difficult to reconcile with other
observations of high-z galaxies. Systematic biases could significantly affect
measurements of M* and SFR, but detailed considerations suggest that none are
obvious candidates to reconcile the discrepancy. A speculative solution is
considered in which the stellar initial mass function (IMF) evolves towards
more high-mass star formation at earlier epochs. Following Larson, a model is
investigated in which the characteristic mass Mhat where the IMF turns over
increases with redshift. The observed and predicted M*-SFR evolution may be
brought into agreement if Mhat=0.5(1+z)^2 Mo out to z~2. Such evolution broadly
matches recent observations of cosmic stellar mass growth, and the resulting
z=0 cumulative IMF is similar to the paunchy IMF favored by Fardal et al to
reconcile the observed cosmic star formation history with present-day fossil
light measures. [abridged]

which has a column density near 5 * 10^{22} cm^{-2} and covers most of the
X-ray continuum source (covering fraction 96-100%). A high-ionization absorbing
component, which yields a narrow absorption feature consistent with Fe K XXVI,
is confirmed. A relativistically broadened Fe K alpha line is required in all
fits, even after the complex absorption is taken into account; an additional
partial-covering component is an inadequate substitute for the continuum
curvature associated with the broad Fe line. A narrow Fe K alpha emission line
has a velocity width consistent with the Broad Line Region. The low-ionization
absorber may be responsible for producing the narrow Fe K alpha line, though a
contribution from additional material out of the line of sight is possible. We
include in our model soft band emission lines from He- and H-like ions of N, O,
Ne and Mg, consistent with photo-ionization, though a small contribution from
collisionally-ionized emission is possible.

so by combining a 3D non-LTE molecular line radiative transfer code with
smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of galaxy mergers that
include prescriptions for star formation, black hole growth, a multiphase
interstellar medium (ISM), and the winds associated with star formation and
black hole growth. Our main results are: (1) Galactic winds can drive outflows
of masses ~10^8-10^9 Msun which may be imaged via CO emission line mapping. (2)
AGN feedback-driven winds are able to drive imageable CO outflows for longer
periods of time than starburst-driven winds owing to the greater amount of
energy imparted to the ISM by AGN feedback compared to star formation. (3)
Galactic winds can control the spatial extent of the CO emission in post-merger
galaxies, and may serve as a physical motivation for the sub-kiloparsec scale
CO emission radii observed in local advanced mergers. (4) Secondary emission
peaks at velocities greater than the circular velocity are seen in the CO
emission lines in all models. In models with winds, these high velocity peaks
are seen to preferentially correspond to outflowing gas entrained in winds,
which is not the case in the model without winds. The high velocity peaks seen
in models without winds are typically confined to velocity offsets (from the
systemic) < 1.7 times the circular velocity, whereas the models with AGN
feedback-driven winds can drive high velocity peaks to ~2.5 times the circular
velocity.

  accepted version","Astrophys.J.681:40-52,2008","10.1086/587450",,"astro-ph",,"  In the past decade, surveys of the stellar component of the Galaxy have
revealed a number of streams from tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies and globular
clusters. Simulations of hierarchical structure formation in LCDM cosmologies
predict that the dark matter halo of a galaxy like the Milky Way contains
hundreds of subhalos with masses of ~10^8 solar masses and greater, and it has
been suggested that the existence of coherent tidal streams is incompatible
with the expected abundance of substructure. We investigate the effects of dark
matter substructure on tidal streams by simulating the disruption of a
self-gravitating satellite on a wide range of orbits in different host models
both with and without substructure. We find that the halo shape and the
specific orbital path more strongly determine the overall degree of disruption
of the satellite than does the presence or absence of substructure, i.e., the
changes in the large-scale properties of the tidal debris due to substructure
are small compared to variations in the debris from different orbits in a
smooth potential. Substructure typically leads to an increase in the degree of
clumpiness of the tidal debris in sky projection, and in some cases a more
compact distribution in line-of-sight velocity. Substructure also leads to
differences in the location of sections of debris compared to the results of
the smooth halo model, which may have important implications for the
interpretation of observed tidal streams. A unique signature of the presence of
substructure in the halo which may be detectable by upcoming surveys is
identified. We conclude, however, that predicted levels of substructure are
consistent with a detection of a coherent tidal stream from a dwarf galaxy.

preserve the well defined character of the flux in the extremal case. The known

over a variable bottom, in a long wave asymptotic regime. We assume that the
bottom of the fluid region can be described by a stationary random process
$\beta(x, \omega)$ whose variations take place on short length scales and which
are decorrelated on the length scale of the long waves. This is a question of
homogenization theory in the scaling regime for the Boussinesq and KdV
equations. The analysis is performed from the point of view of perturbation
theory for Hamiltonian PDEs with a small parameter, in the context of which we
perform a careful analysis of the distributional convergence of stationary
mixing random processes. We show in particular that the problem does not fully
homogenize, and that the random effects are as important as dispersive and
nonlinear phenomena in the scaling regime that is studied. Our principal result
is the derivation of effective equations for surface water waves in the long
wave small amplitude regime, and a consistency analysis of these equations,
which are not necessarily Hamiltonian PDEs. In this analysis we compute the
effects of random modulation of solutions, and give an explicit expression for
the scattered component of the solution due to waves interacting with the
random bottom. We show that the resulting influence of the random topography is
expressed in terms of a canonical process, which is equivalent to a white noise
through Donsker's invariance principle, with one free parameter being the
variance of the random process $\beta$. This work is a reappraisal of the paper
by Rosales & Papanicolaou \cite{RP83} and its extension to general stationary
mixing processes.

of a class of many-fermion systems, indicative of a metal-insulator transition
of first order type, which arises solely from the competition between quenched
disorder and interparticle interactions. Our result is expected to be relevant
for sufficiently strong disorder in d = 3 spatial dimensions. Specifically, we
study a class of half-filled, Hubbard-like models for spinless fermions with
(complex) random hopping and short-ranged interactions on bipartite lattices,
in d > 1. In a given realization, the hopping disorder breaks time reversal
invariance, but preserves the special ``nesting'' symmetry responsible for the
charge density wave instability of the ballistic Fermi liquid. This disorder
may arise, e.g., from the application of a random magnetic field to the
otherwise clean model. We derive a low energy effective field theory
description for this class of disordered, interacting fermion systems, which
takes the form of a Finkel'stein non-linear sigma model [A. M. Finkel'stein,
Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 84, 168 (1983), Sov. Phys. JETP 57, 97 (1983)]. We analyze
the Finkel'stein sigma model using a perturbative, one-loop renormalization
group analysis controlled via an epsilon-expansion in d = 2 + epsilon
dimensions. We find that, in d = 2 dimensions, the interactions destabilize the
conducting phase known to exist in the disordered, non-interacting system. The
metal-insulator transition that we identify in d > 2 dimensions occurs for
disorder strengths of order epsilon, and is therefore perturbatively accessible
for epsilon << 1. We emphasize that the disordered system has no localized
phase in the absence of interactions, so that a localized phase, and the
transition into it, can only appear due to the presence of the interactions.

simple method for controlling a woofer DM in open loop provided the device
behaves in an approximately linear fashion. We have tested a mirror that we
believe meets our criterion, the ALPAO DM52 mirror. Using our open-loop method
we fit several test Kolmogorov wavefronts with the mirror and have achieved an
accuracy of approximately 25 nm rms surface deviation over the whole clear
aperture, and 20 nm rms over 90% of the aperture. We have also flattened the
mirror in open loop to approximately 11 nm rms residual.

flies could contribute a certain amount of neuromatrices indicating an imagery
function of a visual-computational system into computer graphics and storage
systems. The visual system involves the time aspect, whereas flies possess
faster pulses compared to humans' visual ability due to the E-field state on an
active fly's eye surface. This behaviour can be tested on a dissected fly
specimen at its ommatidia. Electro-optical contacts and electrodes are wired
through the flesh forming organic emitter layer to stimulate light emission,
thereby to a computer circuit. The next step is applying a threshold voltage
with secondary voltages to the circuit denoting an array of essential
electrodes for bit switch. As a result, circuit's dormant pulses versus active
pulses at the specimen's area are recorded. The outcome matrix possesses a
construction of RGB and time radicals expressing the time problem in
consumption, allocating time into computational algorithms, enhancing the
technology far beyond. The obtained formulation generates consumed distance
cons(x), denoting circuital travel between data source/sink for pixel data and
bendable wavelengths. Once 'image logic' is in place, incorporating this point
of graphical acceleration permits one to enhance graphics and optimize

propagator when compared to the tree-level behavior $1/p^2$ and a finite
infrared gluon propagator. However, the agreement between analytic and
numerical studies is only at the qualitative level in three and in four
dimensions. In particular, the infrared exponent of the ghost propagator seems
to be smaller than the one predicted analytically and the gluon propagator
seems to display a (finite) nonzero value at zero momentum. It has been argued

by the big bounces, which take place up to three times, once in each diagonal
direction, when the area or volume scale factor approaches the critical values

These two strategies give different evolutions: In one scheme, the effective
dynamics is independent of the choice of the finite sized cell prescribed to
make Hamiltonian finite; in the other, the effective dynamics reacts to the
macroscopic scales introduced by the boundary conditions. Both schemes reveal
interesting symmetries of scaling, which are reminiscent of the relational

matrix elements with four light quark masses, corresponding to pion mass values
of m_\pi = 330-670 MeV, while the dynamical strange mass is fixed at a value
close to physical, on (2.7 fm)^3 spatial volume. We found that our axial
charge, g_A, at the lightest mass exhibits a large deviation from the heavier
mass results. This deviation seems to be a finite-size effect as the g_A value
scales with a single parameter, m_\pi L, the product of pion mass and linear
spatial lattice size. The scaling is also seen in earlier 2-flavor dynamical
DWF and Wilson quark calculations. Without this lightest point, the three
heavier mass results show only very mild mass dependence and linearly
extrapolate to g_A=1.16(6). We determined the four form factors, the vector
(Dirac), induced tensor (Pauli), axial vector and induced pseudoscalar, at a
few finite momentum transfer values as well. At the physical pion mass the
form-factors root mean square radii determined from the momentum-transfer
dependence %of the form factors are 20-30% smaller than the corresonding

EOS has far-reaching consequences for numerous nuclear processes in both the

important quantitative elucidations of the fundamental processes related to
time dilation effects, and general relativity provides a deep analysis to
effects of time flow, such as in the presence of gravitational fields. Through
the special theory of relativity, time became intimately related with space,
giving rise to the notion of spacetime, in which both parameters cannot be
considered as separate entities. As time is incorporated into the proper
structure of the fabric of spacetime, it is interesting to note that general
relativity is contaminated with non-trivial geometries that generate closed
timelike curves, and thus apparently violates causality. The notion of
causality is fundamental in the construction of physical theories; therefore
time travel and its associated paradoxes have to be treated with great caution.
These issues are briefly analyzed in this review paper.

distributed video coding where, for decoding, error correction methods are
applied to improve predictions. Those error corrections sometimes fail which
results in decoded values worse than the initial prediction. Our code exploits
the fact that bit errors are relatively unlikely events: more than a few bit
errors in a decoded pixel value are rare. With a carefully designed counting
code combined with a prediction those bit errors can be corrected and sometimes
the original pixel value recovered. The error correction improves
significantly. Our new code not only maximizes the Hamming distance between
adjacent (or ""near 1"") codewords but also between nearby (for example ""near 2"")
codewords. This is why our code is significantly different from the well-known
maximal counting sequences which have maximal average Hamming distance.
Fortunately, the new counting code can be derived from Gray Codes for every
code word length (i.e. bit depth).

linearly coupled to a massless scalar field initially in the Minkowski vacuum.
Using the exact correlation functions we show that as soon as the coupling is
switched on one can see information flowing from the detector to the field and
propagating with the radiation into null infinity. By expressing the reduced
density matrix of the detector in terms of the two-point functions, we
calculate the purity function in the detector and study the evolution of
quantum entanglement between the detector and the field. Only in the ultraweak
coupling regime could some degree of recoherence in the detector appear at late
times, but never in full restoration. We explicitly show that under the most
general conditions the detector never recovers its quantum coherence and the
entanglement between the detector and the field remains large at late times. To
the extent this model can be used as an analog to the system of a black hole
interacting with a quantum field, our result seems to suggest in the prevalent
non-Markovian regime, assuming unitarity for the combined system, that black
hole information is not lost but transferred to the quantum field degrees of
freedom. Our combined system will evolve into a highly entangled state between
a remnant of large area (in Bekenstein's black hole atom analog) without any
information of its initial state, and the quantum field, now imbued with
complex information content not-so-easily retrievable by a local observer.

fgas measurements for a sample of ~500 hot, X-ray bright, dynamically relaxed

with a Dark Energy Task Force (DETF) figure of merit of 15-40, with the
possibility of boosting these values by 40 per cent or more by optimizing the
redshift distribution of target clusters. Such constraints are comparable to
those predicted by the DETF for other leading, planned dark energy experiments.
A future fgas experiment will be preceded by a large X-ray or SZ survey that
will find hot, X-ray luminous clusters out to high redshifts. Short `snapshot'
observations with the new X-ray observatory should then be able to identify a
sample of ~500 suitably relaxed systems. The redshift, temperature and X-ray
luminosity range of interest has already been partially probed by existing
X-ray cluster surveys which allow reasonable estimates of the fraction of
clusters that will be suitably relaxed for fgas work. Our analysis uses a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo method which fully captures the relevant degeneracies
between parameters and facilitates the incorporation of priors and systematic
uncertainties in the analysis. We explore the effects of such uncertainties for
scenarios ranging from optimistic to pessimistic. We conclude that the fgas
experiment will provide tight constraints on the mean matter and dark energy
densities, with a peak sensitivity for dark energy work at redshifts midway
between those of supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillation/weak
lensing/cluster number counts experiments. In combination, these experiments
should enable a precise measurement of the evolution of dark energy. (Abridged)

delay of microwave peaks relative to HXR peaks, loop-top microwave and
footpoint HXR sources, and a harder electron energy distribution inferred from
the microwave spectrum than from the HXR spectrum. In addition, we found that
the time profile of the spectral index of the higher-energy ($\gsim 100$ keV)
HXRs is similar to that of the microwaves, and is delayed from that of the
lower-energy ($\lsim 100$ keV) HXRs. We interpret these observations in terms
of an electron transport model called {\TPP}. We numerically solved the
spatially-homogeneous {\FP} equation to determine electron evolution in energy
and pitch-angle space. By comparing the behaviors of the HXR and microwave
emissions predicted by the model with the observations, we discuss the
pitch-angle distribution of the electrons injected into the flare site. We
found that the observed spectral variations can qualitatively be explained if
the injected electrons have a pitch-angle distribution concentrated

of the molecule-electrode contact. When a molecular junction weakly coupled to
external electrodes, charging effects do play an important role (Coulomb
blockade regime). In this regime, the non-equilibrium Green function is usually
substituted with master equation approaches, which prevents the density
functional theory from describing Coulomb blockade in non-equilibrium case.
Last year, we proposed an Ansatz to combine the non-equilibrium Green function
technique with the equation of motion method. With help of it, Coulomb blockade
was obtained by non-equilibrium Green function, and completely agrees with the
master equation results [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{76}, 045408 (2007)]. Here, by the
Ansatz, we show a new way to introduce Coulomb blockade correction to DFT
calculation in non-equilibrium case. And the characteristics of Coulomb
blockade are obtained in the calculation of a $toy$ molecule correctly.

distance d and, our approach, in a dual picture, naturally introduces a new
kind of quasiparticles - neutral fermions. Neutral fermion is a composite of
two merons of the same vorticity and opposite charge. For small d (i.e. in the
superfluid phase), neutral fermions appear as dipoles. At larger d dipoles
dissociate into the phase of the two decoupled Fermi-liquid-like states. This
scenario is relevant for the experimental situation where impurities lock
charged merons. In a translation invariant (clean) system, continuous creation
and annihilation of meron-antimeron pairs evolves the QHB toward a paired
phase. The quantum fluctuations fix the form of the pairing function to
g(z)=1/z^*. A part of the description of the paired phase is the 2D

minimal basis of maximally localized Wannier functions is applied both in the
central GW region and the leads. The importance of using a conserving, i.e.
fully self-consistent, GW self-energy is demonstrated both analytically and by
numerical examples. We introduce an effective spin-dependent interaction which
automatically reduces self-interaction errors to all orders in the interaction.
The scheme is applied to the Anderson model in- and out of equilibrium. In
equilibrium at zero temperature we find that GW describes the Kondo resonance
fairly well for intermediate interaction strengths. Out of equilibrium we
demonstrate that the one-shot G0W0 approximation can produce severe errors, in
particular at high bias. Finally, we consider a benzene molecule between
featureless leads. It is found that the molecule's HOMO-LUMO gap as calculated
in GW is significantly reduced as the coupling to the leads is increased,
reflecting the more efficient screening in the strongly coupled junction. For
the IV characteristics of the junction we find that HF and G0W0[G_HF] yield
results closer to GW than does DFT and G0W0[G_DFT]. This is explained in terms
of self-interaction effects and life-time reduction due to electron-electron
interactions.

An effective spin operator of the electric dipole moment is deduced
incorporating both nonrelativistic and relativistic terms. The nonrelativistic

redistribution of the local on-site charge density due to $pd$ covalency and
exchange coupling is believed to govern the multiferroic behaviour in 3d

obtain an asymptotic expansion of the resonances as the coupling constant
$\varkappa$ of the perturbation tends to zero. Further, under the assumption
that the Fermi Golden Rule holds true, we deduce estimates for the time
evolution of the resonance states with and without analyticity assumptions; in
the second case we obtain these results as a corollary of suitable Mourre
estimates and a recent article of Cattaneo, Graf and Hunziker \cite{cgh}. Next,
we describe sets of perturbations $V$ for which the Fermi Golden Rule is valid
at each embedded eigenvalue of $H$; these sets turn out to be dense in various
suitable topologies. Finally, we assume that $V$ decays fast enough at infinity
and is of definite sign, introduce the Krein spectral shift function for the
operator pair $(H+V, H)$, and study its singularities at the energies which
coincide with eigenvalues of infinite multiplicity of the unperturbed operator
$H$.

classification problems, we often impose a sparse structure in the SVM to
eliminate the influences of the irrelevant predictors. The lasso and other
variable selection techniques have been successfully used in the SVM to perform
automatic variable selection. In some problems, there is a natural hierarchical
structure among the variables. Thus, in order to have an interpretable SVM
classifier, it is important to respect the heredity principle when enforcing
the sparsity in the SVM. Many variable selection methods, however, do not
respect the heredity principle. In this paper we enforce both sparsity and the
heredity principle in the SVM by using the so-called structured variable
selection (SVS) framework originally proposed in Yuan, Joseph and Zou (2007).
We minimize the empirical hinge loss under a set of linear inequality
constraints and a lasso-type penalty. The solution always obeys the desired
heredity principle and enjoys sparsity. The new SVM classifier can be
efficiently fitted, because the optimization problem is a linear program.
Another contribution of this work is to present a nonparametric extension of
the SVS framework, and we propose nonparametric heredity SVMs. Simulated and
real data are used to illustrate the merits of the proposed method.

the distribution of persistence intervals turns out to be a powerlaw. We

have been investigated theoretically, in the presence of electron-phonon and
phonon-phonon interactions. Excitation of low frequency optical plasmons in the
metallic nanotube is responsible for the peak known as the Breit-Wigner-Fano
(BWF) line shape in the G-band Raman spectra. In a filled nanotube there is an
additional peak due to excitation of the phonon of the filling atom or
molecule. Positions, shapes and relative strengths of these Raman peaks depend
on the phonon frequencies of the nanotube and that of the filling atoms, and
strengths and forms of the plasmon-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions. For
example, filling atoms with phonon frequency close to the RBM frequency of the
nanotube may broaden and lower the RBM Raman peak to such an extent that it may
become barely visible. Hybridization between the G-bands and the filling atom
phonon is also strong when these two frequencies are close to each other and it
has important effects on the G-band and the BWF line shapes. When the phonon
frequency of the filling atom is far from the RBM and G-band frequencies, it
gives rise to a separate peak with modest effects on the RBM and G-band
spectra. Raman spectra of semiconducting unfilled and filled nanotubes have
similar behavior as those of metallic nanotubes except that normally they have
Lorentzian line shapes and do not show a BWF line shape. However, if a
semiconducting nanotube is filled with donor atoms, it is predicted that the
BWF type line shape may be observed near the RBM, or the G-band or the filling

detail. The study focusses particularly on quasi-stable colorless R-hadrons
originating through confinement of long-lived gluinos (with quarks,
anti-quarks, and gluons) produced in pp collisions at astrophysical sources.
Because of parton density requirements, the gluino has a momentum which is
considerable smaller than the energy of the primary proton, and so production
of heavy (mass ~ 500 GeV) R-hadrons requires powerful cosmic ray engines able
to accelerate particles up to extreme energies, somewhat above 10^{13.6} GeV.
Using a realistic Monte Carlo simulation with the AIRES engine, we study the
main characteristics of the air showers triggered when one of these exotic
hadrons impinges on a stationary nucleon of the Earth atmosphere. We show that
R-hadron air showers present clear differences with respect to those initiated
by standard particles. We use this shower characteristics to construct
observables which may be used to distinguish long-lived gluinos at the Pierre
Auger Observatory.

observe high energy cosmic neutrinos through the detection of the Cerenkov
light produced by up-going induced muons. Background sources are due to
atmospheric neutrinos as well as misreconstructed atmospheric muons. Additional
backgrounds inherent to the sea water environment come from 40K decay and
marine organisms' luminescence. While the contribution of the former is
expected to be constant at a level of about 45 kHz, the bioluminescence has
shown large time variations, with periods of very high activity, up to several

systematic comparison of these proposals is presented here in the framework of
a thermodynamically consistent excluded volume model which has been found to
describe the properties of hadron gas (HG) quite well. We find that the impact
of excluded volume correction is considerably large and the average energy per
hadron is 0.9 GeV, $n_b+n_{\bar b}$ stays nearly constant at 0.12/fm$^3$ and
the normalized entropy density $s/T^3\approx 6$ in this model. Moreover, these
values are independent of the beam or center-of-mass energy and also of the
target and beam nuclei. In ideal HG model these quantities show substantial
energy dependence. Further we have compared the predictions of various excluded
volume models in the precise determination of these criteria and we find that
the thermodynamically consistent excluded volume models give the best results.
In addition, we find another important criterion that entropy per hadron has a
constant value at 6 in our model. We hope that these findings will throw
considerable light on the expansion dynamics and the bulk thermodynamic
properties of the fireball before chemical freeze-out.

vector magnetograms can be used to determine fluxes of magnetic energy (the
Poynting flux) and helicity across the magnetogram layer, and to provide
time-dependent boundary conditions for data-driven simulations of the solar
atmosphere above this layer. Velocity components perpendicular to the magnetic
field are necessary both to compute these transport rates and to derive model
boundary conditions. Here, we discuss some possible approaches to estimating
perpendicular flows from magnetograms. Since Doppler shifts contain
contributions from flows parallel to the magnetic field, perpendicular
velocities are not generally recoverable from Doppler shifts alone. The
induction equation's vertical component relates evolution in $B_z$ to the
perpendicular flow field, but has a finite null space, meaning some ``null''
flows, e.g., motions along contours of normal field, do not affect $B_z$.
Consequently, additional information is required to accurately specify the
perpendicular flow field. Tracking methods, which analyze $\partial_t B_z$ in a
neighborhood, have a long heritage, but other approaches have recently been
developed. In a recent paper, several such techniques were tested using
synthetic magnetograms from MHD simulations. Here, we use the same test data to
characterize: 1) the ability of the induction equation's normal component, by
itself, to estimate flows; and 2) a tracking method's ability to recover flow
components that are perpendicular to $\mathbf{B}$ and parallel to contours of

at Keck II, for the massive star cluster ""B"" in the nearby dwarf irregular
galaxy NGC 1569. From spectral synthesis and equivalent width measurements we
obtain abundances and abundance patterns. We derive an Fe abundance of
[Fe/H]=-0.63+/-0.08, a super-solar [alpha/Fe] abundance ratio of +0.31+/-0.09,
and an O abundance of [O/H]=-0.29+/-0.07. We also measure a low 12C/13C = 5+/-1
isotopic ratio. Using archival imaging from the Advanced Camera for Surveys on
board HST, we construct a colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) for the cluster in
which we identify about 60 red supergiant (RSG) stars, consistent with the
strong RSG features seen in the H-band spectrum. The mean effective temperature
of these RSGs, derived from their observed colours and weighted by their
estimated H-band luminosities, is 3790 K, in excellent agreement with our
spectroscopic estimate of Teff = 3800+/-200 K. From the CMD we derive an age of
15-25 Myr, slightly older than previous estimates based on integrated
broad-band colours. We derive a radial velocity of -78+/-3 km/s and a velocity
dispersion of 9.6+/-0.3 km/s. In combination with an estimate of the half-light
radius of 0.20""+/-0.05"" from the HST data, this leads to a dynamical mass of
(4.4+/-1.1)E5 Msun. The dynamical mass agrees very well with the mass predicted
by simple stellar population models for a cluster of this age and luminosity,
assuming a normal stellar IMF. The cluster core radius appears smaller at
longer wavelengths, as has previously been found in other extragalactic young
star clusters.

Symanzik improved gauge action and Wilson fermions, which became quite popular

has considered the case of a coherent WIMP-nucleus interaction and then derived
the form of the annual modulation region in the plane of the WIMP-nucleon cross
section versus the WIMP mass, using a specific modelling for the channelling
effect. In the present paper we first show that light neutralinos fit the
annual modulation region also when channelling is taken into account. To
discuss the connection with indirect signals consisting in galactic antimatter,
in our analysis we pick up a specific galactic model, the cored
isothermal-sphere. In this scheme we determine the sets of supersymmetric
models selected by the annual modulation regions and then prove that these sets
are compatible with the available data on galactic antiprotons. We comment on
implications when other galactic distribution functions are employed. Finally,
we show that future measurements on galactic antiprotons and antideuterons will
be able to shed further light on the populations of light neutralinos singled

of Gamma=-1.43+/-0.18 in the mass range 0.8-60 Mo, in excellent agreement with
the Salpeter Initial Mass Function (IMF) in the solar neighborhood. Caveats on
the conversion of the PDMF to the IMF are discussed. The PDMF slope changes, as
a function of the radial distance from the center of the NGC 346 star cluster,
indicating a segregation of the most massive stars. This segregation is likely
primordial considering the young age (~3 Myr) of NGC346, and its clumpy
structure which suggests that the cluster has likely not had sufficient time to
relax. Comparing our results for NGC346 with those derived for other star
clusters in the SMC and the Milky Way (MW), we conclude that, while the star
formation process might depend on the local cloud conditions, the IMF does not
seem to be affected by general environmental effects such as galaxy type,
metallicity, and dust content.

flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) -- with the amount of magnetic flux
near strong-field polarity inversion lines (PILs) in active regions'
photospheric magnetic fields, as measured in line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms.
Practically, this empirical correlation holds promise as a space weather
forecasting tool. Scientifically, however, the mechanisms that generate strong
gradients in photospheric magnetic fields remain unknown. Hypotheses include:
the (1) emergence of highly twisted or kinked flux ropes, which possess strong,
opposite-polarity fields in close proximity; (2) emergence of new flux in close
proximity to old flux; and (3) flux cancellation driven by photospheric flows
acting fields that have already emerged. If such concentrations of flux near
strong gradients are formed by emergence, then increases in unsigned flux near
strong gradients should be correlated with increases in total unsigned magnetic
flux -- a signature of emergence. Here, we analyze time series of MDI
line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms from several dozen active regions, and
conclude that increases in unsigned flux near strong gradients tend to occur
during emergence, though strong gradients can arise without flux emergence. We
