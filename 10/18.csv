surrounding dark matter halos. We use cosmological adaptive mesh refinement
simulations that include self-consistent Population III star formation and
feedback to examine the properties of assembling early dwarf galaxies. Accurate
radiative transport is modeled with adaptive ray tracing. We include supernova
explosions and follow the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium. The
calculations focus on the formation of several dwarf galaxies and their
progenitors. In these halos, baryon fractions in 10^8 solar mass halos decrease
by a factor of 2 with stellar feedback and by a factor of 3 with supernova
explosions. We find that radiation feedback and supernova explosions increase
gaseous spin parameters up to a factor of 4 and vary with time. Stellar
feedback, supernova explosions, and H_2 cooling create a complex, multi-phase
interstellar medium whose densities and temperatures can span up to 6 orders of
magnitude at a given radius. The pair-instability supernovae of Population III
stars alone enrich the halos with virial temperatures of 10^4 K to
approximately 10^{-3} of solar metallicity. We find that 40% of the heavy
elements resides in the intergalactic medium (IGM) at the end of our
calculations. The highest metallicity gas exists in supernova remnants and very
dilute regions of the IGM.

near degeneracy between the dark matter neutralino and the tau sleptons,
radiative corrections may boost the gamma-ray yield by up to three or four
orders of magnitude, even for neutralino masses considerably below the TeV

annihilations, namely a sharp step at the mass of the dark matter particle.
Since this is a particularly interesting region for more constrained mSUGRA
models of supersymmetry, we use an extensive scan over this parameter space to
verify the significance of our findings. We also re-visit the direct
annihilation of neutralinos into photons and point out that, for a considerable

indirect dark matter searches than line signals.

  shortened",,,"CECS-PHY-07/20","gr-qc astro-ph cond-mat.stat-mech hep-ph hep-th",,"  In this paper a neutron star with an inner core which undergoes a phase
transition, which is characterized by conformal degrees of freedom on the phase
boundary, is considered. Typical cases of such a phase transition are e.g.
quantum Hall effect, superconductivity and superfluidity. Assuming the
mechanical stability of this system the effects induced by the conformal
degrees of freedom on the phase boundary will be analyzed. We will see that the
inclusion of conformal degrees of freedom is not always consistent with the
staticity of the phase boundary. Indeed also in the case of mechanical
equilibrium there may be the tendency of one phase to swallow the other. Such a
shift of the phase boundary would not imply any compression or decompression of
the core. By solving the Israel junction conditions for the conformal matter,
we have found the range of physical parameters which can guarantee a stable
equilibrium of the phase boundary of the neutron star. The relevant parameters
turn out to be not only the density difference but also the difference of the
slope of the density profiles of the two phases. The values of the parameters
which guarantee the stability turn out to be in a phenomenologically reasonable
range. For the parameter values where the the phase boundary tends to move, a
possible astrophysical consequence related to sudden small changes of the
moment of inertia of the star is briefly discussed.

solutions, and explore the effects of different boundary conditions for the
viscoelastic stress. These are needed because the equations of motion are
inherently non-local and include ``diffusive'' or square-gradient terms. Using
the diffusive Johnson-Segalman model and a variant of the Rolie-Poly model for
entangled micelles or polymer solutions, we study the interplay between
different boundary conditions and the intrinsic stress gradient imposed by the
flow geometry. We consider prescribed gradient (Neumann) or value (Dirichlet)
of the viscoelastic stress tensor at the boundary, as well as mixed boundary
conditions in which an anchoring strength competes with the gradient
contribution to the stress dynamics. We find that hysteresis during shear rate
sweeps is suppressed if the boundary conditions favor the state that is induced
by the sweep. For example, if the boundaries favor the high shear rate phase
then hysteresis is suppressed at the low shear rate edges of the stress
plateau. If the boundaries favor the low shear rate state, then the high shear
rate band can lie in the center of the flow cell, leading to a three-band
configuration. Sufficiently strong stress gradients due to curved flow
geometries, such as that of cylindrical Couette flow, can convert this to a
two-band state by forcing the high shear rate phase against the wall of higher
stress, and can suppress the hysteresis loop observed during a shear rate
sweep.

solution to the information crisis of prebiotic evolution, triggered by the

of the templates it holds in, could resolve this crisis provided that $d$ is
made sufficiently large. Here we review the prototypical package model of
Niesert et al. 1981 which guarantees the greatest possible region of viability
of the protocell population, and show that this model, and hence the entire
package approach, does not resolve the information crisis. This is so because
to secure survival the total information content of the protocell, $Ld$, must
tend to a constant value that depends only on the spontaneous error rate per
nucleotide of the template replication mechanism. As a result, an increase of
$d$ must be followed by a decrease of $L$ to ensure the protocell viability, so
that the net information gain is null.

importance in astrophysics. Modelling this quantity in general is made
difficult by the fact that it depends on the 7-dimensional space of parameters
characterizing the two initial black holes. However, in special cases, when
symmetries can be exploited, the description can become simpler. For black-hole
binaries with unequal masses but with equal spins which are aligned with the
orbital angular momentum, we show that the use of recent simulations and basic
but exact constraints derived from the extreme mass-ratio limit allow to model
this quantity with a simple analytic expression. Despite the simple dependence,
the expression models very accurately all of the available estimates, with
errors of a couple of percent at most. We also discuss how to use the fit to
predict when a Schwarzschild BH is produced by the merger of two spinning BHs,
when the total angular momentum of the spacetime ``flips'' sign, or under what
conditions the final BH is ``spun-up'' by the merger. Finally, suggest an
extension of the fit to include unequal-spin binaries, thus potentially
providing a complete description of the final spin from the coalescence of
generic black-hole binaries with spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum.

  Accepted for publication in ApJ Letter",,"10.1086/524408",,"astro-ph",,"  It has been suggested that fossil groups could be the cannibalized remains of
compact groups, that lost energy through tidal friction. However, in the nearby
universe, compact groups which are close to the merging phase and display a
wealth of interacting features (such as HCG 31 and HCG 79) have very low
velocity dispersions and poor neighborhoods, unlike the massive, cluster-like
fossil groups studied to date. In fact, known z=0 compact groups are very
seldom embedded in massive enough structures which may have resembled the
intergalactic medium of fossil groups. In this paper we study the dynamical
properties of CG6, a massive compact group at z=0.220 that has several
properties in common with known fossil groups. We report on new g' and i'
imaging and multi-slit spectroscopic performed with GMOS on Gemini South. The
system has 20 members, within a radius of 1 h_70^-1 Mpc, a velocity dispersion
of 700 km/s and has a mass of 1.8 x 10^14 h_70^-1 Msun, similar to that of the
most massive fossil groups known. The merging of the four central galaxies in
this group would form a galaxy with magnitude M_r' ~ -23.4, typical for
first-ranked galaxies of fossil groups. Although nearby compact groups with
similar properties to CG 6 are rare, we speculate that such systems occurred
more frequently in the past and they may have been the precursors of fossil
groups.

environments of this type of source, including multiple continuum emission
components (a hot component with T > 700 K and a warm component with T ~ 180 K)
with apparent silicate absorption features, numerous HI recombination lines,
many forbidden ionic lines of low ionization potentials, and pure rotational H2
lines. This indicates that both sources have hot and warm circumstellar dust,
ionized stellar winds, extended low-density ionized regions, and
photo-dissociated regions. It appears difficult to attribute the total optical
extinction of both sources to the hot and warm dust components, which suggests
that there could be an otherwise observable colder dust component responsible
for the most of the optical extinction and silicate absorption features. The
observed mid-infrared spectra are similar to those from Luminous Blue

represent a previously unknown evolutionary phase of X-ray binaries with

above 70 K. This property of present samples allowed to evaluate the ratio
between an average grain size and the magnetic field penetration depth lambda.
Furthermore, at temperatures T > 85 K, using low-field magnetization
measurements, we could evaluate the temperature dependence of lambda, which
turned out to be very close to predictions of the conventional Ginzburg-Landau
theory. Although present samples consisted of randomly oriented grains,
specifics of magnetization measurements allowed for evaluation of lambda_ab(T).
Good agreement between our estimation of the grain size with the real sample
structure provides evidence for the validity of this analysis of magnetization
data. Measurements of equilibrium magnetization in high magnetic fields were
used for evaluation of Hc2(T). At temperatures close to T_c, the Hc2(T)
dependence turned out to be linear in agreement with the Ginzburg-Landau
theory. The value of temperature, at which Hc2 vanishes, coincides with the

of rotation than in other directions. Consequently, our previously published
asymptotic approximation to the value of this field outside the equatorial
plane breaks down as the line of sight approaches a direction normal to the
rotation axis, i.e., is nonuniform with respect to the polar angle. Here we
employ an alternative asymptotic expansion to show that, though having a rate
of decay with frequency (mu) that is by a factor of order mu^(2/3) slower, the
equatorial radiation field has the same dependence on distance as the
nonspherically decaying component of the generated field in other directions:
it, too, diminishes as the inverse square root of the distance from its source.
We also briefly discuss the relevance of these results to the giant pulses
received from pulsars: the focused, nonspherically decaying pulses that arise
from a superluminal polarization current in a highly magnetized plasma have a

ultracool dwarfs we present simultaneous radio, X-ray, UV, and optical
observations of LSR1835+32 (M8.5), and simultaneous X-ray and UV observations
of VB10 (M8), both with a duration of about 9 hours. LSR1835+32 exhibits
persistent radio emission and H-alpha variability on timescales of ~0.5-2 hr.
The detected UV flux is consistent with photospheric emission, and no X-ray
emission is detected to a deep limit of L_X/L_bol<10^-5.7. The H-alpha and
radio emission are temporally uncorrelated, and the ratio of radio to X-ray
luminosity exceeds the correlation seen in F-M6 stars by >2x10^4. Similarly,
L_Halpha/L_X>10 is at least 30 times larger than in early M dwarfs, and
eliminates coronal emission as the source of chromospheric heating. The lack of
radio variability during four rotations of LSR1835+32 requires a uniform
stellar-scale field of ~10 G, and indicates that the H-alpha variability is
dominated by much smaller scales, <10% of the chromospheric volume. VB10, on
the other hand, shows correlated flaring and quiescent X-ray and UV emission,
similar to the behavior of early M dwarfs. Delayed and densely-sampled optical
spectra exhibit a similar range of variability amplitudes and timescales to
those seen in the X-rays and UV, with L_Halpha/L_X~1. Along with our previous
observations of the M8.5 dwarf TVLM513-46546 we conclude that late M dwarfs
exhibit a mix of activity patterns, which points to a transition in the
structure and heating of the outer atmosphere by large-scale magnetic fields.
We find that rotation may play a role in generating the fields as evidenced by
a tentative correlation between radio activity and rotation velocity. The X-ray
emission, however, shows evidence for super-saturation at vsini>25 km/s.

25.2 AB. Stacking analysis reveals that the average stellar population of the
IRAC-undetected sample has an age of ~ 200 Myr and a mass of ~ 3x10^8 solar
masses, consistent with the expectation that LAEs are mostly young and low-mass
galaxies. On the other hand, the IRAC-detected LAEs are on average
significantly older and more massive, with an average age > 1 Gyr and mass ~
10^10 solar masses. Comparing the IRAC colors and magnitudes of the LAEs to z ~
3 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) shows that the IRAC-detected LAEs lie at the
faint blue end of the LBG color-magnitude distribution, suggesting that
IRAC-detected LAEs may be the low mass extension of the LBG population. We also
present tentative evidence for a small fraction (~ 5%) of obscured AGN within
the LAE sample. Our results suggest that LAEs posses a wide range of ages and
masses. Additionally, the presence of evolved stellar populations inside LAEs
suggests that the Lyman-alpha luminous phase of galaxies may either be a
long-lasting or recurring phenomenon.

period spacings overestimates the stellar mass by about 0.06 Mo as compared

several features of the jets can be understood by adopting the picture of a
two-component outflow, wherein a central stellar component around the jet axis
is surrounded by an extended disk-wind. The precise contribution of each
component may depend on the intrinsic physical properties of the YSO-disk
system as well as its evolutionary stage. In this context, the present article
starts a systematic investigation of two-component jet models via
time-dependent simulations of two prototypical and complementary analytical
solutions, each closely related to the properties of stellar-outflows and
disk-winds. These models describe a meridionally and a radially self-similar
exact solution of the steady-state, ideal hydromagnetic equations,
respectively. By using the PLUTO code to carry out the simulations, the study
focuses on the topological stability of each of the two analytical solutions,
which are successfully extended to all space by removing their singularities.
In addition, their behavior and robustness over several physical and numerical
modifications is extensively examined. It is found that radially self-similar
solutions (disk-winds) always reach a final steady-state while maintaining all
their well-defined properties. The different ways to replace the singular part
of the solution around the symmetry axis, being a first approximation towards a
two-component outflow, lead to the appearance of a shock at the super-fast
domain corresponding to the fast magnetosonic separatrix surface. Conversely,
the asymptotic configuration and the stability of meridionally self-similar
models (stellar-winds) is related to the heating processes at the base of the
wind.

identify this force with inertia. At very low accelerations, our inertial law
deviates slightly from that of Newton, yielding a testable prediction that may

disease spread within a social setting. These components are, the underlying
contact structure among individuals that determines the pattern of disease
transmission; and the evolution of this pattern over time. Mathematical models
of infectious diseases, which are in principle analytically tractable, use two
general approaches to incorporate these elements. The first approach, generally
known as compartmental modeling, addresses the time evolution of disease spread
at the expense of simplifying the pattern of transmission. On the other hand,
the second approach uses network theory to incorporate detailed information
pertaining to the underlying contact structure among individuals. However,
while providing accurate estimates on the final size of outbreaks/epidemics,
this approach, in its current formalism, disregards the progression of time
during outbreaks. So far, the only alternative that enables the integration of
both aspects of disease spread simultaneously has been to abandon the
analytical approach and rely on computer simulations. We offer a new analytical
framework based on percolation theory, which incorporates both the complexity
of contact network structure and the time progression of disease spread.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework is equally effective on finite-
and ""infinite""-size networks. Application of this formalism is not limited to
disease spread; it can be equally applied to similar percolation phenomena on
networks in other areas in science and technology.

this material is an unexpected but very promising result that needs to be
further investigated. Since magnetism is assumed to arise from the exchange
interaction between the Fe and Cr cations, the magnetic behaviour is strongly
dependent on both their ordering and the distance between them. We present here
the successful synthesis of epitaxial Bi2FexCryO6 (BFCO x/y) films grown on
SrTiO3 substrates using dual crossed beam pulsed laser deposition. The crystal
structure of the films has different types of (111)-oriented superstructures
depending on the deposition conditions. The multiferroic character of BFCO
(x/y) films is proven by the presence of both ferroelectric and magnetic
hysteresis at room temperature. The oxidation state of Fe and Cr ions in the
films is shown to be 3+ only and the difference in macroscopic magnetization
with Fe/Cr ratio composition could only be due to ordering of the Cr3+ and Fe3+
cations therefore to the modification of the exchange interaction between them.

photon diffusion of shock-deposited thermal energy. The distinguishing property
of the model is that the large ``stellar'' radius of 160 AU required to prevent
adiabatic losses is not the true stellar radius, but rather, the radius of an
opaque, unbound circumstellar envelope, created when 10 Msun was ejected in the
decade before the supernova in an eruption analogous to that of eta Carinae.
The supernova light is produced primarily by diffusion of thermal energy
following the passage of the blast wave through this shell. This model differs
from traditional models of supernova debris interacting with external CSM in
that here the shell is optically thick and the escape of radiation is delayed.
We show that any model attempting to account for SN2006gy's huge luminosity
with radiation emitted by ongoing CSM interaction fails for the following basic
reason: the CSM density required to achieve the observed luminosity makes the
same circumstellar envelope opaque, forcing a thermal diffusion solution. In
our model, the weaker CSM interaction giving rise to SN2006gy's characteristic
Type IIn spectrum and soft X-rays is not linked to the power source of the
visual continuum; instead, it arises after the blast wave breaks free of the
opaque shell into the surrounding wind. While a simple diffusion model can
explain the gross properties of the early light curve of SN2006gy, it predicts
that the light curve must plummet rapidly at late-times, unless an additional
power source is present.

large masses of evolved massive stars like LBVs and WNH stars, WR stars in
lower metallicity environments, observed rotation rates of massive stars at
different metallicity, supernovae that seem to defy expectations of high
mass-loss rates in stellar evolution, and other clues. I pay particular
attention to the role of feedback that would result from higher mass-loss
rates, driving the star to the Eddington limit too particular attention to the
role of feedback that would result from higher mass-loss rates, driving the
star to the Eddington limit too soon, and therefore making higher rates appear
highly implausible. Some of these arguments by themselves may have more than

so far, and potential explanations for its energy demands have implications for
galactic chemical evolution and the deaths of the first stars. It remained
bright for over 200 days, longer than any normal supernova, and it radiated
more than 1e51 ergs of luminous energy at visual wavelengths. I argue that this
Type IIn supernova was probably the explosion of an extremely massive star like
Eta Carinae that retained its hydrogen envelope when it exploded, having
suffered relatively little mass loss during its lifetime. That this occurred at
roughly Solar metallicity challenges current paradigms for mass loss in
massive-star evolution. I explore a few potential explanations for SN2006gy's
power source, involving either circumstellar interaction, or instead, the decay
of 56Ni. If SN 2006gy was powered by the conversion of shock energy into light,
then the conditions must be truly extraordinary and traditional interaction
models don't work. If SN 2006gy was powered by radioactive decay, then the
uncomfortably huge 56Ni mass requires that the star exploded as a pair
instability supernova. The mere possibility of this makes SN 2006gy
interesting, especially at this meeting, because it is the first good candidate
for a genuine pair instability supernova.

static plane symmetric interior structure the expectation values in the region

For a conformally coupled massless scalar the brane induced part in the vacuum
energy-momentum tensor vanishes. In the limit of strong gravitational fields
the brane induced parts are exponentially suppressed for points not too close

orbital parameters we report for the first time a precise estimate of the spin
frequency and of the spin frequency derivative. The phase delays of the pulse
profile show a strong erratic behavior superposed to what appears as a global
spin-up trend. The erratic behavior of the pulse phases is strongly related to
rapid variations of the light curve, making it very difficult to fit these
phase delays with a simple law. As in previous cases, we have therefore
analyzed separately the phase delays of the first harmonic and of the second
harmonic of the spin frequency, finding that the phases of the second harmonic
are far less affected by the erratic behavior. In the hypothesis that the
second harmonic pulse phase delays are a good tracer of the spin frequency
evolution we give for the first time a estimation of the spin frequency
derivative in this source. The source shows a clear spin-up of $\dot \nu =
2.5(7) \times 10^{-14}$ Hz sec$^{-1}$ (1 $\sigma$ confidence level). The
largest source of uncertainty in the value of the spin-up rate is given by the
uncertainties on the source position in the sky. We discuss this systematics on
the spin frequency and its derivative.

variety of applications when the number $K$ of explanatory variables
$(x_1,...,x_K)$ is possibly much larger than the sample size $n$. For
generalized linear models, if most of the $x_j$'s have very small effects on
the response $y$, we show that it is possible to use Bayesian variable
selection to reduce overfitting caused by the curse of dimensionality $K\gg n$.
In this approach a suitable prior can be used to choose a few out of the many
$x_j$'s to model $y$, so that the posterior will propose probability densities
$p$ that are ``often close'' to the true density $p^*$ in some sense. The
closeness can be described by a Hellinger distance between $p$ and $p^*$ that
scales at a power very close to $n^{-1/2}$, which is the ``finite-dimensional
rate'' corresponding to a low-dimensional situation. These findings extend some

data points were produced with differential photometry in a 52x52' (0.75 deg^2)
field centered on the cluster core, but extending well beyond. Taking into
account the size of transit signals as a function of stellar radius, 45,406
stars have suitable photometric accuracy (<=0.045 mag to V=19.5) to search for
transits. Of this sample, 31,000 stars are expected to be main sequence cluster
members. All stars, both cluster and foreground, were subjected to a rigorous
search for transit signatures; none were found. Extensive Monte Carlo
simulations based on our actual data set allows us to determine the sensitivity
of our survey to planets with radii ~1.5R_Jup, and thus place statistical upper
limits on their occurrence frequency 'F'. Smaller planets are undetectable in
our data. At 95% confidence, the frequency of Very Hot Jupiters (VHJs) with
periods P satisfying 1d<P<3d can be no more than F_VHJ < 1/1040 in omega Cen.

smooth function of calendar time; (ii) the effects of air pollution are allowed
to evolve over time. The efficacy of these two extensions are investigated by
applying a series of dynamic and non-dynamic models to air pollution and

approach is that the system allows for extensive analyses of charge and spin
conductance in the non-perturbative regime. By closely examining the behavior
of conductances at low temperatures, in the presence of a finite backward
scattering barrier due to the impurity, we identified four distinct phases
characterized by either perfect transmission or reflection of charge and spin
channels. Our phase diagram for an intermediate scattering strength is
consistent with the standard perturbative renormalization group (RG) analysis
in the limit of weak and strong backward scattering, in the sense that all our
phase boundaries interpolate the two limiting cases. Further investigations
show, however, that precise location and form of our phase boundaries are not
trivially explained by the standard RG analysis, e.g., some part of the phase
diagram looks much similar to the weak backscattering limit, whereas some other
part is clearly derived from the opposite limit. In order to give a more
intuitive interpretation of such behaviors, we also reconsidered our impurity
problem from the viewpoint of a quantum Brownian motion picture.

formed with a power-law initial cluster mass function (ICMF) of spectral index
$\alpha =-2$ assuming different cluster disruption time-scales. For each of
these disruption time-scales we derive the corresponding cluster formation rate
(CFR) required to reproduce the observed cluster age distribution. We then
compare, in a Poissonian $\chi^2$ sense, model mass distributions and model
two-dimensional distributions in log(mass) vs. log(age) space of the detected
surviving clusters to the observations. Because of the bright detection limit
($M_V^{\rm lim} \simeq -4.7$ mag) above which the observed cluster sample is
complete, one cannot constrain the characteristic disruption time-scale for a
$10^4$ M$_\odot$ cluster, $t_4^{\rm dis}$ (where the disruption time-scale
depends on cluster mass as $t_{\rm dis} = t_4^{\rm dis} (M_{\rm cl} / 10^4 {\rm
M}_\odot)^0.62$), to better than $t_4^{\rm dis} \ge 1$ Gyr. We conclude that
the CFR has increased from 0.3 clusters Myr$^{-1}$ 5 Gyr ago, to a present rate
of $(20-30)$ clusters Myr$^{-1}$. For older ages the derived CFR depends
sensitively on our assumption of the underlying CMF shape. If we assume a
universal Gaussian ICMF, then the CFR has increased steadily over a Hubble time
from $\sim 1$ cluster Gyr$^{-1}$ 15 Gyr ago to its present value. If the ICMF
has always been a power law with a slope close to $\alpha=-2$, the CFR exhibits
a minimum some 5 Gyr ago, which we tentatively identify with the well-known age
gap in the LMC's cluster age distribution.

on unknown parameters that must be computed from data. More challenging still
is the case where no parametric assumptions are made about the blur function.
There has been a limited amount of work in this setting, but it invariably
relies on iterative methods, sometimes under assumptions that are
mathematically convenient but physically unrealistic (e.g., that the operator
defined by the blur function has an integrable inverse). In this paper we
suggest a direct, noniterative approach to nonparametric, blind restoration of
a signal. Our method is based on a new, ridge-based method for deconvolution,
and requires only mild restrictions on the blur function. We show that the
convergence rate of the method is close to optimal, from some viewpoints, and

a set of approximations proposed by J. Boussinesq one century ago. To resume,
they consist in assuming constant fluid properties, incompressibility and
conservation of calories during heat transport. Assuming fulfilment of the
first requirement (constant fluid properties), we derive a set of 4 criteria
for assessing the validity of the two other requirements in turbulent
Rayleigh-B\'enard convection. The first criterion $\alpha \Delta \ll 1 $ simply
results from the incompressibility condition in the thermal boundary layer
($\alpha$ and $\Delta$ are the thermal expansion coefficient and the
temperature difference driving the flow). The 3 other criteria are proportional
or quadratic with the density stratification or, equivalently with the
temperature difference resulting from the adiabatic gradient across the cell
$\Delta_{h}$. Numerical evaluations with air, water and cryogenic helium show
that most laboratory experiments are free from such Boussinesq violation as
long as the first criterion is fulfilled. In ultra high Rayleigh numbers
($Ra>10^{16}$) experiments in He, one of the stratification criteria, scaling
with $\alpha \Delta_{h}$, could be violated. This criterion garanties that
pressure fluctuations have a negligible influence both on the density variation
and on the heat transfer equation through compression/expansion cycles.
Extrapolation to higher $Ra$ suggests that strong violation of Boussinesq
approximation could occur in atmospheric convection.

derive differential and integral equations for the mean and covariance function
of the limit Gaussian process. This provides a method of tracking not only the
integral curve, but also the covariance matrix of its estimate. We also study
the asymptotic distribution of the squared minimal distance from the integral
curve to a smooth enough surface $\Gamma\subset G$. Building upon this, we
develop testing procedures for the hypothesis that the integral curve reaches
$\Gamma$. The problems of this nature are of interest in diffusion tensor
imaging, a brain imaging technique based on measuring the diffusion tensor at
discrete locations in the cerebral white matter, where the diffusion of water
molecules is typically anisotropic. The diffusion tensor data is used to
estimate the dominant orientations of the diffusion and to track white matter
fibers from the initial location following these orientations. Our approach
brings more rigorous statistical tools to the analysis of this problem
providing, in particular, hypothesis testing procedures that might be useful in
the study of axonal connectivity of the white matter.

The predictions of QT being of probabilistic character apply to the statistical
distribution of the results obtained in various experiments. The probability
distribution is not an attribute of a dice but it is a characteristic of a
whole random experiment : '' rolling a dice''. and statistical long range
correlations between two random variables X and Y are not a proof of any causal
relation between these variable. Moreover any probabilistic model used to
describe a random experiment is consistent only with a specific protocol
telling how the random experiment has to be performed.In this sense the quantum
theory is a statistical and contextual theory of phenomena. In this paper we
discuss these important topics in some detail. Besides we discuss in historical
perspective various prerequisites used in the proofs of Bell and CHSH
inequalities concluding that the violation of these inequalities in spin
polarization correlation experiments is neither a proof of the completeness of
QT nor of its nonlocality. The question whether QT is predictably complete is
still open and it should be answered by a careful and unconventional analysis
of the experimental data. It is sufficient to analyze more in detail the
existing experimental data by using various non-parametric purity tests and
other specific statistical tools invented to study the fine structure of the
time-series. The correct understanding of statistical and contextual character
of QT has far reaching consequences for the quantum information and quantum
computing.

representation over a field $\mathbb F$ of characteristic zero is called
linear. This note combines the natural structure of semi-direct products with
work of A. Lubotzky on the existence of linear representations to develop a
technique to give sufficient conditions to show that a semi-direct product is
linear.
  Let $G$ denote a discrete group which is a semi-direct product given by a
split extension $1 \to \pi \to G \to \Gamma \to 1$. This note defines an
additional type of structure for this semi-direct product called a stable
extension below. The main results are as follows:
  1. If $\pi$ and $\Gamma$ are linear, and the extension is stable, then $G$ is
also linear. Restrictions concerning this extension are necessary to guarantee
that $G$ is linear as seen from properties of the Formanek-Procesi ""poison
group"". 2. If the action of $\Gamma$ on $\pi$ has a ""Galois-like"" property that
it factors through the automorphisms of certain natural ""towers of groups over
$\pi$"" (to be defined below), then the associated extension is stable and thus
$G$ is linear. 3. The condition of a stable extension also implies that $G$
admits filtration quotients which themselves give a natural structure of Lie
algebra and which also imply earlier results of Kohno, and Falk-Randell on the
Lie algebra attached to the descending central series associated to the
fundamental groups of complex hyperplane complements.
  The methods here suggest that a possible technique for obtaining new
linearity results may be to analyze automorphisms of towers of groups.

massive star systems are known as non-thermal particle production sites, as
indicated by their synchrotron emission in the radio band. As a consequence
they are also considered as candidate sites for non-thermal high-energy photon
production up to gamma-ray energies. The present work considers the effects of
wind clumpiness expected on the emitting relativistic particle spectrum in
colliding wind systems, built up from the pool of thermal wind particles
through diffusive particle acceleration, and taking into account inverse
Compton and synchrotron losses. In comparison to a homogeneous wind, a clumpy
wind causes flux variations of the emitting particle spectrum when the clump
enters the wind collision region. It is found that the spectral features
associated with this variability moves temporally from low to high energy bands
with the time shift between any two spectral bands being dependent on clump
size, filling factor, and the energy-dependence of particle energy gains and

FPGA-based computing system. Each JANUS module has a computational core and a
host. The computational core is a 4x4 array of FPGA-based processing elements
with nearest-neighbor data links. Processors are also directly connected to an
I/O node attached to the JANUS host, a conventional PC. JANUS is tailored for,
but not limited to, the requirements of a class of hard scientific applications
characterized by regular code structure, unconventional data manipulation
instructions and not too large data-base size. We discuss the architecture of
this configurable machine, and focus on its use on Monte Carlo simulations of
statistical mechanics. On this class of application JANUS achieves impressive
performances: in some cases one JANUS processing element outperfoms high-end
PCs by a factor ~ 1000. We also discuss the role of JANUS on other classes of
scientific applications.

  Arbitrary Strategy Sets","36 pages. Revised version",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We provide an epistemic analysis of arbitrary strategic games based on
possibility correspondences. We first establish a generic result that links
true common beliefs (and, respectively, common knowledge) of players'
rationality defined by means of `monotonic' properties, with the iterated
elimination of strategies that do not satisfy these properties. It allows us to
deduce the customary results concerned with true common beliefs of rationality
and iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies as simple
corollaries. This approach relies on Tarski's Fixpoint Theorem. We also provide
an axiomatic presentation of this generic result. This allows us to clarify the
proof-theoretic principles assumed in players' reasoning. Finally, we provide
an alternative characterization of the iterated elimination of strategies based
on the concept of a public announcement. It applies to `global properties'.
Both classes of properties include the notions of rationalizability and the
iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies.

properties of immersed impurity atoms, which are trapped in an optical lattice.
Assuming a weak coupling of the impurity atoms to the BEC, we derive a quantum
master equation for the lattice system. In the special case of fixed impurities
with two internal states the atoms represent a quantum register and the quantum
master equation reproduces the exact evolution of the qubits. We characterise
the qubit dephasing which is caused by the interspecies coupling and show that
the effect of sub- and superdecoherence is observable for realistic
experimental parameters. Furthermore, the BEC phonons mediate an attractive
interaction between the impurities, which has an important impact on their
spatial distribution. If the lattice atoms are allowed to move, there occurs a
sharp transition with the impurities aggregating in a macroscopic cluster at
experimentally achievable temperatures. We also investigate the impact of the
BEC on the transport properties of the impurity atoms and show that a crossover
from coherent to diffusive behaviour occurs with increasing interaction
strength.

Classically, it is a BF theory with gauge algebra osp(2|2). This algebra has
representations which are not completely reducible. This complicates the
procedure when building a state sum. Fortunately, one can and should excise
these representations. We show that the restricted subset of representations
form a subcategory closed under tensor product. The resulting state-sum is once
again a topological invariant. Furthermore, within this framework one can
identify positively and negatively charged fermions propagating on the spin
foam. These results on osp(2|2) representations and intertwiners apply more
generally to spin network states for N=2 loop quantum supergravity (in 3+1

incorporates the BVRIH-band apparent magnitudes of both components, precise
orbital parameters, interstellar extinction and a widely used grid of stellar
models from the literature, the Kepler's third law and a chi^2 minimisation.
The derived distance is 334^(+25)_(-22) pc for an age of 3+/-2 Ma; larger ages
and distances are unlikely. The masses of the primary and the secondary lie on
the approximate intervals 16-20 and 10-12 Msol, respectively. I also discuss
the possibility of sigma Ori AB being a triple system at ~385 pc. These results

  by stencil in 1967 under subheading ``The role of fundamental microphysical
  parameters in cosmogony'', as a foundation for what was to become known as
  the anthropic principle",,,,"hep-th astro-ph gr-qc hep-ph",,"  This is the first part of a survey whose ultimate purpose is to clarify the
significance of the famous coincidence between the Hubble age of the universe
and a certain combination of microphysical parameters. In this part the way is
prepared by a discussion of the manner in which familiar local phenomena depend
qualitatively, and in order of magnitude, quantitatively on the fundamental
parameters of microphysics. In order to keep the account concise while
remaining self contained, only the barest essentials of the standard nuclear
physical and astrophysical calculations involved are given. Only six of the
fundamental parameters play a dominant part, namely the coupling constants of
the strong, electromagnetic, and gravitational forces, and the mass ratios of
the proton, neutron, electron and pi-meson. Attention is drawn to the important
consequences of three coincidental relationships between these parameters. It
is shown that most of the principle limiting masses of astrophysics arise (in
fundamental units) simply as the reciprocal of the gravitational fine structure
constant, with relatively small adjustment factors. The dividing point between
red dwarf and blue giant stars turns out to be an exception: this division
occurs within the range of the main sequence stars only as a consequence of the
rather exotic coincidence that the ninth power of the electromagnetic fine
structure constant is roughly equal to the square root of the gravitational
fine structure constant.

described in analogy to the `two-mode squeezing' of quantum optics in terms of
an su(1,1) algebra. In this system the initial m_F=0 condensate acts as a
source (`pump') for the creation pairs of m_F =+1,-1 atoms. We show that even
though the system as a whole is described by a pure state with zero entropy,
the reduced density matrix for the m_F = +1 degree of freedom, obtained by
tracing out the m_F = -1,0 degrees of freedom, corresponds to a thermal state.
Furthermore, these quantum fluctuations of the initial dynamics of the system
provide the seeds for the formation of domains of ferromagnetically aligned
spins.
