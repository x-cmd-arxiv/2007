haloes over a broad range of descendant halo mass (1e12 < M0 < 1e15 Msun),
progenitor mass ratio (1e-3 < xi < 1), and redshift (0 < z < 6). We find the
mean merger rate per halo, B/n, to have very simple dependence on M0, xi, and
z, and propose a universal fitting form for B/n that is accurate to 10-20%.
Overall, B/n depends very weakly on the halo mass (proportional to M0^0.08) and
scales as a power law in the progenitor mass ratio (proportional to xi^-2) for
minor mergers (xi < 0.1) with a mild upturn for major mergers. As a function of
time, we find the merger rate per Gyr to evolve as (1+z)^n with n=2-2.3, while
the rate per unit redshift is nearly independent of z. Several tests are
performed to assess how our merger rates are affected by, e.g. the time
interval between Millennium outputs, binary vs multiple progenitor mergers, and
mass conservation and diffuse accretion during mergers. In particular, we find
halo fragmentations to be a general issue in merger tree construction from
N-body simulations and compare two methods for handling these events. We
compare our results with predictions of two analytical models for halo mergers
based on the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS) model and the coagulation theory.
We find the EPS model to overpredict the major merger rates and underpredict
the minor merger rates by up to a factor of a few.

of maximizing the sum-rate of flows (network throughput) is considered. A
selective independent scheduling strategy is designed for this purpose, and
using the analytical results for the two-hop network, the achievable throughput
is characterized as a function of the anonymity level. The throughput-anonymity

encoders, are under Byzantine attack; that is, an unknown group of sensors have
been reprogrammed by a malicious intruder to undermine the reconstruction at
the fusion center. Three different forms of the problem are considered. The
first is a variable-rate setup, in which the decoder adaptively chooses the
rates at which the sensors transmit. An explicit characterization of the
variable-rate achievable sum rates is given for any number of sensors and any
groups of traitors. The converse is proved constructively by letting the
traitors simulate a fake distribution and report the generated values as the
true ones. This fake distribution is chosen so that the decoder cannot
determine which sensors are traitors while maximizing the required rate to
decode every value. Achievability is proved using a scheme in which the decoder
receives small packets of information from a sensor until its message can be
decoded, before moving on to the next sensor. The sensors use randomization to
choose from a set of coding functions, which makes it probabilistically
impossible for the traitors to cause the decoder to make an error. Two forms of
the fixed-rate problem are considered, one with deterministic coding and one
with randomized coding. The achievable rate regions are given for both these
problems, and it is shown that lower rates can be achieved with randomized
coding.

network. The approach to the final state is characterized by a time scale that
diverges at the critical point as $\tau \sim |p_c-p|^{-1}$. We find that the
active and frozen phases correspond to a connected and a fragmented network
respectively. We show that the transition in finite-size systems can be seen as
the sudden change in the trajectory of an equivalent random walk at the
critical rewiring rate $p_c$, highlighting the fact that the mechanism behind
the transition is a competition between the rates at which the network and the
state of the nodes evolve.

tailed statistics of human activity patterns. The main predictions are the
existence of a power-law distribution for the interevent time of human actions
and two decay exponents $\alpha=1$ and $\alpha=3/2$. Current models lack,
however, a key aspect of human dynamics, i.e. several tasks require, or are
determined by, interactions between individuals. Here we introduce a minimal
queueing model of human dynamics that already takes into account human-human
interactions. To achieve large scale simulations we obtain a coarse-grained
version of the model, allowing us to reach large interevent times and reliable
scaling exponents estimations. Using this we show that the interevent
distribution of interacting tasks exhibit the scaling exponents $\alpha=2$, 3/2
and a series of numerable values between 3/2 and 1. This work demonstrates
that, within the context of queueing models of human dynamics, interactions
change the exponent of the power-law distributed interevent times. Beyond the
study of human dynamics, these results are relevant to systems where the event
of interest consists of the simultaneous occurrence of two (or more) events.

line from numerous instrumental lines found in the SPI background spectrum, we
study the dependence of the intensity of the line signal on the offset of the
SPI pointing from the direction toward the Galactic Centre. After a critical
analysis of the uncertainties of the DM density profile in the inner Galaxy, we
find that the intensity of the DM decay line should decrease by at least a

sigma in the SPI background spectrum. Possible DM decay origin is not ruled out
only for the unidentified spectral lines, having low (~3 sigma) significance or
coinciding in position with the instrumental ones. In the energy interval from
20 keV to 7 MeV, we derive restrictions on the DM decay line flux, implied by
the (non-)detection of the DM decay line. For a particular DM candidate, the

performed with XMM/Newton. The spectra taken by high-precision instruments have
never been analyzed before. We find an X-ray position for the source that is
inconsistent with the one obtained by ROSAT, but in agreement with the Einstein
position and that of the optical counterpart. The correlated spectral and
timing behaviour of the source suggests that the source is probably in the
normal branch of its X-ray color-color diagram. The spectrum of the source can
be fitted with a blackbody with a temperature 1.5 keV plus a disk blackbody at
0.8 keV. Photoelectric absorption from neutral matter has an equivalent
hydrogen column of 4 x 10^{20} cm^{-2}. An emission line, which we identify as
the O VIII Lyman alpha line, is detected, while no feature due to iron is
detected in the spectrum. We argue that the emission of this source can be
straightforwardly interpreted as a sum of the emission from a boundary layer
between the NS and the disc and a blackbody component coming from the disc
itself. Other canonical models that are used to fit Z-sources do not give a
satisfactory fit to the data. The detection of the O VIII emission line (and
the lack of detection of lines in the iron region) can be due to the fact that
the source lies in the Large Magellanic Cloud.

general relativity (GR), $\gamma_{N}\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$. In the context of
relativistic modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) introduced by Bekenstein,
however, a single filament inclined by $\approx 45^\circ$ from the line of
sight can cause substantial distortion of background sources pointing towards
the filament's axis ($\kappa=\gamma=(1-A^{-1})/2\sim 0.01$); this is rigorous
for infinitely long uniform filaments, but also qualitatively true for short
filaments ($\sim 30$Mpc), and even in regions where the projected matter
density of the filament is equal to zero. Since galaxies and galaxy clusters
are generally embedded in filaments or are projected on such structures, this
contribution complicates the interpretation of the weak lensing shear map in
the context of MOND. While our analysis is of mainly theoretical interest
providing order-of-magnitude estimates only, it seems safe to conclude that
when modeling systems with anomalous weak lensing signals, e.g. the ""bullet
cluster"" of Clowe et al., the ""cosmic train wreck"" of Abell 520 from Mahdavi et
al., and the ""dark clusters"" of Erben et al., filamentary structures might
contribute in a significant and likely complex fashion. On the other hand, our
predictions of a (conceptual) difference in the weak lensing signal could, in
principle, be used to falsify MOND/TeVeS and its variations.

density. For small planets, however, the average density is not unique within
the range of compositions. Variations of a number of important planetary
parameters--which are difficult or impossible to constrain from measurements
alone--produce planets with the same average densities but widely varying bulk
compositions. We find that adding a gas envelope equivalent to 0.1%-10% of the
mass of a solid planet causes the radius to increase 5-60% above its gas-free
value. A planet with a given mass and radius might have substantial water ice
content (a so-called ocean planet) or alternatively a large rocky-iron core and
some H and/or He. For example, a wide variety of compositions can explain the
observed radius of GJ 436b, although all models require some H/He. We conclude
that the identification of water worlds based on the mass-radius relationship

spin-polarized charge densities of bcc and high-spin fcc iron are atypical of
any known for non-magnetic materials. In these cases, the two spin-densities
are correlated: the spin-minority electrons have directional bond paths with
deep minima in the minority density, while the spin-majority electrons fill
these holes, reducing bond directionality. The presence of two distinct spin
topologies suggests that a well-known magnetic phase transition in iron can be
fruitfully reexamined in light of these topological changes. We show that the
two phase changes seen in fcc iron (paramagnetic to low-spin and low-spin to

paradigm and proceeds without a topological transformation, while the latter

one fluid approach, the thermal instability is suppressed due to the magnetic
pressure. However, the previous studies did not precisely consider the effect
of the ion-neutral friction, since they did not treat the flow as two fluid
which is composed of ions and neutrals. Then, we revisit the effect of the
ion-neutral friction of the two fluid to the growth of the thermal instability.
According to our study, (1) The instability which is characterized by the mean
molecular weight of neutrals is suppressed via the ion-neutral friction only
when the magnetic field and the friction are sufficiently strong. The
suppression owing to the friction occurs even along the field line. If the
magnetic field and the friction are not so strong, the instability is not
stabilized. (2) The effect of the friction and the magnetic field is mainly
reduction of the growth rate of the thermal instability of weakly ionized
plasma. (3) The effect of friction does not affect the critical wavelength
lambdaF for the thermal instability. This yields that lambdaF of the weakly
ionized plasma is not enlarged even when the magnetic field exists. We insist
that the thermal instability of the weakly ionized plasma in the magnetic field
can grow up even at the small length scale where the instability under the
assumption of the one fluid plasma can not grow owing to the stabilization by
the magnetic field. (4) The wavelength of the maximum growth rate of the
instability shifts shortward according to the decrement of the growth rate,
because the friction is effective at rather larger scale. Therefore, smaller
structures are expected to appear than those without the ion-neutral friction.

We have carried out simulations of the gravitational lensing effect responsible

submm continuum emission. Using an elliptical lens potential, the best fit
lensing model yields an intrinsic (projected) diameter of ~80pc, which is not
as compact as the optical/near-infrared (NIR) emission and agrees with previous
size estimates of the gas and dust emission in APM08279+5255. Based on our

originates from a warm dust component (T_d=150-220K) that is mainly heated by
the AGN rather than by a starburst (SB). The flux is boosted by a factor of ~90

observation is that the correct fixed-point dynamical system has to be

membranes, as well as the adsorption of organic soft matter to inorganic solid
substrates belong to the most interesting challenges in understanding structure
and function of complex macromolecules. This is reasoned by the
interdisciplinary character of the associated questions ranging from the
molecular origin of the loss of biological functionality as, for example, in
Alzheimer's disease to the development of organic circuits for biosensory
applications. In this lecture, we focus on the analysis of mesoscopic models
for protein folding, aggregation, and hybrid systems of soft and solid
condensed matter. The simplicity of the coarse-grained models allows for a more
universal description of the notoriously difficult problem of protein folding.
In this approach, classifications of structure formation processes with respect
to the conformational pseudophases are possible. This is similar in aggregation
and adsorption processes, where the individual folding propensity is influenced
by external forces. The main problem in studies of conformational transitions
is that the sequences of amino acids proteins are built up of are necessarily
of finite length and, therefore, a thermodynamic limit does not exist. Thus,
structural transitions are not phase transitions in the strict thermodynamic
sense and the analysis of pseudouniversal aspects is intricate, as apparently
small-system effects accompany all conformational transitions and cannot be
neglected.

matter halo, predicted by the rotation curve. From the EGRET excess one can
predict the flux of antiprotons from DMA. However, how many antiprotons arrive
at the detector strongly depends on the propagation model. The conventional
isotropic propagation models trap the antiprotons in the Galaxy leading to a
local antiproton flux far above the observed flux. According to Bergstrom et.
al. this excludes the DMA interpretation of the EGRET excess. Here it is shown
that more realistic anisotropic propagation models, in which most antiprotons
escape by fast transport in the z-direction, are consistent with the B/C ratio,
the antiproton flux and the EGRET excess from DMA.

nonsingular variety of dimension n, and Y a nonempty closed subscheme of X.
Using non-standard methods, we show that every limit of a decreasing sequence
in T_n lies in T_{n-1}, proving in this setting a conjecture of Koll\'{a}r. We
also show that T_n is a closed subset in the set of real numbers; in
particular, every limit of log canonical thresholds on smooth varieties of
fixed dimension is a rational number. As a consequence of this property, we see
that in order to check Shokurov's ACC Conjecture for all T_n, it is enough to
show that 1 is not a point of accumulation from below of any T_n. In a
different direction, we interpret the ACC Conjecture as a semi-continuity

magnetic field that is continuous at the surface with the outside dipole field
whose strength $B_p$ at the magnetic pole is $B_p\sim 10^{16}$G. Since
separation of variables is not possible for oscillations of magnetized stars,
we employ finite series expansions of the perturbations using spherical
harmonic functions to represent the angular dependence of the oscillation
modes. For $B_p\sim 10^{16}$G, we find distinct mode sequences, in each of
which the oscillation frequency of the toroidal mode slowly increases as the
number of radial nodes of the eigenfunction increases. The frequency spectrum
of the toroidal modes for $B_p\sim 10^{16}$G is largely different from that of
the crustal toroidal modes of the non-magnetized model, although the frequency
ranges are overlapped each other. This suggests that an interpretation of the
observed QPOs based on the magnetic toroidal modes may be possible if the field
strength of the star is as strong as $B_p\sim 10^{16}$G.

derived from speckle can be used for a variety of security purposes such as

number generation and tamper protection. The choice of laser speckle as a
source of random keys is quite natural, given the chaotic properties of
speckle. However, this same chaotic behaviour also causes reproducibility
problems. Cryptographic protocols require either zero noise or very low noise
in their inputs; hence the issue of error rates is critical to applications of
laser speckle in cryptography. Most of the literature uses an error reduction
method based on Gabor filtering. Though the method is successful, it has not

in-sample evolution of appropriately chosen diverging/converging statistics.
The proposed rate estimators are based on simple least squares arguments, and
are shown to be accurate in a very general setting without requiring the choice
of a tuning parameter. The notion of scanning is introduced with the purpose of
extracting useful subsamples of the data series; the proposed rate estimation
method is applied to different scans, and the resulting estimators are then
combined to improve accuracy. Applications to heavy tail index estimation as
well as to the problem of estimating the long memory parameter are discussed; a
small simulation study complements our theoretical results.

network access, combined with the current lack of robust authenticity and
privacy, hamstrings the current internet. The collection of disjoint and often
ad-hoc technologies currently in use are at least partially responsible for the
magnitude and potency of the plagues besetting the information economy, of
which spam and email borne virii are canonical examples. The proposed
replacement for the internet, Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), does little
to tackle these underlying issues, instead concentrating on addressing the
technical issues of a decade ago.
  This paper introduces CANE, a Content Addressed Network Environment, and
compares it against current internet and related technologies. Specifically,
CANE presents a simple computing environment in which location is abstracted
away in favour of identity, and trust is explicitly defined. Identity is
cryptographically verified and yet remains pervasively open in nature. It is
argued that this approach is capable of being generalised such that file
storage and network access can be unified and subsequently combined with human
interfaces to result in a Unified Theory of Access, which addresses many of the
significant problems besetting the internet community of the early 21st
century.

to the first order character of the transition and to the underlying phases
coexistence. Despite these out of equilibrium features, a positive and linear
magneto-resistance is also observed, possibly linked to the heterogeneity of
the state. From a magnetic point of view, the paramagnetic to ordered magnetic

shows the characteristics of a continuous transition, and time dependent

motivated by a desire to modify the Barrett-Crane model in such a way that the
imposition of certain second class constraints, called cross-simplicity
constraints, are weakened. We refer to these two models as the FKLS model, and
the flipped model. Both of these models are based on a reformulation of the
cross-simplicity constraints. This paper has two main parts. First, we clarify
the structure of the reformulated cross-simplicity constraints and the nature
of their quantum imposition in the new models. In particular we show that in
the FKLS model, quantum cross-simplicity implies no restriction on states. The
deeper reason for this is that, with the symplectic structure relevant for
FKLS, the reformulated cross-simplicity constraints, in a certain relevant
sense, are now \emph{first class}, and this causes the coherent state method of
imposing the constraints, key in the FKLS model, to fail to give any
restriction on states. Nevertheless, the cross-simplicity can still be seen as
implemented via suppression of intertwiner degrees of freedom in the dynamical
propagation. In the second part of the paper, we investigate area spectra in
the models. The results of these two investigations will highlight how, in the
flipped model, the Hilbert space of states, as well as the spectra of area
operators exactly match those of loop quantum gravity, whereas in the FKLS (and
Barrett-Crane) models, the boundary Hilbert spaces and area spectra are
different.

versus their orbital radii suggests that the star formation rate in the thin
disk decreases with increasing Galactocentric distance, and there was no star
formation for some time outside the solar circle while this process was
continuous within the solar circle. The decrease in the star formation rate
with increasing Galactocentric distance is responsible for the existence of a
negative radial metallicity gradient in the thin disk. At the same time the
relative magnesium abundance exhibits no radial gradient. It is in detail
considered the influence of selective effects on the form of both age -
metallicity and age - relative magnesium abundance diagrams. It is shown that
the first several billion years of the formation of the thin disk interstellar
medium in it was on the average sufficiently rich in heavy elements (<[Fe/H]> =
-0.22), badly mixed (\sigma_[Fe/H] = 0.21), and the average relative magnesium
abundance was comparatively high (<[Mg/Fe]> = 0.10). Approximately 5 billion
years ago average metallicity began to systematically increase, and its
dispersion and the average relative magnesium abundance - to decrease. These
properties may be explained by an increase in star formation rate with the
simultaneous intensification of the processes of mixing the interstellar medium

work forms part of an ongoing programme to constrain the internal

between the various formation scenarios proposed for these objects. First
comparisons of asteroseismic values with evolutionary theory look promising,
however it is clear that more targets are needed for meaningful statistics to
be derived. The observational pulsation periods of PG 0911+456 were extracted
from rapid time-series photometry using standard Fourier analysis techniques.
Supplemented by spectroscopic estimates of the star's mean atmospheric
parameters, they were used as a basis for the ""forward modelling"" approach in
asteroseismology. The latter culminates in the identification of one or more
""optimal"" models that can accurately reproduce the observed period spectrum.
This naturally leads to an identification of the oscillations detected in terms
of degree l and radial order k, and infers the structural parameters of the
target. From the photometry it was possible to extract 7 independent pulsation
periods in the 150-200 s range with amplitudes between 0.05 and 0.8 % of the
star's mean brightness. An asteroseismic search of parameter space identified
several models that matched the observed properties of PG 0911+456 well, one of
which was isolated as the ""optimal"" model on the basis of spectroscopic and
mode identification considerations. All the observed pulsations are identified
with low-order acoustic modes with degree indices l=0,1,2 and 4, and match the
computed periods with a dispersion of only ~0.26 %.

It is also known that Doob's transform of FBM and the process obtained from the

the first one of these can be described as a solution of a Langevin equation

eccentricity of $e=0.903\pm0.02$. It orbits a metal rich G5V star at $a=1.28$
AU which displays an additional radial velocity drift of 28 m s$^{-1}$/yr
observed during 8 years. The combination of the radial-velocity data and the
non-detection of any main sequence stellar companion in our high contrast
images taken at the VLT with NACO/SDI, characterizes the companion as a
probable brown dwarf or as a faint white dwarf. The second planet, \object{HD
156846 b}, has minimum mass of $m\sin{i}=10.45\pm0.05$ M$_{\rm Jup}$, a period
of $P=359.51\pm0.09 $ days, an eccentricity of $e=0.847\pm0.002$ and is located

also the primary of a wide binary system ($a>250$ AU, $P>4000$ years). Its
stellar companion, \object{IDS 17147-1914 B}, is a M4 dwarf. The very high
eccentricities of both planets can be explained by Kozai oscillations induced
by the presence of a third object.

fluctuations depends on magnetic Reynolds number only when the mean magnetic
field is smaller than $B_{eq} / 4 Rm^{1/4}$, where $B_{eq}$ is the
equipartition mean magnetic field determined by the turbulent kinetic energy
and Rm is magnetic Reynolds number. Generation of magnetic fluctuations in a
turbulent convection with a nonzero mean magnetic field results in a decrease
of the total turbulent pressure and may cause formation of the large-scale
inhomogeneous magnetic structures even in an originally uniform mean magnetic
field. This effect is caused by a negative contribution of the turbulent
convection to the effective mean Lorentz force. The inhomogeneous large-scale
magnetic fields are formed due to the excitation of the large-scale
instability. The energy for this instability is supplied by the small-scale
turbulent convection. The discussed effects might be useful for understanding
the origin of the solar nonuniform magnetic fields, e.g., sunspots.

find evidence for propellering in the late stages of outburst of several dwarf
novae, as shown by reductions in EUVE fluxes and from rapid increases of the
DNO periods. Reanalysis of DNOs observed in TY PsA, which had particularly
large amplitudes, shows that the apparent loss of coherence during late decline
is better described as a regular switching between two nearby periods. It is
partly this and the rapid deceleration in some systems that make the DNOs
harder to detect.
  We suggest that the 28.95 s periodicity in WZ Sge, which has long been a
puzzle, is caused by heated regions in the disc, just beyond the corotation
radius, which are a consequence of magnetic coupling between the primary and

group D_n, the index j of the fermion representation 2_j and the preserved
subgroups indicated by m_u and m_d. Here we construct a low energy model which
incorporates this idea. The gauge group is the one of the Standard Model and
D_7 x Z_2 ^(aux) serves as flavor symmetry. The additional Z_2 ^(aux) is
necessary in order to maintain two sets of Higgs fields, one which couples only
to up quarks and another one coupling only to down quarks. We assume that D_7
is broken spontaneously at the electroweak scale by vacuum expectation values
of SU(2)_L doublet Higgs fields. The quark masses and mixing parameters can be
accommodated well. Furthermore, the potential of the Higgs fields is studied
numerically in order to show that the required configuration of the vacuum
expectation values can be achieved. We also comment on more minimalist models
which explain the Cabibbo angle in terms of group theoretical quantities, while
theta_{13}^q and theta_{23}^q vanish at leading order. Finally, we perform a
detailed numerical study of the lepton mixing matrix V_{MNS} in which one of
its elements is entirely determined by the group theory of a dihedral symmetry.
Thereby, we show that nearly tri-bi-maximal mixing can also be produced by a

contained between $\bigcup_{p>0}H^p$ and so-called ``big'' Hardy-Orlicz spaces.
Big Hardy-Orlicz spaces, carrying an algebraic structure, are equal to their
multiplier algebra, whereas in classical Hardy spaces $H^p$, the multipliers
reduce to $H^{\infty}$. For Hardy-Orlicz spaces $\mH_{\Phi}$ between these two
extremal situations and subject to some conditions, we exhibit multipliers that
are in Hardy-Orlicz spaces the defining functions of which are related to
$\Phi$. Even if the results do not entirely characterize the multiplier
algebra, some examples show that we are not very far from precise conditions.
In certain situations we see how the multiplier algebra grows in a sense from
$\Hi$ to big Hardy-Orlicz spaces when we go from classical $H^p$ spaces to big
Hardy-Orlicz spaces. However, the multiplier algebras are not always ordered as
their underlying Hardy-Orlicz spaces. Such an ordering holds in certain
situations, but examples show that there are large Hardy-Orlicz spaces for
which the multipliers reduce to $\Hi$ so that the multipliers do in general not
conserve the ordering of the underlying Hardy-Orlicz spaces. We apply some of
the multiplier results to construct Hardy-Orlicz spaces close to
$\bigcup_{p>0}H^p$ and for which the free interpolating sequences are no longer
characterized by the Carleson condition which is well known to characterize
free interpolating sequences in $H^p$, $p>0$.

condition on physical states which, differently from the Dirac method, requires
them to be invariant under the BRST transformation. Employing this method for
the action of general relativity expressed in terms of the spin connection and
tetrad fields with path integral methods, we construct the generator of BRST
transformation associated with the underlying local Lorentz symmetry of the
theory and write a physical state condition consequence of BRST invariance. We
observe that this condition differs form the one obtained within Ashtekar's

temperature Te([O III]) implied by the line ratio [O III]4363A/[O III]5007A in
low-metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxies, casting doubts on the assumption
of photoionization by hot stars as the dominant source of heating of the gas in
these objects. Combinations of runs of the 1-D photoionization code NEBU are
used to explore alternative models for the giant H II region shell I Zw 18 NW.
Acceptable models are obtained, which represent schematically an incomplete
shell comprising radiation-bounded condensations embedded in a low-density
matter-bounded diffuse medium. The thermal pressure contrast between gas
components is about a factor 7. The diffuse phase can be in pressure balance
with the hot superbubble fed by mechanical energy from the inner massive star
cluster. The failure of previous modellings is ascribed to (1) the adoption of
an inadequate small-scale gas density distribution, which proves critical when
the collisional excitation of hydrogen contributes significantly to the cooling
of the gas, and possibly (2) a too restrictive implementation of Wolf-Rayet
stars in synthetic stellar cluster spectral energy distributions. A neutral gas
component heated by soft X-rays, whose power is less than 1% of the star
cluster luminosity and consistent with CHANDRA data, can explain the
low-ionization fine-structure lines detected by SPITZER. [O/Fe] is slightly
smaller in I Zw 18 NW than in Galactic Halo stars of similar metallicity and
[C/O] is correlatively large. Extra heating by, e.g., dissipation of mechanical
energy is not required to explain Te([O III]) in I Zw 18. Important
astrophysical developments are at stakes in the 5% uncertainty attached to [O
III] collision strengths.

few to more than twenty thousand Bloch oscillation periods. We quantify the
dephasing in terms of the width of the quasi-momentum distribution and measure
its dependence on time for different values of the scattering length.
Minimizing the dephasing allows us to realize a BEC-based atom interferometer
in the non-interacting limit. We use it for a precise determination of a
zero-crossing for the atomic scattering length and to observe collapse and
revivals of Bloch oscillations when the atomic sample is subject to a spatial

carried out in the nuclear region of Centaurus A (NGC5128). The 500 pc bipolar
dust shell discovered by Quillen et al.(2006) is even more clearly seen in the
11.3 micron dust emission feature than previous broad band imaging. The pure
rotational lines of molecular hydrogen other than the S(0) line are detected
above the dusty disk and associated with the oval dust shell. The molecular
hydrogen transitions indicate the presence of warm gas at temperatures
250--720K. The ratio of the dust emission features at 7.7 and 11.3 micron and
the ratio of the [NeII](12.8) and 11.3 dust emission feature are lower in the
500 pc dust shell than in the star forming disk. The clearer shell morphology
at 11.3 micron, warm molecular hydrogen emission in the shell, and variation in
line ratios in the shell compared to those in the disk, confirm
spectroscopically that this shell is a separate coherent entity and is unlikely
to be a chance superposition of dust filaments. The physical conditions in the
shell are most similar to Galactic supernova remnants where blast waves
encounter molecular clouds. The lines requiring the highest level of
ionization, [NeV] and [OIV], are detected 20--25 arcsec north-east and
south-west of the nucleus and at position angles near the radio jet axis. Fine
structure line ratios and limits from this region suggest that the medium is
low density and illuminated by a hard radiation field at low ionization
parameter. These higher S molecular hydrogen pure rotational transitions are
also particularly bright in the same region as the [OIV] and [NeV] emission.
This suggests that the gas associated with the dust shell has been excited near
the jet axis and is part of an ionization cone.

Seyfert 2 nuclei is the viewing angle with respect to an obscuring structure
around the nucleus. High energy photons above 20 keV are not affected by this
absorption if the column is Compton thin, so their 30--100 keV spectra should
be the same. However, the observed spectra at high energies appear to show a
systematic difference, with Seyfert 1's having $\Gamma \sim $2.1 whereas
Seyfert 2's are harder with $\Gamma \sim$ 1.9. We estimate the mass and
accretion rate of Seyferts detected in these high energy samples and show that
they span a wide range in $L/L_{Edd}$. Both black hole binary systems and AGN
show a correlation between spectral softness and Eddington fraction, so these
samples are probably heterogeneous, spanning a range of intrinsic spectral
indices which are hidden in individual objects by poor signal-to-noise.
However, the mean Eddington fraction for the Seyfert 1's is higher than for the
Seyfert 2's, so the samples are consistent with this being the origin of the
softer spectra seen in Seyfert 1's. We stress that high energy spectra alone
are not necessarily a clean test of Unification schemes, but that the intrinsic
nuclear properties should also change with $L/L_{Edd}$

a log-normal distribution and a modified Schechter form, respectively. About
85% of the central galaxies and about 80% of the satellite galaxies in halos
with masses $M_h\ga 10^{14}\msunh$ are red galaxies. These numbers decrease to
50% and 40%, respectively, in halos with $M_h \sim 10^{12}\msunh$. For halos of
a given mass, the distribution of the luminosities of central galaxies, $L_c$,
has a dispersion of about 0.15 dex. The mean luminosity (stellar mass) of the
central galaxies scales with halo mass as $L_c\propto M_h^{0.17}$
($M_{*,c}\propto M_h^{0.22}$) for halos with masses $M\gg 10^{12.5}\msunh$, and
both relations are significantly steeper for less massive halos. We also
measure the luminosity (stellar mass) gap between the first and second
brightest (most massive) member galaxies, $\log L_1 - \log L_2$ ($\log
M_{*,1}-\log M_{*,2}$). These gap statistics, especially in halos with $M_h \la

studied in the past decades. Late-type stars have been assumed as the main
source of dust to the ISM, but recent observations show that supernova remnants
may play a role on the ISM dust feedback. In this work, I study the importance
of low and high mass stars, as well as their evolutionary phase, on the ISM
dust feedback process. I also determine the changes on the obtained results
considering different mass distribution functions and star formation history.
We describe a semi-empirical calculation of the relative importance of each
star at each evolutionary phase in the dust ejection to the ISM. I compare the
obtained results for two stellar mass distribution functions, the classic
Salpeter initial mass function and the present day mass function. I used the
evolutionary track models for each stellar mass, and the empirical mass-loss
rates and dust-to-gas ratio. The relative contribution of each stellar mass
depends on the used distribution. Ejecta from massive stars represent the most
important objects for the ISM dust replenishment using the Salpeter IMF. On the
other hand, for the present day mass function low and intermediate mass stars
are dominant. Late-type giant and supergiant stars dominate the ISM dust
feedback in our actual Galaxy, but this may not the case of galaxies
experiencing high star formation rates, or at high redshifts. In those cases,
SNe are dominant in the dust feedback process.

characterizing more systematically the circumstances under which they can
happen to be flavor universal. We consider both heterotic orbifold and
intersecting brane models, possibly with several anomalous and non-anomalous
spontaneously broken U(1) symmetries. The hidden sector is assumed to consist
of the universal dilaton, Kahler class and complex structure moduli, which are
supposed to break supersymmetry, and a minimal set of Higgs fields which
compensate the Fayet-Iliopoulos terms. We leave the superpotential that is
supposed to stabilize the hidden sector fields unspecified, but we carefully
take into account the relations implied by gauge invariance and the constraints
required for the existence of a metastable vacuum with vanishing cosmological
constant. The results are parametrized in terms of a constrained Goldstino
direction, suitably defined effective modular weights, and the U(1) charges and
shifts. We show that the effect induced by vector multiplets strongly depends
on the functional form of the Kahler potential for the Higgs fields. We find in
particular that whenever these are charged matter fields, like in heterotic
models, the effect is non-trivial, whereas when they are shifting moduli
fields, like in certain intersecting brane models, the effect may vanish.

fit radio galaxy and supernovae model parameters determined in the different

dimensionless coordinate distances to supernovae and radio galaxies, and
distance moduli to the radio galaxies. The distance moduli to the radio

sources, particularly high-redshift sources, in the samples. The constraints
obtained here with the combined radio galaxy plus supernovae data set in the

system and then measuring the position of the pointer. If the initial
wavefunction for the pointer is real, the mean displacement of the pointer is
proportional to the so-called weak value of the observable being measured. This
gives an intuitively direct way of understanding weak measurement. However, if
the initial pointer wavefunction takes complex values, the relationship between
pointer displacement and weak value is not quite so simple, as pointed out
recently by R. Jozsa. This is even more striking in the case of sequential weak
measurements. These are carried out by coupling several pointers at different
stages of evolution of the system, and the relationship between the products of
the measured pointer positions and the sequential weak values can become
extremely complicated for an arbitrary initial pointer wavefunction.
Surprisingly, all this complication vanishes when one calculates the cumulants
of pointer positions. These are directly proportional to the cumulants of
sequential weak values. This suggests that cumulants have a fundamental
physical significance for weak measurement.

Beam Maps (PBMs) of the following observables: line-of-sight velocities, the
corresponding velocity dispersion, and the stellar number density that are
functions of distance from the observer. We show that such maps can be used to
infer spiral structure parameters, such as pattern speed, solar phase angle,
and number of arms. The mean line-of-sight velocity and velocity dispersion are
affected by up to ~35 km/s which is well within the detectable limit for
forthcoming radial velocity surveys. One can measure the pattern speed by
searching for imprints of resonances. In the case of a two-armed spiral
structure it can be inferred from the radius of a high velocity dispersion ring
situated at the 2:1 ILR. This information, however, must be combined with
information related to the velocities and stellar number density in order to
distinguish from a four-armed structure. If the pattern speed is such that the
2:1 ILR is hidden inside the Galactic bulge the 2:1 OLR will be present in the
outer Galaxy and thus can equivalently be used to estimate the pattern speed.
Once the pattern speed is known the solar angle can be estimated from the
line-of-sight velocities and the number density PBMs. Forthcoming radial
velocity surveys are likely to provide powerful constraints of the structure of
the Milky Way disk.

  Pellegrini, G. Trinchieri","The Dearth of low-luminosity Globular Cluster LMXBs in NGC 3379","submitted to ApJ; 3 figs reloaded with correct author's list",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Our campaign of deep monitoring observations with {\it Chandra} of the nearby
elliptical galaxy NGC 3379 has lead to the detection of nine globular cluster
(GC) and 53 field low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the joint {\it
Hubble}/{\it Chandra} field of view of this galaxy. Comparing these
populations, we find a highly significant lack of GC LMXBs at the low (0.3-8
keV) X-ray luminosities (in the $\sim 10^{36}$ to $\sim 4\times10^{37}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ range) probed with our observations. This result conflicts with the
proposition that all LMXBs are formed in GCs. This lack of low-luminosity
sources in GCs is consistent with continuous LMXB formation due to stellar
interactions and with the transition from persistent to transient LMXBs. The
observed cut-off X-ray luminosity favors a predominance of LMXBs with
main-sequence donors instead of ultra-compact binaries with white-dwarf donors;
ultra-compacts could contribute significantly only if their disks are not
affected by X-ray irradiation. Our results suggest that current theories of
magnetic stellar wind braking may work rather better for the unevolved
companions of GC LMXBs than for field LMXBs and cataclysmic variables in the
Galaxy, where these companions may be somewhat evolved.
