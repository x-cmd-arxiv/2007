halo. However, the commonly used constant overdensity criterion does not
reflect the dynamical structure of haloes. Here we analyze dark matter
cosmological simulations in order to obtain properties of haloes of different
masses focusing on the size of the region with zero mean radial velocity. Dark
matter inside this region is stationary, and thus the mass of this region is a
much better approximation for the virial mass. We call this mass the static
mass to distinguish from the commonly used constant overdensity mass. We also
study the relation of this static mass with the traditional virial mass, and we
find that the matter inside galaxy-size haloes is underestimated by the virial
mass by nearly a factor of two. At redshift zero the virial mass is close to
the static mass for cluster-size haloes. The same pattern - large haloes having
M_vir > M_static - exists at all redshifts, but the transition mass M_0 = M_vir
= M_static decreases dramatically with increasing redshift. When rescaled to
the same M_0 haloes clearly demonstrate a self-similar behaviour, which in a
statistical sense gives a relation between the static and virial mass. To our
surprise we find that the abundance of haloes with a given static mass, i.e.
the static mass function, is very accurately fitted by the Press & Schechter
approximation at z=0, but this approximation breaks at higher redshifts.
Instead, the virial mass function is well fitted as usual by the Sheth & Tormen
approximation. We find an explanation why the static radius can be 2-3 times
larger as compared with the constant overdensity estimate. Applying the
non-stationary Jeans equation we find that the role of the pressure gradients
is significantly larger for small haloes.

non-degenerate submanifold $\cM$ of $\R^n$. In this paper the simultaneous
inhomogeneous analogue of Sprindzuk's conjecture is established. More
precisely, for any `inhomogeneous' vector $\bm\theta\in\R^n$ we prove that the
simultaneous inhomogeneous Diophantine exponent $w_{0}(\vv x, \bm\theta)= 1/n$
for almost every point $\vv x$ on $M$. The key result is an inhomogeneous
transference principle which enables us to deduce that the homogeneous exponent

encompasses Einstein-matter systems (comprising scalar and p-forms), and also

counterpart. Some emphasis is devoted to the nonextensive version of the less
known spectral density method whose effectiveness in exploring equilibrium and
transport properties of a wide variety of systems has been well established in
conventional classical and quantum many-body physics. To check how both the
equations of motion and the spectral density methods work to study the
$q$-induced nonextensivity effects in nontrivial many-body problems, we focus
on the equilibrium properties of a second-quantized model for a high-density
Bose gas with strong attraction between particles for which exact results exist
in extensive conditions. Remarkably, the contributions to several thermodynamic
quantities of the $q$-induced nonextensivity close to the extensive regime are
explicitly calculated in the low-temperature regime by overcoming the
calculation of the $q$ grand-partition function.

binary system then falls within the period gap of the orbital period
distribution of cataclysmic variables. From the maximum magnitude -- rate of

densities in a liquid ocean. However, nuclei with Z=8 or 10 may not burn until
higher densities where the crust is solid and electron capture has made the

and analysed maps of spatially distributed emission-lines, continuum emission

extinction, kinematics). We investigated the relation of these properties to
the spatial distribution and evolutionary stage of the massive stars. For the
first time we have detected the presence of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in this
galaxy. The peak of the ionized gas emission coincides with the location of the
WR bump. The region of the galaxy with lower dust extinction corresponds to the
region that shows the lowest values of velocity dispersion and radial velocity.
The overall picture suggests that the ISM of this region is being disrupted via
photoionization and stellar winds, leading to a spatial decoupling between
gas+stars and dust clouds. The bulk of dust appears to be located at the
boundaries of the region occupied by the probable ionizing cluster. We also
found that this region is associated to the nebular emission in HeII4686 and to
the intensity maximum of most emission lines. This indicates that the hard
ionizing radiation responsible for the HeII4686 nebular emission can be related
to the youngest stars. Within $\sim$ 0.4 x 0.3 kpc^2 in the central burst, we
derived O/H using direct determinations of Te[OIII]. We found abundances in the

  METHODS: VHE Observations of PG 1553+113 were made with the High Energy

spectroscopy of PG 1553+113 was performed in March 2006 with SINFONI, an
integral field spectrometer of the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile.
  RESULTS: A VHE signal, ~10 standard deviations, is detected by HESS during
the 2 years of observations (24.8 hours live time). The integral flux above 300
GeV is (4.6 +- 0.6{stat} +- 0.9{syst}) x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, corresponding
to ~3.4% of the flux from the Crab Nebula above the same threshold. The
time-averaged energy spectrum is measured from 225 GeV to ~1.3 TeV, and is
characterized by a very soft power law (photon index of Gamma = 4.5 +-
0.3{stat} +- 0.1{syst}). No evidence for any flux or spectral variations is

1553+113 could not be determined. Indeed, even though the measured SINFONI
spectrum is the most sensitive ever reported for this object at near infrared
wavelengths, and the sensitivity is comparable to the best spectroscopy at
other wavelengths, no absorption or emission lines were found in the H+K

processes and the theory of stochastic processes through the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem, it is necessary to invoke a postulate of the
Einstein-Boltzmann type. For convective processes hydrodynamic fluctuations
must be included, the velocity is a dynamical variable and although the entropy
cannot depend directly on the velocity, $\delta^{2} S$ will depend on velocity
variations. Some authors do not include velocity variations in $\delta^{2} S$,
and so have to introduce a non-thermodynamic function which replaces the
entropy and does depend on the velocity. At first sight, it seems that the
introduction of such a function requires a generalisation of the
Einstein-Boltzmann relation to be invoked. We review the reason why it is not
necessary to introduce such a function, and therefore why there is no need to
generalise the Einstein-Boltzmann relation in this way. We then obtain the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem which shows some differences as compared with
the non-convective case. We also show that $\delta^{2} S$ is a Liapunov
function when it includes velocity fluctuations.

presented, the main axiom being a Jacobi identity with odd formal variables in
which an N=2 superconformal shift is incorporated into the usual Jacobi
identity for a vertex superalgebra. It is shown that as a consequence of these
axioms, the N=2 vertex superalgebra is naturally a representation of the Lie
algebra isomorphic to the three-dimensional algebra of superderivations with
basis consisting of the usual conformal operator and the two N=2 superconformal
operators. The notion of N=2 Neveu-Schwarz vertex operator superalgebra with
two odd formal variables is introduced, and consequences of this notion are
derived. Various other formulations of the notion of N=2 (Neveu-Schwarz) vertex
(operator) superalgebra appearing in the mathematics and physics literature are
discussed, and several mistakes in the literature are noted and corrected. The
notion of ``N=2 (Neveu-Schwarz) vertex (operator) superalgebra with one odd
formal variable"" is formulated. It is shown that this formulation naturally
arises from alternate notions of N=1 superconformality and the continuous
deformation of an N=1 (Neveu-Schwarz) vertex (operator) superalgebra with one
odd formal variable. This notion is formulated to reflect the underlying N=1
superanalytic geometry, and it is shown that the equivalence of the notions of
N=2 (Neveu-Schwarz) vertex (operator) superalgebra with one and with two odd
formal variables reflects the equivalence of N=2 superconformal and N=1
superanalytic geometry. In particular we prove that the group of formal N=2
superconformal functions vanishing at zero and invertible in a neighborhood of
zero is isomorphic to a certain subgroup of N=1 superanalytic functions
vanishing at zero and invertible in a neighborhood of zero.

vectors and relay weighting matrix for the multiple-input multiple-output

In the first step, the direct link between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver
(Rx) is ignored and we show that the transmitter and the relay should map their
signals to the strongest right singular vectors of the Tx-relay and relay-Rx
channels. Based on the distributions of these vectors for independent
identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh channels, the Grassmannian codebooks
are used for quantizing and sending back the channel information to the
transmitter and the relay. The simulation results show that even a few number
of bits can considerably increase the link reliability in terms of bit error
rate. For the second step, the direct link is considered in the problem model
and we derive the optimization problem that identifies the optimal Tx
beamforming vector. For the i.i.d Rayleigh channels, we show that the solution
to this problem is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere and we justify the
appropriateness of the Grassmannian codebook (for determining the optimal
beamforming vector), both analytically and by simulation. Finally, a modified
quantizing scheme is presented which introduces a negligible degradation in the
system performance but significantly reduces the required number of feedback

depending on the lower luminosity cutoff and the slope, beta, of the
Holmberg-like luminosity scaling, R \propto L^beta. The observed distribution
of impact parameters, D, are such that several absorbing galaxies lie at D >
R_x and several non-absorbing galaxies lie at D < R_x. We deduced f_c must be
less than unity and obtain a mean of <f_c> ~ 0.5 for our sample. Moreover, the
data suggest halo radii of MgII absorbing galaxies do not follow a luminosity
scaling with beta in the range of 0.2-0.28, if f_c= 1 as previously reported.
However, provided f_c~0.5, we find that halo radii can remain consistent with a
Holmberg-like luminosity relation with beta ~ 0.2 and R* = R_x/sqrt(f_c)= 110
kpc. No luminosity scaling (beta=0) is also consistent with the observed
distribution of impact parameters if f_c < 0.37. The data support a scenario in
which gaseous halos are patchy and likely have non-symmetric geometric
distributions about the galaxies. We suggest halo gas distributions may not be
govern primarily by galaxy mass/luminosity but also by stochastic processes
local to the galaxy.

(with the same electron count as Si$_2$) and [CoSb]$^{4-}$ (the same electron
count as GaSb), are both structurally and electronically, zinc-blende
semiconductors. The electronic structure of half-metallic ferromagnets in this
structure type can then be described as semiconductors with stuffing magnetic
ions which have a local moment: For example, 22 electron MnNiSb can be written
Mn$^{3+}$[NiSb]$^{3-}$. The tendency in the 18 electron compound for a
semiconducting gap -- believed to arise from strong covalency -- is carried
over in MnNiSb to a tendency for a gap in one spin direction. Here we similarly
propose the systematic examination of 18-electron hexagonal compounds for
semiconducting gaps; these would be the ""stuffed wurtzite"" analogues of the
""stuffed zinc blende"" half-Heusler compounds. These semiconductors could then
serve as the basis for possibly new families of half-metallic compounds,
attained through appropriate replacement of non-magnetic ions by magnetic ones.
These semiconductors and semimetals with tunable charge carrier concentrations

scenario arises naturally in hierarchical cosmologies, as MBH formation
mechanisms typically are efficient in biased systems, which would later evolve
into massive galaxies. Nurture, in the guise of MBH ejections following MBH
mergers, provides an additional mechanism that is more effective for low mass,
satellite galaxies. The combination of inefficient formation, and lower
retention of MBHs, leads to the natural explanation of the distribution of
compact massive ob jects in Virgo galaxies. If MBHs arrive to the correlation
with the host mass and velocity dispersion during merger-triggered accretion
episodes, sustained tidal stripping of the host galaxies creates a population
of MBHs which lie above the expected scaling between the holes and their host
mass, suggesting a possible environmental dependence.

spirit of the work of Pontrjagin and Rokhlin. A new proof of the Hopf Invariant
One Theorem by J.F.Adams is obtained in all dimensions except 15 and 31.
  To prove that the stable Hopf invariant H: \Pi_n \to Z/2 vanishes for n>31,
we apply methods of geometric topology. The Pontrjagin-Thom construction along
with Hirsch's compression lemma identify every \alpha \in \Pi_n with the framed
bordism class of a framed immersion of a closed n-manifold into R^{n+k}, for
any given k>0. Its self-intersection M projects to an immersion f: M \to R^n
which is framed by k copies of a line bundle \kappa. It is well-known that
H(\alpha) = <w_1(\kappa)^{n-k}, [M]>. The self-intersection N of f is framed by
k copies of a plane bundle with structure group D_4. We observe that H(\alpha)
= <w_1(i^*\kappa)^{n-2k}, [\bar N]>, where i immerses the double cover \bar N
of N into M. The hardest part of the proof is to show that, after modifying f
in its skew-framed bordism class, the classifying map g: N \to K(D_4,1) factors
through K(Z/4,1), provided that n=2^l-1, l>5 and n-2k=15. This is achieved by
analyzing immersions in the regular homotopy class of f that approximate the
composition of the classifying map M \to RP^{n-k}, the projection of RP^{n-k}
onto the join of copies of S^1/(Z/4) (the standard sphere), and an embedding of
this join in R^n. The last step is proved with the quaternions.

spanning 0.18 < z < 1.24. We find that X-ray luminosity and ICM mass at a fixed
temperature evolve with redshift in a manner inconsistent with the standard
self-similar model of cluster formation. Both luminosity and ICM mass evolve
more slowly toward high redshift than the self-similar prediction. We find that
evolution in these two observables can be modeled by a simple evolution in the
cluster gas mass fraction. Excluding cluster cores from measurements results in
evolution more consistent with the self-similar model than when the entire
cluster is used, indicating that the fraction of clusters with cool cores
increases with time, or that cool cores become more developed over time in
those clusters that have them; this is supported by direct study of the
redshift dependence of central surface brightness, which increases in scatter
and magnitude at low redshift. We find that isophotal size-temperature
relations evolve differently according to which isophote is used, indicating
that the central and outer regions of cluster ICM evolve differently. We show
that constraints on the evolution of the gas fraction and isophotal
size-temperature relations constraints can be combined to measure cluster
distances, and thus to constrain cosmological parameters. There are indications
that scaling relation scatter decreases at higher redshift, suggesting that
merging is not the dominant source of cluster structural variation. Our results
provide constraints for simulations attempting to model cluster physics,
indicate some difficulties for cosmological studies that assume constant
cluster gas fractions, and point toward other potentially more robust uses of
clusters for cosmological applications. (Abridged)

the dimension), the logarithmic singularities of Schwartz kernels and Green
kernels of conformal invariant pseudodifferential operators are linear
combinations of Weyl conformal invariants, i.e., of local conformal invariants
arising from complete tensorial contractions of the covariant derivatives of
the Lorentz ambient metric of Fefferman-Graham. In even dimension and above the
critical weight exceptional local conformal invariants may further come into
play. As a consequence, this allows us to get invariant expressions for the
logarithmic singularities of the Green kernels of the GJMS operators (including
the Yamabe and Paneitz operators). In the second part, we prove analogues of
these results in CR geometry. Namely, we prove that the logarithmic
singularities of Schwartz kernels and Green kernels of CR invariant Heisenberg
pseudodifferential operators give rise to local CR invariants, and below the
critical weight are linear combinations of complete tensorial contractions of
the covariant derivatives of Fefferman's K\""alher-Lorentz ambient metric. As a

density, from several percent in whole giant molecular clouds to ~30 or more in

structure if there is a characteristic density as which individual stars become
well defined. Also in this case, the efficiency of star formation increases
with the dispersion of the density probability distribution function (pdf).
Models with log-normal pdf's illustrate these effects. The difference between
star formation in bound clusters and star formation in loose groupings is
attributed to a difference in cloud pressure, with higher pressures forming
more tightly bound clusters. This correlation accounts for the observed
increase in clustering fraction with star formation rate and with the
observation of Scaled OB Associations in low pressure environments. ``Faint
fuzzie'' star clusters, which are bound but have low densities, can form in
regions with high Mach numbers and low background tidal forces. The proposal by
Burkert, Brodie & Larsen (2005) that faint fuzzies form at large radii in
galactic collisional rings, satisfies these constraints.

fast-rotating main-sequence stars yield iron cores at collapse endowed with
high angular momentum. It is thought that high angular momentum and black hole
formation are critical ingredients of the collapsar model of long-soft
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Here, we present 2D multi-group,
flux-limited-diffusion MHD simulations of the collapse, bounce, and immediate
post-bounce phases of a 35-Msun collapsar-candidate model of Woosley & Heger.
We find that, provided the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) operates in the
differentially-rotating surface layers of the millisecond-period neutron star,
a magnetically-driven explosion ensues during the proto-neutron star phase, in
the form of a baryon-loaded non-relativistic jet, and that a black hole,
central to the collapsar model, does not form. Paradoxically, and although much
uncertainty surrounds stellar mass loss, angular momentum transport, magnetic
fields, and the MRI, current models of chemically homogeneous evolution at low
metallicity yield massive stars with iron cores that may have too much angular
momentum to avoid a magnetically-driven, hypernova-like, explosion in the
immediate post-bounce phase. We surmise that fast rotation in the iron core may
inhibit, rather than enable, collapsar formation, which requires a large
angular momentum not in the core but above it. Variations in the angular
momentum distribution of massive stars at core collapse might explain both the
diversity of Type Ic supernovae/hypernovae and their possible association with
a GRB. A corollary might be that, rather than the progenitor mass, the angular
momentum distribution, through its effect on magnetic field amplification,
distinguishes these outcomes.

comparing with a pure hydrodynamic approach we identify effects of hadronic

v_2(p_T) for identified hadrons, focusing on dissipative effects during the

observed mass-splitting is generated during the hadronic stage, due to build-up
of additional radial flow. The phi meson, having a small interaction cross
section, does not fully participate in this additional flow. As a result, it
violates the mass-ordering pattern for v_2(p_T) that is observed for other
hadron species. We also show that the early decoupling of the phi meson from
the hadronic rescattering dynamics leads to interesting and unambiguous
features in the p_T-dependence of the nuclear suppression factor R_AA and of
the phi/p ratio.

the case of air pollution. It uses a computer model involving ambient pollution

The output from the model comprises a set of daily exposures for a sample of
individuals from the population of interest. These daily exposures are
approximated by parametric distributions, so that the predictive exposure
distribution of a randomly selected individual can be generated. These
distributions are then incorporated into a hierarchical Bayesian framework

In practice, this has to be accomplished via noisy channels (such as optical
fibers) that generally result in exponential attenuation of quantum signals at
large distances. A special class of quantum error correction protocols--quantum
repeater protocols--can be used to overcome such losses. In this work, we
introduce a method for systematically optimizing existing protocols and
developing new, more efficient protocols. Our approach makes use of a dynamic
programming-based searching algorithm, the complexity of which scales only
polynomially with the communication distance, letting us efficiently determine
near-optimal solutions. We find significant improvements in both the speed and

structures are in ever increasing demand for analyzing the rapidly growing data
of protein structures. CLePAPS is a tool developed for this purpose. It
distinguishes itself from other existing algorithms by the use of
conformational letters, which are discretized states of 3D segmental structural
states. A letter corresponds to a cluster of combinations of the three angles
formed by C_alpha pseudobonds of four contiguous residues. A substitution
matrix called CLESUM is available to measure similarity between any two such
letters. CLePAPS regards an aligned fragment pair (AFP) as an ungapped string
pair with a high sum of pairwise CLESUM scores. Using CLESUM scores as the
similarity measure, CLePAPS searches for AFPs by simple string comparison. The
transformation which best superimposes a highly similar AFP can be used to
superimpose the structure pairs under comparison. A highly scored AFP which is
consistent with several other AFPs determines an initial alignment. CLePAPS
then joins consistent AFPs guided by their similarity scores to extend the
alignment by several `zoom-in' iteration steps. A follow-up refinement produces
the final alignment. CLePAPS does not implement dynamic programming. The
utility of CLePAPS is tested on various protein structure pairs.

atom-molecule equilibrium states are calculated analytically; molecular, mixed,
and dissociated phases are shown to appear for the change of the binding energy
of the molecules. The temperature dependences of the atom or molecule densities
are calculated numerically, and finite-temperature phase structures are
obtained of the atom-molecule equilibrium in the mixtures. The transition
temperatures of the atom or molecule Bose-Einstein condensations are also
evaluated from these results. Quantum-statistical deviations of the law of mass
action in atom-molecule equilibrium, which should be satisfied in mixtures of
classical Maxwell-Boltzmann gases, are calculated, and the difference in the
different types of quantum-statistical effects is clarified. Mean-field
calculations with interparticle interactions (atom-atom, atom-molecule, and
molecule-molecule) are formulated, where interaction effects are found to give
the linear density-dependent term in the effective molecular binding energies.
This method is applied to calculations of zero-temperature phase diagrams,
where new phases with coexisting local-equilibrium states are shown to appear
in the case of strongly repulsive interactions.

of stability for networks with arbitrary topologies. We prove that the max-min
fair RCP fluid model is globally stable in the absence of propagation delays,
and also derive a set of conditions for local stability when arbitrary
heterogeneous propagation delays are present. The network delay stability
result assumes that, at equilibrium, there is only one bottleneck link along
each route. Lastly, in the simpler setting of a single link, single delay
model, we investigate the impact of the loss of local stability via a Hopf

bottom of the triplet, which is a singlet of the Standard Model SU(2)_L group.
In addition, the right-handed sneutrino is the lightest slepton. By these
properties, the right-handed sneutrino is weakly interacting with the Standard
Model and stable without introduction of extra symmetry. From the
Spergel-Steinhardt condition, the typical mass limit $\leq 10 $ MeV is derived.
With self-interacting coupling constant fixed by supersymmetry, this limit is
deduced without any approximation. The condition for thermal generated
self-interacting dark matter in the Universe is also obtained.

macroscopic properties of polymeric solutions. This screening depends not only
on the polymer concentration but has a dynamic nature. In the present work, a

of a test polymer is solved together with the Brinkman's equation for the
solvent velocity that takes into account the presence of other coils in

found. A tendency to the screening of HI is demonstrated on the coil diffusion

concentration of the coils they both show a transition to the exact Rouse

0101+039, a subdwarf B star + white dwarf binary from its tiny (0.025 %) light

estimation of covariances between a large number of assets, whose histories can
greatly vary in length. Such data are said to follow a monotone missingness
pattern, under which the likelihood has a convenient factorization. Upon
further assuming that asset returns are multivariate normally distributed, with
histories at least as long as the total asset count, maximum likelihood (ML)
estimates are easily obtained by performing repeated ordinary least squares
(OLS) regressions, one for each asset. Things get more interesting when there
are more assets than historical returns. OLS becomes unstable due to
rank--deficient design matrices, which is called a ""big p small n"" problem. We
explore remedies that involve making a change of basis, as in principal
components or partial least squares regression, or by applying shrinkage
methods like ridge regression or the lasso. This enables the estimation of
covariances between large sets of assets with histories of essentially
arbitrary length, and offers improvements in accuracy and interpretation. We
further extend the method by showing how external factors can be incorporated.
This allows for the adaptive use of factors without the restrictive assumptions
common in factor models. Our methods are demonstrated on randomly generated
data, and then benchmarked by the performance of balanced portfolios using real
historical financial returns. An accompanying R package called monomvn,
containing code implementing the estimators described herein, has been made

regular $R$ is a subset of the fraction $F$ if $FR = R$, which in turn is
equivalent to $\sum_t F(t)R(t) = \sum_t R(t)$. If $\mathcal H = \{\alpha_1 >...

$(\log t)^{2}$ asymptotic behaviour if the distribution of the RE is not

applied parallel to the specimens. Two structures have been studied: FM-SC-FM

an underlying parameter that may falsify the interpretation of the transport
properties of relevant FM-SC-FM TLs and FM-SC BLs investigated in the recent

peaks in the TLs relates to the suppression of superconductivity mainly due to
the magnetic coupling of the two FM layers as the out-of-plane rotation of
their magnetizations takes place across the coercive field where stray fields
emerge in their whole surface owing to the multidomain magnetic state that they
acquire.

challenging problem and much attention has been paid to it. The most
fundamental difference between this application and highly successful
astrophysical and upper atmospheric remote sensing is the line width associated
with atmospheric pressure broadening, ~ 5 GHz in all spectral regions. In this
paper, we discuss quantitatively a new approach that would use a short pulse
infrared laser to modulate the submillimeter/terahertz (SMM/THz) spectral
absorptions on the time scale of atmospheric relaxation. We show that such a
scheme has three important attributes: (1) The time resolved pump makes it
possible and efficient to separate signal from atmospheric and system clutter,
thereby gaining as much as a factor of 10^6 in sensitivity, (2) The 3-D
information matrix (infrared pump laser frequency, SMM/THz probe frequency, and
time resolved SMM/THz relaxation) can provide orders of magnitude greater
specificity than a sensor that uses only one of these three dimensions, and (3)
The congested and relatively weak spectra associated with large molecules can
actually be an asset because the usually deleterious effect of their
overlapping spectra can be used to increase signal strength.

simultaneous inverse energy and enstrophy ranges present in the Lagrangian and

ratios of the real-space moments {\em local} exponents, indicating that though
the real-space moments are not scaling ``nicely'', the relative behavior of the
velocity difference probability distribution functions is changing over very
short ranges of length scales. Utilizing this technique we show that the ratios
of the local exponents for Eulerian moments in weak two-dimensional turbulence
behave in agreement with Kolmogorov predictions over the spectrally identified
ranges. The Lagrangian local exponent ratios, however, behave in a different
manner compared to their Eulerian counterparts, and deviate significantly from

antikaon-nuclear potential of order 150-200 MeV in nuclear matter is suggested
by fits to the kaonic-atom data, with interesting possible repercussions on
kaon condensation and on the evolution of strangeness in high-density stars.
The case for relatively narrow, deeply bound antikaon atomic states is made,
essentially independent of the nuclear potential depth. Dynamical models for
calculating binding energies and widths of antikaon-nuclear states are
discussed and a lower bound of approximately 50 MeV on the width is
established. For Sigma atoms, the fitted potential becomes repulsive inside the

implying that Sigma hyperons generally do not bind in nuclei. This repulsion
significantly affects calculated compositions and masses of neutron stars.

ground-based direct imaging searches for brown dwarf and planetary mass
companions to stars. The technique takes advantage of absorption features that
exist in these cool objects, but not in stars, and is normally implemented
through simultaneous narrow-band imagers in 2 to 4 adjacent channels. However,
by instead using an integral field unit, different spectral features could be
used depending on the actual spectrum, potentially leading to greater
flexibility and stronger detection limits. In this paper, we present the
results of a test of spectral differential imaging using the SINFONI integral
field unit at the VLT to study the nearby active star L449-1. No convincing
companion candidates are found. We find that the method provides a 3 sigma
contrast limit of 7.5 mag at 0.35"", which is about 1.5 mag lower than for

reasons for this, and the implications. In addition, we use the SINFONI data to
constrain the spectral type in the NIR for L 449-1, and find a result between

from group rings. They consist primarily of two types: zero-divisor and
unit-derived codes. Previous codes from group rings focused on ideals; for
example cyclic codes are ideals in the group ring over a cyclic group. The
fresh focus is on the encodings themselves, which only under very limited
conditions result in ideals. We use the result that a group ring is isomorphic
to a certain well-defined ring of matrices, and thus every group ring element
has an associated matrix. This allows matrix algebra to be used as needed in
the study and production of codes, enabling the creation of standard generator
and check matrices. Group rings are a fruitful source of units and
zero-divisors from which new codes result. Many code properties, such as being
LDPC or self-dual, may be expressed as properties within the group ring thus
enabling the construction of codes with these properties. The methods are
general enabling the construction of codes with many types of group rings.
There is no restriction on the ring and thus codes over the integers, over
matrix rings or even over group rings themselves are possible and fruitful.

code is written - e.g., the order of clauses, the order of literals in a
clause, the use of cuts or negations - influences its efficiency. Furthermore,
different optimization techniques may be redundant or conflicting when they are
applied together, depending on the way a procedure is called - e.g., inserting
cuts and enabling indexing. We present an optimiser, based on abstract
interpretation, that automatically performs safe code transformations of Prolog
procedures in the context of some class of input calls. The method is more
effective if procedures are annotated with additional information about modes,
types, sharing, number of solutions and the like. Thus the approach is similar
