Consistency requires constructing N=4 SYM in the D7 supergravity background and

experience multiple mergers during their cosmic assembly, then BH binaries
should be common albeit temporary features of most galactic bulges.
Observationally, the paucity of active BH pairs points toward binary lifetimes
far shorter than the Hubble time, indicating rapid inspiral of the BHs down to
the domain where gravitational waves lead to their coalescence. Here, we review
a series of studies on the dynamics of massive BHs in gas-rich galaxy mergers
that underscore the vital role played by a cool, gaseous component in promoting
the rapid formation of the BH binary. The BH binary is found to reside at the
center of a massive self-gravitating nuclear disc resulting from the collision
of the two gaseous discs present in the mother galaxies. Hardening by
gravitational torques against gas in this grand disc is found to continue down
to sub-parsec scales. The eccentricity decreases with time to zero and when the
binary is circular, accretion sets in around the two BHs. When this occurs,
each BH is endowed with it own small-size (< 0.01 pc) accretion disc comprising
a few percent of the BH mass. Double AGN activity is expected to occur on an
estimated timescale of < 1 Myr. The double nuclear point-like sources that may
appear have typical separation of < 10 pc, and are likely to be embedded in the
still ongoing starburst. We note that a potential threat of binary stalling, in
a gaseous environment, may come from radiation and/or mechanical energy
injections by the BHs. Only short-lived or sub-Eddington accretion episodes can
guarantee the persistence of a dense cool gas structure around the binary
necessary for continuing BH inspiral.

that a cosmological constant in a spatially flat universe provides a good

of an inhomogeneous disk leads to differences in the formation of a wind, most
noticeably the absence of the ``blow-out'' effect seen in homogeneous models. A
wind forms from a series of small bubbles that propagate into the tenuous gas
between dense clouds in the disk. These bubbles merge and follow the path of
least resistance out of the disk, before flowing freely into the halo.
Filaments are formed from disk gas that is broken up and accelerated into the
outflow. These filaments are distributed throughout a biconical structure
within a more spherically distributed hot wind. The distribution of the
inhomogeneous interstellar medium in the disk is important in determining the
morphology of this wind, as well as the distribution of the filaments. While
higher resolution simulations are required in order to ascertain the importance
of mixing processes, we find that soft X-ray emission arises from gas that has
been mass-loaded from clouds in the disk, as well as from bow shocks upstream
of clouds, driven into the flow by the ram pressure of the wind, and the
interaction between these shocks.

help in constraining the dominant mechanism at the epochs of their assembly.
The structural parameters of a magnitude-limited sample of 148 unbarred S0--Sb
galaxies were derived in order to study the correlations between bulges and
disks as well as the probability distribution function (PDF) of the intrinsic
equatorial ellipticity of bulges. It is presented a new fitting algorithm
(GASP2D) to perform the two-dimensional photometric decomposition of galaxy
surface-brightness distribution. This was assumed to be the sum of the
contribution of a bulge and disk component characterized by elliptical and
concentric isophotes with constant (but possibly different) ellipticity and
position angles. Bulge and disk parameters of the sample galaxies were derived
from the J-band images which were available in the Two Micron All Sky Survey.
The PDF of the equatorial ellipticity of the bulges was derived from the
distribution of the observed ellipticities of bulges and misalignments between
bulges and disks. Strong correlations between the bulge and disk parameters
were found. About 80% of bulges in unbarred lenticular and
early-to-intermediate spiral galaxies are not oblate but triaxial ellipsoids.
Their mean axial ratio in the equatorial plane is <B/A> = 0.85. There is not
significant dependence of their PDF on morphology, light concentration, and
luminosity. The interplay between bulge and disk parameters favors scenarios in
which bulges assembled from mergers and/or grew over long times through disk
secular evolution. But all these mechanisms have to be tested against the
derived distribution of bulge intrinsic ellipticities.

gaps are from the intergalactic medium (IGM) where the density of neutral

where the transmitted leaks come from is still unclear so far. We demonstrate
that leaking can originate from the lowest density voids in the IGM as well as
the ionized patches around ionizing sources using semi-analytical simulations.
If leaks were produced in lowest density voids, the IGM might already be highly
ionized, and the ionizing background should be almost uniform; in contrast, if
leaks come from ionized patches, the neutral fraction of IGM would be still
high, and the ionizing background is significantly inhomogeneous. Therefore,
the origin of leaking is crucial to determining the epoch of
inhomogeneous-to-uniform transition of the the ionizing photon background. We
show that the origin could be studied with the statistical features of leaks.
Actually, Ly$\alpha$ leaks can be well defined and described by the equivalent
width $W$ and the full width of half area $W_{\rm H}$, both of which are less
contaminated by instrumental resolution and noise. It is found that the
distribution of $W$ and $W_{\rm H}$ of Ly$\alpha$ leaks are sensitive to the
modeling of the ionizing background. We consider four representative
reionization models. It is concluded that the leak statistics provides an
effective tool to probe the evolutionary history of reionization at

discriminate between these two possibilities. At energies within a few MeV of

constants associated with the B -> K transitions. The line shapes of the X
resonance depend on its decay channel; they are different for J/psi pi+ pi-,

that a detonation ignites in that layer before the Chandrasekhar mass is

+ O core. By means of one- and two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we
investigate the robustness of this explosion mechanism for generic 1-M_sun
models and analyze its observable predictions. Also a resolution dependence in
numerical simulations is analyzed. The propagation of thermonuclear detonation
fronts, both in helium and in the carbon-oxygen mixture, is computed by means
of both a level-set function and a simplified description for nuclear
reactions. The decision whether a secondary detonation is triggered in the
white dwarf's core or not is made based on criteria given in the literature. In
a parameter study involving different initial flame geometries for He-shell
masses of 0.2 and 0.1 M_sun, we find that a secondary detonation ignition is a
very robust process. Converging shock waves originating from the detonation in
the He shell generate the conditions for a detonation near the center of the
white dwarf in most of the cases considered. Finally, we follow the complete
evolution of three selected models with 0.2 M_sun of He through the
C/O-detonation phase and obtain nickel-masses of about 0.40 to 0.45 M_sun.
Although we have not done a complete scan of the possible parameter space, our
results show that sub-Chandrasekhar models are not good candidates for normal
or sub-luminous type Ia supernovae. The chemical composition of the ejecta
features significant amounts of nickel in the outer layers at high expansion
velocities, which is inconsistent with near-maximum spectra. (abbreviated)

estoration of chiral and axial symmetries are investigated within the SU(3)
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The regularization consists in using an infinite
cutoff in the integrals that are convergent at finite temperature, a procedure
that allows one to take into account the effects of high momentum quarks at
high temperatures. It is found that the critical temperature for the phase
transition is closer to lattice results than the one obtained with the
conventional regularization, and the restoration of chiral and axial
symmetries, signaled by the behavior of several observables, occurs
simultaneously and at a higher temperature. The restoration of the axial
symmetry appears as a natural consequence of the full recovering of the chiral
symmetry that was dynamically broken. By using an additional ansatz that
simulates instanton suppression effects, by means of a convenient temperature
dependence of the anomaly coefficient, we found that the restoration of U(2)
symmetry is shifted to lower values, but the dominant effect at high
temperatures comes from the new regularization that enhances the decrease of
quark condensates, especially in the strange sector.

task. However, for a certain type of (sufficiently) good codes an efficient
decoding algorithm with near optimal performance exists. These codes are
defined via a combination of constituent codes with low complexity trellis
representations. Their decoding algorithm is an instance of (loopy) belief
propagation and is based on an iterative transfer of constituent beliefs. The
beliefs are thereby given by the symbol probabilities computed in the
constituent trellises. Even though weak constituent codes are employed close to
optimal performance is obtained, i.e., the encoder/decoder pair (almost)
achieves the information theoretic capacity. However, (loopy) belief
propagation only performs well for a rather specific set of codes, which limits
its applicability.
  In this paper a generalisation of iterative decoding is presented. It is
proposed to transfer more values than just the constituent beliefs. This is
achieved by the transfer of beliefs obtained by independently investigating
parts of the code space. This leads to the concept of discriminators, which are
used to improve the decoder resolution within certain areas and defines
discriminated symbol beliefs. It is shown that these beliefs approximate the
overall symbol probabilities. This leads to an iteration rule that (below
channel capacity) typically only admits the solution of the overall decoding
problem. Via a Gauss approximation a low complexity version of this algorithm
is derived. Moreover, the approach may then be applied to a wide range of
channel maps without significant complexity increase.

constructed from a LTB solution. We study the propagation of photons in the

observables. Following a fitting procedure based on light-cone averages, we
find that the the expansion scalar is unaffected by the inhomogeneities. This
is because of spherical symmetry. However, the light-cone average of the
density as a function of redshift is affected by inhomogeneities. The effect
arises because, as the universe evolves, a photon spends more and more time in
the (large) voids than in the (thin) high-density structures. The
phenomenological homogeneous model describing the light-cone average of the
density is similar to the concordance model. Although the sole source in the
swiss-cheese model is matter, the phenomenological homogeneous model behaves as
if it has a dark-energy component. Finally, we study how the equation of state
of the phenomenological model depends on the size of the inhomogeneities, and
find that the equation-of-state parameters w_0 and w_a follow a power-law
dependence with a scaling exponent equal to unity. That is, the equation of
state depends linearly on the distance the photon travels through voids. We
conclude that within our toy model, the holes must have a present size of about
250 Mpc to be able to mimic the concordance model.

observation allows the construction of a UV convergent theory of corrections to

shown to be the sum of: (i) a $k$-independent contribution that arises from a
renormalization of the effective $\chi$ parameter, (ii) a $k$-dependent
contribution that arises from a renormalization of monomer statistical segment
lengths, (iii) a contribution proportional to $k^{2}$ that arises from a

All but one are detected at S/N>3; though 3 were not observed long enough to
support detailed analysis. Surface brightness profiles are fit to beta-models.
Integrated spectra are extracted within R(2500), and Tx and Lx information is
obtained. We derive gas and total masses within R(2500) and R(500).
Cosmologically corrected scaling relations are investigated, and we find the
RCS clusters to be consistent with self-similar scaling expectations. However
discrepancies exist between the RCS sample and lower-z X-ray selected samples
for relationships involving Lx, with the higher-z RCS clusters having lower Lx
for a given Tx. In addition, we find that gas mass fractions within R(2500) for
the high-z RCS sample are lower than expected by a factor of ~2. This suggests
that the central entropy of these high-z objects has been elevated by processes
such as pre-heating, mergers, and/or AGN outbursts, that their gas is still
infalling, or that they contain comparatively more baryonic matter in the form
of stars. Finally, relationships between red-sequence optical richness (Bgc)
and X-ray properties are fit to the data. For systems with measured Tx, we find
that optical richness correlates with both Tx and mass, having a scatter of
~30% with mass for both X-ray and optically-selected clusters. However we also
find that X-ray luminosity is not well correlated with richness, and that
several of our sample appear to be significantly X-ray faint.

and/or distribution of the dust. Specifically, these galaxies have more hot
dust and/or very small grains and less PAH emission than either spiral or
higher luminosity starburst galaxies. As has been shown in previous studies,
there is a gradual decrease in PAH emission as a function of metallicity.
Because much of the energy from star formation in galaxies is re-radiated in
the mid-infrared, star-formation rate indicators based on both line and

Balbus (2000) demonstrated that plasmas in which the temperature increases in

flux and the fastest growing mode has a growth time of order the local

weakly magnetized low collisionality plasmas are unstable on a dynamical time
to magnetically-mediated buoyancy instabilities. The instability described in

break forms early on and persists throughout the evolution, moving outward as
more gas is able to cool and add mass to the disk. The parameters of the break
are in excellent agreement with observations. The break corresponds with a
rapid drop in the star formation rate associated with a drop in the cooled gas
surface density, but the outer exponential is populated by stars that were
scattered outward on nearly circular orbits from the inner disk by spiral arms.
The resulting profile and its associated break are therefore a consequence of
the interplay between a radial star formation cutoff and redistribution of
stellar mass by secular processes. A consequence of such evolution is a sharp
change in the radial mean stellar age profile at the break radius.

affected by the late Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (lISW) effect caused by any
time-variation of the gravitational potential on linear scales. Dark energy is
not the only source of lISW, since massive neutrinos induce a small decay of
the potential on small scales during both matter and dark energy domination. In
this work, we study the prospect of using the cross-correlation between CMB and
galaxy density maps as a tool for constraining the neutrino mass. On the one
hand massive neutrinos reduce the cross-correlation spectrum because
free-streaming slows down structure formation; on the other hand, they enhance
it through their change in the effective linear growth. We show that in the
observable range of scales and redshifts, the first effect dominates, but the
second one is not negligible. We carry out an error forecast analysis by
fitting some mock data inspired by the Planck satellite, Dark Energy Survey
(DES) and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The inclusion of the
cross-correlation data from Planck and LSST increases the sensitivity to the
neutrino mass m_nu by 38% (and to the dark energy equation of state w by 83%)
with respect to Planck alone. The correlation between Planck and DES brings a
far less significant improvement. This method is not potentially as good for
detecting m_nu as the measurement of galaxy, cluster or cosmic shear power
spectra, but since it is independent and affected by different systematics, it
remains potentially interesting if the total neutrino mass is of the order of
0.2 eV; if instead it is close to the lower bound from atmospheric
oscillations, m_nu ~ 0.05 eV, we do not expect the ISW-galaxy correlation to be
ever sensitive to m_nu.

correlated with both the optical metallicity indicator [MgFe]' and central
velocity dispersion; (2) in the same galaxies, the K-band Fe features saturate
in galaxies with sigma > 150 km/s while Na I (and [MgFe]') continues to
increase; (3) [Si/Fe] (and possibly [Na/Fe]) is larger in all observed Fornax
galaxies than in Galactic open clusters with near-solar metallicity; (4) in
various near-IR diagnostic diagrams, galaxies with signatures of a young
stellar component (strong Hbeta, weak [MgFe]') are clearly separated from
galaxies with purely old stellar populations; furthermore, this separation is
consistent with the presence of an increased number of M-giant stars (most
likely to be thermally pulsating AGB stars); (5) the near-IR diagrams discussed

the presence of signals in the f~0.5-1.5 mHz range. Implementation of an
alternative approach in data processing, as well as combination of the MOST

closely matches the amplitudes inferred from the ground-based spectroscopy and

photometric redshifts for a SNAP like mission. We focus on how the accuracy of
the photometric redshifts depends on the magnitude limit and signal-to-noise
ratio, wave-length coverage, number of filters and their shapes and observed
galaxy type. We use simulated galaxy catalogs constructed to reproduce observed
galaxy luminosity functions from GOODS, and derive photometric redshifts using
a template fitting method. By using a catalog that resembles real data, we can
estimate the expected number density of galaxies for which photometric
redshifts can be derived. We find that the accuracy of photometric redshifts is
strongly dependent on the signal-to-noise (S/N) (i.e., S/N>10 is needed for
accurate photometric redshifts). The accuracy of the photometric redshifts is
also dependent on galaxy type, with smaller scatter for earlier type galaxies.
Comparing results using different filter sets, we find that including the
U-band is important for decreasing the fraction of outliers, i.e.,
``catastrophic failures''. Using broad overlapping filters with resolution
~4gives better photometric redshifts compared to narrower filters (resolution
>~5) with the same integration time. We find that filters with square response
curves result in a slightly higher scatter, mainly due to a higher fraction of
outliers at faint magnitudes. We also compare a 9-filter set to a 17-filter
set, where we assume that the available exposure time per filter in the latter
set is half that of the first set. We find that the 9-filter set gives more
accurate redshifts for a larger number of objects and reaches higher redshift,
while the 17-filter set is gives better results at bright magnitudes.

states. We first examine in detail the two-channel problem as a toy-model to
clarify the issues and to remedy common mistakes made in earlier literature.
Realistic multichannel problems are too challenging for quantitative analysis.
To cope with mathematical complexity, we introduce a method of approximation
that is applicable to the case where one prominant inelastic channel dominates

the decay B to pi K fed by the intermediate states of a charmed meson pair.

M_delta-T_X relationships obtained from low-redshift data. Assuming a single
cluster, X-ray mass estimates are a factor of ~10-100 below the red-sequence
optical richness mass estimate. Optical spectroscopy reveals that this cluster
comprises two components which are close enough to perhaps be physically
associated. We present simple modeling of this two-component system which then
yields an X-ray mass and optical richness consistent with expectations from
statistical samples of lower redshift clusters. An unexpectedly high gas mass
fraction is measured assuming a single cluster, which independently supports

optical fields with short and with long range correlations. For short range
screening the charge variance in a circular region with radius $R$ grows
linearly with $R$, instead of with $R^{2}$ as expected in the absence of
screening; for long range screening it grows faster than $R$: for a field whose
autocorrelation function is the zero order Bessel function J_{0}, the charge
variance grows as R ln R$. A J_{0} correlation function is not attainable in
practice, but we show how to generate an optical field whose correlation
function closely approximates this form. The charge variance can be measured by
counting positive and negative singularities inside the region A, or more
easily by counting signed zero crossings on the perimeter of A. \For the first
method the charge variance is calculated by integration over the charge
correlation function C(r), for the second by integration over the zero crossing
correlation function Gamma(r). Using the explicit forms of C(r) and of Gamma(r)
we show that both methods of calculation yield the same result. We show that
for short range screening the zero crossings can be counted along a straight
line whose length equals P, but that for long range screening this
simplification no longer holds. We also show that for realizable optical
fields, for sufficiently small R, the charge variance goes as R^2, whereas for
sufficiently large R, it grows as R. These universal laws are applicable to
both short and pseudo-long range correlation functions.

disorder is to create 'islands' of strong superconductivity, coupled by regions

throughout the material, leading to an insulator. On the other hand, when
disorder is strong, superconductivity persists in the islands, and the effect
of a magnetic field is to suppress the coupling between them, resulting in
strong superconducting phase fluctuations, again leading to an insulating
state. These findings may be relevant to the high-temperature superconductors,
where intrinsic disorder may play a role.

  http://acs.pha.jhu.edu/~mkjee/acs_psf/acspsf.pdf",,"10.1086/524849",,"astro-ph",,"  We describe the time- and position-dependent point spread function (PSF)
variation of the Wide Field Channel (WFC) of the Advanced Camera for Surveys
(ACS) with the principal component analysis (PCA) technique. The time-dependent
change is caused by the temporal variation of the $HST$ focus whereas the
position-dependent PSF variation in ACS/WFC at a given focus is mainly the
result of changes in aberrations and charge diffusion across the detector,
which appear as position-dependent changes in elongation of the astigmatic core
and blurring of the PSF, respectively. Using >400 archival images of star
cluster fields, we construct a ACS PSF library covering diverse environments of
the $HST$ observations (e.g., focus values). We find that interpolation of a
small number ($\sim20$) of principal components or ``eigen-PSFs'' per exposure
can robustly reproduce the observed variation of the ellipticity and size of
the PSF. Our primary interest in this investigation is the application of this
PSF library to precision weak-lensing analyses, where accurate knowledge of the
instrument's PSF is crucial. However, the high-fidelity of the model judged
from the nice agreement with observed PSFs suggests that the model is
potentially also useful in other applications such as crowded field stellar
photometry, galaxy profile fitting, AGN studies, etc., which similarly demand a
fair knowledge of the PSFs at objects' locations. Our PSF models, applicable to
any WFC image rectified with the Lanczos3 kernel, are publicly available.

compared with that through metal-band-insulator interfaces. For band
insulators, rectification has been known to occur owing to a Schottky barrier,
which is produced by the work-function difference. For Mott insulators,
however, qualitatively different current-voltage characteristics are obtained.
Theoretically, we use the one-dimensional Hubbard model for a Mott insulator
and attach to it the tight-binding model for metallic electrodes. A Schottky
barrier is introduced by a solution to the Poisson equation with a simplified
density-potential relation. The current density is calculated by solving the
time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation. We mainly use the time-dependent
Hartree-Fock approximation, and also use exact many-electron wave functions on
small systems for comparison. Rectification is found to be strongly suppressed
even for large work-function differences. We show its close relationship with
the fact that field-effect injections into one-dimensional Mott insulators are
ambipolar. Experimentally, we fabricated asymmetric contacts on top of single

the intrinsic X-ray spectra are well modelled by disc blackbody emission, its

reflection. These spectra are strongly modified by absorption and reprocessing
in the stellar wind, which we model using the photoionization code cloudy. The
form of the observed spectra implies the wind is composed of two phases. A hot
tenuous plasma containing most of the wind mass is required to account for the
observed features of very strongly ionized Fe. Small dense cool clumps filling
<0.01 of the volume are required to absorb the soft X-ray excess, which is
emitted by the hot phase but not present in the data. The total mass-loss rate

embedded sources (HH26IRS, HH34IRS and HH46IRS) belonging to different

to investigate the source accretion and ejection properties and their
connection. We used VLT-ISAAC spectra (R~9000, H and K bands) to derive in a
self-consistent way parameters like the star luminosity, the accretion
luminosity and the mass accretion rate. Mass loss rates have also been
estimated from the analysis of different emission features. The spectra present
several emission lines but no photospheric features in absorption, indicating a
large veiling in H and K. We detected features commonly observed in jet-driving
sources (HI,[FeII],H_2,CO) and also a number of emission lines due to permitted
atomic transitions, like NaI and TiI. The NaI 2.2um doublet is observed along
with CO(2-0) band-head emission, indicating a common origin in an inner gaseous
disc heated by accretion. We find that accretion provides ~50% and ~80% of the
bolometric luminosity in HH26IRS and HH34IRS, as expected for accreting young
objects.Mass accretion and loss rates spanning 10^-8 - 10^-6 Msun/yr have been

HH46IRS, numbers that are in the range of values predicted by MHD jet-launching
models and found in the most active classical T Tauri stars. Comparison with
other similar studies seems to indicate that Class Is actually having
accretion- dominated luminosities are a limited number. Although the analysed

beam with well defined incident velocity is suddenly removed, the density
profile develops during the time evolution an oscillatory pattern known as
diffraction in time. The interference fringes are suppressed or their
visibility is diminished by several effects such as averaging over a
distribution of incident velocities, apodization of the aperture function,
atom-atom interactions, imperfect reflection or environmental noise. However,
when the mirror moves with finite velocity along the direction of propagation
of the beam, the visibility of the fringes is enhanced. For mirror velocities
below beam velocity, as used for slowing down the beam, the matter wave splits
into three regions separated by space-time points with classical analogues. For
mirror velocities above beam velocity a visibility enhancement occurs without a
classical counterpart. When the velocity of the beam approaches that of the
mirror the density oscillations rise by a factor 1.8 over the stationary value.

they correspond to the first return maps of the vertical flow on a transverse

provides a powerful tool to analyze the Teichmueller geodesic flow on the
moduli space of Abelian differentials. Several major results have been proved

  Danthony and Nogueira introduced in 1988 a natural generalization of interval
exchange transformations, namely the linear involutions. These maps are related
to general measured foliations on surfaces (orientable or not). In this paper
we are interested by such maps related to geodesic flow on (orientable) flat
surfaces with Z/2Z linear holonomy. We relate geometry and dynamics of such

the Rauzy-Veech induction and give an efficient combinatorial characterization
of its attractors. We establish a natural bijection between the extended Rauzy

evolution can only start from a Killing horizon, (ii) matter is absent at the
horizon, and (iii) matter can only appear in the cosmological region due to
interaction with vacuum. The latter is understood phenomenologically as a fluid
whose stress tensor is insensitive to boosts in a particular direction. We also
argue that matter is absent in a static region beyond the horizon. All this
generalizes the observations recently obtained for a mixture of dust and a
vacuum fluid. If, however, we admit the existence of phantom matter, its
certain special kinds (with the parameter $w \leq -3$) are consistent with a
Null Big Bang without interaction with vacuum (or without vacuum fluid at all).
Then in the static region there is matter with $w\geq -1/3$. Alternatively, the
evolution can begin from a horizon in an infinitely remote past, leading to a
scenario combining the features of a Null Big Bang and an emergent universe.

spanned over R by [X,f,C], for X a compact Kuranishi space with corners, f : X
--> Y a submersion, and C ""co-gauge-fixing data"". We also define simpler
theories of Kuranishi bordism KB_*(Y;R) and Kuranishi cobordism KB^*(Y;R), for
R a commutative ring. These are new topological invariants, and we show they
are very large.
  These theories are powerful new tools in symplectic geometry. Defining
virtual cycles and chains for moduli spaces of J-holomorphic curves is trivial
in Kuranishi (co)homology. There is no need to perturb moduli spaces, and no
problems with transversality. This gives major simplifications in Lagrangian
Floer cohomology.

on HST ACS data. We constrain the lens model using 8 previously known multiply
imaged systems, of which 7 have spectroscopically confirmed redshifts. In
addition, we propose five candidate multiply imaged systems and estimate their
redshifts using our mass model. The model parameters are optimized in the
source plane by a bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain as implemented in the the
publicly available software Lenstool. We find rms=0.""12 for the scatter of the
sources in the source plane, which translates into rms=1.""49 between the
predicted and measured image positions in the image plane. We find that the
projected mass distribution of Abell 2218 is bimodal, which is supported by an
analysis of the light distribution. We also find evidence for two structures in
velocity space, separated by ~1000 km/s, corresponding to the two large scale
dark matter clumps. We find that the lensing constraints can not be well
reproduced using only dark matter halos associated with the cluster galaxies,
but that the dark matter is required to be smoothly distributed in large scale
halos. At 100"" the enclosed projected mass is 3.8e14 solar masses. At that
radius, the large scale halos contribute ~85% of the mass. We find that the
model is not very sensitive to the fainter galaxy sized halos, unless they
locally perturb a given multiply imaged system. Therefore, dark galaxy sized
substructure can be reliably constrained only if it locally perturbs one of the
systems. In an appendix we give a self-contained description of the parametric
profile we use, the dual pseudo isothermal elliptical mass distribution (dPIE).
This profile is a two component pseudo isothermal mass distribution (PIEMD)
with both a core radii and a scale radii. (Abridged)

cumulative effect is proposed. In the field of a plate the relative x and y
coordinate positions of each star with respect to all the other stars are
added. The procedure is carried out for two epochs t_1 and t_2 separately, then
one sum is subtracted from another. For a field star the differences in its
relative coordinate positions of two epochs will be accumulated. For a cluster
star, on the contrary, the changes in relative positions of cluster members at
t_1 and t_2 will be very small. On the histogram of sums the cluster stars will
gather to the left of the diagram, while the field stars will form a tail to
the right. The procedure allows us to efficiently discriminate one group from
another. The greater the distance between t_1 and t_2 and the more cluster
stars present, the greater is the effect. The accumulation method does not
require reference stars, determination of centroids and modelling the
distribution of field stars, necessary in traditional methods. By the proposed
method 240 open clusters have been processed, including stars up to m<13. The
membership probabilities have been calculated and compared to those obtained by
the most commonly used Vasilevskis-Sanders method. The similarity of the
results acquired the two different approaches is satisfactory for the majority
of clusters.

aspects: The system models are structured, often as products of components, and
the specification logic has to be expressive enough to allow the formalization
of reachability properties. The present paper is a study on what can be
achieved for infinite transition systems under these premises. As models we
consider products of infinite transition systems with different synchronization
constraints. We introduce finitely synchronized transition systems, i.e.
product systems which contain only finitely many (parameterized) synchronized
transitions, and show that the decidability of FO(R), first-order logic
extended by reachability predicates, of the product system can be reduced to
the decidability of FO(R) of the components. This result is optimal in the
following sense: (1) If we allow semifinite synchronization, i.e. just in one
component infinitely many transitions are synchronized, the FO(R)-theory of the
product system is in general undecidable. (2) We cannot extend the expressive
power of the logic under consideration. Already a weak extension of first-order
logic with transitive closure, where we restrict the transitive closure
operators to arity one and nesting depth two, is undecidable for an
asynchronous (and hence finitely synchronized) product, namely for the infinite

responsible for the steepening of the 1.4 GHz source counts, is the origin of
their radio emission. Particularly interesting is the possibility of combining
radio spectral index information with other observational properties to assess
whether the sources are triggered by star formation or nuclear activity. The
aim of this work is to study the optical and near infrared properties of a
complete sample of 131 radio sources with S>0.4 mJy, observed at both 1.4 and 5
GHz as part of the ATESP radio survey. We use deep multi-colour (UBVRIJK)
images, mostly taken in the framework of the ESO Deep Public Survey, to
optically identify and derive photometric redshifts for the ATESP radio
sources. Deep optical coverage and extensive colour information are available
for 3/4 of the region covered by the radio sample. Typical depths of the images
are U~25, B~26, V~25.4, R~25.5, I~24.3, 19.5<K_s<20.2, J<22.2. Optical/near
infrared counterparts are found for ~78% (66/85) of the radio sources in the
region covered by the deep multi-colour imaging, and for 56 of these reliable
estimates of the redshift and type are derived. We find that many of the
sources with flat radio spectra are characterised by high radio-to-optical
ratios (R>1000), typical of classical powerful radio galaxies and quasars.
Flat-spectrum sources with low R values are preferentially identified with
early type galaxies, where the radio emission is most probably triggered by
low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. Considering both early type galaxies and
quasars as sources with an active nucleus, such sources largely dominate our
sample (78%). Flat-spectrum sources associated with early type galaxies are
quite compact (d<10-30 kpc), suggesting core-dominated radio emission.

concerning the Gaussian distribution of the vector connecting the ends of

equations, self-averaging over continuous fragments of a macromolecule
naturally defines a linear term for the tagged chain, and this term differs
from the entropy term of the classical Rouse model only by the numerical
coefficient. According to the inertia-free approximation, the initial decay
rates of correlation functions for the normal modes are described by the Rouse
model independently of the character of fluctuations of the vector connecting
the ends of the Kuhn segment. This statement is valid for any moment if the
initial Langevin equations are treated in terms of the approximation of dynamic
self-consistency. Simulation of the Fraenkel chains by the method of Brownian
dynamics shows that decay of autocorrelation functions of shortwave normal
modes is fairly described by the linearized equations for a given model of a
chain and that the Rouse equation can be used for the longwave modes. The
results of this study make it possible to explain a marked difference between
the lengths of the Kuhn and Rouse segments that is estimated from static and
dynamic experiments.

that both the spectral function of photons and the field fluctuations split up
into vacuum- and medium-induced contributions, for which explicit expressions
are derived. Using Poynting's theorem, the incoherent emission is analyzed and
related to the coherent absorption as may be measured in a linear
transmission-reflection experiment. Their ratio defines the medium-induced
population of the modes of the transverse electromagnetic field and so
generalizes Planck's law to an arbitrarily absorbing and dispersing medium in a
nonequilibrium steady state. For quasi-equilibrium, this population develops
into a Bose distribution whose chemical potential marks the crossover from
absorption to gain and, also, characterizes the degree of excitation.

essentially categorized as the B-type. We also show that, amongst the two
inequivalent twists of N=4 D=3, only the B-type SYM can be realized on the
lattice consistently with the Leibniz rule and the gauge covariance on the
lattice.

  Yang","The VSOP 5 GHz Active Galactic Nucleus Survey: V. Imaging Results for
  the Remaining 140 sources","Accepted ApJS",,"10.1086/525025",,"astro-ph",,"  In February 1997, the Japanese radio astronomy satellite HALCA was launched
to provide the space-bourne element for the VLBI Space Observatory Programme
(VSOP) mission. Approximately twenty-five percent of the mission time was
dedicated to the VSOP Survey of bright compact Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at
5 GHz. This paper, the fifth in the series, presents images and models for the
remaining 140 sources not included in Paper III, which contained 102 sources.
For most sources, the plots of the uv-coverage, the visibility amplitude versus
uv-distance, and the high resolution image are presented. Model fit parameters
to the major radio components are determined, and the brightness temperature of
the core component for each source is calculated. The brightness temperature
distributions for all of the sources in the VSOP AGN survey are discussed.
