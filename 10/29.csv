we observed with XMM-Newton 4 randomly chosen, optical type 1s, and 4 type 2s.
All targets have been detected. The optical-to-Xray spectral index, alphaox,

However, the Compton thin type 2s have an absorption corrected X-ray luminosity
systematically lower than the type 1s, by a factor which makes them consistent
with the radio quiet alphaox. Within the limited statistics, the Compton thick
objects seem to have a reflected component more luminous than the Compton thin

the standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology, have indicated that our
universe is dominated by a Cosmological Constant. The dimming of distant Type
Ia supernovae suggests that the expansion rate is accelerating, as if driven by
vacuum energy, and this has been indirectly substantiated through studies of
angular anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and of spatial
correlations in the large-scale structure (LSS) of galaxies. However there is
no compelling direct evidence yet for (the dynamical effects of) dark energy.
The precision CMB data can be equally well fitted without dark energy if the
spectrum of primordial density fluctuations is not quite scale-free and if the
Hubble constant is lower globally than its locally measured value. The LSS data
can also be satisfactorily fitted if there is a small component of hot dark
matter, as would be provided by neutrinos of mass 0.5 eV. Although such an
Einstein-de Sitter model cannot explain the SNe Ia Hubble diagram or the
position of the `baryon acoustic oscillation' peak in the autocorrelation
function of galaxies, it may be possible to do so e.g. in an inhomogeneous
Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi cosmology where we are located in a void which is
expanding faster than the average. Such alternatives may seem contrived but
this must be weighed against our lack of any fundamental understanding of the
inferred tiny energy scale of the dark energy. It may well be an artifact of an
oversimplified cosmological model, rather than having physical reality.

of a typical two-terminal mesoscopic spin-orbit coupled system as the example,
we show explicitly that the nonequilibrium terminal spin currents in a

general. This non-conservation of terminal spin currents is not caused by the
use of an improper definition of spin current but is intrinsic to
spin-dependent transports in mesoscopic spin-orbit coupled systems. We also
show that the nonequilibrium lateral edge spin accumulation induced by a
longitudinal charge current in a thin strip of \textit{finite} length of a
two-dimensional electronic system with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling may be
non-antisymmetric in general, which implies that some cautions may need to be

resolution of time-of-flight neutron spectrometers, as well as its partial
contributions, over a dynamical range that extends from the elastic line to the

the past to the TOSCA and HET neutron inelastic scattering spectrometers
installed at the ISIS neutron spallation source [A M Gaspar, PhD Thesis,
Universidade Tecnica de Lisboa, 2004], is here applied to the high resolution
time-of-flight spectrometer TOFTOF, mainly dedicated to quasi-elastic neutron
scattering studies and installed at the new neutron reactor FRM II. To make
such calculations easily understandable, the principle of work of the TOFTOF
instrument and of each of its components is explained in detail. A simply
method that can be used to estimate the instrument intensity, i.e. of the
number of neutrons arriving at the sample position per unit time, is also

  To the benefit of the TOFTOF users, graphs displaying the dependencies of the
instrument resolution at the elastic line and of the instrument intensity on
the relevant instrument parameters, i.e the wavelength of the incident
neutrons, the choppers speed of rotation and the frame overlap ratio, are
presented, in the form of iso-resolution or iso-intensity lines. The method of
estimation of the frame overlap ratio that is commonly used at time-of-flight
instruments such as TOFTOF is also explained and alternative options concerning
this parameter, depending on the dynamical range of interest, are briefly
addressed.

have been extracted and cross calibrated with optical spectra from the

We have also produced a composite of the rest-frame UV-optical line fluxes of
powerful, z~2.5 radio galaxies. We have investigated the relative strengths of
Ly-alpha, H-beta, H-alpha, HeII 1640 and HeII 4687, and we find that Av can
vary significantly from object to object. In addition, we identify new line

emission line spectra and conclude they are best explained by
AGN-photoionization with the ionization parameter U varying between objects.
Single slab photoionization models are unable to reproduce the high- and the
low-ionization lines simultaneously: this may be alleviated either by combining
two or more single slab photoionization models with different U, or by using
mixed-medium models such as those of Binette, Wilson & Storchi-Bergmann (1996).
On the basis of NV/NIV] and NIV]/CIV we argue that shocks make a fractional
contribution to the ionization of the EELR. We find that in the EELR of z~2
radio galaxies the N/H abundance ratio is close to its solar value. We conclude
that N/H and metallicity do not vary by more than a factor of two in our
sample. This is consistent with the idea that massive ellipticals are assembled
very early in the history of the universe, and then evolve relatively passively
up to the present day.

bounds on the correlations of locally orthogonal observables. Violations of
such inequalities give strong sufficient criteria for various forms of partial
inseparability and multiqubit entanglement. The strength of these criteria is
illustrated by showing that they are stronger than several other well-known
entanglement criteria (the fidelity criterion, violation of Mermin-type
separability inequalities, the Laskowski-\.Zukowski criterion and the
D\""ur-Cirac criterion), and also by showing their great noise robustness for a

(typically $v\sin{i}<$ 10 km s$^{-1}$) of BHB stars with effective temperatures

only effective in a stable stellar atmosphere. In this work we search for
observational evidence of vertical chemical stratification in the atmospheres
of six hot BHB stars: B84, B267 and B279 in M15 and WF2-2541, WF4-3085 and
WF4-3485 in M13. We undertake an abundance stratification analysis of the

whose abundance increases toward the lower atmosphere, while the other two

substantially enables to prove the statement. Based on the result, we briefly
argue the integrable structures of five-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$

aforementioned potentials correspond to gauge theory observables analogous to
the Wilson loops, and thereby the partition functions are translated in the

eigenfunctions of the covariance kernel (i.e., the functional principal
components) from sparse and irregularly observed longitudinal data. We approach
this problem through a maximum likelihood method assuming that the covariance
kernel is smooth and finite dimensional. We exploit the smoothness of the
eigenfunctions to reduce dimensionality by restricting them to a lower
dimensional space of smooth functions. The estimation scheme is developed based
on a Newton-Raphson procedure using the fact that the basis coefficients
representing the eigenfunctions lie on a Stiefel manifold. We also address the
selection of the right number of basis functions, as well as that of the
dimension of the covariance kernel by a second order approximation to the
leave-one-curve-out cross-validation score that is computationally very
efficient. The effectiveness of our procedure is demonstrated by simulation
studies and an application to a CD4 counts data set. In the simulation studies,
our method performs well on both estimation and model selection. It also
outperforms two existing approaches: one based on a local polynomial smoothing
of the empirical covariances, and another using an EM algorithm.

It turns out to be nearly compensated by ferromagnetic interaction between
half-filled $t_{2g}$ and empty $e_g$ orbitals in Cr-based pyroxenes. The
fine-tuning of the interaction parameters by the crystal structure results in
the ferromagnetism for NaCrGe$_2$O$_6$. Further increase of the total number of
electrons and occupation of $e_g$ sub-shell makes the $t_{2g}-e_g$ contribution
and total exchange interaction antiferromagnetic for Mn- and Fe-based
pyroxenes. Strong oxygen polarization was found in Fe-based pyroxenes. It is
shown that this effect leads to a considerable reduction of antiferromagnetic

unchanged at the threshold to completely convective stars, i.e. no change in
the efficiency of the magnetic dynamos is observed. On the other hand, a sudden
change in the strength of rotational braking appears at the threshold mass to
full convection, and strong evidence exists for rotational braking weakening
with lower mass. A probable explanation is that the field topology changes from
dipolar to small scale structure as the objects become fully convective.

second--quantization influence functional in path integral formalism, in which

photoluminescence (PL) from NV$^-$, NV$^0$ and GR1 centers formed by ion
implantation of 2MeV He ions over a wide range of fluences. The sample was
annealed at $600^{\circ}$C to minimize residual vacancy diffusion, allowing for

monotonic increasing PL in NV$^0$/NV$^-$ and GR1/(NV$^0$ + NV$^1$) ratios, and
increasing inhomogeneous broadening of the zero-phonon lines with increasing

identification of similarities and differences between the various documents,
in two axes: the synchronic and the diachronic. This is achieved by the
introduction of the notion of Synchronic and Diachronic Relations. Those
relations connect the messages that are found in the documents, resulting thus
in a graph which we call grid. Although the creation of the grid completes the
Document Planning phase of a typical NLG architecture, it can be the case that
the number of messages contained in a grid is very large, exceeding thus the
required compression rate. In this paper we provide some initial thoughts on a
probabilistic model which can be applied at the Content Determination stage,

about the nature of measurement, about the characterization of the observer,
about the reliability of measurement processes etc. The present paper attempts
to talk about these questions through the information science. We start from
the idea, rather common and intuitive, that the measurement process basically
acquires information. Next we expand this idea through four formal definitions
and infer some corollaries regarding the measurement process from those
definitions. Relativity emerges as the basic property of measurement from the
present logical framework and this rather surprising result collides with the
feeling of physicists who take measurement as a myth. In the closing this paper
shows how the measurement relativity wholly consists with some effects
calculated in QM and in Einstein's theory.

and, they respond to hG magnetic field strengths differently from the lines
used in solar magnetometry. This peculiarity has been employed to measure
magnetic field strengths in quiet Sun regions. However, the methods applied so
far assume the magnetic field to be constant in the resolution element. The
assumption is clearly insufficient to describe the complex quiet Sun magnetic
fields, biasing the results of the measurements. We present the first syntheses
of MnI lines in realistic quiet Sun model atmospheres. The syntheses show how
the MnI lines weaken with increasing field strength. In particular, kG magnetic
concentrations produce NnI 5538 circular polarization signals (Stokes V) which
can be up to two orders of magnitude smaller than the weak magnetic field
approximation prediction. Consequently, (1) the polarization emerging from an
atmosphere having weak and strong fields is biased towards the weak fields, and
(2) HFS features characteristic of weak fields show up even when the magnetic
flux and energy are dominated by kG fields. For the HFS feature of MnI 5538 to
disappear the filling factor of kG fields has to be larger than the filling
factor of sub-kG fields. Stokes V depends on magnetic field inclination
according to the simple consine law. Atmospheres with unresolved velocities
produce asymmetric line profiles, which cannot be reproduced by simple
one-component model atmospheres. The uncertainty of the HFS constants do not
limit the use of MnI lines for magnetometry.

complex molecule that have very high affinity for oxygen. The capacity of
erythrocytes to load and unload oxygen is thus a determinant factor in their
efficacy. In this paper, we will focus on the pulmonary capillary where red
blood cells capture oxygen. We propose a camera method in order to numerically
study the behavior of the red blood cell along a whole capillary. Our goal is
to understand how erythrocytes geometrical changes along the capillary can
affect its capacity to capture oxygen. The first part of this document presents
the model chosen for the red blood cells along with the numerical method used

confronted with a standard ALE method. Some geometrical properties of the red

conformal gravity to be phenomenologically viable requires that the conformal
symmetry is not manifest at the energy scales of the other known physical
forces. Hence we require a mechanism for the spontaneous breaking of conformal
invariance. In this paper we study the possibility that conformal invariance is
spontaneously broken due to interactions with conformally coupled matter
fields. The vacuum of the theory admits conformally non-invariant solutions
corresponding to maximally symmetric space-times and variants thereof. These
are either de Sitter space-time or anti-de Sitter space-time in the full four
space-time dimensions or in a lower dimensional sub-space. We consider in
particular normalizable, linearized gravitational perturbations around the
anti-de Sitter background. Exploiting the conformal flatness of this

that are taken to be fourier decomposable, carry zero energy-momentum. This
squares well with the theorem that asymptotically flat space-times conformal
gravity contain zero energy and momentum \cite{bhs}. We also show the
possibility of domain wall solitons interpolating between the ground states of
spontaneously broken conformal symmetry that we have found. These solitons
necessarily require the vanishing of the scalar field, repudiating the recent
suggestion \cite{f} that the conformal symmetry could be quarantined to a

the spin-orbit coupling into our calculations we determine the easy and hard
axes of the magnetic moment, the strength of the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy
energy (MAE), relevant for the thermal stability of magnetic orientation, and
the change of the electronic structure with respect to the direction of the
magnetic moment, important for spin-transport properties. While for the V-based
compounds the values of the MAE are only of the order of 0.05-0.5 meV per metal
atom, increasing the spin-orbit strength by substituting V with heavier Nb and
Ta allows to achieve an increase in anisotropy values by one to two orders of

the strong ferromagnetic ordering makes them attractive candidates for
spin-polarized transport applications. For a Nb-benzene infinite wire the

sizable flux of annihilation products from our galaxy. Neutrinos are the least

we show that neutrino detectors with good energy resolution and low energy

actually test the hypothesis of the possible existence of MeV DM, i.e. test the
values of the cross section required to explain the observed DM density. At

spectrum, which is due to scattering processes and it offers a rich diagnostic
potential for exploring solar magnetic fields via the Hanle effect. However,
this so-called second solar spectrum is full of mysterious spectral features,
which cannot be understood with simplified polarization transfer theories, thus
suggesting that the underlying scattering physics is more complex than
previously thought. In this paper we argue that the physical understanding of
the second solar spectrum requires the consideration of scattering processes in
multilevel atomic models, taking fully into account the transfer of atomic
polarization among all the levels involved. The consideration of lower-level
atomic polarization leads to non-linear and non-local coupled sets of
equations, even for the two-level model atom case considered in this paper. The
unknowns of the problem are the irreducible tensor components of the atomic
density matrix whose self-consistent values have first to be obtained to be
able to calculate the emergent Stokes profiles. To solve numerically this
non-LTE problem of the second kind we present some iterative methods that are
very suitable for developing a general multilevel scattering polarization code.
We demonstrate that there exists metastable-level atomic polarization in the
solar chromosphere, which suggests that the solution to some
recently-formulated ""paradoxes"" is to be found by carefully revising our
current ideas about the chromospheric magnetic field.

is reconsidered from the point of view of stability theory. In particular, we
derive the complete infinite set of exact analytical solutions for the phase
difference that describe the current-carrying states of the junction with
arbitrary W and an arbitrary mode of the injection of J. These solutions are
parameterized by two natural parameters: the constants of integration. The
boundaries of their stability regions in the parametric plane are determined by
a corresponding infinite set of exact functional equations. Being mapped to the
physical plane (H,J), these boundaries yield the dependence of the critical
transport current Jc on H. Contrary to a wide-spread belief, the exact
analytical dependence Jc=Jc(H) proves to be multivalued even for arbitrarily
small W. What is more, the exact solution reveals the existence of unquantized
Josephson vortices carrying fractional flux and located near one of the
junction edges, provided that J is sufficiently close to Jc for certain finite
values of H. This conclusion (as well as other exact analytical results) is
illustrated by a graphical analysis of typical cases.

private matching protocol is called \emph{fuzzy}, and is useful, for instance,
when elements may be inaccurate or corrupted by errors.

Elements are similar if they match on $t$ out of $T$ attributes. First we show

self-consistent values of these density-matrix elements is to be determined by
solving jointly the kinetic and radiative transfer equations for the Stokes

structure, and it can also explain the cored density profiles on smaller
scales. However, it has been argued that warm dark matter could delay the star
formation. This does not happen if warm dark matter is made up of keV sterile
neutrinos, which can decay into X-ray photons and active neutrinos. The X-ray
photons have a catalytic effect on the formation of molecular hydrogen, the
essential cooling ingredient in the primordial gas. In all the cases we have
examined, the overall effect of sterile dark matter is to facilitate the
cooling of the gas and to reduce the minimal mass of the halo prone to
collapse. We find that the X-rays from the decay of keV sterile neutrinos
facilitate the collapse of the gas clouds and the subsequent star formation at
high redshift.

stochastic and depends on its ancestors' only through the mother's

probability $P(x,dy dz)$ which gives the probability that the pair of
daughters' characteristics is around $(y,z)$, given that the mother's

given $x$, and their respective conditional distributions may differ. We then
speak of bifurcating Markov chains. We derive laws of large numbers and central

have analysed the ultra-high-resolution images from a new monitoring program at

archival and calibration VLBA data set, covering from 1997 to 2007, has been

important role in the dynamics of the jet in NRAO 150, which is supported by
the large values of the magnetic field strength obtained from our first

behavior of 2d electron systems near an antiferromagnetic (AFM) instability.
Recently, the standard procedure to integrate out the fermions to obtain an
effective action for spin waves has been questioned in the clean case. We show
that in the presence of disorder, the single fermion loops display two
crossover scales: upon lowering the energy, the singularities of the clean
fermionic loops are first cut off, but below a second scale new singularities
arise that lead again to marginal scaling. In addition, impurity lines between
different fermion loops generate new relevant couplings which dominate at low
energies. We outline a non-linear sigma model formulation of the single-loop
problem, which allows to control the higher singularities and provides an
effective model in terms of low-energy diffusive as well as spin modes.

colloidal systems that evolve from a purely low-viscosity liquid to a
predominantly elastic glass or gel. Using microrheology, we measure the local
complex shear modulus $G^{*}(\omega)$ over a very wide range of frequencies (1
Hz- 100 kHz). The combined use of one- and two-particle microrheology allows us
to differentiate between colloidal glasses and gels - the glass is homogenous,
whereas the colloidal gel shows a considerable degree of heterogeneity on
length scales larger than 0.5 micrometer. Despite this characteristic
difference, both systems exhibit similar rheological behavior which evolve in
time with aging, showing a crossover from a single power-law frequency
dependence of the viscoelastic modulus to a sum of two power laws. The
crossover occurs at a time $t_{0}$, which defines a mechanical transition
point. We found that the data acquired during the aging of different samples
can be collapsed onto a single master curve by scaling the aging time with
$t_{0}$. This raises questions about the prior interpretation of two power laws
in terms of a superposition of an elastic network embedded in a viscoelastic
background.

the pion form factor and to study the interplay between the nonperturbative and

pion distribution amplitude. Our results demonstrate the dominance of the
nonperturbative contribution to the form factor up to relatively large values
of the momentum transfer: namely, the nonperturbative O(1) term, which provides
the $1/Q^4$ power correction, gives more than half of the pion form factor in
