equivalently in a concave corner formed by two solid walls. For mild corners,
there are two possible steady state solutions, one with a strong and one with a
weak shock emanating from the corner. The weak shock is observed in supersonic
flights. A long-standing natural conjecture is that the strong shock is
unstable in some sense.
  We resolve this issue by showing that a sharp wedge will eventually produce
weak shocks at the tip when accelerated to a supersonic speed. More precisely
we prove that for upstream state as initial data in the entire domain, the
time-dependent solution is self-similar, with a weak shock at the tip of the
wedge. We construct analytic solutions for self-similar potential flow, both
isothermal and isentropic with arbitrary $\gamma\geq 1$.
  In the process of constructing the self-similar solution, we develop a large
number of theoretical tools for these elliptic regions. These tools allow us to
establish large-data results rather than a small perturbation. We show that the
wave pattern persists as long as the weak shock is supersonic-supersonic; when
this is no longer true, numerics show a physical change of behaviour. In
addition we obtain rather detailed information about the elliptic region,
including analyticity as well as bounds for velocity components and shock
tangents.

given. In particular, a novel rigorous definition of a fuzzy negation as an
operation acting on a lattice to render it into a fuzzy logic is presented.
According to this definition, a fuzzy negation satisfies the weak double
negation condition, requiring double negation to be expansive, the antitony
condition, being equivalent to the disjunctive De Morgan law and thus
warranting compatibility of negation with the lattice operations, and the
Boolean boundary condition stating that the universal bounds of the lattice are
the negation of each other. From this perspective, the most general logics are
fuzzy logics, containing as special cases paraconsistent (quantum) logics,
quantum logics, intuitionistic logics, and Boolean logics, each of which given
by its own algebraic restrictions. New examples of a non-contradictory logic
violating the conjunctive De Morgan law, and of a typical non-orthomodular
fuzzy logic along with its explicit lattice representation are given.

telescope. Blue and red spectra with resolutions from 2 to 4\AA covering the
principal gaseous emission and stellar absorption lines were obtained along the
major and minor axes and six other position angles. The observed radial
velocities of the ionized gas along the photometric major axis of M33 remain
flat at ~22 km s^{-1} all the way into the center, while the stellar velocities
show a gradual rise from zero to 22 km s^{-1} over that same region. The
central star cluster is at or very close to the dynamical center, with a
velocity that is in accordance with M33's systemic velocity to within our
uncertainties. Velocities on the minor axis are non-zero out to about 1' from
the center in both the stars and gas. Together with the major axis velocities,
they point at significant deviations from circular rotation. The most likely
explanation for the bulk of the velocity patterns are streaming motions along a
weak inner bar with a PA close to that of the minor axis, as suggested by
previously published IR photometric images. The presence of bar imprints in M33
implies that all major Local Group galaxies are barred. The non-circular
motions over the inner 200 pc make it difficult to constrain the shape of M33's
inner dark matter halo profile. If the non-circular motions we find in this

(CSI) and (ii) soft decoding delays together with worst-case delay guarantees

reliability can be realized with a very short expected delay and a slightly
longer (but bounded) worst-case decoding delay guarantee in communication
systems where the transmitter has access to even one bit per coherence interval
of causal CSI. While similar in spirit to the recent work on communication
systems based on automatic repeat requests (ARQ) where decoding failure is
known at the transmitter and leads to re-transmission, here transmit
side-information is purely based on CSI. The findings reported here also lend
further support to an emerging understanding that decoding delay (related to
throughput) and codeword blocklength (related to coding complexity and delays)
are distinctly different design parameters which can be tuned to control
reliability.

particular, applying this principle to the cooling of (solid-state) lasers
opens up many potential device applications, especially in the domain of

suitable for oversampled digital signals. The aim is twofold. On one hand, it
proposes an optimization framework for the design of constituent decimation
filters in a general multistage decimation architecture. The basic building
blocks embedded in the proposed filters belong, for a simple reason, to the
class of cyclotomic polynomials (CPs): the first 104 CPs have a z-transfer
function whose coefficients are simply {-1,0,+1}. On the other hand, the paper
provides a bunch of useful techniques, most of which stemming from some key
properties of CPs, for designing the proposed filters in a variety of
architectures. Both recursive and non-recursive architectures are discussed by
focusing on a specific decimation filter obtained as a result of the
optimization algorithm.
  Design guidelines are provided with the aim to simplify the design of the

is obtained in an infinite isotropic elastic medium (a matrix) with a
three-dimensional polyhedron-shaped inclusion (a quantum dot). The expression
was obtained utilizing the analogy between electrostatic and elastic theory
problems. The main idea lies in similarity of behavior of point charge electric
field and the strain field induced by point inclusion in the matrix. This opens
a way to simplify the structure of the expression for the strain tensor. In the
solution, the strain distribution consists of contributions related to faces
and edges of the inclusion. A contribution of each face is proportional to the
solid angle at which the face is seen from the point where the strain is
calculated. A contribution of an edge is proportional to the electrostatic
potential which would be induced by this edge if it is charged with a constant
linear charge density. The solution is valid for the case of inclusion having
the same elastic constants as the matrix. Our method can be applied also to the
case of semi-infinite matrix with a free surface. Three particular cases of the
general solution are considered--for inclusions of pyramidal, truncated
pyramidal, and ""hut-cluster"" shape. In these cases considerable simplification
was achieved in comparison with previously published solutions. A
generalization of the obtained solution to the case of anisotropic media is

relative to Fe, are in better agreement with the yields of hyper-energetic

to the diversity of the Supernova-GRB connection. We summarize the diverse

In particular, the Non-SN GRBs (dark hypernovae) have been predicted in order
to explain the origin of C-rich EMP stars. We show that these variations and

old globular cluster system (GCS) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) based on
numerical simulations of the LMC formation. We particularly discuss the
observed possible GCS's rotational kinematics (V/sigma > 2) that appears to be
significantly different from the stellar halo's one with a large velocity
dispersion (~50 km/s). We consider that both halo field stars and old GCs can
originate from low-mass subhalos virialized at high redshifts (z >6). We
investigate the final dynamical properties of the two old components in the
LMC's halo formed from merging of low-mass subhalos with field stars and GCs.
We find that the GCS composed of old globular clusters (GCs) formed at high
redshifts (z > 6) has little rotation (V/sigma ~0.4) and structure and
kinematics similar to those of the stellar halo. This inconsistency between the
simulated GCS's kinematics and the observed one is found to be seen in models
with different parameters. This inconsistency therefore implies that if old,
metal-poor GCs in the LMC have rotational kinematics, they are highly unlikely
to originate from the low-mass subhalos that formed the stellar halo. We thus
discuss a scenario in which the stellar halo was formed from low-mass subhalos
with no/few GCs whereas the GCS was formed at the very early epoch of the LMC's
disk formation via dissipative minor and major merging of gas-rich subhalos and
gas infall. We suggest that there can be a threshold subhalo mass above which
GCs can be formed within subhalos at high redshifts and thus that this
threshold causes differences in physical properties between stellar halos and
GCSs in less luminous galaxies like the LMC.

of around 21.7 it rose to 16.2, an outburst amplitude of about 5.5 magnitudes.
It declined at 0.17 mag/d for 5 days before slowing to 0.11 mag/d for a further
3 days. The light curve revealed common superhumps with a peak-to-peak
amplitude of 0.3 magnitude, which decayed and then re-grew concurrently with
the change in decline rate. These were followed by a phase-changing transition
to late superhumps. Analysis of these observations has revealed evidence for an
orbital period of 0.05572(19) d and a common superhump period of 0.05664(2) d,
giving a fractional superhump period excess of 0.017(5). From astrometry of SS
LMi in outburst we have established for the first time its correct position as
RA 10h 34m 05.85(1)s, Dec +31deg 08m 00.00(18)s (J2000). The position commonly

single crystal. Ac susceptibility at frequencies 10 - 1500 Hz has been measured
in parallel to the crystal surface DC felds, H0. We found that in the DC feld
H0 > Hc2 DC magnetic moment completely disappears while the ac response
exhibited the presence of superconductivity at the surface. Increasing of the
DC field from Hc2 revealed the enlarging of losses with a maximum in the feld
between Hc2 and Hc3. Losses at the maximum were considerably larger than in the
mixed and in the normal states. The value of the DC field, where loss peak was
observed, depends on the amplitude and frequency of the ac feld. Close to Tc
this peak shifts below Hc2 which showed the coexistence of surface
superconducting states and Abrikosov vortices. We observed a logarithmic
frequency dependence of the in-phase component of the susceptibility. Such
frequency dispersion of the inphase component resembles the response of
spin-glass systems, but the out-of-phase component also exhibited frequency
dispersion that is not a known feature of the classic spin-glass response.
Analysis of the experimental data with Kramers-Kronig relations showed the
possible existence of the loss peak at very low frequencies (< 5 Hz). We found
that the amplitude of the third harmonic was not a cubic function of the ac
amplitude even at considerably weak ac felds. This does not leave any room for
treating the nonlinear effects on the basis of perturbation theory. We show
that the conception of surface vortices or surface critical currents could not
adequately describe the existing experimental data. Consideration of a model of
slow relaxing nonequilibrium order parameter permits one to explain the partial
shielding and losses of weak ac field for H0 > Hc2.
