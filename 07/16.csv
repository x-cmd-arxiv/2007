this result to evolve conformal thin-sandwich (CTS) binary BH initial data by

evolving with standard puncture gauge choices. The waveforms generated for both

minor differences between irrotational and corotational CTS BH binaries. Even
the interior solutions appear to evolve to the same constraint-satisfying

circled realization, is endowed with two natural symplectic forms: the flat
form and the hyperbolic form. In a similar way, the ambient vector space is
also endowed with two natural symplectic forms: the Fubini-Study form and the
flat form. It has been shown in arXiv:math.DG/0603141 that there exists a
diffeomorphism from the domain to the ambient vector space which puts in
correspondence the above pair of forms. This phenomenon is called symplectic
duality for Hermitian non compact symmetric spaces.
  In this article, we first give a different and simpler proof of this fact.
Then, in order to measure the non uniqueness of this symplectic duality map, we
determine the group of bisymplectomorphisms of a bounded symmetric domain, that
is, the group of diffeomorphisms which preserve simultaneously the hyperbolic
and the flat symplectic form. This group is the direct product of the compact
Lie group of linear automorphisms with an infinite-dimensional Abelian group.
This result appears as a kind of Schwarz lemma.

examine in detail the dichotomy in the properties of low- and high-excitation
radio galaxies. The X-ray spectra of low-excitation sources (those with weak or
absent optical emission lines) are dominated by unabsorbed emission from a
parsec-scale jet, with no contribution from accretion-related emission. These
sources show no evidence for an obscuring torus, and are likely to accrete in a
radiatively inefficient manner. High-excitation sources (those with prominent
optical emission lines), on the other hand, show a significant contribution
from a radiatively efficient accretion disk, which is heavily absorbed in the
X-ray when they are oriented close to edge-on with respect to the observer.
However, the low-excitation/high-excitation division does not correspond to the
FRI/FRII division: thus the Fanaroff-Riley dichotomy remains a consequence of
the interaction between the jet and the hot-gas environment through which it
propagates. Finally, we suggest that accretion of the hot phase of the IGM is
sufficient to power all low-excitation radio sources, while high-excitation
sources require an additional contribution from cold gas that in turn forms the
cold disk and torus. This model explains a number of properties of the
radio-loud active galaxy population, and has important implications for AGN
feedback mechanisms.

theory is in a confining phase for all values of the coupling $0 < g < \infty$
defined at lattice spacing (UV regulator) $a$, and space-time dimension $d \leq
4$. The strategy is to employ approximate RG decimation transformations of the
potential moving type which give both upper and lower bounds on the partition
function at each successive decimation step. By interpolation between these
bounds an exact representation of the partition function is obtained on
progressively coarser lattices. In the same manner, one obtains a
representation of the partition function in the presence of external center
flux. Under successive decimations the flow of the effective action in these
representations is constrained by that in the upper and lower bounds which are
easily explicitly computable. Confining behavior for the vortex free energy
order parameter (ratio of partition functions with and without external flux),
hence `area law' for the Wilson loop, is the result for any initial coupling.
Keeping the string tension fixed determines the dependence $g(a)$, which is
such that $g(a) \to 0$ for $a \to 0$.

the prompt collapse to a black hole (BH) of the core of a massive star (M ~ 40
Msun) that had lost its outer hydrogen and helium envelopes. All these SNe
exhibited strong oxygen lines, and their energies were much larger than those
of typical SNe, thus these SNe are called Hypernovae (HNe). The case of SN
2006aj/GRB060218 appears different: the GRB was weak and soft (an X-Ray Flash,
XRF); the SN is dimmer and has very weak oxygen lines. The explosion energy of
SN 2006aj was smaller, as was the ejected mass. In our model, the progenitor
star had a smaller mass than other GRB/SNe (M ~ 20 Msun), suggesting that a
neutron star (NS) rather than a black hole was formed. If the nascent neutron
star was strongly magnetized (a so-called magnetar) and rapidly spinning, it
may launch a weak GRB or an XRF. The final fate of 20-30 Msun stars show
interesting variety, as seen in the very peculiar Type Ib/c SN 2005bf. This
mass range corresponds to the NS to BH transition. We also compare the
nucleosynthesis feature of HNe with the metal-poor stars and suggest the
Hypernova-First Star connection.

with it leading to energy and angular momentum exchange. This interaction
determines the evolution of the planet through changes to the orbital
parameters. We investigate changes in the orbital elements of a 20 Earth--mass
planet due to the torques from the disk. We focus on the non-linear evolution
of initially non-vanishing eccentricity $e$ and/or inclination $i$. We treat
the disk as a two- or three-dimensional viscous fluid and perform
hydrodynamical simulations with an embedded planet. We find rapid exponential
decay of the planet orbital eccentricity and inclination for small initial
values of $e$ and $i$, in agreement with linear theory. For larger values of $e
> 0.1$ the decay time increases and the decay rate scales as $\dot{e} \propto
e^{-2}$, consistent with existing theoretical models. For large inclinations
($i$ > 6 deg) the inclination decay rate shows an identical scaling $di/dt
\propto i^{-2}$. We find an interesting dependence of the migration on the
eccentricity. In a disk with aspect ratio $H/r=0.05$ the migration rate is
enhanced for small non-zero eccentricities ($e < 0.1$), while for larger values
we see a significant reduction by a factor of $\sim 4$. We find no indication
for a reversal of the migration for large $e$, although the torque experienced
by the planet becomes positive when $e \simeq 0.3$. This inward migration is
caused by the persisting energy loss of the planet.
  For non gap forming planets, eccentricity and inclination damping occurs on a
time scale that is very much shorter than the migration time scale. The results
of non linear hydrodynamic simulations are in very good agreement with linear
theory for small $e$ and $i$.

a double root of the characteristic polynomial in t, which could be erroneously
interpreted as two coalesce assembly modes. But, unlike what arises in
non-degenerate cases, this double root yields two sets of solutions for the
position coordinates (x, y) of the platform. In the second situation, we show
that the forward kinematics degenerates over the whole joint space if the base
and platform triangles are congruent and the platform triangle is rotated by
180 deg about one of its sides. For these ""degenerate"" manipulators, which are
defined here for the first time, the forward kinematics is reduced to the
solution of a 3rd-degree polynomial and a quadratics in sequence. Such

are studied theoretically for scattering angles close to 180$^{\circ}$ and
antiproton energies with the interval 100 eV -- 10 keV. We investigate the
Coulomb glory effect which is caused by a screening of the Coulomb potential of
the nucleus and results in a prominent maximum of the differential cross
section in the backward direction at some energies of the incident particle. We
found that for larger numbers of electrons in the ion the effect becomes more
pronounced and shifts to higher energies of the antiproton. On the other hand,
a maximum of the differential cross section in the backward direction can also
be found in the scattering of antiprotons on a bare uranium nucleus. The latter
case can be regarded as a manifestation of the screening property of the
vacuum-polarization potential in non-relativistic collisions of heavy
particles.

derivative of the diffusion coefficient times a factor that depends on the
convention used to define the multiplicative noise. We explore the consequences

second B-band light-curve maximum. The degree of the Interstellar Polarization,
determined from depolarized emission lines in the spectrum, is found to be
large with $p_{max}(ISP)=1.6%$ and $\theta(ISP)=149$\fdg$7\pm4.0$, but this may
be an upper limit on the real value of the ISP. After ISP subtraction,
significant polarization is observed over large wavelength regions, indicating
a significant degree of global asymmetry, $\gtrsim 10%$. Polarizations of 3.5%
and 4% are observed for absorption components of Ca II H&K and IR triplet, and
1.3% for He I 5876\AA and Fe II. On the $Q-U$ plane clear velocity-dependent
loop structure is observed for the He I 5876\AA line, suggestive of departures
from an axial symmetry and possible clumping of the SN ejecta. Weak High
Velocity components of $\mathrm{H\alpha}$, $\mathrm{H\beta}$ and
$\mathrm{H\gamma}$ are observed, with velocities of -15 000\kms. The low degree
of polarization observed at H$\beta$ suggests that the polarization observed
for the other Balmer lines ($\sim 0.4%$ above the background polarization) may
rather be due to blending of $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ and $\mathrm{H\gamma}$ with
polarized Si II and Fe II lines, respectively. We suggest a model in which a
jet of material, that is rich in $\mathrm{^{56}Ni}$, has penetrated the C-O
core, but not the He mantle. The jet axis is tilted with respect to the axis of
the photosphere. This accounts for the lack of significant polarization of O I

associated fast halo CME that originated from a bipolar active region NOAA
10759 on 2005 May 13. The source active region has a conspicuous sigmoid
structure at TRACE 171 A channel as well as in the SXI soft X-ray images, and
we mainly concern ourselves with the detailed process of the sigmoid eruption
as evidenced by the multiwavelength data ranging from Halpha, WL, EUV/UV,
radio, and hard X-rays (HXRs). The most important finding is that the flare
brightening starts in the core of the active region earlier than that of the
rising motion of the flux rope. This timing clearly addresses one of the main
issues in the magnetic eruption onset of sigmoid, namely, whether the eruption
is initiated by an internal tether-cutting to allow the flux rope to rise
upward or a flux rope rises due to a loss of equilibrium to later induce tether
cutting below it. Our high time cadence SXI and Halpha data shows that the
first scenario is relevant to this eruption. As other major findings, we have
the RHESSI HXR images showing a change of the HXR source from a confined
footpoint structure to an elongated ribbon-like structure after the flare
maximum, which we relate to the sigmoid-to-arcade evolution. Radio dynamic
spectrum shows a type II precursor that occurred at the time of expansion of
the sigmoid and a drifting pulsating structure in the flare rising phase in
HXR. Finally type II and III bursts are seen at the time of maximum HXR
emission, simultaneous with the maximum reconnection rate derived from the
flare ribbon motion in UV. We interpret these various observed properties with
the runaway tether-cutting model proposed by Moore et al. in 2001.

These processes are considered here, including turbulence compression in the
outer parts of giant molecular cloud (GMC) cores and GMC envelopes, GMC core
formation in an initially supercritical state, and compression-induced
triggering in dispersing GMC envelopes. The classical issues related to star
formation timescales are addressed: high molecular fractions, low efficiencies,
long consumption times for CO and HCN, rapid GMC core disruption and the lack
of a stable core, long absolute but short relative timescales with accelerated
star formation, and the slow motions of protostars. We consider stimuli to
collapse from changes in the density dependence of the ionization fraction, the
cosmic ray ionization rate, and various dust properties at densities above
~10^5 cm^{-3}. We favor the standard model of subcritical GMC envelops and
suggest they would be long lived if not for disruption by rapid star formation
in GMC cores. The lifecycle of GMCs is illustrated by a spiral arm section in
the Hubble Heritage image of M51, showing GMC formation, star formation, GMC
disruption with lingering triggered star formation, and envelope dispersal.
There is no delay between spiral arm dustlanes and star formation; the
classical notion results from heavy extinction in the dust lane and triggered
star formation during cloud dispersal. Differences in the IMF for the different
modes of star formation are considered.

  comments,Accepted for publication in ApJ","AIP Conf.Proc.1016:436-438,2008","10.1063/1.2943617",,"astro-ph",,"  Recent hydrodynamic studies of core-collapse supernovae imply that the
neutrino-heated ejecta from a nascent neutron star develops to supersonic
outflows. These supersonic winds are influenced by the reverse shock from the
preceding supernova ejecta, forming the wind termination shock. We investigate
the effects of the termination shock in neutrino-driven winds and its roll on
the r-process. Supersonic outflows are calculated with a semi-analytic
neutrino-driven wind model. Subsequent termination-shocked, subsonic outflows
are obtained by applying the Rankine-Hugoniot relations. We find a couple of
effects that can be relevant for the r-process. First is the sudden slowdown of
the temperature decrease by the wind termination. Second is the entropy jump by
termination-shock heating, up to several 100NAk. Nucleosynthesis calculations
in the obtained winds are performed to examine these effects on the r-process.
We find that 1) the slowdown of the temperature decrease plays a decisive roll
to determine the r-process abundance curves. This is due to the strong
dependences of the nucleosynthetic path on the temperature during the r-process
freezeout phase. Our results suggest that only the termination-shocked winds
with relatively small shock radii (~500km) are relevant for the bulk of the
solar r-process abundances (A~100-180). The heaviest part in the solar
r-process curve (A~180-200), however, can be reproduced both in shocked and
unshocked winds. These results may help to constrain the mass range of
supernova progenitors relevant for the r-process. We find, on the other hand,
2) negligible roles of the entropy jump on the r-process. This is a consequence
that the sizable entropy increase takes place only at a large shock radius
(~10,000km) where the r-process has already ceased.

interest. It does not only provide a great deal of flexibility over existing
parametric methods in the modeling aspect but also results in a closed and
tractable Bayes estimator for the bathtub-shaped failure rate (BFR). Such an
estimator is derived to be a finite sum over two $\mathbf{S}$-paths due to an
explicit posterior analysis in terms of two (conditionally independent)

from mid 1970s, other proxies can be used to infer the polar field at earlier
times. The observational data indicate a strong correlation between the polar
field at a sunspot minimum and the strength of the next cycle, although the
strength of the cycle is not correlated well with the polar field produced at
its end. This suggests that the Babcock Leighton mechanism of poloidal field
generation from decaying sunspots involves randomness, whereas the other
aspects of the dynamo process must be reasonably ordered and deterministic.
Only if the magnetic diffusivity within the convection zone is assumed to be
high, we can explain the correlation between the polar field at a minimum and
the next cycle. We give several independent arguments that the diffusivity must
be of this order. In a dynamo model with diffusivity like this, the poloidal
field generated at the mid latitudes is advected toward the poles by the
meridional circulation and simultaneously diffuses towards the tachocline,
where the toroidal field for the next cycle is produced. To model actual solar
cycles with a dynamo model having such high diffusivity, we have to feed the
observational data of the poloidal field at the minimum into the theoretical
model. We develop a method of doing this in a systematic way. Our model
predicts that cycle 24 will be a very weak cycle. Hemispheric asymmetry of
solar activity is also calculated with our model and compared with
observational data.

far from the center. These findings may be relevant to various separation
processes and to the control of chemical reactions, in particular their

into a lighter one $\nu_1$ via the transition process $\nu_{\mu}\to \nu_e+X$

$\nu_\mu\to \nu_e+\bar\nu_e+\nu_e$. Unfortunately, the number coming out from
the computation is too small to explain the observation. Moreover, our results
are consistent with the cosmology constraint on the neutrino lifetime and the
theoretical estimation made by other groups, therefore we can conclude that
even though neutrino decay seems plausible in this case, it indeed cannot be
the source of the peak at lower energy observed by the MiniBooNE collaboration

stability of ""isothermal"" spheres in general relativity. This concerns objects
that are described by a linear equation of state $P=q\epsilon$ so that the
pressure is proportional to the energy density. In the Newtonian limit $q\to
0$, this returns the classical isothermal equation of state. We consider
specifically a self-gravitating radiation (q=1/3), the core of neutron stars
(q=1/3) and a gas of baryons interacting through a vector meson field (q=1). We
study how the thermodynamical parameters scale with the size of the object and
find unusual behaviours due to the non-extensivity of the system. We compare
these scaling laws with the area scaling of the black hole entropy. We also
determine the domain of validity of these scaling laws by calculating the
critical radius above which relativistic stars described by a linear equation
of state become dynamically unstable. For photon stars, we show that the
criteria of dynamical and thermodynamical stability coincide. Considering
finite spheres, we find that the mass and entropy as a function of the central
density present damped oscillations. We give the critical value of the central
density, corresponding to the first mass peak, above which the series of
equilibria becomes unstable. Finally, we extend our results to d-dimensional
spheres. We show that the oscillations of mass versus central density disappear
above a critical dimension d_{crit}(q). For Newtonian isothermal stars (q=0) we
recover the critical dimension d_{crit}=10. For the stiffest stars (q=1) we
find d_{crit}=9 and for a self-gravitating radiation (q=1/d) we find
d_{crit}=9.96404372... very close to 10. Finally, we give analytical solutions
of relativistic isothermal spheres in 2D gravity.

investigate resolution effects on the properties of the velocity field. To
quantify the structure of the velocity field we also perform a kinemetry
analysis. If the galaxy is undisturbed we find that the rotation curve
extracted from the 2D field agrees well with long-slit rotation curves. This is
not true for interacting systems, as the kinematic axis is not well defined and
does in general not coincide with the photometric axis of the system. For large
(Milky way type) galaxies we find that distortions are still visible at
intermediate redshifts but partly smeared out. Thus a careful analysis of the
velocity field is necessary before using it for a Tully-Fisher study. For small
galaxies (disc scale length ~2 kpc) even strong distortions are not visible in
the velocity field at z~0.5 with currently available angular resolution.
Therefore we conclude that current distant Tully-Fisher studies cannot give
reliable results for low-mass systems. Additionally to these studies we confirm
the power of near-infrared integral field spectrometers in combination with
adaptive optics (such as SINFONI) to study velocity fields of galaxies at high
redshift (z~2).

the Penrose plane wave limit of spacetime in the neighbourhood of a null
geodesic. We find that the high-frequency limit of the phase velocity (i.e. the
wavefront velocity) is always equal to c and causality is assured. However, the
Kramers-Kronig dispersion relation is violated due to a non-analyticity of the
refractive index in the upper-half complex plane, whose origin may be traced to
the generic focusing property of null geodesic congruences and the existence of
conjugate points. This puts into question the issue of micro-causality, i.e.
the vanishing of commutators of field operators at spacelike separated points,
in local quantum field theory in curved spacetime.

orders of magnitude in peak flux, establishing a general scaling law and
extending it to the most intense stellar flaring events observed to date. We
used the data from the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager
(RHESSI) spacecraft, a NASA Small Explorer launched in February 2002. RHESSI
has good spectral resolution (~1 keV in the X-ray range) and broad energy
coverage (3 keV--20 MeV), which makes it well suited to distinguish the thermal
from non-thermal emission in solar flares. Our study is based on the detailed
analysis of 45 flares ranging from the GOES C-class, to the strongest X-class
events, using the peak photon fluxes in the GOES 1.6--12.4 keV and in two bands
selected from RHESSI data, i.e.20--40 keV and 60--80 keV. We find a significant
correlation between the soft and hard peak X-ray fluxes spanning the complete
sample studied. The resulting scaling law has been extrapolated to the case of
the most intense stellar flares observed, comparing it with the stellar

metal surfaces is of paramount importance; it provides valuable information on
the nature of the adsorbate-substrate and the substrate-substrate interactions.
In particular, the experimental broadening observed in the diffusive peak with
increasing coverage is usually interpreted in terms of a dipole-dipole like
interaction among adsorbates via extensive molecular dynamics calculations
within the Langevin framework. Here we present an alternative way to interpret
this broadening by means of a purely stochastic description, namely the
interacting single adsorbate approximation, where two noise sources are
considered: (1) a Gaussian white noise accounting for the surface friction and
temperature, and (2) a white shot noise replacing the interaction potential
between adsorbates. Standard Langevin numerical simulations for flat and
corrugated surfaces (with a separable potential) illustrate the dynamics of Na
atoms on a Cu(100) surface which fit fairly well to the analytical expressions
issued from simple models (free particle and anharmonic oscillator) when the
Gaussian approximation is assumed. A similar broadening is also expected for
the frustrated translational mode peaks.

massless superparticle (M0-brane) in its spinor moving frame or twistor-like
Lorentz harmonics formulation. The presence of additional twistor-like
variables (spinor harmonics) allows us to separate covariantly the first and
the second class constraints. After taking into account the second class
constraints by means of Dirac brackets and after further reducing the first
class constraints algebra, the dynamical system is described by the cohomology
of a simple BRST charge associated to the d=1, n=16 supersymmetry algebra. The
calculation of the cohomology of this BRST operator requires a regularization
which implies the complexification of the bosonic ghost associated to the
kappa-symmetry and further leads to a complex (non-Hermitian) BRST charge which
is essentially the `pure spinor' BRST operator by Berkovits, but with a
composite pure spinor.

opposite. We then show that any quantization functor with this property also
commutes with the operation of taking doubles. As an application, we show that
the Etingof-Kazhdan quantization of some affine Lie superalgebras coincide with

important instruments for studying their cosmological evolution. However, the
classic spectral line ratios techniques can become misleading when trying to
properly separate AGN from starbursts or even from apparently normal galaxies.
  Aims: We use X-ray band observations to discriminate AGN activity in
previously classified MIR-selected starburst galaxies and to derive updated
AGN1 and (Compton thin) AGN2 counts at 15 um.
  Methods: XMM observations of the ELAIS-S1 15um sample down to flux limits
~2x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (2-10 keV band) were used. We classified as AGN all
those MIR sources with a unabsorbed 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity higher that
~10^42 erg/s.
  Results: We find that at least about 13(+/-6) per cent of the previously
classified starburst galaxies harbor an AGN. According to these figures, we
provide an updated estimate of the counts of AGN1 and (Compton thin) AGN2 at 15
um. It turns out that at least 24% of the extragalactic sources brighter than
0.6 my at 15 um are AGN (~13% contribution to the extragalactic background
produced at fluxes brighter than 0.6 mJy).

magnetodipolar interaction between ferromagnetic (FM) layers of a trilayer
magnetic nanoelement on its magnetization dynamics. As an example we use a
Co/Cu/Ni80Fe20 element with a square lateral shape where the magnetization of
FM layers forms a closed Landau-like domain pattern. First we show that when
the thickness of the non-magnetic (NM) spacer is in the technology relevant
region h ~ 10 nm, magnetodipolar interaction between 90o Neel domain walls in
FM layers qualitatively changes the equilibrium magnetization state of these
layers. In the main of the paper we compare the magnetization dynamics induced
by a sub-nsec field pulse in a single-layer Ni80Fe20 (Py) element and in the
Co/Cu/Py trilayer element. Here we show that (i) due to the spontaneous
symmetry breaking of the Landau state in the FM/NM/FM trilayer its domains and
domain walls oscillate with different frequencies and have different spatial
oscillation patterns; (ii) magnetization oscillations of the trilayer domains
are strongly suppressed due to different oscillation frequencies of domains in
Co and Py; (iii) magnetization dynamics qualitatively depends on the relative
rotation sense of magnetization states in Co and Py layers and on the
magnetocrystalline anisotropy kind of Co crystallites. Finally we discuss the
relation of our findings with experimental observations of magnetization
dynamics in magnetic trilayers, performed using the element-specific
time-resolved X-ray microscopy.

redshifts and evolutionary stages of galaxies. In order to understand the
increased SF rates in intermediate redshift galaxies one possibility is to
study star formation in local galaxies with properties frequently found at this
earlier epoch like low metallicity and small size. We present sensitive
observations of the molecular gas in M 33, a small Local Group spiral at a
distance of 840 kpc which shares many of the characteristics of the
intermediate redshift galaxies. The observations were carried out in the
CO(2--1) line with the HERA heterodyne array on the IRAM 30 m telescope. A
11\arcmin$\times$22\arcmin region in the northern part of M 33 was observed,
reaching a detection threshold of a few 10$^{3}$ \msol. The correlation in this
field between the CO emission and tracers of SF (8\mum, 24\mum, \Ha, FUV) is
excellent and CO is detected very far North, showing that molecular gas forms
far out in the disk even in a small spiral with a subsolar metallicity. One
major molecular cloud was discovered in an interarm region with no HI peak and
little if any signs of SF -- without a complete survey this cloud would never
have been found. The radial dependence of the CO emission has a scale length
similar to the dust emission, less extended than the \Ha or FUV. If, however,
the $\ratioo$ ratio varies inversely with metallicity, then the scale length of
the H$_2$ becomes similar to that of the \Ha or FUV. Comparing the SF rate to
the H$_2$ mass shows that M 33, like the intermediate redshift galaxies it
resembles, has a significantly higher SF efficiency than large local universe
spirals.
