Dedekind Q-algebra, some stronger results are obtained. A key element in the
proof is a theorem which yields the following corollary: Over an Artinian ring
A all two-dimensional polynomial automorphisms having Jacobian determinant one
are stably tame, and are tame if A is a Q-algebra. Another crucial ingredient,
of interest in itself, is that stable tameness is a local property: If an
automorphism is locally tame, then it is stably tame.

discussing Poincare duality and orientability. In the discussion of
orientability, Hochschild homology is replaced by a twisted version which
avoids the dimension drop. The twisted Hochschild cycle representing an
orientation is related to the volume form of the distinguished covariant
differential calculus. Integration over the volume form defines a twisted
cyclic 2-cocycle which computes the q-winding numbers of quantum line bundles.
Second, a ""twisted"" Chern character from equivariant K0-theory to even twisted

between equivariant K0-theory and twisted cyclic cohomology. The Chern-Connes
pairing between the equivariant K0-group of the standard Podles sphere and the

spectroscopy. The optical emission of the galaxy is dominated by a central
young starburst, with a bar-like shape, while an underlying component of stars,
with elliptical isophotes and red colors, extends more than 4 kpc from the
galaxy center. High resolution Halpha and color maps allow us to identify the
star-forming regions, to spatially discriminate them from the older stars, and
to recognize several dust patches. We derive colors and Halpha parameters for
all the identified star-forming knots. Observables derived for each knot are
corrected for the contribution of the underlying older stellar population, the
contribution by emission lines, and from interstellar extinction, and compared
with evolutionary synthesis models. We find that the contributions of these
three factors are by no means negligible and that they significantly vary
across the galaxy. Therefore, careful quantification and subtraction of
emission lines, galaxy host contribution, and interstellar reddening at every
galaxy position, are essential to derive the properties of the young stars in
BCDs. We find that we can reproduce the colors of all the knots with an
instantaneous burst of star formation and the Salpeter initial mass function
with an upper mass limit of 100 M_solar. In all cases the knots are just a few
Myr old. The underlying population of stars has colors consistent with being
several Gyr old.

derived from the library of models by using the Bayesian statistics. We find a
decreasing presence of galaxies with low attenuation and low total luminosity
as redshift decreases, which does not hold for high total luminosity galaxies.
In addition the dust attenuation of low mass galaxies increases as redshift
decreases, and this trend seems to disappear for galaxies with M* > 10^11
M_sun. This result is consistent with a mass dependent evolution of the dust to
gas ratio, which could be driven by a mass dependent efficiency of star
formation in star forming galaxies. The specific star formation rates (SSFR)
decrease with increasing stellar mass at all redshifts, and for a given stellar
mass the SSFR decreases with decreasing redshift. The differences in the slope
of the M*--SSFR relation found between this work and others at similar redshift
could be explained by the adopted selection criteria of the samples which, for

random subset is almost surely difference dominated, as N --> oo, for any
choice of p(N) tending to zero, thus confirming a conjecture of Martin and
O'Bryant. The proofs use recent strong concentration results.
  Furthermore, we exhibit a threshold phenomenon regarding the ratio of the
size of the difference- to the sumset. If p(N) = o(N^{-1/2}) then almost all
sums and differences in the random subset are almost surely distinct, and in
particular the difference set is almost surely about twice as large as the
sumset. If N^{-1/2} = o(p(N)) then both the sum and difference sets almost
surely have size (2N+1) - O(p(N)^{-2}), and so the ratio in question is almost
surely very close to one. If p(N) = c N^{-1/2} then as c increases from zero to
infinity (i.e., as the threshold is crossed), the same ratio almost surely
decreases continuously from two to one according to an explicitly given
function of c.
  We also extend our results to the comparison of the generalized difference
sets attached to an arbitrary pair of binary linear forms. For certain pairs of
forms f and g, we show that there in fact exists a sharp threshold at c_{f,g}
N^{-1/2}, for some computable constant c_{f,g}, such that one form almost
surely dominates below the threshold, and the other almost surely above it.
  The heart of our approach involves using different tools to obtain strong

viscosity parameter (alpha) to be ~ 0.2 - 0.02 in the outburst state,

may be consistent with theories incorporating both gravitational instability

  Methods: We randomly vary the parameters of the standard fireball model to

results with available observational data to assess the internal consistency of
the standard fireball model.
  Results: We show that the luminosity functions can be described by a function
similar to a log normal distribution with an exponential cutoff. The function
parameters are frequency dependent but not very dependent on the model
parameter distributions used to create the virtual populations. Comparison with
observations shows that while there is good general agreement with the data, it
is difficult to explain simultaneously the X-ray and optical data. Possible
reasons for this are discussed and the most likely one is that the standard

from the nucleus, and a bright complex of star formation 47"" (3 kpc) SW of the
nucleus. The brightest 8 um PAH emission regions coincide remarkably well with
knots observed in an Halpha image. Strong PAH features at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and
11.3 um are detected in IRS spectra measured at numerous locations inside,
within, and outside the inner spiral. The IRAC colors and IRS spectra of these
regions rule out dust heated by the AGN as the primary emission source; the
SEDs are dominated by starlight and PAH emission. The equivalent widths and
flux ratios of the PAH features in the inner spiral are generally consistent
with conditions in a typical spiral galaxy ISM. Interior to the inner spiral,
the influence of the AGN on the ISM is evident via PAH flux ratios indicative
of a higher ionization parameter and a significantly smaller mean equivalent
width than observed in the inner spiral. The brightest 8 and 24 um emission
peaks in the disk of the galaxy, even at distances beyond the inner spiral, are
located within the ionization cones traced by [O III]/Hbeta, and they are also
remarkably well aligned with the axis of the radio jets. Although it is
possible that radiation from the AGN may directly enhance PAH excitation or
trigger the formation of OB stars that subsequently excite PAH emission at
these locations in the inner spiral, the orientation of collimated radiation
from the AGN and star formation knots in the inner spiral could be
coincidental. (abridged)

associated with hydrostatic nuclear burning on the surface of a white dwarf
with high accretion rate. This high mass transfer rate has been suggested to be
caused by dynamical instability, expected when the donor star is more massive
than the accreting object. When the orbital period is smaller than ~6 hours,
this mechanism does not work and the CBSS with such periods are believed to be
fed by a distinct mechanism: the wind-driven accretion. Such a mechanism has
been proposed to explain the properties of objects like SMC 13, T Pyx and V617
Sgr. One observational property that offers a critical test for discriminating
between the above two possibilities is the orbital period change. As systems
with wind-driven accretion evolve with increasing periods, some of them may
reach quite long orbital periods. The above critical test may, therefore, also
be applied to orbital periods longer than 6 hours. CAL 87 is an eclipsing
system in the LMC with an orbital period of 10.6 hours that could provide the
opportunity for testing the hypothesis of the system being powered by
wind-driven accretion. We obtained eclipse timings for this system and show
that its orbital period increases with a rate of P/Pdot = +7.2(+/-1.3) X 10^{6}
years. Contrary to the common belief, we conclude that CAL 87 is the first
confirmed case of a wind-driven CBSS with an orbital period longer than 6
hours. The system is probably an evolved object that had an initial secondary
mass of M2i=0.63 solar masses but is currently reduced to about M2=0.34 solar
masses. We discuss evidence that other CBSS, like CAL 83 and V Sge stars, like
WX Cen, are probably also wind-driven systems. This may in fact be the rule,
and systems with inverted mass ratio, the exception.

  Estimation","18 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables",,,,"q-bio.PE q-bio.GN q-bio.QM",,"  Estimates of molecular divergence times when rates of evolution vary require
the assumption of a model of rate change. Brownian motion is one such model,
and since rates cannot become negative, a log Brownian model seems appropriate.
Divergence time estimates can then be made using weighted least squares
penalties. As sequences become long, this approach effectively becomes
equivalent to penalized likelihood or Bayesian approaches. Different forms of
the least squares penalty are considered to take into account correlation due
to shared ancestors. It is shown that a scale parameter is also needed since
the sum of squares changes with the scale of time. Errors or uncertainty on
fossil calibrations, may be folded in with errors due to the stochastic nature
of Brownian motion and ancestral polymorphism, giving a total sum of squares to
be minimized. Applying these methods to placental mammal data the estimated age
of the root decreases from 125 to about 94 mybp. However, multiple fossil
calibration points and relative molecular divergence times inflate the sum of
squares more than expected. If fossil data are also bootstrapped, then the
confidence interval for the root of placental mammals varies widely from ~70 to
130 mybp. Such a wide interval suggests that more and better fossil calibration
data is needed and/or better models of rate evolution are needed and/or better
molecular data are needed. Until these issues are thoroughly investigated, it
is premature to declare either the old molecular dates frequently obtained
(e.g. > 110 mybp) or the lack of identified placental fossils in the
Cretaceous, more indicative of when crown-group placental mammals evolved.

galaxy void statistics to test whether the galaxy content of halos of fixed
mass is systematically different in low density environments. We present new
measurements of the void probability function (VPF) and underdensity
probability function (UPF) from Data Release Four of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey, as well as new measurements of the VPF from the full data release of
the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey. We compare these measurements to
predictions calculated from models of the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD)
that are constrained to match both w_p and the space density of galaxies. The
standard implementation of the HOD assumes that galaxy occupation depends on
halo mass only, and is independent of local environment. For luminosity-defined
samples, we find that the standard HOD prediction is a good match to the
observations, and the data exclude models in which galaxy formation efficiency
is reduced in low-density environments. More remarkably, we find that the void
statistics of red and blue galaxies (at L ~ 0.4L_*) are perfectly predicted by
standard HOD models matched to the correlation function of these samples,
ruling out ""assembly bias"" models in which galaxy color is correlated with
large-scale environment at fixed halo mass. We conclude that the luminosity and
color of field galaxies are determined predominantly by the mass of the halo in
which they reside and have little direct dependence on the environment in which
the host halo formed. In broader terms, our results show that the sizes and
emptiness of voids found in the distribution of L > 0.2L_* galaxies are in
excellent agreement with the predictions of a standard cosmological model with

We prove a lemma which greatly simplifies the derivation of the recurrence

  to Academic Radiology",,,,"physics.med-ph",,"  The human lung and its functions are extremely sensitive to orientation and
posture, and debate continues as to the role of gravity and the surrounding
anatomy in determining lung function and heterogeneity of perfusion and
ventilation. However, study of these effects is difficult. The conventional
high-field magnets used for most hyperpolarized 3He MRI of the human lung, and
most other common radiological imaging modalities including PET and CT,
restrict subjects to lying horizontally, minimizing most gravitational effects.
In this paper, we briefly review the motivation for posture-dependent studies
of human lung function, and present initial imaging results of human lungs in
the supine and vertical body orientations using inhaled hyperpolarized 3He gas
and an open-access MRI instrument. The open geometry of this MRI system
features a ""walk-in"" capability that permits subjects to be imaged in vertical
and horizontal positions, and potentially allows for complete rotation of the
orientation of the imaging subject in a two-dimensional plane. Initial results
include two-dimensional lung images acquired with ~ 4 mm in-plane resolution
and three-dimensional images with ~ 1.5 cm slice thickness. Effects of posture
variation are observed.

the low speeds indicated by VLBI knot motions and the high Doppler factors
inferred from emission of TeV photons could be reconciled if ultrarelativistic
jets possessed modest opening angles. Here we evaluate the (flux-weighted)
viewing angles of the jet and the apparent speeds and Doppler factors of the
radio knots on parsec scales. The influence of the jet opening angle on these
radio knot parameters are found for the usually considered types of
relativistic nuclear jets: those with uniform bulk speeds and those where the
bulk Lorentz factor of the flow decreases with distance from the jet axis,
known as `spine--sheath' flows. For both types of jet velocity structures the
expectation value of the jet orientation angle at first falls dramatically with
increases in the (central) jet Lorentz factor, but for extremely relativistic
jets it levels off at a fraction of the opening angle. The effective values of
the apparent speeds and Doppler factors of the knots always decline
substantially with increasing jet opening angle. The rarity of highly
superluminal parsec-scale radio components in TeV blazars can be understood if
their jets are both highly relativistic and intrinsically weaker, so probably
less well collimated, than the jets in ordinary blazars.

replication models. The first model considers a population of organisms
replicating via the production of asexual spores. The second model considers a
sexually replicating population that produces identical gametes. The third
model considers a sexually replicating population that produces distinct sperm
and egg gametes. All models assume diploid organisms whose genomes consist of
two chromosomes, each of which is taken to be functional if equal to some
master sequence, and defective otherwise. In the asexual population, the
asexual diploid spores develop directly into adult organisms. In the sexual
populations, the haploid gametes enter a haploid pool, where they may fuse with
other haploids. The resulting immature diploid organisms then proceed to
develop into mature organisms. Based on an analysis of all three models, we
find that, as organism size increases, a sexually replicating population can
only outcompete an asexually replicating population if the adult organisms
produce distinct sperm and egg gametes. A sexual replication strategy that is
based on the production of large numbers of sperm cells to fertilize a small
number of eggs is found to be necessary in order to maintain a sufficiently low
cost for sex for the strategy to be selected for over a purely asexual
strategy. We discuss the usefulness of this model in understanding the
evolution and maintenance of sexual replication as the preferred replication
strategy in complex, multicellular organisms.

adaptation in an asexual population is determined by the dynamics of the
stochastic edge of the population, that is, by the emergence and subsequent
establishment of rare mutants that exceed the fitness of all sequences
currently present in the population. Desai and Fisher perform an elaborate
stochastic calculation of the mean time $\tau$ until a new class of mutants has
been established, and interpret $1/\tau$ as the speed of adaptation. As they
note, however, their calculations are valid only for moderate speeds. This
limitation arises from their method to determine $\tau$: Desai and Fisher
back-extrapolate the value of $\tau$ from the best-fit class' exponential
growth at infinite time. This approach is not valid when the population adapts
rapidly, because in this case the best-fit class grows non-exponentially during
the relevant time interval. Here, we substantially extend Desai and Fisher's
analysis of the stochastic edge. We show that we can apply Desai and Fisher's
method to high speeds by either exponentially back-extrapolating from finite
time or using a non-exponential back-extrapolation. Our results are compatible
with predictions made using a different analytical approach (Rouzine et al.

the Compton scale: the tail of the potential follows an anisotropic Coulomb
law, decreasing away from the charge slower along the magnetic field and faster
across. In the infinite-magnetic-field limit the potential is confined to an
infinitely thin string passing though the charge parallel to the external

correlated spin ice regime that extends from 1 K down to as low as 60 mK. The
diffuse elastic neutron scattering intensities in the spin ice regime can be
remarkably well described by a phenomenological model of weakly interacting
hexagonal spin clusters, as invoked in other geometrically frustrated magnets.
We present a highly refined microscopic theory of Dy2Ti2O7 that includes
long-range dipolar and exchange interactions to third nearest neighbors and
which demonstrates that the clusters are purely fictitious in this material.
The seeming emergence of composite spin clusters and their associated
scattering pattern is instead an indicator of fine-tuning of ancillary
correlations within a strongly correlated state.

  - whose sample complexity has no dependence on n, the dimension of the domain
the Boolean functions are defined over;
  - with no access to any classical or quantum membership (""black-box"")
queries. Instead, our algorithms use only classical examples generated
uniformly at random and fixed quantum superpositions of such classical
examples;
  - which require only a few quantum examples but possibly many classical
random examples (which are considered quite ""cheap"" relative to quantum
examples).
  Our quantum algorithms are based on a subroutine FS which enables sampling
according to the Fourier spectrum of f; the FS subroutine was used in earlier
work of Bshouty and Jackson on quantum learning. Our results are as follows:
  - We give an algorithm for testing k-juntas to accuracy $\epsilon$ that uses
$O(k/\epsilon)$ quantum examples. This improves on the number of examples used
by the best known classical algorithm.
  - We establish the following lower bound: any FS-based k-junta testing
algorithm requires $\Omega(\sqrt{k})$ queries.
  - We give an algorithm for learning $k$-juntas to accuracy $\epsilon$ that
uses $O(\epsilon^{-1} k\log k)$ quantum examples and $O(2^k \log(1/\epsilon))$
random examples. We show that this learning algorithms is close to optimal by
giving a related lower bound.

spans E(J-Ks)=0.3 to 10 mag (corresponding to visual extinction between about 2

in the diffuse ISM where a tight linear correlation between the 9.7 micron
silicate feature optical depth and the extinction (Av) is observed, we find
that the silicate feature in dense clouds does not show a monotonic increase
with extinction. Thus, in dense clouds, tau_9.7 is not a good measure of total
dust column density. With few exceptions, the measured tau_9.7 values fall well
below the diffuse ISM correlation line for E(J-Ks) > 2 mag (Av >12 mag). Grain
growth via coagulation is a likely cause of this effect.

strongly affected by observational biases. We develop a thorough analysis of
these systematic effects by relying on specially selected mock catalogues. For
the purpose of this paper, we use the MAK reconstruction method, although any
other Lagrangian reconstruction method should be sensitive to the same
problems. We extensively study the uncertainty in the mass-to-light assignment
due to luminosity incompleteness, and the poorly-determined relation between
mass and luminosity. The impact of redshift distortion corrections is analyzed
in the context of MAK and we check the importance of edge and finite-volume
effects on the reconstructed velocities. Using three mock catalogues with
different average densities, we also study the effect of cosmic variance. In
particular, one of them presents the same global features as found in
observational catalogues that extend to 80 Mpc/h scales. We give recipes,
checked using the aforementioned mock catalogues, to handle these particular
observational effects, after having introduced them into the mock catalogues so
as to quantitatively mimic the most densely sampled currently available galaxy
catalogue of the nearby universe. Once biases have been taken care of, the
typical resulting error in reconstructed velocities is typically about a
quarter of the overall velocity dispersion, and without significant bias. We
finally model our reconstruction errors to propose an improved Bayesian
approach to measure Omega_m in an unbiased way by comparing the reconstructed
velocities to the measured ones in distance space, even though they may be
plagued by large errors. We show that, in the context of observational data, a
nearly unbiased estimator of Omega_m may be built using MAK reconstruction.

integrable functions that support a tridiagonal matrix representation for the

plasticity, which is able to learn either discrete or continuous attractors,
depending on the frequency of presentation of stimuli and on the structure of
sensory coding. A continuous attractor is learned when experience matches
sensory coding, i.e. when the distribution of experienced stimuli matches the
distribution of preferred stimuli of neurons. In that case, there is no
processing of sensory information and neural activity displays maximal entropy.
If experience goes beyond sensory coding, processing is initiated and the
continuous attractor is destabilized into a set of discrete attractors.

theoretical framework and the observations that motivate it. A conception of
star formation has emerged in which turbulence plays a dual role, both creating
overdensities to initiate gravitational contraction or collapse, and countering
the effects of gravity in these overdense regions. The key dynamical processes
involved in star formation -- turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity --
are highly nonlinear and multidimensional. Physical arguments are used to
identify and explain the features and scalings involved in star formation, and
results from numerical simulations are used to quantify these effects. We
divide star formation into large-scale and small-scale regimes and review each
in turn. Large scales range from galaxies to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and
their substructures. Important problems include how GMCs form and evolve, what
determines the star formation rate (SFR), and what determines the initial mass
function (IMF). Small scales range from dense cores to the protostellar systems
they beget. We discuss formation of both low- and high-mass stars, including
ongoing accretion. The development of winds and outflows is increasingly well
understood, as are the mechanisms governing angular momentum transport in
disks. Although outstanding questions remain, the framework is now in place to
build a comprehensive theory of star formation that will be tested by the next

thermodynamics of these spacetimes is investigated, while in the second part
the no hair theorem for these spacetimes in four dimensions is considered. In
part I, first, the Euclidean actions of a d-dimensional charged rotating black
brane are computed through the use of the counterterms renormalization method
both in the canonical and the grand-canonical ensemble, and it is shown that
the logarithmic divergencies associated to the Weyl anomalies and matter field
vanish. Second, a Smarr-type formula for the mass as a function of the entropy,
the angular momenta and the electric charge is obtained, which shows that these
quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. Third, by using the
conserved quantities and the Euclidean actions, the thermodynamics potentials
of the system in terms of the temperature, the angular velocities and the
electric potential are obtained both in the canonical and the grand-canonical
ensemble. Fourth, a stability analysis in these two ensembles is performed,
which shows that the system is thermally stable. This is in commensurable with
the fact that there is no Hawking-Page phase transition for black object with
zero curvature horizon. Finally, the logarithmic correction of the entropy due
to the thermal fluctuation around the equilibrium is calculated. In part II,
the cosmological defects are studied, and it is shown that the Abelian Higgs
field equations in the background of a four-dimensional rotating charged black
string have vortex solutions.

physics of photoionized nebula. In this work, we analize and discuss data for a
sample of Galactic and extragalactic HII regions where this abundance
discrepancy has been determined. We find that the abundance discrepancy factor
(ADF) is fairly constant and of the order of 2 in all the available sample of
HII regions. This is a rather different behaviour than that observed in
planetary nebulae, where the ADF shows a much wider range of values. We do not
find correlations between the ADF and the O/H, O++/H+ ratios, the ionization
degree, Te(High), Te(Low)/ Te(High), FWHM, and the effective temperature of the
main ionizing stars within the observational uncertainties. These results
indicate that whatever mechanism is producing the abundance discrepancy in HII
regions it does not substantially depend on those nebular parameters. On the
contrary, the ADF seems to be slightly dependent on the excitation energy, a
fact that is consistent with the predictions of the classical temperature
fluctuations paradigm. Finally, we obtain that Te values obtained from OII
recombination lines in HII regions are in agreement with those obtained from
collisionally excited line ratios, a behaviour that is again different from
that observed in planetary nebulae. These similar temperature determinations
are in contradiction with the predictions of the model based on the presence of
chemically inhomogeneous clumps but are consistent with the temperature
fluctuations paradigm. We conclude that all the indications suggest that the
physical mechanism responsible of the abundance discrepancy in HII regions and
planetary nebulae are different.

considered here are able to heat the IGM at z<25, although never above ~100 K.
Stars with a Salpeter IMF are more effective as, due to the contribution from
small-mass long-living stars, they produce a higher Lyalpha background. Lyalpha
heating can affect the subsequent formation of small mass objects by producing
an entropy floor that may limit the amount of gas able to collapse and reduce
the gas clumping.We find that the gas fraction in halos of mass below ~ 5 x
10^6 M_sun is less than 50% (for the smallest masses this fraction drops to 1%

Group (LG) indicates that there maybe a limit on mass of a halo, which can host
a galaxy. This idea can be tested using voids in the distribution of galaxies:
at some level small voids should not contain any (even dwarf) galaxies. We use
observational samples complete to M_B = -12 with distances less than 8 Mpc to
construct the void function (VF): the distribution of sizes of voids empty of
any galaxies. There are ~30 voids with sizes ranging from 1 to 5 Mpc. We then
study the distribution of dark matter halos in very high resolution simulations
of the LCDM model. The theoretical VF matches the observations remarkably well
only if we use halos with circular velocities larger than 45 +/- 10 km/s. This
agrees with the Local Group predictions. There are smaller halos in the voids,
but they should not produce any luminous matter. Small voids look quite similar
to their giant cousins: the density has a minimum at the center of a void and
it increases as we get closer to the border. Small nonluminous halos inside the
void form a web of tiny filaments. Thus, both the Local Group data and the
nearby voids indicate that isolated halos below 45 +/- 10 km/s must not host
galaxies and that small (few Mpc) voids are truly dark.

Kepler law significant at more than 1-sigma level would occur if the
inclination i of the system's orbital plane to the plane of the sky falls
outside the range 41-56 deg: such deviations cannot be due to the first
post-Newtonian (1PN) correction to the orbital period because of its smallness;
interpreted in the framework of the Newtonian theory of gravitation as due to
the stellar quadrupole mass moment Q, they are unphysical because Q would take
unreasonably large values. By conservatively assuming that the third Kepler law
is an adequate model for the orbital period we obtain i=(48 +/- 7) deg which

A model for superconductivity is developed based on the assumption that doping

out-of-plane A1 orbitals apical O pz, planar Cu dz2, and planar O psigma. This
is in contrast to the assumption of hole doping into planar Cu dx2-y2 and O
psigma orbitals as in the t-J model. Interaction of holes with the d9 spin
background leads to chiral polarons with either a clockwise or anti-clockwise
charge current. When the polaron plaquettes percolate through the crystal at
x~0.05 for LaSrCuO, a Cu dx2-y2 and planar O psigma band is formed. Spin
exchange Coulomb repulsion with chiral polarons leads to D-wave
superconductivity. The equivalent of the Debye energy in phonon
superconductivity is the maximum energy separation between a chiral polaron and
its time-reversed partner. An additive skew-scattering contribution to the Hall
effect is induced by chiral polarons and leads to a temperature dependent Hall
effect that fits the measured values for LaSrCuO. The integrated imaginary
susceptibility satisfies omega/T scaling due to chirality and spin-flip
scattering of polarons along with a uniform distribution of polaron energy
splittings. The derived functional form is compatible with experiments. The
static spin structure factor is computed and is incommensurate with a
separation distance from (pi,pi) given by ~(2pi)x. Coulomb scattering of the
x2-y2 band with polarons leads to linear resistivity. Coupling of the x2-y2
band to the undoped Cu d9 spins leads to the ARPES pseudogap and its doping and
temperature dependence.

follows the expected relation $\rho(B_\perp) = \rho_{\rm{B}}\exp(\alpha
B_\perp^2)$. The prefactor $\rho_{\rm{B}}$ decreases exponentially with
increasing electron density but saturates to a finite value at higher
densities. Strikingly, this value is found to be universal when expressed in
terms of absolute resistance and and shows quantisation at $R_{\rm{B}}\approx
h/e^2$ and $R_{\rm{B}}\approx 1/2$ $ h/e^2$. We suggest a strongly correlated
electronic phase as a possible explanation.

is often studied to determine the regions where this variable varies the most
or to find teleconnections, i.e. correlations between specific regions. While
usual methods to find spatial patterns, such as Principal Components Analysis
(PCA), are constrained by linear symmetries, the dependence of variables such
as temperature or pressure at different locations is generally nonlinear. In
particular, large deviations from the sample mean are expected to be strongly
affected by such nonlinearities. Here we apply a newly developed nonlinear
technique (Maxima of Cumulant Function, MCF) for the detection of typical
spatial patterns that largely deviate from the mean. In order to test the
technique and to introduce the methodology, we focus on the El Nino/Southern
Oscillation and its spatial patterns. We find nonsymmetric temperature patterns
corresponding to El Nino and La Nina, and we compare the results of MCF with
other techniques, such as the symmetric solutions of PCA, and the nonsymmetric
solutions of Nonlinear PCA (NLPCA). We found that MCF solutions are more
reliable than the NLPCA fits, and can capture mixtures of principal components.
Finally, we apply Extreme Value Theory on the temporal variations extracted
from our methodology. We find that the tails of the distribution of extreme
temperatures during La Nina episodes is bounded, while the tail during El Ninos
is less likely to be bounded. This implies that the mean spatial patterns of
the two phases are asymmetric, as well as the behaviour of their extremes.

magnetic field. In order to characterize the kind of propagation we evaluated
the mean-square displacement (MSD), the participation function and which is
more important we were able to follow the wave at different times, which

superconducting and Mott-insulating states are explored for the two-dimensional
Hubbard model including nearest and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings at zero
temperature. Using the variational cluster approach with clusters of different
shapes and sizes up to 10 sites, it is found that the doping-driven transition
from a phase with microscopic coexistence of antiferromagnetism and
superconductivity to a purely superconducting phase is discontinuous for strong
interaction and accompanied by phase separation. At half-filling the system is
in an antiferromagnetic Mott-insulating state with vanishing charge
compressibility. Upon decreasing the interaction strength U below a certain
critical value of roughly U=4 (in units of the nearest-neighbor hopping),
however, the filling-dependent magnetic transition changes its character and
becomes continuous. Phase separation or, more carefully, the tendency towards
the formation of inhomogeneous states disappears. This critical value is in
contrast to previous studies, where a much larger value was obtained. Moreover,
we find that the system at half-filling undergoes the Mott transition from an
insulator to a state with a finite charge compressibility at essentially the
same value. The weakly correlated state at half-filling exhibits
superconductivity microscopically admixed to the antiferromagnetic order. This
scenario suggests a close relation between phase separation and the
Mott-insulator physics.

energy gain due to the Jahn-Teller distortion is 82/104 meV per chromium ion in
the tetragonal/monoclinic phase, respectively. These phases show A-type
magnetic ordering and have a bandgap of 2.48 eV. In this Mott insulating state
KCrF_3 has a substantial conduction bandwidth of 2.1 eV, leading to the
possibility for the kinetic energy of charge carriers in electron- or
hole-doped derivatives of KCrF_3 to overcome the polaron localization at low
temperatures, in analogy with the situation encountered in the colossal
magnetoresistive manganites.

incorporates photometry in the ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. We find that the
starburst that creates the E+A galaxy typically takes place within the last Gyr
and creates a high fraction (20-60 percent) of the stellar mass in the remnant
over a short timescale (< 0.1 Gyrs). We find a tight correlation between the
luminosity of our E+A galaxies and the implied star formation rate (SFR) during
the starburst. While low-luminosity E+As (M(z) > -20) exhibit implied SFRs of
less than 50 solar masses per year, their luminous counterparts (M(z) < -22)
shows SFRs greater than 300 and as high as 2000 solar masses per year,
suggesting that luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies in the
low-redshift Universe could be the progenitors of massive nearby E+A galaxies.
We perform a comprehensive study of the characteristics of the quenching that
truncates the starburst in E+A systems.We find that, for galaxies less massive
than 10^10 MSun, the quenching efficiency decreases as the galaxy mass
increases. However, for galaxies more massive than 10^10 MSun, this trend is
reversed and the quenching efficiency increases with galaxy mass. Noting that
the mass threshold at which this reversal occurs is in excellent agreement with
the mass above which AGN become significantly more abundant in nearby galaxies,
we use simple energetic arguments to show that the bimodal behaviour of the
quenching efficiency is consistent with AGN and supernovae (SN) being the
principal sources of negative feedback above and below M ~ 10^10 MSun
respectively. (abridged)

  Let Y be an orbifold and R a commutative ring or Q-algebra. We define two
kinds of Kuranishi homology KH_*(Y;R). The chain complex KC_*(Y;R) defining
KH_*(Y;R) is spanned over R by [X,f,G], for X a compact oriented Kuranishi
space with corners, f : X --> Y smooth, and G ""gauge-fixing data"" which makes
Aut(X,f,G) finite. Our main result is that these are isomorphic to singular
homology. We define Poincare dual Kuranishi cohomology, isomorphic to
compactly-supported cohomology.
  We define five kinds of Kuranishi (co)bordism spanned by isomorphism
classes[X,f] for X a compact oriented Kuranishi space without boundary and f :
X --> Y smooth. They are new topological invariants, and we show they are very
large. These theories are powerful new tools in symplectic geometry. Defining
virtual cycles and chains for moduli spaces of J-holomorphic curves is trivial
in Kuranishi (co)homology. There is no need to perturb moduli spaces, and no
problems with transversality. This gives major simplifications in Lagrangian
Floer cohomology.
  We define new Gromov-Witten type invariants in Kuranishi bordism, over Z not

an area of concern within the fusion research community. In a burning plasma
machine design like the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor

contribute to tritium safety issues. Additionally due to ITER design, such dust
contamination problems are projected to become of even greater concern due to
dust/wall interactions and possible instabilities created within the plasma by
such particulates. Since the dynamics of such dust can in general be explained
employing a combination of the ion drag, Coulomb force, and ion pre-sheath
drifts, recent research in complex (dusty) plasma physics often offers unique
insights for this research area. This paper will discuss the possibility of how
experimental observations of the dust and plasma parameters within a GEC rf

  Pennsylvania (2007), Advisor: Vaclav Vitek",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  In this Thesis we first show how the shape of the Peierls barrier and its
dependence on the applied loading can be extracted from the data obtained in
atomistic studies at 0 K. We consider the Peierls barrier as a two-dimensional
periodic function of the position of the intersection of the dislocation line
with the perpendicular {111} plane, with adjustable terms dependent on the
shear stresses parallel and perpendicular to the slip direction. The functional
forms of these terms are based on the effective yield criterion recently
developed on the basis of atomistic modeling of the glide of screw dislocations
at 0 K. The minimum energy path between two potential minima, and thus the
corresponding activation barrier, is obtained using the Nudged Elastic Band
method. The constructed Peierls barrier reproduces correctly both the
well-known twinning-antitwinning asymmetry observed for pure shear parallel to
the slip direction and the effect of shear stresses perpendicular to the slip
direction. This advancement introduces for the first time the effect of both
shear stresses parallel and perpendicular to the slip direction into the model
of thermally activated dislocation motion. Based on this model we formulate a
general yield criterion that includes not only the full stress tensor but also
effects of temperature and strain rate. This approach forms a basis for
multislip yield criteria and flow relations for continuum analyses in both
single and polycrystals the results of which can be compared with experimental
observations.

global properties such as luminosity, mass, dust content, mean stellar
metallicity and mean stellar age relate to Zneb. (2) We present a simple
formalism which compresses the results of the synthesis into time-dependent
star formation rates (SFR) and mass assembly histories. (3) The current SFR
derived from the population synthesis and that from H-alpha are shown to agree
within a factor of two. Thus we now have a way to estimate SFR in AGN hosts,
where the H-alpha method cannot be applied. (4) Fully time-dependent SFHs are
derived for all galaxies and averaged over six Zneb bins spanning the entire SF
wing in the [OIII]/H-beta X [NII]/H-alpha diagram. (5) We find that SFHs vary
systematically along the SF sequence, such that low-Zneb systems evolve slower
and are currently forming stars at a higher relative rate. (6) At any given
time, the distribution of specific SFRs for galaxies within a Zneb-bin is broad
and roughly log-normal. (7) The same results are found grouping galaxies in
stellar mass (M*) or surface mass density (S*) bins. (8) The overall pattern of
SFHs as a function of Zneb, M* or S* is robust against changes in selection
criteria, choice of evolutionary synthesis models for the spectral fits, and
differential extinction effects. (Abridged)

compare the kiloparsec scale HI distribution with the location of super star
clusters found from the optical images. For most of the tails, we find that
there is an increase in super star cluster density with increasing projected HI
column density, such that the star cluster density is highest when log N(HI) >=
