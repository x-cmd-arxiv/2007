driven by mean field potentials, either due to scattering between atoms or due
to coupling to external fields; and coherent quantum dynamics have been
observed in various cold-atom experiments. In this article, we report results
of studies of a class of quantum spin dynamics which are purely driven by zero
point quantum fluctuations of spin collective coordinates. Unlike the usual
mean-field coherent dynamics, quantum fluctuation-controlled spin dynamics or
QFCSD studied here are very sensitive to variation of quantum fluctuations and
can be tuned by four to five order of magnitude using optical lattices. They
have unique dependence on optical lattice potential depths and quadratic Zeeman
fields. QFCSD can be potentially used to calibrate quantum fluctuations and
investigate correlated fluctuations and various universal scaling properties
near quantum critical points.

fields with a bounded dynamic range, in a distributed,
communication-constrained, processing environment is addressed. A central unit,
having access to the data gathered by a dense network of fixed-precision
sensors, operating under stringent inter-node communication constraints, is
required to reconstruct the field snapshots to maximum accuracy. Both
deterministic and stochastic field models are considered. For stochastic
fields, results are established in the almost-sure sense. The feasibility of
having a flexible tradeoff between the oversampling rate (sensor density) and
the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) precision, while achieving an exponential
accuracy in the number of bits per Nyquist-interval per snapshot is
demonstrated. This exposes an underlying ``conservation of bits'' principle:
the bit-budget per Nyquist-interval per snapshot (the rate) can be distributed
along the amplitude axis (sensor-precision) and space (sensor density) in an
almost arbitrary discrete-valued manner, while retaining the same (exponential)
distortion-rate characteristics. Achievable information scaling laws for field
reconstruction over a bounded region are also derived: With N one-bit sensors
per Nyquist-interval, $\Theta(\log N)$ Nyquist-intervals, and total network
bitrate $R_{net} = \Theta((\log N)^2)$ (per-sensor bitrate $\Theta((\log
N)/N)$), the maximum pointwise distortion goes to zero as $D = O((\log N)^2/N)$
or $D = O(R_{net} 2^{-\beta \sqrt{R_{net}}})$. This is shown to be possible
with only nearest-neighbor communication, distributed coding, and appropriate
interpolation algorithms. For a fixed, nonzero target distortion, the number of
fixed-precision sensors and the network rate needed is always finite.

potential-difference output-switch into diverse logic states in quantum dot
computational methods via utilizing coiled carbon nanotubes (CCNTs) and carbon
nanotube field effect transistors (CNFETs). A 'quantum confinement' is thus
derived for a flow of particles in a categorized quantum well substrate with a

space-time continuum is folded by chance for the particle. This benefits from
Maxwell-Lorentz theory in Minkowski's space-time viewpoint alike to crystal
oscillators for precise data timing purposes and radar systems e.g., time
varying self-clocking devices in diverse geographic locations. This application
could also be optional for data depository versus extraction, in the best
supercomputer system's locations, autonomously. For best performance in
minimizing current limiting mechanisms including electromigration, a multilevel
metallization and implant process forming elevated sources/drains for the

to calculate the partition function, the Greens functions and the field

neuronal activity are discrete jumps between a small number of stable states.
Learning in systems with discrete synapses is known to be a computationally
hard problem. Here, we study a neurobiologically plausible on-line learning
algorithm that derives from Belief Propagation algorithms. We show that it
performs remarkably well in a model neuron with binary synapses, and a finite
number of `hidden' states per synapse, that has to learn a random
classification task. Such system is able to learn a number of associations
close to the theoretical limit, in time which is sublinear in system size. This
is to our knowledge the first on-line algorithm that is able to achieve
efficiently a finite number of patterns learned per binary synapse.
Furthermore, we show that performance is optimal for a finite number of hidden
states which becomes very small for sparse coding. The algorithm is similar to
the standard `perceptron' learning algorithm, with an additional rule for
synaptic transitions which occur only if a currently presented pattern is
`barely correct'. In this case, the synaptic changes are meta-plastic only
(change in hidden states and not in actual synaptic state), stabilizing the
synapse in its current state. Finally, we show that a system with two visible
states and K hidden states is much more robust to noise than a system with K
visible states. We suggest this rule is sufficiently simple to be easily
implemented by neurobiological systems or in hardware.

without any free parameters, the current vacuum fluctuation energy density

According to the statistical approach by Schaefer (2007), the use of several
empirical relations obtained from GRBs observables, after a consistent
calibration for a specific model, enables one to probe current cosmological
models. Based on this recently introduced method, we use the 69 GRBs sample
collected by Schaefer (2007); and the most recently released SWIFT satellite

difficult task involving an analytic continuation in the conical angle. In this
paper, we obtain this analytic continuation explicitly exploiting a relation
between the functional integral formulas and the Chung-Peschel expressions for
the density matrix in terms of correlators. The result is that the entropy is
given in terms of a functional integral in flat Euclidean space with a cut on V

wave bands for 65 galaxies in the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey

morphological parameters demonstrate strong variations along the Hubble
sequence, including statistically significant differences between S0/a-Sab and
Sc-Sd galaxies. Early-type galaxies are generally found to be compact,
centralized, symmetric sources in the 24 micron band, while late-type galaxies
are generally found to be extended, asymmetric sources. These results suggest
that the processes that increase the real or apparent sizes of galaxies' bulges
also lead to more centralized 24 micron dust emission. Several phenomena, such
as strong nuclear star formation, Seyfert activity, or outer ring structures,
may cause galaxies to deviate from the general morphological trends observed at
24 microns. We also note that the 24 micron morphologies of Sdm-Im galaxies are
quite varied, with some objects appearing very compact and symmetric while
others appear diffuse and asymmetric. These variations reflect the wide
variation in star formation in irregular galaxies as observed at other
wavelengths. The variations in the 24 micron morphological parameters across
the Hubble sequence mirror many of the morphological trends seen in other
tracers of the ISM and in stellar emission. However, the 24 micron
morphological parameters for the galaxies in this sample do not match the
morphological parameters measured in the stellar wave bands. This implies that
the distribution of dust emission is related to but not equivalent to the
distribution of stellar emission.

that bistability occurs during growth on TMG/succinate and lactose + glucose,
but not during growth on lactose. More recent studies with lacGFP-transfected
cells show bistability with TMG/succinate, but not with lactose and lactose +
glucose. In the literature, these results are attributed to variations of the
positive feedback generated by induction. Specifically, during growth on
TMG/succinate, induction generates positive feedback because the permease
stimulates the accumulation of TMG, which, in turn, promotes the synthesis of
more permease. This positive feedback is attenuated during growth on lactose
because hydrolysis of lactose by galactosidase suppresses the stimulatory
effect of the permease. But the stabilizing effect of dilution also changes
dramatically as a function of the medium composition. For instance, during
growth on TMG/succinate, the dilution rate of the permease is proportional to
its activity, $e$, because the specific growth rate is independent of $e$.
However, during growth on lactose, the permease dilution rate is proportional
to $e^2$ because the specific growth rate is proportional to the specific
lactose uptake rate, which in turn, proportional to $e$. Here, we show that:
(a) This dependence on $e^2$ creates such a strong stabilizing effect that
bistability is virtually impossible during growth on lactose, even in the face
of positive feedback. (b) This stabilizing effect is weakened during growth on
lactose + glucose because the specific growth rate on glucose is independent of
$e$, so that the dilution rate once again contains a term that is proportional
to $e$. We discuss the experimental data in the light of these results.

the coronal plasma roughly marginally collisionless. The self-regulating
mechanism is based on the interplay of two effects. First, plasma density
controls coronal energy release via the transition between the slow collisional
Sweet-Parker regime and the fast collisionless reconnection regime. This
transition takes place when the Sweet--Parker layer becomes thinner than the
characteristic collisionless reconnection scale. I present a simple criterion
for this transition in terms of the upstream plasma density (n_e), the
reconnecting (B_0) and guide (B_z) magnetic field components, and the global
length (L) of the reconnection layer: L < 6.10^9 cm [n_e/(10^{10}/cm^3)]^(-3)
(B_0/30G)^4 (B_0/B_z)^2. Next, coronal energy release by reconnection raises
the ambient plasma density via chromospheric evaporation and this, in turn,
temporarily inhibits subsequent reconnection involving the newly-reconnected
loops. Over time, however, radiative cooling gradually lowers the density again
below the critical value and fast reconnection again becomes possible. As a
result, the density is highly inhomogeneous and intermittent but,
statistically, does not deviate strongly from the critical value which is
comparable with the observed coronal density. Thus, in the long run, the
coronal heating process can be represented by repeating cycles that consist of
fast reconnection events (i.e., nanoflares), followed by rapid evaporation
episodes, followed by relatively long periods (1-hour) during which magnetic
stresses build up and simultaneously the plasma cools down and precipitates.

invariant building blocks such as circles and spheres. Concrete problems
considered in these lectures include the Willmore energy as well as conformal
and curvature line parametrizations of surfaces. In particular we discuss
geometric properties of a recently found discrete Willmore energy. The
convergence to the smooth Willmore functional is shown for special refinements
of triangulations originating from a curvature line parametrization of a
surface. Further we treat special classes of discrete surfaces such as
isothermic and minimal. The construction of these surfaces is based on the
theory of circle patterns, in particular on their variational description.

Both kinds of impurities reduce modestly and equally the Kosterliz-Thouless

are found to be qualitatively different at lower temperatures; fermions are
repulsive and further suppress superfluidity at low temperatures.

from color triplets (anti-triplets) with charges $Q=-1/3(1/3)$ and
$Q=-4/3(4/3)$ is suppressed by an internal cancellation due to contributions
from different sources. We exhibit the mechanism for an SU(5) model with
$45_H+\bar{45}_H$ Higgs multiplets in addition to the usual Higgs structure of
the minimal model. This model contains both $Q=-1/3(1/3)$ and $Q=-4/3(4/3)$
Higgs color triplets (anti-triplets) and simple constraints allow for a
complete suppression of Higgsino mediated proton decay. Suppression of proton
decay in an SU(5) model with Planck scale contributions is also considered. The
suppression mechanism is then exhibited for an SO(10) model with a unified
Higgs structure involving $144_H+\bar{144}_H$ representations.The SU(5)
decomposition of $144_H+\bar{144}_H$ contains $5_H+\bar 5_H$ and
$45_H+\bar{45}_H$ and the cancellation mechanism arises among these
contributions which mirrror the SU(5) case. The cancellation mechanism appears
to be more generally valid for a larger class of unification models.
Specifically the cancellation mechanism may play a role in string model
constructions to suppress proton decay from dimension five operators. The
mechanism allows for the suppression of proton decay consistent with current
data allowing for the possibility that proton decay may be visible in the next
round of nucleon stability experiment.

  Journal",,"10.1086/591218",,"astro-ph",,"  During the inspiral and merger of a binary black hole, gravitational
radiation is emitted anisotropically due to asymmetries in the merger
configuration. This anisotropic radiation leads to a gravitational wave kick,
or recoil velocity, as large as ~ 4000 km/sec. We investigate the effect
gravitational recoil has on the retention of intermediate mass black holes
(IMBH) within Galactic globular clusters. Assuming that our current
understanding of IMBH-formation is correct and yields an IMBH-seed in every
globular cluster, we find a significant problem retaining low mass IMBHs (1000
$\Msun$) in the typical merger-rich globular cluster environment. Given a
uniform black hole spin distribution and orientation and a Kroupa IMF, we find
that at most 3% of the globular clusters can retain an IMBH larger than 1000
$\Msun$ today. For a population of black holes that better approximates mass
loss from winds and supernovae, we find that 16% of globulars can retain an
IMBH larger than 1000 $\Msun$. Our calculations show that if there are black
holes of mass $M > 60 \Msun$ in a cluster, repeated IMBH-BH encounters will
eventually eject a 1000 $\Msun$ IMBH with greater than 30% probability. As a
consequence, a large population of rogue black holes may exist in our Milky Way
halo. We discuss the dynamical implications of this subpopulation, and its
possible connection to ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs).

isolation between these colors and those of many other types of astronomical

illustrate is due to YSOs. However, this ambiguity is readily resolved by the
unique optical characteristics of PNe and their environs. We also examine the
relationships between optical and MIR morphologies from 3.6 to 8.0um and
explore the ratio of mid-infrared (MIR) to radio nebular fluxes, which is a
valuable discriminant between thermal and nonthermal emission. MASH emphasizes
late evolutionary stages of PNe compared with previous catalogs, enabling study
of the changes in MIR and radio flux that attend the aging process. Spatially
integrated MIR energy distributions were constructed for all MASH PNe observed
by the GLIMPSE Legacy Project, using the H-alpha morphologies to establish the
dimensions for the calculations of the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX), IRAC,
and radio continuum (from the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope and the
Very Large Array) flux densities. The ratio of IRAC 8.0-um to MSX 8.3-um flux
densities provides a measure of the absolute diffuse calibration of IRAC at 8.0
um. We independently confirm the aperture correction factor to be applied to
IRAC at 8.0um to align it with the diffuse calibration of MSX. The result
agrees with the recommendations of the Spitzer Science Center and with results
from a parallel study of HII regions. These PNe probe the diffuse calibration
of IRAC on a spatial scale of 9-77 arcsec.

residual silicon. Specific microscopic structures are found on the surface of
the bare C/SiC mirrors after polishing. These structures are considered to be
caused by the different hardness of those materials. The roughness obtained for
the bare mirrors is 20 nm rms for flat surfaces and 100 nm rms for curved
surfaces. It was confirmed that a SiSiC slurry coating is effective in reducing
the roughness to 2 nm rms. The scattering properties of the mirrors were
measured at room temperature and also at 95 K. No significant change was found
in the scattering properties through cooling, which suggests that the
microscopic surface structure is stable with changes in temperature down to
cryogenic values. The C/SiC mirror with the SiSiC slurry coating is a promising
candidate for the SPICA telescope.

sources in a sunspot can also contribute significantly to these travel-time
shifts, and in some cases, an asymmetry between in and outgoing wave travel
times. The tight connection between the physical interpretation of travel times
and source-distribution homogeneity is confirmed. Statistically significant
travel-time shifts are recovered upon numerically simulating wave propagation
in the presence of a localized decrease in source strength. We also demonstrate
that these time shifts are relatively sensitive to the modal damping rates;
thus we are only able to place bounds on the magnitude of this effect. We see a
systematic reduction of 10-15 seconds in $p$-mode mean travel times at short
distances ($\sim 6.2$ Mm) that could be misinterpreted as arising from a
shallow (thickness of 1.5 Mm) increase ($\sim$ 4%) in the sound speed. At
larger travel distances ($\sim 24$ Mm) a 6-13 s difference between the ingoing

see that, phantom fluid violates the weak energy condition (WEC) till energy

the effective equation of state does not violate WEC. Moreover, with increasing
phantom energy density, a stage comes when even strong energy condition is not

matter of debate.
  Aims: We report the detection of low-mass, Li-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch
(AGB) stars located in the Galactic bulge.
  Methods: A homogeneous and well-selected sample of low mass, oxygen-rich AGB
stars in the Galactic bulge has been searched for the absorption lines of Li.
Using spectral synthesis techniques, we determine from high resolution UVES/VLT
spectra the Li abundance in four out of 27 sample stars, and an upper limit for
the remaining stars.
  Results: Two stars in our sample have a solar Li abundance or above; these
stars seem to be a novelty, since they do not show any s-element enhancement.
Two more stars have a Li abundance slightly below solar; these stars do show
s-element enhancement in their spectra. Different scenarios which lead to an
increased Li surface abundance in AGB stars are discussed.
  Conclusions: Of the different enrichment scenarios presented, Cool Bottom
Processing (CBP) is the most likely one for the Li-rich objects identified
here. Self-enrichment by Hot Bottom Burning (HBB) seems very unlikely as all
Li-rich stars are below the HBB mass limit. Also, the ingestion of a low mass
companion into the stars' envelope is unlikely because the associated
additional effects are lacking. Mass transfer from a former massive binary
companion is a possible scenario, if the companion produced little s-process
elements. A simple theoretical estimation for the Li abundance due to CBP is
presented and compared to the observed values.

propagate at constant speed along their symmetry axis and are characterized by

is demonstrated that an easy axis anisotropy results in an instability to
perturbations which break the axial symmetry. The unstable mode corresponds to
a migration of spin flips around the vortex ring that leads to a pinching
instability and ultimately the collapse of the vortex ring. It is found that
this instability does not exist for an isotropic ferromagnet. Similarities
between vortex rings in ferromagnets and vortons in cosmology are noted.

motion into three different sets of 8 bosonic and 8 fermionic operators. These
three different graded sets of integrals generate two different nonlinear,

multiplicative central charge. On the ground state, the nonlinear superalgebra
is reduced to the two distinct 2D Euclidean analogs of a superextended

Looking at the resulting Friedmann equation, we see that the brane cosmology at
high energies is dominated by a five-dimensional rho^2 energy density term. At
low energies, we obtain a Friedmann equation with a term linear to the energy
density with, however, negative coefficient in the small four-brane radius

ground-based telescopes, resulting in data sets with unprecedented spatial
resolution at these long wavelengths. In this paper we examine
'ground-based-only' diagnostics, which can be used in the study of star-forming
regions in starburst galaxies. By combining output from the stellar population
synthesis code Starburst 99 with the photoionization code Mappings, we model
stellar clusters and their surrounding interstellar medium, focusing on the
evolution of emission lines in the N- and Q-band atmospheric windows (8-13 and
16.5-24.5 micron respectively) and those in the near-infrared. We address the
detailed sensitivity of various emission line diagnostics to stellar population
age, metallicity, nebular density, and ionization parameter. Using our model
results, we analyze observations of two stellar clusters in the overlap region
of the Antennae galaxies obtained with VLT Imager and Spectrometer for mid
Infrared (VISIR). We find evidence for clumpy, high density, ionized gas. The
two clusters are young (younger than 2.5 and 3 Myr respectively), the
surrounding interstellar matter is dense (10^4 cm^-3 or larger) and can be
characterized by a high ionization parameter (logU > -1.53). Detailed analysis
of the mid-infrared spectral features shows that a (near-)homogeneous medium
cannot account for the observations, and that complex structure on scales below
the resolution limit, containing several young stellar clusters embedded in
clumpy gas, is more likely.

energy deposition of both Pop III and Pop II stars. We find that: (i) due to

arise; as a result Pop III star formation continues down to z=2.5, but at a low
peak rate of 10^-5 M_sun yr^-1 Mpc^-3 occurring at z~6 (about 10^-4 of the

timescales result in a very inefficient astration. These conclusions strongly
encourage deep searches for pristine star formation sites at moderate (2<z<5)

particles whose size and velocity are small enough that the fluid motion is in

particle, and extended the Stokesian Dynamics method to conduct dynamic
simulations of a collection of such particles. In our description, each
particle is treated as a sphere with an orientation vector $\te{p}$, whose
locomotion is driven by the action of a force dipole at a point slightly
displaced from its centre. In isolation, a self-propelled particle moves at a
constant speed in the direction of $\te{p}$. When it coexists with many such
particles, its hydrodynamic interaction with the other particles alters its
velocity and, more importantly, its orientation. As a result, the motion of the
particle is chaotic. Our simulations are not restricted to low particle
concentration, as we implement the full hydrodynamic interactions between the
particles, but we restrict the motion of particles to two dimensions to reduce
computation. We report the statistical properties of a suspension of
self-propelled particles, such as the distribution of particle velocity, the
pair correlation function and the orientation correlation function, for a range

non-stationary and stationary systems. Applying DFA to AR processes can help
understanding the non uniform correlation structure of such processes. We
systematically investigated a first order autoregressive model AR(1) by DFA and
established the relationship between the interaction constant of AR(1) and the
DFA correlation exponent. The higher the interaction constant the higher is the
short range correlation exponent. They are exponentially related. The
investigation was extended to AR(2) processes. The presence of a distant
positive interaction in addition to a near by interaction will increase the
correlation exponent and the range of correlation while the effect of a distant
negative interaction will decrease significantly only the range of interaction.

monochromatic luminosity at 2200 ang and virial mass estimates based on
measurements of the MgII line width and 3000 ang continuum luminosity. We find
little evidence for mass dependent variations in the mean slopes, but a
significant luminosity dependent trend in the near UV spectral slopes is
observed with larger (bluer) slopes at higher luminosities. The far UV slopes
show no clear variation with luminosity and are generally lower (redder) than
the near UV slopes at comparable luminosities, suggesting a slightly concave
quasar continuum shape. We compare these results with Monte Carlo distributions
of slopes computed from models of thin accretion disks, accounting for
uncertainties in the mass estimates. The model slopes produce mass dependent
trends which are larger than observed, though this conclusion is sensitive to
the assumed uncertainties in the mass estimates. The model slopes are also
generally bluer than observed, and we argue that reddening by dust intrinsic to
the source or host galaxy may account for much of the discrepancy.

In this paper we shall study the special

polylogarithm values (MPVs) of level $N$. These objects are generalizations of
multiple zeta values and alternating Euler sums, which was studied by Euler,
and more recently, many mathematicians and theoretical physicists.. Our primary
goal in this paper is to investigate the relations among the MPVs of the same
weight and level by using the regularized double shuffle relations, regularized
distribution relations, lifted versions of such relations from lower weights,
and seeded relations which are produced by relations of weight one MPVs. We
call relations from the above four families \emph{standard}. Let $d(w,N)$ be
the $\Q$-dimension of $\Q$-span of all MPVs of weight $w$ and level $N$. Then
we obtain upper bound for $d(w,N)$ by the standard relations which in general
are no worse or no better than the one given by Deligne and Goncharov depending
on whether $N$ is a prime-power or not, respectively, except for 2- and
3-powers, in which case standard relations seem to be often incomplete whereas
Deligne shows that their bound should be sharp by a variant of Grothedieck's
period conjecture. This suggests that in general there should be other linear
relations among MPVs besides the standard relations, some of which are written
down in this paper explicitly with good numerical verification. We also provide
a few conjectures which are supported by our computational evidence.

simulations of compressible convection carried out in spherical shells of

Mm of the photosphere. Such modelling at the highest spatial resolution to date
allows study of distinctly turbulent convection, revealing that coherent
downflow structures associated with giant cells continue to play a significant
role in maintaining the strong differential rotation that is achieved. These
giant cells at lower latitudes exhibit prograde propagation relative to the
mean zonal flow, or differential rotation, that they establish, and retrograde
propagation of more isotropic structures with vortical character at mid and
high latitudes. The interstices of the downflow networks often possess strong
and compact cyclonic flows. The evolving giant-cell downflow systems can be
partly masked by the intense smaller scales of convection driven closer to the
surface, yet they are likely to be detectable with the helioseismic probing
that is now becoming available. Indeed, the meandering streams and varying
cellular subsurface flows revealed by helioseismology must be sampling
contributions from the giant cells, yet it is difficult to separate out these
signals from those attributed to the faster horizontal flows of
supergranulation. To aid in such detection, we use our simulations to describe
how the properties of giant cells may be expected to vary with depth, how their
patterns evolve in time, and analyze the statistical features of correlations
within these complex flow fields.

  June 2007",,"10.1109/ISIT.2007.4557401",,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  The fading broadcast channel with confidential messages (BCC) is
investigated, where a source node has common information for two receivers
(receivers 1 and 2), and has confidential information intended only for
receiver 1. The confidential information needs to be kept as secret as possible
from receiver 2. The channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be known at
both the transmitter and the receivers. The secrecy capacity region is first
established for the parallel Gaussian BCC, and the optimal source power
allocations that achieve the boundary of the secrecy capacity region are
derived. In particular, the secrecy capacity region is established for the
Gaussian case of the Csiszar-Korner BCC model. The secrecy capacity results are
then applied to give the ergodic secrecy capacity region for the fading BCC.

careful consideration of extra currents provides a stronger theoretical basis
for the theory of the quantum Hall effect which has not been considered before.
The non-trivial extra contribution to the particle current density and local
conductivity, which originates from the cubic dependence on the momentum
operator in the Hamiltonian, will have no effect on the integer quantization of
the Hall conductance. The extension of Noether's theorem for the 2D k-cubic
Rashba system is also addressed. The two methods reach to exactly the same
results.

attempt to generalize to gravitation the energy-momentum tensor of
electromagnetism. This generalization was successful from the mathematical
point of view because these tensors share mathematical properties which are
remarkably similar to those of the energy-momentum tensor of electromagnetism.
However, the physical role of these tensors in General Relativity has remained
obscure and no interpretation has achieved wide acceptance. In principle, they
cannot represent {\em energy} and the term {\em superenergy} has been coined
for the hypothetical physical magnitude lying behind them. In this work we try
to shed light on the true physical meaning of {\em superenergy} by following
the same procedure which enables us to give an interpretation of the
electromagnetic energy. This procedure consists in performing an orthogonal
splitting of the Bel and Bel-Robinson tensors and analysing the different parts
resulting from the splitting. In the electromagnetic case such splitting gives
rise to the electromagnetic {\em energy density}, the Poynting vector and the
electromagnetic stress tensor, each of them having a precise physical
interpretation which is deduced from the {\em dynamical laws} of
electromagnetism (Poynting theorem). The full orthogonal splitting of the Bel
and Bel-Robinson tensors is more complex but, as expected, similarities with
electromagnetism are present. Also the covariant divergence of the Bel tensor
is analogous to the covariant divergence of the electromagnetic energy-momentum
tensor and the orthogonal splitting of the former is found. The ensuing {\em
equations} are to the superenergy what the Poynting theorem is to
electromagnetism. See paper for full abstract.

OHband positions in the infrared (IR) spectra of micaceous minerals. These
studies are based on the coexistence, in dioctahedral micas or smectites, of
several cationic pairs around the hydroxyl group which each produce a
characteristic band in the IR spectrum. The aim of this work is to obtain the
wavenumber values of the IR OH vibration bands of the (Al-Fe3+)-OH and
(Fe3+-Fe3+)-OH local cationic environments of 'pyrophyllite type' in order to
prove, disprove or modify a model of dioctahedral phyllosilicate OH-stretching
band decomposition. Natural samples are characterized by powder X-ray
diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopies
and electron microprobe; the hydrothermal synthesis products are also analysed
by powder XRD and FTIR after inductively coupled plasma measurements to obtain
the chemical compositions of nascent gel phases. Natural samples contain some
impurities which were eliminated after acid treatment; nevertheless, a small Fe
content is found in the pyrophyllite structure. The amount of Fe which is
incorporated within the pyrophyllite structure is much more important for the
synthetic samples than for the natural ones. The IR OH bands were clearly
observed in both natural and synthetic pyrophyllites and assigned to hydroxides
bonded to (Al-Al), (Al-Fe) and (Fe-Fe) cationic pairs. During this study, three
samples were analysed by DTG to check the cis- or trans-vacant character of the
layers and to determine the influence of this structural character on the
OH-stretching band position in IR spectroscopy.

nuclei (AGN) is generally accepted. Here, the situation is discussed when the
torus ""twisting"" by the radiation or wind transforms it into a dipole toroidal
vortex which in turn can be a source of matter replenishing the accretion disk.
Thus emerging instability which can be responsible for quasar radiation flares
accompanied by matter outbursts is also discussed. The ""Matreshka"" scheme for
an obscuring vortex torus structure capable of explaining the AGN variability
and evolution is proposed. The model parameters estimated numerically for the
luminosity close to the Eddington limit agree well with the observations.
