by the metallicity of their host galaxy. We match the SAI Supernova Catalog to
the SDSS-DR4 catalog of star-forming galaxies with measured metallicities.
These supernova host galaxies span a range of oxygen abundance from 12 +
log(O/H) = 7.9 to 9.3 (~ 0.1 to 2.7 solar) and a range in absolute magnitude
from MB = -15.2 to -22.2. To reduce the various observational biases, we select
a subsample of well-characterized supernovae in the redshift range from 0.01 to
0.04, which leaves us with 58 SN II, 19 Ib/c, and 38 Ia. We find strong
evidence that SN Ib/c are occurring in higher-metallicity host galaxies than SN
II, while we see no effect for SN Ia relative to SN II. We note some extreme
and interesting supernova-host pairs, including the metal-poor (~ 1/4 solar)
host of the recent SN Ia 2007bk, where the supernova was found well outside of
this dwarf galaxy. To extend the luminosity range of supernova hosts to even
fainter galaxies, we also match all the historical supernovae with z < 0.3 to
the SDSS-DR6 sky images, resulting in 1225 matches. This allows us to identify
some even more extreme cases, such as the recent SN Ic 2007bg, where the likely
host of this hypernova-like event has an absolute magnitude MB ~ -12, making it
one of the least-luminous supernova hosts ever observed. This low-luminosity
host is certain to be very metal poor (~ 1/20 solar), and therefore this
supernova is an excellent candidate for association with an off-axis GRB. The
two catalogs that we have constructed are available online and will be updated
regularly. Finally, we discuss various implications of our findings for
understanding supernova progenitors and their host galaxies.

(CMB) and large-scale structure (LSS) probe various inhomogeneous properties of
the dark sectors (including neutrinos, dark matter, and dark energy). We
stress, and quantify by simple formulas, that the primary CMB anisotropies are
very susceptible to the gravitational potentials during horizon entry, less at
recombination. The CMB thus allows us to scan \Phi+\Psi and the underlying dark
kinetics for all redshifts z~1-10^5. LSS, on the other hand, responds strongest
to \Phi at low redshifts. Dark perturbations are often parameterized by the
anisotropic stress and effective sound speed (stiffness). We find that the dark
anisotropic stress and stiffness influence the visible species at the
correspondingly early and late stages of horizon entry, and affect stronger
respectively the CMB and LSS. The CMB yet remains essential to probing the
stiff perturbations of light neutrinos and dark energy, detectable only during
horizon entry. The clustering of dark species and large propagation speed of
their inhomogeneities also map to distinctive features in the CMB and LSS. -Any
parameterization of the signatures of dark kinetics that assumes general
relativity can effectively accommodate any modified gravity (MG) that retains
the equivalence principle for the visible sectors. This implies that formally
the nonstandard structure growth or \Phi/\Psi ratio, while indicative, are not
definitive MG signatures. The definitive signatures of MG may include the
strong dependence of the apparent dark dynamics on visible species, its
superluminality, and the nonstandard phenomenology of gravitational waves.

example to all Teichmueller discs stabilized obtained by Thurston's
construction with a trace field of degree three which moreover ``obviously not
Veech''. We produce an infinite series of such examples and show moreover that
the favourable splitting situation does not arise everywhere on L, contrary to
the situation in genus two. We also study completely periodic directions on

differential codes, fixed-point-free group codes and product of groups and for
the same bit error rate, our codes allow smaller signal to noise ratio by as

through the optimization of a performance index that closely describes the bit

can also improve efficiency of existing codes.

have revealed that a young, nearby and energetic pulsar, PSR J1617-5055, is a
powerful emitter of soft gamma-rays in the 20-100 keV domain. In this paper we
present an analysis of all available data from the INTEGRAL, Swift, BeppoSAX
and XMM-Newton telescopes with a view to assessing the most likely counterpart
to the HESS source. We find that the energy source that fuels the X/gamma-ray
emissions is derived from the pulsar, both on the basis of the positional
morphology, the timing evidence and the energetics of the system. Likewise, the
1.2% of the pulsar's spin down energy loss needed to power the 0.1-10 TeV
emission is also fully consistent with other HESS sources known to be
associated with pulsars. The relative sizes of the X/gamma-ray and VHE sources
are consistent with the expected lifetimes against synchrotron and Compton
losses for a single source of parent electrons emitted from the pulsar. We find
that no other known object in the vicinity could be reasonably considered as a
plausible counterpart to the HESS source. We conclude that there is good
evidence to assume that the HESS J1616-508 source is driven by PSR J1617-5055

create the observed morphology of a broad-band emitter from keV to TeV

nucleation and subsequent collision of large concentrations of energy density
in the form of bubble-like structures moving at relativistic speeds. This
generates a significant fraction of energy in the form of a stochastic
background of gravitational waves, whose time evolution is determined by the
successive stages of reheating: First, tachyonic preheating makes the amplitude
of gravity waves grow exponentially fast. Second, bubble collisions add a new
burst of gravitational radiation. Third, turbulent motions finally sets the end
of gravitational waves production. From then on, these waves propagate
unimpeded to us. We find that the fraction of energy density today in these
primordial gravitational waves could be significant for GUT-scale models of
inflation, although well beyond the frequency range sensitivity of
gravitational wave observatories like LIGO, LISA or BBO. However, low-scale
models could still produce a detectable signal at frequencies accessible to BBO

wave background from some chaotic inflation models and obtained results similar
to those found by other groups. The discovery of such a background would open a
new observational window into the very early universe, where the details of the

suggested the existence of a lighter than 1 GeV nonet of scalar mesons which
behave like four quark composites. On the other hand, the validity of a
spontaneously broken chiral symmetric description would suggest that these
states be chiral partners of the light pseudoscalar mesons, which are two quark
composites. The model solves the problem by starting with the two chiral nonets
mentioned and allowing them to mix with each other. The input of physical
masses in the SU(3) invariant limit for two scalar octets and an ""excited"" pion
octet results in a mixing pattern wherein the light scalars have a large four

with diffuse band and atomic line absorption spectra of eight heavily-reddened
Galactic sightlines, CH2CN- is found to be a plausible carrier of the

Doppler-broadened with a b parameter between 16 and 33 km/s that depends on the

economic interpretation of firm selection through competition has been a weak
grasp on an incomplete scientific paradigm. As I.F. Price notes, ""The
biological metaphor has long lurked in the background of management theory

of technology substitution, drawing on recent work by Kauffman, Arthur,

  Networks","6 pages",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT",,"  The advent of network coding presents promising opportunities in many areas
of communication and networking. It has been recently shown that network coding
technique can significantly increase the overall throughput of wireless
networks by taking advantage of their broadcast nature. In wireless networks,
each transmitted packet is broadcasted within a certain area and can be
overheard by the neighboring nodes. When a node needs to transmit packets, it
employs the opportunistic coding approach that uses the knowledge of what the
node's neighbors have heard in order to reduce the number of transmissions.
With this approach, each transmitted packet is a linear combination of the
original packets over a certain finite field.
  In this paper, we focus on the fundamental problem of finding the optimal
encoding for the broadcasted packets that minimizes the overall number of
transmissions. We show that this problem is NP-complete over GF(2) and
establish several fundamental properties of the optimal solution. We also
propose a simple heuristic solution for the problem based on graph coloring and
present some empirical results for random settings.

either data or computation intensive: in data intensive situations jobs may be
pushed to the data and in computation intensive situations data may be pulled
to the jobs. This kind of scheduling, in which there is no consideration of
network characteristics, can lead to performance degradation in a Grid
environment and may result in large processing queues and job execution delays
due to site overloads. In this paper we describe a Data Intensive and Network
Aware (DIANA) meta-scheduling approach, which takes into account data,
processing power and network characteristics when making scheduling decisions
across multiple sites. Through a practical implementation on a Grid testbed, we
demonstrate that queue and execution times of data-intensive jobs can be
significantly improved when we introduce our proposed DIANA scheduler. The
basic scheduling decisions are dictated by a weighting factor for each
potential target location which is a calculated function of network
characteristics, processing cycles and data location and size. The job
scheduler provides a global ranking of the computing resources and then selects
an optimal one on the basis of this overall access and execution cost. The
DIANA approach considers the Grid as a combination of active network elements
and takes network characteristics as a first class criterion in the scheduling
decision matrix along with computation and data. The scheduler can then make
informed decisions by taking into account the changing state of the network,
locality and size of the data and the pool of available processing cycles.

suggest two different approaches to construct a convex functional of the
self-energy. In the first approach, one can show analytically that in the
approximation where the irreducible particle-hole vertex depends only on center
of mass coordinates, the functional is convex away from phase transitions in
the corresponding channel. Numerical tests on a tractable version of that
functional show that convexity can be a nuisance when looking for instabilities
both in the pairing and particle-hole channels. Therefore, an alternative
phenomenological functional is proposed. Convexity is explicitly enforced only
with respect to a restricted set of variables, such as the cluster chemical
potential that is known to be otherwise problematic. Numerical tests show that
our functional is convex at the physical solutions of VCA and allows
second-order phase transitions in the pairing channel as well. This opens the
way to the use of more efficient algorithms to find solutions of the VCA
equations.

precoding/multiplexing scheme for a set of non-cooperative links sharing the
same physical resources, e.g., time and bandwidth. We consider two alternative
optimization problems: P.1) the maximization of mutual information on each
link, given constraints on the transmit power and spectral mask; and P.2) the
maximization of the transmission rate on each link, using finite order
constellations, under the same constraints as in P.1, plus a constraint on the
maximum average error probability on each link. Aiming at finding decentralized
strategies, we adopted as optimality criterion the achievement of a Nash
equilibrium and thus we formulated both problems P.1 and P.2 as strategic
noncooperative (matrix-valued) games. In Part I of this two-part paper, after
deriving the optimal structure of the linear transceivers for both games, we
provided a unified set of sufficient conditions that guarantee the uniqueness
of the Nash equilibrium. In this Part II, we focus on the achievement of the
equilibrium and propose alternative distributed iterative algorithms that solve
both games. Specifically, the new proposed algorithms are the following: 1) the
sequential and simultaneous iterative waterfilling based algorithms,
incorporating spectral mask constraints; 2) the sequential and simultaneous
gradient projection based algorithms, establishing an interesting link with
variational inequality problems. Our main contribution is to provide sufficient
conditions for the global convergence of all the proposed algorithms which,
although derived under stronger constraints, incorporating for example spectral
mask constraints, have a broader validity than the convergence conditions known
in the current literature for the sequential iterative waterfilling algorithm.

The resulting spectrum might be probed by direct detection experiments if
inflation occurs at a low enough energy scale. In this paper, we develop a
theory and algorithm to calculate, analytically and numerically, the spectrum
of energy density in gravitational waves produced from an inhomogeneous
background of stochastic scalar fields in an expanding universe. We derive some
generic analytical results for the emission of gravity waves by stochastic
media of random fields, which can test the validity/accuracy of numerical
calculations. We contrast our method with other numerical methods in the
literature, and then we apply it to preheating after chaotic inflation. In this
case, we are able to check analytically our numerical results, which differ
significantly from previous works. We discuss how the gravity wave spectrum
builds up with time and find that the amplitude and the frequency of its peak
depend in a relatively simple way on the characteristic spatial scale amplified
during preheating. We then estimate the peak frequency and amplitude of the
spectrum produced in two models of preheating after hybrid inflation, which for
some parameters may be relevant for gravity wave interferometric experiments.

cornerstone of robust control design. It is our contention that a blind
acceptance of worst-case scenarios may lead to designs that are actually more
dangerous than designs based on probabilistic techniques with a built-in risk
factor. The real issue is one of modeling. If one accepts that no mathematical
model of uncertainties is perfect then a probabilistic approach can lead to
more reliable control even if it cannot guarantee stability for all possible
cases. Our presentation is based on case analysis. We first establish that
worst-case is not necessarily ""all-encompassing."" In fact, we show that for
some uncertain control problems to have a conventional robust control solution
it is necessary to make assumptions that leave out some feasible cases. Once we
establish that point, we argue that it is not uncommon for the risk of
unaccounted cases in worst-case design to be greater than that of the accepted
risk in a probabilistic approach. With an example, we quantify the risks and
show that worst-case can be significantly more risky. Finally, we join our
analysis with existing results on computational complexity and probabilistic
robustness to argue that the deterministic worst-case analysis is not

technology to DNA microarrays for DNA detection and RNA profiling.
Understanding the effect of DNA sequences on the melting temperature of the
system is central to developing reliable detection technology. We studied the
effects of DNA base-pairing defects, such as mismatches and deletions, on the
melting temperature of DNA-nanoparticle assemblies. We found that, contrary to
the general assumption that defects lower the melting temperature of DNA, some
defects increase the melting temperature of DNA-linked nanoparticle assemblies.
The effects of mismatches and deletions were found to depend on the specific
base pair, the sequence, and the location of the defects. Our results
demonstrate that the surface-bound DNA exhibit hybridization behavior different
from that of free DNA. Such findings indicate that a detailed understanding of
DNA-nanoparticle assembly phase behavior is required for quantitative
interpretation of DNA-nanoparticle aggregation.

consider a simple toy model of a helical grain that reproduces well the basic

attached at an angle to it. Being very simple, the model allows analytical
description of RATs that act upon it. We show a good correspondence of RATs
obtained for this model and those of irregular grains calculated by DDSCAT. Our
analysis of the role of different torque components for grain alignment reveals
that one of the three RAT components does not affect the alignment, but induces
only for grain precession. The other two components provide a generic alignment
with grain long axes perpendicular to the radiation direction, if the radiation
dominates the grain precession, and perpendicular to magnetic field, otherwise.
We study a self-similar scaling of RATs as a function of $\lambda/a_{eff}$. We
show that the self-similarity is useful for studying grain alignment by a broad
spectrum of radiation, i.e. interstellar radiation field.

ionic forbidden emission lines are consistent with an optical LINER
classification for the active nucleus, which is not luminous enough to power

there is no direct indication of this. More likely, the H2 is shock-heated in a

mixing are caused by VEVs of SU(2)_L-singlet scalars \phi which are nonets
({\bf 8}+{\bf 1}) of the SU(3) flavor symmetry, and which are broken into {\bf
2}+{\bf 3}+{\bf 3}' and {\bf 1} of S_4. If we require the invariance under the
transformation (\phi^{(8)},\phi^{(1)}) \to (-\phi^{(8)},+\phi^{(1)}) for the
superpotential of the nonet field \phi^{(8+1)}, the model leads to a beautiful
relation for the charged lepton masses. The observed tribimaximal neutrino
mixing is understood by assuming two SU(3) singlet right-handed neutrinos
\nu_R^{(\pm)} and an SU(3) triplet scalar \chi.

performance of a flashing ratchet. We investigate the effect of a time delay in
the implementation of feedback control in a closed-loop collective flashing
ratchet, using Langevin dynamics simulations. Surprisingly, for a large
ensemble, a well-chosen delay time improves the ratchet performance by allowing
the system to synchronize into a quasi-periodic stable mode of oscillation that
reproduces the optimal average velocity for a periodically flashing ratchet.
For a small ensemble, on the other hand, finite delay times significantly
reduce the benefit of feedback control for the time-averaged velocity, because
the relevance of information decays on a time scale set by the diffusion time
of the particles. Based on these results, we establish that experimental use of
feedback control is realistic.

bands and use them in an agile manner. Transmission by the primary user must be
detected reliably even in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and in the
face of shadowing and fading. Communication signals are typically
cyclostationary, and have many periodic statistical properties related to the
symbol rate, the coding and modulation schemes as well as the guard periods,
for example. These properties can be exploited in designing a detector, and for
distinguishing between the primary and secondary users' signals. In this paper,
a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) for detecting the presence of
cyclostationarity using multiple cyclic frequencies is proposed. Distributed
decision making is employed by combining the quantized local test statistics
from many secondary users. User cooperation allows for mitigating the effects
of shadowing and provides a larger footprint for the cognitive radio system.
Simulation examples demonstrate the resulting performance gains in the low SNR
regime and the benefits of cooperative detection.

CMZ is dominated by gas that is warmer than the majority of the dust present
there. A comparison with the CO survey by Sawada et al. (2001) shows that the
NH3 emitting region is surrounded by a high pressure region on the l-v plane.
Although NH3 emission traces dense gas, it is not extended into a high pressure
region. Therefore, the high pressure region is less dense and has to be hotter.
This indicates that the molecular cloud complex in the Galactic center region
has a ``core'' of dense and warm clouds which are traced by the NH3 emission,
and an ``envelope'' of less dense and hotter gas clouds. Besides heating by
ambipolar diffusion, the hot plasma gas emitting the X-ray emission may heat
the hot ``envelope''.

needed for studies of many of their fundamental properties. However, as these
stars are heavily obscured and variable, optical and infrared astrometry is
unable to provide enough accuracy.
  Methods: Astrometry using masers in the circumstellar envelopes can be used
to overcome this problem. We have observed the OH masers of a number of
Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars for approximately 1 year with the Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA). We have used the technique of phase referencing with
in-beam calibrators to test the improvements this technique can provide to Very
Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) OH maser astrometric observations.
  Results: We have significantly improved the parallax and proper motion
measurements of the Mira variable stars U Her, S CrB and RR Aql.
  Conclusions: It is shown that both in-beam phase-referencing and a decrease
in solar activity during the observations significantly improves the accuracy
of the astrometric observations. The improved distances to S CrB (418 +21 -18
pc) and RR Aql (633 +214 -128 pc) are fully consistent with published P-L
relations, but the distance to U Her (266 +32 -28 pc) is significantly smaller.
We conclude that for sources that are bright and have a nearby in-beam
calibrator, VLBI OH maser astrometry can be used to determine distances to OH
masing stars of up to ~2 kpc.

different from that without the final state interaction effect. Therefore, when

represented as a simplical complex, in which simplices and vertices
respectively represent two layers of objects. The model relies on the simplical
complex for structural representation and analysis. To quantify structural
properties of individual primary objects (or equivalently simplices), and the
simplicial complex as a whole, we define a set of centrality measures by
considering multidimensional chains of connectivity, i.e. the number of
contextual objects shared by a pair of primary objects. With the model, the
interaction and relationships with a geographic system are modeled from both
local and global perspectives. The structural properties and modeling
capabilities are illustrated with a simple example and a case study applied to

  overshooting?","12 pages, 9 figures, submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.12969.x",,"astro-ph",,"  Under nonlocal convection theory, convection extends without limit therefore
no apparent boundary can be defined clearly as in the local theory. From the
requirement of a similar structure for both local and non-local models having
the same depth of convection zone, and taking into account the driving
mechanism of turbulent convection, we argue that a proper definition of the
boundary of a convective zone should be the place where the convective energy
flux (i.e. the correlation of turbulent velocity and temperature) changes its
sign. Therefore, it is convectively unstable region when the flux is positive,
and it is convective overshooting zone when the flux becomes negative. The
physical picture of the overshooting zone drawn by the usual non-local
mixing-length theory is not correct. In fact, convection is already
sub-adiabatic ($\nabla<\nabla_{ad}$) far before reaching the unstable boundary;
while in the overshooting zone below the convective zone, convection is
sub-adiabatic and super-radiative ($\nabla_{rad}<\nabla<\nabla_{ad}$). The
transition between the adiabatic temperature gradient and the radiative one is
continuous and smooth instead of a sudden switch. In the unstable zone the
temperature gradient is approaching radiative rather than going to adiabatic.
We would like to claim again that, the overshooting distance is different for
different physical quantities......

the existence of a population of GRBs with an isotropic-equivalent luminosity
which is about 10^4 times smaller than in the standard cosmological case. We
investigate two scenarios to explain a weak GRB : a normal (intrinsically
bright) GRB seen off-axis or an intrinsically weak GRB seen on-axis. For each
of these two scenarios, we first derive the conditions to produce a GRB
980425-like event and we then discuss the consequences for the event rate. If
we exclude the possibility that GRB 980425 is an occurence of an extremely rare
event observed by chance during the first eight years of the 'afterglow era',
the first scenario implies that (i) the local rate of standard bright GRBs is
much higher than what is usually expected; (ii) the typical opening angle is
much narrower than what is derived from observations of a break in the
afterglow lightcurve. In addition, we show that the afterglow of GRB 980425 in
this scenario should have been very bright and easily detected. For these
reasons the second scenario appears more realistic. We show that the parameter
space of the internal shock model indeed allows GRB 980425-like events, in
cases where the outflow is only mildly-relativistic and mildly-energetic. The
rate of such weak events in the Universe has to be much higher than the rate of
standard bright GRBs to allow the discovery of GRB 980425 during a short period
of a few years. However it is still compatible with the observations as the
intrinsic weakness of these GRB 980425-like bursts does not allow detection at
cosmological redshift. We finally briefly discuss the consequences of such a
high local rate of GRB 980425-like events for the future prospects of detecting
non-electromagnetic radiation, especially gravitational waves.

Supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) are characterised by very low
temperatures (< 100 eV). Classical SSSs have bolometric luminosities in the
range of 10^36-10^38 erg/s and are modelled with steady nuclear burning of
hydrogen on the surfaces of white dwarfs. However, several SSSs have been
discovered with much higher luminosities. Their nature is still unclear. Aims.
We report the discovery of a 4h modulation for an ultraluminous SSS in the
nearby edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 4631, observed with XMM-Newton in 2002 June.
Temporal and spectral analysis of the source is performed. Methods. We use a
Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis for the period search and evaluate the
confidence level using Monte-Carlo simulations. We measure the source
temperature, flux and luminosity through spectral fitting. Results. A
modulation of 4.2+-0.4 h (3 sigma error) was found for the SSS with a
confidence level >99%. Besides dips observed in the light curve, the flux
decreased by a factor of 3 within ~10h. The spectrum can be described with an
absorbed blackbody model with kT~67eV. The absorbed luminosity in the 0.2-2 kev
energy band was 2.7x10^38 erg/sec while the bolometric luminosity was a hundred
time higher (3.2x10^40 erg/s), making the source one of the most luminous of
its class, assuming the best fit model is correct. Conclusions. This source is
another very luminous SSS for which the standard white dwarf interpretation
cannot be applied, unless a strong beaming factor is considered. A stellar-mass
black hole accreting at a super Eddington rate is a more likely interpretation,
where the excess of accreted matter is ejected through a strong optically-thick
outflow. The 4 h modulation could either be an eclipse from the companion star
or the consequence of a warped accretion disk.

that g-modes are unstable.

beating phenomenon. Four significant frequencies have been detected for each
star. Comparison of the observed amplitude ratios for each pulsational
frequency with those calculated from theoretical pulsation codes allows us to
estimate the pulsation modes associated with the different detected

nebula spectrum is dominated by pure Halpha line emission. However, the nebula
is not detected in our IR observations, whick makes it impossible to to
constrain its spectrum. A faint point-like object (J>22.6, H~21.6, Ks ~ 21.4)
compatible with the neutron star's Chandra X-ray position is detected in our IR

neutron star motion through the ISM or, alternatively, a photo-ionization

AGB stars with varying photospheric C/O-ratios and mass-loss rates are
presented. A combination of low- and high-energy lines are important in
constraining the circumstellar distribution of SiS molecules. A detailed
radiative transfer modelling of the observed SiS line emission is performed,
including the effect of thermal dust grains in the excitation analysis. We find
that the circumstellar fractional abundance of SiS in these environments has a
strong dependence on the photospheric C/O-ratio as expected from chemical
models. The carbon stars (C/O>1) have a mean fractional abundance of 3.1E-6,
about an order of magnitude higher than found for the M-type AGB stars (C/O<1)
where the mean value is 2.7E-7. These numbers are in reasonable agreement with
photospheric LTE chemical models. SiS appears to behave similar to SiO in terms
of photodissociation in the outer part of the circumstellar envelope. In
contrast to previous results for the related molecule SiO, there is no strong
correlation of the fractional abundance with density in the CSE, as would be
the case if freeze-out onto dust grains were important. However, possible
time-variability of the line emission in the lower J transitions and the
sensitivity of the line emission to abundance gradients in the inner part of
the CSE may mask a correlation with the density of the wind. There are
indications that the SiS fractional abundance could be significantly higher
closer to the star which, at least in the case of M-type AGB stars, would
require non-equilibrium chemical processes.

the theoretical point of view, our previous investigations were able to
reproduce some empirical tests for suitable assumptions on the helium to metal
relative enrichment, but those results relied on specific assumptions
concerning the Mass-Luminosity relation and the efficiency of the convective
transfer in the pulsating envelopes. In this paper, we investigate the effects
of the assumed value of the mixing length parameter l/Hp on the pulsation
properties and we release the assumption of a fixed Mass-Luminosity relation.
As a whole, we show that our pulsation relations appear fully consistent with
the observed properties of Galactic and Magellanic Cloud Cepheids, supporting
the predicted steepening and brightening of the PL relations when moving from
metal-rich to metal-poor variables. Moreover, we show that the distances
inferred by the predicted PW relations agree with recently measured
trigonometric parallaxes, whereas they suggest a correction to the values based
on the Infrared Surface Brightness technique, as already found from an
independent method. Finally, also the pulsation metal contents suggested by the
predicted PW relations appear in statistical agreement with spectroscopic

transformation is done very slowly (adiabatically). Previously derived
fluctuation theorems can be recovered as special cases. We show how these FTs

mid-IR photometry and near-IR spectroscopy and polarimetry of one object (V1118
Ori) are presented, complementing those given in a previous paper and related
to a different activity period. Our catalog indicates how the database
accumulated so far is inadequate for any statistical study of the EXor events.
Nevertheless, all the observational evidence can be interpreted into a coherent
scheme. The sources that present the largest brightness variations tend to
become bluer while brightening. The scenario of disk accretion based on viscous
friction between particles agrees with the observations. The new results on
V1118 Ori confirm such a general view. The striking novelty is represented by a
near-IR spectrum of V1118 Ori taken 1 yr after the last monitored outburst: any
emission line previously detected has now totally disappeared at our
sensitivity. For the same source, mid-IR photometry is provided here for the

  I will reflect on Eduardo's scientific career, the problems that motivated
him and his achievements, focusing particularly on a problem which had
intrigued us both for several years and on which Eduardo was making important
progress at the time of his death. Finally, I will mention the personal
qualities that Eduardo brought to his work and the acute sense of loss that is
shared by all those - friends and collaborators - who were privileged to know
him.

that the excess emission cannot be due to uncertainties in the background
subtraction or in the Galactic HI column density. Calibration uncertainties in
the ACIS detector that may affect our results are addressed by comparing the
Chandra data to XMM MOS and PN spectra. While differences between the three
instruments remain, all detect the excess in similar amounts, providing
evidence against an instrumental nature of the excess. Given the presence of
non-thermal radio emission near the center of A3112, we argue that the excess
X-ray emission is of non-thermal nature and distributed throughout the entire

incompleteness at most 21 AGNs are missed in the survey, so that the fraction
would increase up to 41%. Using corollary Near-IR observations, that enable us
to estimate galaxies dynamical masses, it is found that AGNs are hosted
exclusively in massive galaxies, i.e. M_dyn\gsim 10^{10} solar masses. Their
frequency increases steeply with the dynamical mass from zero at
M_dyn\approx10^{9.5} solar masses to virtually 1 at M_dyn>10^{11.5} solar
masses. These frequencies are consistent with the ones of low luminosity AGNs
found in the general field by the SDSS. Massive galaxies that harbor AGNs
commonly show conspicuous r-band star-like nuclear enhancements. Conversely
they often, but not necessarily contain massive bulges. Few well known AGNs

The expression of the kinetic energy operator in this set of coordinates is
given and its derivation, following the polyspherical method, is discussed. The
PES employed is that of Huang et al. [JCP, 122, 044308, (2005)]. A scheme for
the representation of the potential energy surface (PES) is discussed which is
based on a high dimensional model representation scheme (cut-HDMR), but
modified to take advantage of the mode-combination representation of the
vibrational wavefunction used in MCTDH. The convergence of the PES expansion
used is quantified and evidence is provided that it correctly reproduces the
reference PES at least for the range of energies of interest. The reported zero
point energy of the system is converged with respect to the MCTDH expansion and
in excellent agreement (16.7 cm-1 below) with the diffusion Monte Carlo result
on the PES of Huang et al. The highly fluxional nature of the cation is
accounted for through use of curvilinear coordinates. The system is found to
interconvert between equivalent minima through wagging and internal rotation
motions already when in the ground vibrational-state, i.e., T=0. It is shown

  Nanocircuit Elements Part 1: Analytical Solution","21 pages, 5 figures",,"10.1364/JOSAB.24.003007",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  Following our recent development of the paradigm for extending the classic
concepts of circuit elements to the infrared and optical frequencies [N.
Engheta, A. Salandrino, A. Alu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 095504 (2005)], in this
paper we investigate the possibility of connecting nanoparticles in series and
in parallel configurations, acting as nanocircuit elements, In particular, we
analyze a pair of conjoined half-cylinders, whose relatively simple geometry
may be studied and analyzed analytically. In this first part of the work, we
derive a closed-form quasi-static analytical solution of the boundary-value
problem associated with this geometry, which will be applied in Part II for a
nanocircuit and physical interpretation of these results.
