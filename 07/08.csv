a strategy to mitigate decoherence in quantum information processing. It is
important to investigate the actual performance of these dynamical decoupling
strategies in real systems that are promising qubit candidates. In this Rapid
Communication, we compute the echo decay of concatenations of the Hahn echo
sequence for a solid-state electronic spin qubit in a nuclear spin bath using a
cluster expansion technique. We find that each level of concatenation reverses
the effect of successive levels of intrabath fluctuations. On the one hand,
this advances CDD as a versatile and realistic decoupling strategy. On the
other hand, this invalidates, as overly optimistic, results of the simple pair
approximation used previously to study restoration, through CDD, of coherence
lost to a mesoscopic spin bath.

due to common interference or noise propagation from preceding hops. In this
work we consider a parallel relay network with noise correlation. For the relay
strategy of amplify-and-forward (AF), we determine the optimal rate maximizing
relay gains when correlation knowledge is available at the relays. The effect
of correlation on the performance of the relay networks is analyzed for the
cases where full knowledge of correlation is available at the relays and when
there is no knowledge about the correlation structure. Interestingly we find
that, on the average, noise correlation is beneficial regardless of whether the
relays know the noise covariance matrix or not. However, the knowledge of
correlation can greatly improve the performance. Typically, the performance
improvement from correlation knowledge increases with the relay power and the
number of relays. With perfect correlation knowledge the system is capable of
canceling interference if the number of interferers is less than the number of
relays.
  For a dual-hop multiple access parallel network, we obtain closed form
expressions for the maximum sum-rate and the optimal relay strategy. The relay
optimization for networks with three hops is also considered. For any relay
gains for the first stage relays, this represents a parallel relay network with
correlated noise. Based on the result of two hop networks with noise
correlation, we propose an algorithm for solving the relay optimization problem
for three-hop networks.

eigenvalue spectra and eigenvectors statistics of delayed correlation matrices
of network traffic counts time series. Delayed correlation matrix D is composed
of the correlations between one variable in the multivariable time series and
another at a time delay \tau . Inverse participation ratio (IPR) of
eigenvectors of D deviates substantially from the IPR of eigenvectors of the
equal time correlation matrix C. We relate this finding to the localization and
discuss its importance for network congestion control. The time-lagged
correlation pattern between network time series is preserved over a long time,
up to 100\tau, where \tau=300 sec. The largest eigenvalue \lambda_{max} of D
and the corresponding IPR oscillate with two characteristic periods of 3\tau
and 6\tau . The existence of delayed correlations between network time series
fits well into the long range dependence (LRD) property of the network traffic.
  The ability to monitor and control the long memory processes is crucial since
they impact the network performance. Injecting the random traffic counts
between non-randomly correlated time series, we were able to break the picture
of periodicity of \lambda_{max}. In addition, we investigated influence of the
periodic injections on both largest eigenvalue and the IPR, and addressed
relevance of these indicators for the LRD and self-similarity of the network

to achieve in such a communication scenario and compute the optimal number of

of occurrence for major solar flares, gamma-ray events, and solar energetic
particle (SEP) fluences. Such phenomena do not appear to follow the direct
indices of solar magnetic activity, such as the sunspot number. I show that
this results from the non-Poisson occurrence for the most energetic events.
This Letter also points out a particularly striking example of this
irregularity in a comparison between the declining phases of the recent two
solar cycles (1993-1995 and 2004-2006, respectively) and traces it through the
radiated energies of the flares, the associated SEP fluences, and the sunspot
areas. These factors suggest that processes in the solar interior involved with
the supply of magnetic flux up to the surface of the Sun have strong
correlations in space and time, leading to a complex occurrence pattern that is
presently unpredictable on timescales longer than active region lifetimes
(weeks) and not correlated well with the solar cycle itself.

integration of stiff wave systems is presented. Physics-based assumptions are
used to derive a convergent iterative formulation of the SI scheme which
enables the monitoring and control of the error introduced by the SI operator.
This iteration essentially turns a semi-implicit method into a fully implicit
method. Accuracy, rather than stability, determines the timestep. The scheme is
second-order accurate and shown to be equivalent to a simple preconditioning
method. We show how the diffusion operators can be handled so as to yield the
property of robust damping, i.e., dissipating the solution at all values of the
parameter $\mathcal D\dt$, where $\mathcal D$ is a diffusion operator and $\dt$
the timestep. The overall scheme remains second-order accurate even if the
advection and diffusion operators do not commute. In the limit of no physical
dissipation, and for a linear test wave problem, the method is shown to be
symplectic. The method is tested on the problem of Kinetic Alfv\'en wave
mediated magnetic reconnection. A Fourier (pseudo-spectral) representation is
used. A 2-field gyrofluid model is used and an efficacious k-space SI operator
for this problem is demonstrated. CPU speed-up factors over a CFL-limited
explicit algorithm ranging from $\sim20$ to several hundreds are obtained,
while accurately capturing the results of an explicit integration. Possible
extension of these results to a real-space (grid) discretization is discussed.

equation has some extra terms, called dark radiation and dark pressure,
respectively, which arise from the embedding of the 3-brane in the bulk. To
derive the generalized virial theorem we use a method based on the
collisionless Boltzmann equation. The dark radiation term generates an
equivalent mass term (the dark mass), which gives an effective contribution to
the gravitational energy. This term may account for the well-known virial
theorem mass discrepancy in actual clusters of galaxies. An approximate
solution of the vacuum field equations on the brane, corresponding to weak
gravitational fields, is also obtained, and the expressions for the dark
radiation and dark mass are derived. The qualitative behavior of the dark mass
is similar to that of the observed virial mass in clusters of galaxies. We
compare our model with the observational data for galaxy clusters, and we
express all the physical parameters of the model in terms of observable
quantities. In particular, we predict that the dark mass must extend far beyond
the presently considered virial radius. The behavior of the galaxy cluster
velocity dispersion in brane world models is also considered. Therefore the
study of the matter distribution and velocity dispersion at the extragalactic
scales could provide an efficient method for testing the multi-dimensional
physical models.

formalism of quantum mechanics (QM) was in fact discovery of a very general
formalism describing {\it consistent processing of incomplete information}
about contexts (physical, mental, economic, social). The brain is an advanced
device which developed the ability to create a QL representation of contexts.
Therefore its functioning can also be described by the mathematical formalism
of QM. The possibility of such a description has nothing to do with composing
of the brain of quantum systems (photons, electrons, protons,...). Moreover, we
shall propose a model in that the QL representation is based on conventional
neurophysiological model of the functioning of the brain. The brain uses the QL
rule (given by von Neumann trace formula) for calculation of {\it approximative
averages} for mental functions, but the physical basis of mental functions is
given by neural networks in the brain. The QL representation has a {\it

subcognitive time scale (which is very fine) and cognitive time scale (which is
essentially coarser).

extension with $Gal(\F/F)\simeq \Z_l^d$ (for some prime $l\neq p$) and $E/F$ a
non-isotrivial elliptic curve. We study the behaviour of Selmer groups
$Sel_E(L)_r$ ($r$ any prime) as $L$ varies through the subextensions of $\F$
via appropriate versions of Mazur's Control Theorem. As a consequence we prove
that $Sel_E(\F)_r$ is a cofinitely generated (in some cases cotorsion)
$\Z_r[[Gal(\F/F)]]$-module.

"0707.1144","Mark Sapir","John Crisp, Michah Sageev, Mark Sapir","Surface subgroups of right-angled Artin groups","44 pages",,,,"math.GR math.GT",,"  We consider the question of which right-angled Artin groups contain closed
hyperbolic surface subgroups. It is known that a right-angled Artin group
$A(K)$ has such a subgroup if its defining graph $K$ contains an $n$-hole (i.e.
an induced cycle of length $n$) with $n\geq 5$. We construct another eight
""forbidden"" graphs and show that every graph $K$ on $\le 8$ vertices either
contains one of our examples, or contains a hole of length $\ge 5$, or has the
property that $A(K)$ does not contain hyperbolic closed surface subgroups. We
also provide several sufficient conditions for a \RAAG to contain no hyperbolic
surface subgroups.
  We prove that for one of these ""forbidden"" subgraphs $P_2(6)$, the right
angled Artin group $A(P_2(6))$ is a subgroup of a (right angled Artin) diagram
group. Thus we show that a diagram group can contain a non-free hyperbolic
subgroup answering a question of Guba and Sapir. We also show that fundamental
groups of non-orientable surfaces can be subgroups of diagram groups. Thus the
first integral homology of a subgroup of a diagram group can have torsion (all
homology groups of all diagram groups are free Abelian by a result of Guba and
Sapir).
