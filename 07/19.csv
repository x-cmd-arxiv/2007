"0707.2739","Jieun Jeong","Jieun Jeong","On Cycles in the Transcription Network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae",,,,,"q-bio.MN q-bio.GN",,"  We investigate the cycles in the transcription network of S. cerevisiae.
Unlike a similar network of E. coli, it contains many cycles. We characterize
properties of these cycles and their place in the regulatory mechanism of the
cell. Almost all cycles in the transcription network of S. cerevisiae are
contained in a single strongly connected component, which we call LSCC (L for
``largest''), except for a single cycle of two transcription factors. Among
different physiological conditions, cell cycle has the most significant
relationship with LSCC, as the set of 64 transcription interactions that are
active in all phases of the cell cycle has overlap of 27 with the interactions
of LSCC (of which there are 49). Conversely, if we remove the interactions that
are active in all phases of the cell cycle (fewer than 1% of the total), the
LSCC would have only three nodes and 5 edges, 4 of which are active only in the
stress response subnetwork. LSCC has a special place in the topology of the
network and it can be used to define a natural hierarchy in the network; in
every physiological subnetwork LSCC plays a pivotal role. Apart from those
well-defined conditions, the transcription network of S. cerevisiae is devoid
of cycles. It was observed that two conditions that were studied and that have
no cycles of their own are exogenous: diauxic shift and DNA repair, while cell
cycle, sporulation are endogenous.

joint fit for the soft component remains constant with the errors from previous
Chandra, XMM, and ASCA data. The hard temperature recovers from its 2000-2002

The hard (2-10 keV) light curve is confirmed to be declining. The derived

in astronomy, usually handled by computing the cross-correlation of the

problem of the determination of wavelength or velocity shifts among multiple

cross-correlation method and experiment with several simple models to determine
the location of the maximum of the cross-correlation function. We propose a new
technique, 'self-improvement', to refine the derived solutions by requiring
that the relative velocity for any given pair of spectra is consistent with all
others. By exploiting all available information, spectroscopic surveys
involving large numbers of similar objects may improve their precision
significantly. As an example, we simulate the analysis of a survey of G-type
stars with the SDSS instrumentation. Applying 'self-improvement' refines
relative radial velocities by more than 50% at low signal-to-noise ratio. The
concept is equally applicable to the problem of combining a series of
spectroscopic observations of the same object, each with a different Doppler
velocity or instrument-related offset, into a single spectrum with an enhanced

dsNA and fluctuations around the average unwinding velocity. Motivated by a
recent claim that the NS3 helicase of Hepatitis C virus follows a flashing
ratchet mechanism, we have compared the experimental results for the NS3
helicase with a special limit of our model which corresponds to the flashing
ratchet scenario. Our model accounts for one key feature of the experimental

efficiency or immediate loss, through radiative cooling, of a large fraction of
the energy inserted by stellar winds and supernovae during the early evolution
of the cluster. This implies a bimodal hydrodynamic solution which leads to a
reduced mass deposition rate into the ISM, with a much reduced outflow
velocity. Furthermore, to match the observed parameters of the HII region
associated to M82-A1, the resultant star cluster wind is here shown to ought to
be confined by a high pressure interstellar medium. The cluster wind
parameters, as well as the location of the reverse shock, its cooling length

of these properties are then confirmed with a semi-analytical integration of
the flow equations, which provides us also with the run of the hydrodynamic
variables as a function of radius. The impact of the results is discussed and
extended to other massive and young superstar clusters surrounded by a compact

This hole is manifested by a void in the pair wavefunction and a momentum kick.
Photoassociation into loosely bound levels of the external well in Cs_2
0$_g^-$(6S + 6P$_{3/2}$ is considered as a case study. After the pulse, the
free evolution of the ground triplet state wavepacket is analyzed. Due to a
negative momentum kick, motion to small distances is manifested and a
compression effect is pointed out, markedly increasing the density of atom
pairs at short distance. A consequence of the hole is the redistribution of the
vibrational population in the ground triplet state, with population of the last
bound level and creation of pairs of hot atoms. The physical interpretation
makes use of the time dependence of the probability current and population on
each channel to understand the role of the parameters of the photoassociation
pulse. By varying such parameters, optimization of the compression effect in
the ground state wavepacket is demonstrated. Due to an increase of the short
range density probability by more than two orders of magnitude, we predict
important photoassociation rates into deeply bound levels of the excited state
by a second pulse, red-detuned relative to the first one and conveniently
delayed.

been so far focused on single-user systems. For single-user systems, transmit
diversity schemes suffer a loss in spectral efficiency if the receiver is
equipped with more than one antenna, making them unsuitable for high rate
transmission. One such transmit diversity scheme is the cyclic delay diversity
code (CDD). The advantage of CDD over other diversity schemes such as
orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBC) is that a code rate of one and delay
optimality are achieved independent of the number of transmit antennas. In this
work we analyze the ergodic rate of a multi-user multiple access channel (MAC)
with each user applying such a cyclic delay diversity (CDD) code. We derive
closed form expressions for the ergodic sum-rate of multi-user CDD and compare
it with the sum-capacity. We study the ergodic rate region and show that in
contrast to what is conventionally known regarding the single-user case,
transmit diversity schemes are viable candidates for high rate transmission in
multi-user systems. Finally, our theoretical findings are illustrated by
numerical simulation results.

Morphology-density relations (MDR) are derived in each cluster from a complete,
luminosity-selected sample of 452 galaxies with a magnitude limit M_V <
M^{*}_{V} + 1. The change in the early-type fraction with redshift matches
previous work for massive clusters of galaxies. We performed a similar

the equivalent of =~1 mag below L^{*} for the red cluster galaxies, and
encompasses =~70% of the stellar mass in cluster galaxies. The MDRs in the
mass-selected sample at densities of Sigma > 50 galaxies Mpc^{-2} are similar
to those in the luminosity-selected sample but show larger early-type
fractions. However, the trend with redshift in the fraction of elliptical and

down to M=4x10^10 Msol (for a ``diet'' Salpeter IMF), corresponding to a

corresponds to M_B=-19.3 for red galaxies. Morphologies are determined with an
automated method, using the Sersic parameter n and a measure of the residual
from the model fits, called ``bumpiness'', to distinguish different
morphologies. These classifications are verified with visual classifications.
In agreement with previous studies, 65-70% of the galaxies are located on the
red sequence, both at z~0.03 and at z~0.8. Similarly, 65-70% of the galaxies

recent results for cluster galaxies in the same redshift range, we find that
the morphology-density relation for galaxies more massive than 0.5M* has
remained constant since at least z~0.8. This implies that galaxies evolve in
mass, morphology and density such that the morphology-density relation does not
change. In particular, the decline of star formation activity and the
accompanying increase in the stellar mass density of red galaxies since z~1
must happen without large changes in the early-type galaxy fraction in a given

function, $\alpha$, using semi-analytical modeling of galaxy formation. In
agreement with observations, we find that the slope can be fitted well by
$\alpha (z) =a+b z$, with a=-1.13 and b=-0.1. The main driver for the evolution
in $\alpha$ is the evolution in the underlying dark matter mass function.
Sub-L_* galaxies reside in dark matter halos that occupy a different part of
the mass function. At high redshifts, this part of the mass function is steeper
than at low redshifts and hence $\alpha$ is steeper. Supernova feedback in
general causes the same relative flattening with respect to the dark matter
mass function. The faint-end slope at low redshifts is dominated by field
galaxies and at high redshifts by cluster galaxies. The evolution of
$\alpha(z)$ in each of these environments is different, with field galaxies
having a slope b=-0.14 and cluster galaxies b=-0.05. The transition from
cluster-dominated to field-dominated faint-end slope occurs roughly at a
redshift $z_* \sim 2$, and suggests that a single linear fit to the overall
evolution of $\alpha(z)$ might not be appropriate. Furthermore, this result
indicates that tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies in clusters cannot play a
significant role in explaining the evolution of $\alpha(z)$ at z< z_*. In
addition we find that different star formation efficiencies a_* in the
Schmidt-Kennicutt-law and supernovae-feedback efficiencies $\epsilon$ generally

"0707.2791","P. Q. Hung","P. Q. Hung","Shadow vacuum alignment and dark energy","RevTex, double columns, 5 pages",,,,"hep-ph astro-ph",,"  In a recent model of dark energy (with several phenomenological
consequences), the universe is assumed to be trapped in a false vacuum with an
energy density of the order of (10^{-3} eV)^4, mimicking the presently
successful $\Lambda CDM$ scenario. This involves a new gauge group SU(2)_Z,
{\em the shadow sector}, which becomes strong at a scale $\Lambda_Z \sim
10^{-3} eV$. The model is described by the SU(2)_Z instanton-induced potential
of an axion-like scalar field, a_Z, with two degenerate vacuua. The false
(metastable) vacuum appears as a result of an phenomenological (ad-hoc) soft
breaking term linear in a_Z which explicitely breaks that degeneracy. In this
paper, we discuss a possible dynamical origin for this soft breaking term as
coming from the alignment of the vacuum along a direction in which the
condensate of the shadow fermions, $<\bar{\psi}^{(Z)}_{i} i \gamma_{5}
\psi^{(Z)}_{i}>$ which breaks spontaneously both P and CP, is non-vanishing.
The present universe lives in a vacuum which violates both P and CP in the
shadow SU(2)_Z sector!

High-resolution optical spectra obtained with UVES on the ESO Very Large
Telescope are used to determine the radial-velocity orbit of the OB
(super)giants with high precision. The excellent quality of the spectra
provides the opportunity to measure the radial-velocity curve based on
individual lines, and to study the effect of possible distortions of the line
profiles due to e.g. X-ray heating on the derived radial-velocity amplitude.
Several spectral lines show intrinsic variations with orbital phase. The
magnitude of these variations depends on line strength, and thus provides a
criterion to select lines that do not suffer from distortions. The undistorted
lines show a larger radial-velocity amplitude than the distorted lines,
consistent with model predictions. Application of our line-selection criteria
results in a mean radial-velocity amplitude K(Opt) of 20.2 +/- 1.1, 35.1 +/-
1.5, and 27.5 +/- 2.3 km/s (1 sigma errors), for the OB companion to SMC X-1,
LMC X-4 and Cen X-3, respectively. Adding information on the projected
rotational velocity of the OB companion (derived from our spectra), the
duration of X-ray eclipse and orbital parameters of the X-ray pulsar (obtained
from literature), we arrive at a neutron star mass of 1.06^{+0.11}_{-0.10},

explain the outbursting behaviour of quasars, can be used to explain the radio
flaring behaviour of the microquasar Cygnus X-3.
  Method: We have used a method developed to model the synchrotron outbursts of
quasar jets, which decomposes multifrequency lightcurves into a series of
outbursts. The method is based on the Marscher & Gear (1985) shock model, but
we have implemented the modifications to the model suggested by Bjornsson &
Aslaksen (2000), which make the flux density increase in the initial phase less
abrupt. We study the average outburst evolution as well as specific
characteristics of individual outbursts and physical jet properties of Cyg X-3.
  Results: We find that the lightcurves of the February-March 1994 and
September 2001 outbursts can be described with the modified shock model. The
average evolution shows that instead of the expected synchrotron plateau, the
flux density is still increasing during the synchrotron stage. We also find
that high frequency peaking outbursts are shorter in duration than the ones
peaking at lower frequencies. Finally, we show that the method can be used,
complementary to radio interferometric jet imaging, for deriving the physical
parameters such as the magnetic field strength and the energy density of
relativistic electrons in the jet of Cyg X-3.

weak coupling if the interaction and the covariance are summable and if certain
determinants arising in the expansion can be bounded efficiently, e.g. if the
covariance admits a Gram representation with a finite Gram constant. The
covariances of the standard many--fermion systems do not fall into this class
due to the slow decay of the covariance at large Matsubara frequency, giving
rise to a UV problem in the integration over degrees of freedom with Matsubara
frequencies larger than some Omega (usually the first step in a multiscale
analysis). We show that these covariances do not have Gram representations on
any separable Hilbert space. We then prove a general bound for determinants
associated to chronological products which is stronger than the usual Gram
bound and which applies to the many--fermion case. This allows us to prove
convergence of the first integration step in a rather easy way, for a
short--range interaction which can be arbitrarily strong, provided Omega is
chosen large enough. Moreover, we give - for the first time - nonperturbative

study in some more detail the parameter space in which this is viable, and

equilibrium} are studied from both wave-interaction and particle-interaction
points of view. It is shown that, even in a strongly nonlinear regime, the
chain in thermal equilibrium can be effectively described by a system of weakly
interacting \textit{renormalized} nonlinear waves. These waves possess (i) the
Rayleigh-Jeans distribution and (ii) zero correlations between waves, just as
noninteracting free waves would. This renormalization is achieved through a set
of canonical transformations. The renormalized linear dispersion of these
renormalized waves is obtained and shown to be in excellent agreement with
numerical experiments. Moreover, a dynamical interpretation of the
renormalization of the dispersion relation is provided via a self-consistency,
mean-field argument. It turns out that this renormalization arises mainly from
the trivial resonant wave interactions, i.e., interactions with no momentum
exchange. Furthermore, using a multiple time-scale, statistical averaging
method, we show that the interactions of near-resonant waves give rise to the
broadening of the resonance peaks in the frequency spectrum of renormalized
modes. The theoretical prediction for the resonance width for the thermalized
$\beta$-FPU chain is found to be in very good agreement with its numerically
measured value. Moreover, we show that the dynamical scenario for thermalized
$\beta$-FPU chains is spatially highly localized discrete breathers riding
chaotically on spatially extended, renormalized waves. We present numerical

Improved presentation and removed typos","Quantum Information and Computation Vol. 8 pg. 681 (2008)",,,"quant-ph math.GT",,"  It is known that evaluating a certain approximation to the Jones polynomial
for the plat closure of a braid is a BQP-complete problem. That is, this
problem exactly captures the power of the quantum circuit model. The one clean
qubit model is a model of quantum computation in which all but one qubit starts
in the maximally mixed state. One clean qubit computers are believed to be
strictly weaker than standard quantum computers, but still capable of solving
some classically intractable problems. Here we show that evaluating a certain
approximation to the Jones polynomial at a fifth root of unity for the trace
closure of a braid is a complete problem for the one clean qubit complexity
class. That is, a one clean qubit computer can approximate these Jones
polynomials in time polynomial in both the number of strands and number of
crossings, and the problem of simulating a one clean qubit computer is
reducible to approximating the Jones polynomial of the trace closure of a
braid.

Instead of stabilizing the volume modulus chi at instantaneous minima of the

multi-field inflation scenario involving these two fields. The two-field
dynamics with the potential V(phi,chi) in this model is significantly different
from the effective single-field description in terms of the field phi when the
field chi is integrated out. The latter picture underestimates the total number
of e-foldings even by one order of magnitude. We show that a correct
single-field description is provided by a field psi obtained from a rotation in
the two-field space along the background trajectory. This model can give a
large number of e-foldings required to solve flatness and horizon problems at
the expense of fine-tunings of model parameters. We also estimate the spectra

relevant to the investigation of trapped alpha particle interactions with
low-frequency MHD modes in burning plasmas: in fact, alpha particles in reactor
relevant conditions are characterized by small dimensionless orbits, similarly
to electrons; the trapped particle bounce averaged dynamics, meanwhile, depends
on energy and not mass.

radio galaxies which have more than one radio hotspot in at least one of their

information about the locations of high-energy particle acceleration. In some
models of the relationship between the jet and hotspot the hotspots that are
not the current jet termination point should be detached from the energy supply
from the active nucleus and therefore not capable of accelerating particles to
high energies. We find that in fact some secondary hotspots are X-ray sources,
and thus probably locations for high-energy particle acceleration after the
initial jet termination shock. In detail, though, we show that the spatial
structures seen in X-ray are not consistent with naive expectations from a
simple shock model: the current locations of the acceleration of the
highest-energy observable particles in powerful radio galaxies need not be
coincident with the peaks of radio or even optical emission.

corresponds when these probabilities cannot be factorized. We analyze how
non-factorizability changes Nash equilibria in two-player games while

EPR joint probabilities cannot be helpful to escape from the classical outcome
of the game. For a particular version of the Chicken game, however, we find
that the two non-factorizable sets of joint probabilities, that maximally

three phenomena. As a specific application of our results, we consider
tunneling between a normal metal and a noncentrosymmetric superconductor with
mixed singlet and triplet gaps. The conductance spectrum reveals information
about these gaps in addition to how the influence of spin-orbit coupling is
manifested. We also consider the coexistence of itinerant ferromagnetism and
triplet superconductivity as a model for recently discovered ferromagnetic
superconductors. The coupled gap equations are solved self-consistently, and we
study the conditions necessary to obtain the coexistent regime of
ferromagnetism and superconductivity. Analytical expressions are presented for
the order parameters, and we provide an analysis of the free energy to identify
the preferred system state. Moreover, we make specific predictions concerning
the heat capacity for a ferromagnetic superconductor. In particular, we report
a nonuniversal relative jump in the specific heat, depending on the
magnetization of the system, at the uppermost superconducting phase transition.

of dark energy structure associated with the dark matter halo: non-phantom
equations of state induce the formation of a dark energy halo, damping the
growth of structures; phantom models, on the other hand, generate dark energy
voids, enhancing structure growth. Finally, we employ the Press-Schechter

quarks surrounded by a meson cloud is applied to study the electroweak
structure of the proton and neutron. Light-cone wavefunctions are derived for
the dressed nucleon as pictured to be part of the time a bare nucleon and part
of the time a baryon-meson system. Configurations are considered where the
baryon can be a nucleon or a \Delta and the meson can be a pion as well as a
vector meson such as the \rho or the \omega. An overall good description of the
electroweak form factors is obtained. The contribution of the meson cloud is
small and only significant at low Q^2. Mixed-symmetry S'-wave components in the
wavefunction are most important to reproduce the neutron electric form factor.
Charge and magnetization densities are deduced as a function of both the radial
distance from the nucleon center and the transverse distance with respect to
the direction of the three-momentum transfer. In the latter case a central
negative charge is found for the neutron. The up and down quark distributions
associated with the Fourier transform of the axial form factor have opposite
sign, with the consequence that the probability to find an up (down) quark with
positive helicity is maximal when it is (anti)aligned with the proton helicity.

adopted. Radiative transfer in low and high rotational lines of CO, C18O, HCO+,
DCO+, HCN, CS, and H2CO is simulated. The corresponding excitation
temperatures, synthetic spectra, and channel maps are derived and compared to
the results of the Monte Carlo calculations. A simple scheme that describes the
conditions of the line excitation for a chosen molecular transition is
elaborated. We find that the simple LTE approach can safely be applied for the
low molecular transitions only, while it significantly overestimates the
intensities of the upper lines. In contrast, the Full Escape Probability (FEP)
approximation can safely be used for the upper transitions ($J_{\rm up} \ga 3$)

construct covariant quantum fields in arbitrary dimensions. We study the
complementary and the discrete series which correspond to light and massless
fields and which lead new feature with respect to the massive principal series
we previously studied (hep-th/0606119). When considering the complementary
series, we make use of a non-trivial scalar product in order to get local
expressions in the position representation. Based on these, we construct a
family of covariant canonical fields parametrized by SU(1,1)/U(1). Each of
these correspond to the dS invariant alpha-vacua. The behavior of the modes at
asymptotic times brings another difficulty as it is incompatible with the usual
definition of the in and out vacua. We propose a generalized notion of these
vacua which reduces to the usual conformal vacuum in the conformally massless
limit. When considering the massless discrete series we find that no covariant
field obeys the canonical commutation relations. To further analyze this
singular case, we consider the massless limit of the complementary scalar
fields we previously found. We obtain canonical fields with a deformed
representation by zero modes. The zero modes have a dS invariant vacuum with
singular norm. We propose a regularization by a compactification of the scalar
field and a dS invariant definition of the vertex operators. The resulting
two-point functions are dS invariant and have a universal logarithmic infrared
divergence.

\sigma_R while k_{max} is proportional to 1/\sigma_R when \xi is much smaller
than \sigma_R, and that the localization is strongest when \xi is of the order
of \sigma_R. Numerical calculations support our analysis and our estimates
indicate that the localization of the Bogolyubov quasiparticles is accessible
in current experiments with ultracold atoms.

emission-line stars: RJHA 49 and SS73 21. Methods: We used low and high
resolution optical data. Line identifications and measurements were performed
for several features in their spectra. Results: For each object, we have
derived the extinction and the excitation temperature from a set of [Fe II]
lines, and the electron density from [N II] lines. For RJHA 49, no detailed
spectroscopic study was done so far. Regarding SS73 21, our low resolution
spectrum have confirmed the main characteristics found in previous works. On
the other side, from our high resolution data, we have found that the Halpha
line presents a double-peak, in contrast with the suggestion in the literature
that it should reveal a P-Cygni profile. Surprisingly, we found a few He I
transitions resembling P-Cygni profiles (e.g. He I 5876), directly suggesting
that mass loss is active in SS73 21. We also discussed the nature of these two
objects based on the data obtained. Although the evolutionary status of SS73 21
seems well established from previous studies (a proto-planetary nebula), the
situation for RJHA 49 is not so clear mainly due to its unknown distance.
However, from the strength of [N II] 5754 relative to [O I] 6300, the
possibility of RJHA 49 being a LBV object is reduced, and a B[e]-supergiant or
a proto-planetary nebula status is more plausible.

view so that a given line segment is under full surveillance, which is termed
as the Disc Covering Problem on a Line. The cost of each sensor includes a
fixed component, and a variable component that is proportional to the
field-of-view area. When only one type of sensor or, in general, one type of
disc, is available, then a simple polynomial algorithm solves the problem. When
there are different types of sensors in terms of fixed and variable costs, the
problem becomes NP-hard. A branch-and-bound algorithm as well as an efficient
heuristic are developed. The heuristic very often obtains the optimal solution
as shown in extensive computational testing.

agree up to an additive constant. Both complexities are defined as the minimal
length of any (classical resp. quantum) computer program that outputs the
corresponding string.
  It follows that quantum complexity is an extension of classical complexity to
the domain of quantum states. This is true even if we allow a small
probabilistic error in the quantum computer's output. We outline a mathematical
proof of this statement, based on an inequality for outputs of quantum
operations and a classical program for the simulation of a universal quantum
computer.

0537-286, 0836+710, and 2149-307), classified as blazars. The sources,
well-known emitters at soft-medium X-rays, were detected at >5sigma with the
BAT experiment in 15-150 keV. No flux variability was detected within the XRT
and BAT exposures, with the exception of 0836+710 which shows an increase of a
factor 4 of the 15-150 keV flux on a timescale of one month. The 0.3-10 keV
spectra are well fitted by power law models, with rather hard continua (photon
indices Gamma_XRT ~1.3-1.5); similarly, the 15-150 keV spectra are described by
power laws with Gamma_BAT ~1.3-1.8. The XRT data exhibit spectral curvature,
which can be modeled either in terms of excess absorption along the line of
sight, or a downward-curved broken power law. In the former case, if the excess
N_H is at the rest-frame of the source, columns of N_H^z=(0.3-6)x10^22 cm^-2
are measured. Modeling of the SEDs of the four quasars shows that the emission
at the higher frequencies, >~ 10^16 Hz, is dominated by the jet, while the
steep optical-to-UV continua, observed with the UVOT, can be attributed to
thermal emission from the accretion disk. The disk luminosity is between 1% and
10% the jet power, similar to other powerful blazars.

After that, we study the case where Gamma is a connected, simply laced Dynkin
diagram of finite or affine type. We prove that X is then an affine space, and
that all points in an open dense subset of X parameterise Lie algebras
isomorphic to a single fixed Lie algebra. If Gamma is of affine type, then this
fixed Lie algebra is the split finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra
corresponding to the associated finite-type Dynkin diagram. This gives a new
construction of these Lie algebras, in which they come together with
interesting degenerations, corresponding to points outside the open dense
subset. Our results may prove useful for recognising these Lie algebras.

planets have been found in binary systems. From theoretical point of view,
however, whether or not the planetary formation proceeds in a binary system is
a very complex problem, because secular perturbation from the companion star
can easily stir up the eccentricity of the planetesimals and cause
high-velocity, destructive collisions between planetesimals. Early stage of
planetary formation process in binary systems has been studied by restricted
three-body approach with gas drag and it is commonly accepted that accretion of
planetesimals can proceed due to orbital phasing by gas drag. However, the gas
drag becomes less effective as the planetesimals become massive. Therefore it
is still uncertain whether the collision velocity remains small and planetary
accretion can proceed, once the planetesimals become massive. We performed {\it
N}-body simulations of planetary formation in binary systems starting from
massive planetesimals whose size is about 100-500 km. We found that the
eccentricity vectors of planetesimals quickly converge to the forced
eccentricity due to the coupling of the perturbation of the companion and the
mutual interaction of planetesimals if the initial disk model is sufficiently
wide in radial distribution. This convergence decreases the collision velocity
and as a result accretion can proceed much in the same way as in isolated
systems. The basic processes of the planetary formation, such as runaway growth
and oligarchic growth and final configuration of the protoplanets are
essentially the same in binary systems and single star systems, at least in the
late stage where the effect of gas drag is small.
