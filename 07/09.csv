surprisingly well behaved in the ultraviolet and may even be ultraviolet finite
in perturbation theory. The novel cancellations necessary for ultraviolet
finiteness first appear at one loop in the guise of the ""no-triangle
hypothesis"". We study one-loop amplitudes in pure Einstein gravity and point
out the existence of cancellations similar to those found previously in N=8
supergravity. These cancellations go beyond those found in the one-loop
effective action. Using unitarity, this suggests that generic theories of
quantum gravity based on the Einstein-Hilbert action may be better behaved in
the ultraviolet at higher loops than suggested by naive power counting, though
without additional (supersymmetric) cancellations they diverge. We comment on
future studies that should be performed to support this proposal.

supergravity formulation invariant under local complexified Weyl
transformations. We obtain the classical superpotential from a standard
argument involving domain walls and generalized calibrations and show how the
resulting F-flatness and D-flatness equations exactly reproduce the full
ten-dimensional supersymmetry equations. Furthermore, we consider the effect of
non-perturbative corrections to this superpotential arising from gaugino
condensation or Euclidean D-brane instantons. For the latter we derive the
supersymmetry conditions in N=1 flux vacua in full generality. We find that the
non-perturbative corrections induce a quantum deformation of the internal
generalized geometry. Smeared instantons allow to understand KKLT-like AdS
vacua from a ten-dimensional point of view. On the other hand, non-smeared
instantons in IIB warped Calabi-Yau compactifications 'destabilize' the
Calabi-Yau complex structure into a genuine generalized complex one. This
deformation gives a geometrical explanation of the non-trivial superpotential
for mobile D3-branes induced by the non-perturbative corrections.

to generate curvature, just as the connection, so there should be an extra

introduce the huge natural scale due to the vacuum energy of quantum fields.
This scale allows for a perturbative solution of the equations of motion. We
prove the system has a vacuum state that forces the metricity of the metric and
results in General Relativity for low energies. The vacuum energy of the
quantum fields cancels, becoming unobservable. At very high energies, the
metric does not appear differentiated in the lagrangian and so it is not a
quantum field, just a background classical field. The true quantum fields are
the connections. The theory becomes very similar to a Yang-Mills, with affine
connections taking the place of Yang-Mills vector fields. It should be
renormalizable since it has a coupling constant with no units and correct
propagators after fixing the gauge (diffeomorphisms). The weakness of gravity
turns out to be due to the large vacuum energy of the quantum fields.

expected in various scenarios. In this paper, we study the neutrino emission
from early afterglows of GRBs, especially under the reverse-forward shock model
and late prompt emission model. In the former model, the early afterglow
emission occurs due to dissipation made by an external shock with the
circumburst medium (CBM). In the latter model, internal dissipation such as
internal shocks produces the shallow decay emission in early afterglows. We
also discuss implications of recent Swift observations for neutrino signals in
detail. Future neutrino detectors such as IceCube may detect neutrino signals
from early afterglows, especially under the late prompt emission model, while
the detection would be difficult under the reverse-forward shock model.
Contribution to the neutrino background from the early afterglow emission may
be at most comparable to that from the prompt emission unless the outflow
making the early afterglow emission loads more nonthermal protons, and it may
be important in the very high energies. Neutrino-detections are inviting
because they could provide us with not only information on baryon acceleration
but also one of the clues to the model of early afterglows. Finally, we compare
various predictions for the neutrino background from GRBs, which are testable
by future neutrino-observations.

graded module over $H^*A$ is called \emph{realisable} if it is (up to direct
summands) of the form $H^*M$ for some differential graded $A$-module $M$.
Benson, Krause and Schwede have stated a local and a global obstruction for
realisability. The global obstruction is given by the Hochschild class
determined by the secondary multiplication of the $A_{\infty}$-algebra
structure of $H^*A$.
  In this thesis we mainly consider differential graded algebras $A$ with
graded-commutative cohomology ring. We show that a finitely presented graded
$H^*A$-module $X$ is realisable if and only if its $\mathfrak{p}$-localisation
$X_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is realisable for all graded prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}$ of
$H^*A$.
  In order to obtain such a local-global principle also for the global
obstruction, we define the \emph{localisation of a differential graded algebra
$A$ at a graded prime $\mathfrak{p}$ of $H^*A$}, denoted by $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$,
and show the existence of a morphism of differential graded algebras inducing
the canonical map $H^*A \to (H^*A)_{\mathfrak{p}}$ in cohomology. The latter
result actually holds in a much more general setting: we prove that every
smashing localisation on the derived category of a differential graded algebra
is induced by a morphism of differential graded algebras.
  Finally we discuss the relation between realisability of modules over the

certain less than fortunate yet essential differences between modern
Mathematics and theoretical Physics, as far as the significant freedom of
introducing new fundamental concepts, structures and theories in the former is
concerned. A number of modern mathematical concepts and structures are

highlighting the comparisons made with those of the recently revealed Galactic
bulge stars. A similarity between two of the comparisons leads to a new
theoretical picture of the bulge-disk connection in the Galaxy, where a
supermassive black hole resides at the center. We postulate that a metal-rich
outflow, triggered by feedback from a black hole, was generated and quenched
the star formation, which had lasted several billion years in the bulge. The
expelled gas cooled down in the Galactic halo without escaping from the
gravitational potential of the Galaxy. The gas gradually started to accrete to
the disk around five billion years ago, corresponding to the time of sun's
birth, and replaced a low-metallicity halo gas that had been accreting over
nearly ten billion years. The metal-rich infalling gas, whose elemental
abundance reflects that of metal-rich bulge stars, mixed with the interstellar
gas already present in the disk. Stars formed from the mixture compose the
metal-rich stellar disk. This scheme is incorporated into models for chemical
evolution of the disk. The resultant elemental features are compatible with the
observed abundance trends of metal-rich disk stars, including the upturning
feature exhibited in some [X/Fe] ratios, whose interpretation was theoretically
puzzling. Furthermore, the predicted abundance distribution function of disk
stars covers all observational facts to be considered: (i) the deficiency of
metal-poor stars, (ii) the location of peak, and (iii) the extended metal-rich
tail up to [Fe/H] ~ +0.4.

flow. The basic idea is to integrate models for nonmotorized vehicles
(nm-vehicles) with models for motorized vehicles (m-vehicles). Based on the
idea, a model for mix traffic flow is realized in in the following two steps.
At a first step, the models that can be integrated should be chosen. The famous
NaSch cellular automata (NCA) model for m-vehicles and the Burgur cellular
automata (BCA) model for nm-vehicles are used in this paper, since the two
models are similar and comparable. At a second step, we should study coupling
rules between m-vehicles and nm-vehicles to represent their interaction.
Special lane changing rules are designed for the coupling process. The proposed
model is named as the combined cellular automata (CCA) model. The model is
applied to a typical mixed traffic scenario, where a bus stop without special
stop bay is set on nonmotorized lanes. The simulation results show that the
model can describe both the interaction between the flow of nm-vehicles and
m-vehicles and their characters.

the LINER/starburst galaxy NGC 6764. The galaxy has an outflow morphology in
radio continuum, spatially coincident with the CO and H$\alpha$ emission, and
centered slightly off the radio continuum peak at the LINER nucleus. The total
molecular gas mass in the center is about 7x10^8 \msun, using a CO luminosity
to total molecular gas conversion factor that is three times lower than the
standard one. CO(1-0) emission is found near the boundaries of the radio
continuum emission cone. The outflow has a projected expansion velocity of 25
km/s relative to the systemic velocity of NGC6764. About 4x 10^6 \msun of
molecular gas is detected in the outflow. The approximate location (~1 kpc) of
the dynamical inner Lindblad resonance has been derived from the rotation
curve. The peak of the CO emission is slightly (< 200 pc) offset from the peak
of the radio continuum.
  The molecular gas has most likely been ejected by the stellar winds from the
recent starburst, but the CO line ratios show indication of an interaction with
the AGN. The energy released by the nuclear starburst is sufficient to explain
the observed outflow, even if the data cannot exclude the AGN from being the
major energy source. Comparison of the outflow with hydrodynamical simulations
suggests that the nuclear starburst is 3--7 Myr old and the bubble-like outflow
is still confined and not freely expanding.

points, referred to as cusp points, which may appear on these curves. Cusp
points play an important role in the kinematic behavior of parallel

The purpose of this study is twofold. First, it reviews an important previous

it determines the cusp points in any two-dimensional slice of the joint space.
First results show that the number of cusp points may vary from zero to eight.

chemical and bio-chemical analysis. During the past decade, there has been an
increasing emphasis on miniaturization of chemical analysis systems and
naturally this has stimulated a large effort in integrating microfluidics and
optics in lab-on-a-chip microsystems. This development is partly defining the
emerging field of optofluidics. Scaling analysis and experiments have
demonstrated the advantage of micro-scale devices over their macroscopic
counterparts for a number of chemical applications. However, from an optical
point of view, miniaturized devices suffer dramatically from the reduced
optical path compared to macroscale experiments, e.g. in a cuvette. Obviously,
the reduced optical path complicates the application of optical techniques in
lab-on-a-chip systems. In this paper we theoretically discuss how a strongly
dispersive photonic crystal environment may be used to enhance the light-matter
interactions, thus potentially compensating for the reduced optical path in
lab-on-a-chip systems. Combining electromagnetic perturbation theory with
full-wave electromagnetic simulations we address the prospects for achieving
slow-light enhancement of Beer-Lambert-Bouguer absorption, photonic band-gap
based refractometry, and high-Q cavity sensing.

intermediate-mass black holes of mass up to about 1000 solar masses out to a
luminosity distance of a few Gpc. For typical multipolar energy distributions,
we show that the single-mode ringdown templates presently used for ringdown
searches in the LIGO data stream can produce a significant event loss (> 10%
for all detectors in a large interval of black hole masses) and very large
parameter estimation errors on the black hole's mass and spin. We estimate that
more than 10^6 templates would be needed for a single-stage multi-mode search.
Therefore, we recommend a ""two stage"" search to save on computational costs:
single-mode templates can be used for detection, but multi-mode templates or
Prony methods should be used to estimate parameters once a detection has been
made. We update estimates of the critical signal-to-noise ratio required to
test the hypothesis that two or more modes are present in the signal and to
resolve their frequencies, showing that second-generation Earth-based detectors
and LISA have the potential to perform no-hair tests.

been measured. The measurements were carried out over a temperature range from
~ 10 K to ~ 180 K. The latter was the highest temperature, where the diode
still demonstrated rectifying properties. This maximum operating temperature is
higher than any of the earlier reported results.

markedly at a bias of ~ 400 mV for TDJ, and at ~550 mV for IJ. The ideality
factor n was about 1.5-2 for both diode types at 80 K. The analysis of the C-V
plots shows that the junctions in both diode types are linearly graded. The
analysis of the C-V plots allows also determining the height of the junction
barrier, the concentrations and the concentration gradient of the impurities,
and the temperature dependence of the static dielectric constant. The
zero-bias-resistance x area products (R0Ae) at 80 K are: 850 OHMcm2 for TDJ,
250 OHMcm2 for In-IJ, and ~ 80 OHMcm2 for Zn-IJ, while at 180 K R0Ae ~ 0.38
OHMcm2 for TDJ, and ~ 0.1 OHMcm2 for IJ. The estimated detectivity is: D* ~
10^10 cmHz^(1/2)/W up to T=140 K, determined mainly by background radiation,
while at T=180 K, D* decreases to 108-107 cmHz^(1/2)/W, and is determined by

Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (mSOD1 mice) constitute an animal model of ALS that,
like patients, exhibits unexpectedly increased energy expenditure.
Counterbalancing for this increase with a high-fat diet extends lifespan and
prevents motor neuron loss. Here, we investigated whether lipid metabolism is
defective in this animal model. Hepatic lipid metabolism was roughly normal,
whereas gastrointestinal absorption of lipids as well as peripheral clearance
of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins were markedly increased, leading to decreased
postprandial lipidemia. This defect was corrected by the high-fat regimen that
typically induces neuroprotection in these animals. Together, our findings show
that energy metabolism in mSOD1 mice shifts toward an increase in the
peripheral use of lipids. This metabolic shift probably accounts for the
protective effect of dietary lipids in this model.

quenching of cooling flows and star formation in massive dark-matter haloes
hosting ellipticals and clusters. The virial shock heating in haloes >10^12 Mo
triggers quenching in 10^12-13 Mo haloes (Birnboim, Dekel & Neistein 2007). We
show that the long-term quenching in haloes >Mmin~7x10^12 Mo could be due to
the gravitational energy of cosmological accretion delivered to the inner-halo
hot gas by cold flows via ram-pressure drag and local shocks. Mmin is obtained
by comparing the gravitational power of infall into the potential well with the
overall radiative cooling rate. The heating wins if the gas inner density cusp
is not steeper than r^-0.5 and if the masses in the cold and hot phases are
comparable. The effect is stronger at higher redshifts, making the maintenance
easier also at later times. Clumps >10^5 Mo penetrate to the inner halo with
sufficient kinetic energy before they disintegrate, but they have to be <10^8
Mo for the drag to do enough work in a Hubble time. Pressure confined ~10^4K
clumps are stable against their own gravity and remain gaseous once below the
Bonnor-Ebert mass ~10^8 Mo. They are also immune to tidal disruption. Clumps in
the desired mass range could emerge by thermal instability in the outer halo if
the conductivity is not too high. Alternatively, such clumps may be embedded in
dark-matter subhaloes if the ionizing flux is ineffective, but they separate
from their subhaloes by ram pressure before entering the inner halo. Heating by
dynamical friction becomes dominant for massive satellites, which can
contribute up to one third of the total gravitational heating. We conclude that
gravitational heating by cosmological accretion is a viable alternative to AGN
feedback as a long-term quenching mechanism.

  Two ways to implement the limit are considered: c going to infinity with the
velocity v of the particles fixed, the case for which rigorous results have
already been discussed in the literature, and v going to 0 with c fixed. The
second case can be rephrased as the limit of heavy particles, m_{j} -->
epsilon^{-2}m_{j}, observed over a long time, t --> epsilon^{-1}t, epsilon -->
0^{+}, with kinetic energy E_{kin} = Or(1).
  Focusing on the second approach we construct subspaces which are invariant
for the dynamics up to terms of order epsilon sqrt{log(epsilon^{-1})} and
describe effective dynamics, for the particles only, inside them. At the lowest
order the particles interact through Coulomb potentials. At the second one,
epsilon^{2}, the mass gets a correction of electromagnetic origin and a
velocity dependent interaction, the Darwin term, appears.
  Moreover, we calculate the radiated piece of the wave function, i. e., the
piece which leaks out of the almost invariant subspaces and calculate the
corresponding radiated energy.

representation space for the actions of these two Moyal algebras, and suggest
physical arguments for this choice of the representation space. We give the
proper setup to couple the matter fields based on A_theta(R^2) to
electromagnetic fields which are described by the abelian commutative gauge
group G_c(U(1)), i.e. gauge fields based on A_0(R^2). This enables us to give a
manifestly gauge covariant formulation of integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE).
Thus, we can view IQHE as an elementary example of interacting quantum
topologies, where matter and gauge fields based on algebras A_theta^prime with
different theta^prime appear. Two-particle wave functions in this approach are
based on A_theta(R^2) x A_theta(R^2). We find that the full symmetry group in
IQHE, which is the semi-direct product SO(2) \ltimes G_c(U(1)) acts on this
tensor product using the twisted coproduct Delta_theta. Consequently, as we
show, many particle sectors of each Landau level have twisted statistics. As an
example, we find the twisted two particle Laughlin wave functions.

limited and some of the images may remain unresolved. It may be still possible
to find a full set of time delays from such a blended data. We discuss here a
particular but interesting case when we have two light curves that both are
blends. A suitable computational algorithm is developed and tested to work with
computer-generated model light curves. Our method combines both blended
sequences using the hypothetical time delays between the initial components of
the light curves as free input parameters. The combined curves are then
compared using statistical distance estimation. It occurs that using an
assumption of equal magnification ratios between the components of the blends,
we can indeed recover the whole set of time delays.

candidate star OGLE-TR-82. Good seeing V-band images acquired with VIMOS
instrument at ESO VLT allowed us to measure V=20.6+-0.03 mag star in spite of
the presence of a brighter neighbour about 1"" away. This faint magnitude
answers the question why it has not been possible to measure radial velocities
for this object. One transit of this star has been observed with GMOS-S
instrument of GEMINI-South telescope in i and g-bands. The measurement of the
transit allows us to verify that this is not a false positive, to confirm the
transit amplitude measured by OGLE, and to improve the ephemeris. The transit
is well defined in i-band light curve, with a depth of A_i=0.034 mag. It is
however, less well defined, but deeper (A_g=0.1 mag) in the g-band, in which
the star is significantly fainter. The near-infrared photometry obtained with
SofI array at the ESO-NTT yields K=12.2+-0.1 and V-K=8.4+-0.1, so red that it
is unlike any other transit candidate studied before. Due to the extreme nature
of this object, we have not yet been able to measure velocities for this star,
but based on the new data we consider two different possible configurations:(1)
a nearby M7V star, or (2) a blend with a very reddened distant red giant. The
nearby M7V dwarf hypothesis would give a radius for the companion of
R_p=0.3+-0.1 R_J, i.e. the size of Neptune. Quantitative analysis of near-IR
spectroscopy finally shows that OGLE-TR-82 is a distant, reddened metal poor
early K giant. This result is confirmed by direct comparison with stellar
templates that gives the best match for a K3III star. Therefore, we discard the
planetary nature of the companion. Based on all the new data, we conclude that
this system is a main-sequence binary blended with a background red giant.

fluctuating electric fields superposed on an X-type magnetic field. Particle
distributions are obtained by numerically integrating individual charged
particle orbits when a time varying electric field is superimposed on a static
X-type neutral point. This configuration represents the effects of the passage
of a generic MHD disturbance through such a system. Different frequencies of
the electric field are used, representing different possible types of wave. The
electric field reduces with increasing distance from the X-type neutral point
as in linear dynamic magnetic reconnection. The resulting particle
distributions have properties that depend on the amplitude and frequency of the
electric field. In many cases a bimodal form is found. Depending on the
timescale for variation of the electric field, electrons and ions may be
accelerated to different degrees and often have energy distributions of
different forms. Protons are accelerated to $\gamma$-ray producing energies and
electrons to and above hard X-ray producing energies in timescales of 1 second.

a function of both luminosity and environment in the SDSS DR4 dataset. Using a
sample of 27753 galaxies at 0.005<z<0.037 that is >90% complete to Mr=-18.0 we
find that the EW(Ha) distribution is strongly bimodal, allowing galaxies to be
robustly separated into passive and star-forming populations about a value
EW(Ha)=2A. In high-density regions ~70% of galaxies are passive independent of
luminosity. In the rarefied field however, the fraction of passively-evolving
galaxies is a strong function of luminosity, dropping from ~50% for Mr<-21 to
zero by Mr~-18. Indeed for the lowest luminosity range covered (-18<Mr<-16)
none of the ~600 galaxies in the lowest density quartile are passive. The few
passively-evolving dwarf galaxies in field regions appear as satellites to
bright (~L*) galaxies. The fraction of galaxies with optical AGN signatures
decreases steadily from ~50% at Mr~-21 to ~0% by Mr~-18 closely mirroring the
luminosity-dependence of the passive galaxy fraction in low-density
environments. This result reflects the increasing importance of AGN feedback
with galaxy mass for their evolution, such that the star-formation histories of
massive galaxies are primarily determined by their past merger history. In
contrast, the complete absence of passively-evolving dwarf galaxies more than
~2 virial radii from the nearest massive halo (i.e. cluster, group or massive
galaxy) indicates that internal processes, such as merging, AGN feedback or gas
consumption through star-formation, are not responsible for terminating
star-formation in dwarf galaxies. Instead the evolution of dwarf galaxies is
primarily driven by the mass of their host halo, probably through the combined
effects of tidal forces and ram-pressure stripping.

limit measures $\mu$ induced by a finite family of affine mappings in

  By a systematic analysis of the Fourier transform of the measure $\mu$ at

singular carry a gradation, ranging from Cantor-like fractal measures to
measures exhibiting chaos, i.e., a situation when small changes in the initial

(in this case the measures). Our method depends on asymptotic estimates on the
Fourier transform of $\mu$ for paths at infinity in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show how
properties of $\mu$ depend on perturbations of the initial data, e.g.,
variations in a prescribed finite set of affine mappings in $\mathbb{R}^d$, in

The exciton wave functions and energies are found exactly by numerically
diagonalizing the Hamiltonian. The principal restriction we impose is that only
the optical transitions between the ground state and optically dominant states
of the one-exciton manifold are considered, whereas transitions to other
states, including those of higher exciton manifolds, are neglected. The optical
dynamics of the system is treated within the framework of truncated optical
Maxwell-Bloch equations in which the electric polarization is calculated by
using a joint distribution of the transition frequency and the transition
dipole moment of the optically dominant states. This function contains all the
statistical information about these two quantities that govern the optical
response, and is obtained numerically by sampling many disorder realizations.
We derive a steady-state equation that establishes a relationship between the
output and input intensities of the electric field and show that within a
certain range of the parameter space this equation exhibits a three-valued
solution for the output field. A time-domain analysis is employed to
investigate the stability of different branches of the three-valued solutions

that carbon dioxide (CO2) radiative forcing was the prime mover in the changes
in temperature, ice-sheet volume, and related climatic variables in the glacial
and interglacial periods of the past 650,000 years, even under the ""fast
response"" framework where the convenient if artificial distinction between
forcing and feedback is assumed. Atmospheric CO2 variations generally follow
changes in temperature and other climatic variables rather than preceding them.
Likewise, there is no confirmation of the often-posited significant supporting
role of methane (CH4) forcing, which despite its faster atmospheric response
time is simply too small, amounting to less than 0.2 W/m2 from a change of 400
ppb. We cannot quantitatively validate the numerous qualitative suggestions
that the CO2 and CH4 forcings that occurred in response to the Milankovich
orbital cycles accounted for more than half of the amplitude of the changes in
the glacial/interglacial cycles of global temperature, sea level, and ice
volume. Consequently, we infer that natural climatic variability notably the
persistence of insolation forcing at key seasons and geographical locations,
taken with closely-related thermal, hydrological, and cryospheric changes (such
as the water vapor, cloud, and ice-albedo feedbacks) suffices in se to explain
the proxy-derived, global and regional, climatic and environmental
phase-transitions in the paleoclimate. If so, it may be appropriate to place
anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions in context by separating their
medium-term climatic impacts from those of a host of natural forcings and
feedbacks that may, as in paleoclimatological times, prove just as significant.

thrust distribution in electron-positron annihilation. The corrections turn out
to be sizable, enhancing the previously known next-to-leading order prediction
by about 15%. Inclusion of the NNLO corrections significantly reduces the
theoretical renormalisation scale uncertainty on the prediction of the thrust
distribution.

pi_1(1400) and pi_1(1600) exotic candidates. Should they exist, mounting
theoretical arguments suggest that they are tetraquark molecular resonances
excitable by meson rescattering.
  We report a new tetraquark calculation within a model field theory
approximation to Quantum Chromodynamics in the Coulomb gauge supporting this
conjecture. We also strengthen this claim by consistently contrasting results
with exotic state predictions for hybrid (q qbar g) mesons within the same
theoretical framework.
  Our findings confirm that molecular-like configurations involving two color
singlets (a resonance, not a bound state) are clearly favored over hybrid or
color-exotic tetraquark meson (q qbar q qbar atoms) formation.
  Finally, to assist needed further experimental searches we document a useful
off-plane correlator for establishing the structure of these exotic systems
along with similar, but anticipated much narrower, states that should exist in
the charmonium and bottomonium spectra.

admitting a (bounded) exhaustive real function u, defined on M minus a point
x_o, so that: a) it is a smooth solution on $M\setminus {x_o}$ to the
Monge-Amp\`ere equation $(d d^c u)^n = 0$; b) x_o is a singular point for u of
logarithmic type and e^u extends smoothly on the blow up of M at x_o; c) $d d^c
(e^u) >0$ at any point of $M\setminus {x_o}$. This class of manifolds naturally
includes all smoothly bounded, strictly linearly convex domains and all
smoothly bounded, strongly pseudoconvex circular domains of $\bC^n$. The moduli
spaces of bounded manifolds of circular type are studied. In particular, for
each biholomorphic equivalence class of them it is proved the existence of an
essentially unique manifold in normal form. It is also shown that the class of
normalizing maps for an n-dimensional manifold M is a new holomorphic invariant
with the following property: it is parameterized by the points of a finite
dimensional real manifold of dimension n^2 when M is a (non-convex) circular
domain while it is of dimension $n^2 + 2 n$ when M is a strictly convex domain.
New characterizations of the circular domains and of the unit ball are also
obtained.

the visualization problem due to data sparsity. We use the results of a
Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) to reduce the negative effect of
sparsity by organizing differently data cube cells. Our approach does not
reduce sparsity, however it tries to build relevant representation spaces where
facts are efficiently gathered. In order to evaluate our approach, we propose
an homogeneity criterion based on geometric neighborhood of cells. The obtained
experimental results have shown the efficiency of our method.

several applications to the structure theory of non-selfadjoint graph operator
