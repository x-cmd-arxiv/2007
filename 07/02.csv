heavy fermion metals. Its manifestation in the transport properties is studied
through an effective Bose-Fermi Kondo model; the bosonic bath, corresponding to

focused on investigating analytically and quantitatively how the momentum

transfer in these decelerating and accelerating processes. The complete STIRAP

capitalizes on the iteration vectors produced by CG to update only a small
window of vectors that approximate the eigenvectors. While this window is
restarted in a locally optimal way, the CG algorithm for the linear system is
unaffected. Yet, in all our experiments, this small window converges to the
required eigenvectors at a rate identical to unrestarted Lanczos. After the
solution of the linear system, eigenvectors that have not accurately converged
can be improved in an incremental fashion by solving additional linear systems.
In this case, eigenvectors identified in earlier systems can be used to
deflate, and thus accelerate, the convergence of subsequent systems. We have
used this algorithm with excellent results in lattice QCD applications, where
hundreds of right hand sides may be needed. Specifically, about 70 eigenvectors
are obtained to full accuracy after solving 24 right hand sides. Deflating
these from the large number of subsequent right hand sides removes the dreaded
critical slowdown, where the conditioning of the matrix increases as the quark
mass reaches a critical value. Our experiments show almost a constant number of
iterations for our method, regardless of quark mass, and speedups of 8 over
original CG for light quark masses.

  Our first result states that for any monotone graph property P, any \epsilon

possible and for most properties, it is NP-hard to approximate E_P(G) up to an
additive error of n^{2-\delta}, for any fixed positive \delta.
  The proof requires several new combinatorial ideas and involves tools from

favors a local singlet on each unit cell, and a resonating-valence-bond effect,
which favors a local singlet on each pair of nearest-neighbor unit cells,
stabilizes the Fermi liquid, whose ground state is a singlet as a whole, in the
strong-coupling regime. In the whole Hilbert space with no restriction, the
normal Fermi liquid is unstable at least against a magnetic or superconducting
state. This analysis confirms an early Fermi-liquid theory of high-temperature
superconductivity, F. J. Ohkawa, Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 26, L652 (1987). The

in G) is the collection of the numbers $\{{\rm dim} V^{H}\}$, where V runs over
all the finite dimensional representations of G. By a Theorem of Larsen-Pink
([L-P90]), the dimension data determines H up to isomorphism, and if G = GL (n)
even up to conjugacy. Professor Langlands raised the question as to whether the
strong (conjugacy) result holds for arbitrary G. In this paper We provided the
following (negative) answer: If H is simple of type A_{4 n}, $B_{2 n} (n \geq
2)$, $C_{2 n} (n \geq 2)$, E_{6}, E_{8}, F_{4} and G_{2}, then there exist (for
suitable $N$) pairs of embeddings i and i' of H into $G = SO (2 N)$ such that
there image i (H) and i' (H) have the same dimension data but are not

a pseudogap with a finite intensity at the Fermi level ($E_F$) in the
high-temperature paramagnetic insulating (PI) phase. Within the CO phase, the
spectral intensity near $E_F$ gradually increased with temperature. These
observations are consistent with the results of Monte Carlo simulations on a
model including charge ordering and ferromagnetic fluctuations [H. Aliaga {\it

little temperature dependence was observed within the low-temperature
ferromagnetic insulating (FI) phase and the intensity at $E_F$ remained low in
the high-temperature PI phase. We attribute the difference in the temperature
dependence near $E_F$ between the CO and FI phases to the different correlation
lengths of orbital order between both phases. Furthermore, we observed a
chemical potential shift with temperature due to the opening of the gap in the
FI and CO phases. The doping dependent chemical potential shift was recovered
at low temperatures, corresponding to the disappearance of the doping dependent
change of the modulation wave vector. Spectral weight transfer with hole
concentration was clearly observed at high temperatures but was suppressed at
low temperatures. We attribute this observation to the fixed periodicity with
hole doping in PCMO at low temperatures.

dust distribution on the Eddington limit of the torus. For smooth dust
distributions, the Eddingtion limit on the dust alone is 5 orders of magnitudes
below the limit for electron scattering in a fully ionized plasma, while a
clumpy dust torus has an Eddington limit slightly larger than the classical
one. We study the behaviour of a clumpy torus at low and high AGN luminosities.
For low luminosities of the order of ~10^42 erg/s, the torus changes its
characteristics and obscuration becomes insufficient. In the high luminosity
regime, the clumpy torus can show a behaviour which is consistent with the
""receding torus"" picture. The derived luminosity-dependent fraction of
type-2-objects agrees with recent observational results. Moreover, the
luminosity-dependent covering factor in a clumpy torus may explain the presence
of broad-line AGN with high column densities in X-rays.

It is explicitly shown, with Hamiltonian formalism, that the theory of an
electromagnetic field on d-dimensional spherical black holes reduces to one of
an infinite number of massive complex scalar fields on 2-dimensional spacetime,
for which the usual anomaly-cancellation method is available. It is found that
the total energy emitted from the horizon for the electromagnetic field is just
(d-2) times as that for a scalar field. The results support the picture that
Hawking radiation can be regarded as an anomaly eliminator on horizons.

MID-infrared Interferometer (MIDI) at ESO's VLTI telescope array. The
interferometric measurements are spectrally resolved (R = 30) in the wavelength
range 8 to 13 micron. Their spatial resolution reaches 15 mas at the shortest
wavelengths. Supplementary observations were obtained in the near-infrared with
the adaptive optics instrument NACO, and at mm wavelengths with SEST and JCMT.
We find that he mid-infrared emission from the core of Centaurus A is dominated
by an unresolved point source (<10 mas). Observations with baselines orientated
perpendicular to the radio jet reveal an extended component which can be
interpreted as a geometrically thin, dusty disk, the axis of which is aligned
with the radio jet. Its diameter is about 0.6 pc. We argue, that the unresolved
emission is dominated by a synchrotron source. Its overall spectrum is
characterized by a \nu^{-0.36} power-law which cuts off exponentially towards
high frequencies at 8x10^{13} Hz and becomes optically thick at \nu < 45 GHz.
Based on a Synchrotron Self Compton (SSC) interpretation for the gamma-ray
emission, we find a magnetic field strength of 26 microTesla and a maximum
energy of relativistic electrons of \gamma_c = E_c/m_e c^2 = 8500. Near
\gamma_c, the acceleration time scale is 4 days, in good agreement with the
fastest X-ray variations. Our SSC model argues for an upper limit for the bulk
Lorentz factor < 2.5, at variance with the concept of a ""mis-directed BL Lac
object"". We estimate a thermal core luminosity of 1.3x10^{34} W, intermediate
between the values for highly efficiently accreting AGN (e.g. Seyfert galaxies)

This problem is a generalization of the standard vertex cover to hypergraphs:
one seeks a configuration of particles with minimal density such that every
hyperedge of the hypergraph contains at least one particle. It can also be used
in important practical tasks, such as the Group Testing procedures where one
wants to detect defective items in a large group by pool testing. Using a
Statistical Mechanics approach based on the cavity method, we study the phase
diagram of the HVC problem, in the case of random regualr hypergraphs.
Depending on the values of the variables and tests degrees different situations
can occur: The HVC problem can be either in a replica symmetric phase, or in a
one-step replica symmetry breaking one. In these two cases, we give explicit
results on the minimal density of particles, and the structure of the phase
space. These problems are thus in some sense simpler than the original vertex
cover problem, where the need for a full replica symmetry breaking has
prevented the derivation of exact results so far. Finally, we show that
decimation procedures based on the belief propagation and the survey
propagation algorithms provide very efficient strategies to solve large
individual instances of the hyper vertex cover problem.

states that if there exists an n-times continuously differentiable Lyapunov
function which proves exponential stability on a bounded subset of R^n, then
there exists a polynomial Lyapunov function which proves exponential stability
on the same region. Such a continuous Lyapunov function will exist if, for
example, the right-hand side of the differential equation is polynomial or at
least n-times continuously differentiable. The proof is based on a
generalization of the Weierstrass approximation theorem to differentiable
functions in several variables. Specifically, we show how to use polynomials to
approximate a differentiable function in the Sobolev norm W^{1,\infty} to any
desired accuracy. We combine this approximation result with the second-order
Taylor series expansion to find that polynomial Lyapunov functions can
approximate continuous Lyapunov functions arbitrarily well on bounded sets. Our
investigation is motivated by the use of polynomial optimization algorithms to
construct polynomial Lyapunov functions.

frames. Natural frames allow to extend this result to coordinate systems, so
that coordinate systems may be also locally classified in four causal classes.
These causal classes admit simple geometric descriptions and physical
interpretations. For example, one can generate representatives of the four
causal classes by means of the {\em linear synchronization group}. Of
particular interest is the {\em local Solar time synchronization}, which
reveals the limits of the frequent use of the concept of `causally oriented
oordinate', such as that of `time-like coordinate'. Classical {\em positioning
systems}, based in sound or light signals, are, by themselves, interesting
examples of location systems, i.e. of physically constructible coordinate
systems. They show that one can locate events in Newtonian space-time {\em
without} any use of the concept of synchronization. In fact, the coordinate
systems associated to positioning systems, belong to all the classes but the
standard one, i.e. the one based in the simultaneity synchronization. The
relativistic analogs of these examples, emphasize the contrast between the four
Newtonian and the one hundred and ninety nine Lorentzian causal classes of
frames of classical and relativistic space-times, respectively.

free-flying collectors coupled as (future) imaging arrays in space for
astrophysics applications are examined. The basic imaging element of these
arrays is the two-element interferometer. Accurate knowledge of two quantities
is required: the \textit{projected baseline length}, which is the distance
between the two interferometer elements projected on the plane tranverse to the
line of sight to the target; and the \textit{optical path difference}, which is
the difference in the distances from that transverse plane to the beam
combiner. ``Rules-of-thumb'' are determined for the typical accuracy required
on these parameters. The requirement on the projected baseline length is a
\textit{knowledge} requirement and depends on the angular size of the targets
of interest; it is generally at a level of half a meter for typical stellar
targets, decreasing to perhaps a few centimeters only for the widest attainable
fields of view. The requirement on the optical path difference is a
\textit{control} requirement and is much tighter, depending on the bandwidth of
the signal; it is at a level of half a wavelength for narrow (few %) signal
bands, decreasing to $\approx 0.2 \lambda$ for the broadest bandwidths expected
to be useful. Translation of these requirements into engineering requirements
on station-keeping accuracy depends on the specific details of the collector
constellation geometry. Several examples are provided to guide future
application of the criteria presented here. Some implications for the design of
such collector constellations and for the methods used to transform the
information acquired into images are discussed.
