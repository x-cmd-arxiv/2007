studied by microwave and dc resistivity and magnetoresistivity and by the dc
Hall measurements. The magnetic ordering temperature T_m is considerably
reduced with increasing Sn content. However, doping with Sn leads to only
slight reduction of the superconducting critical temperature T_c accompanied
with the increase of the upper critical field B_c2, indicating an increased
disorder in the system and a reduced scattering length of the conducting holes
in CuO2 layers. In spite of the increased scattering rate, the normal state
resistivity and the Hall resistivity are reduced with respect to the pure
compound, due to the increased number of itinerant holes in CuO2 layers, which
represent the main conductivity channel. Most of the electrons in RuO2 layers
are presumably localized, but the observed negative magnetoresistance and the
extraordinary Hall effect lead to the conclusion that there exists a small
number of itinerant electrons in RuO$_2$ layers that exhibit colossal
magnetoresistance.

us to gain an order of perturbation theory. We demonstrate the efficiency of

a Laughlin like wave function. The existence of strong correlations modify the
transport properties which show non equilibrium effects, similar to those
predicted for tunneling into other strongly correlated systems.

of the bright Seyfert 1.9 galaxy MCG-5-23-16, which is thought to have one of
the best known examples of a relativistically broadened iron K-alpha line. The
time averaged spectral analysis shows that the iron K-shell complex is best
modeled with an unresolved narrow emission component (FWHM < 5000 km/s, EW ~ 60
eV) plus a broad component. This latter component has FWHM ~ 44000 km/s and EW
~ 50 eV. Its profile is well described by an emission line originating from an
accretion disk viewed with an inclination angle ~ 40^\circ and with the
emission arising from within a few tens of gravitational radii of the central
black hole. The time-resolved spectral analysis of the XMM EPIC-pn spectrum
shows that both the narrow and broad components of the Fe K emission line
appear to be constant in time within the errors. We detected a narrow sporadic
absorption line at 7.7 keV which appears to be variable on a time-scale of 20
ksec. If associated with Fe XXVI Ly-alpha this absorption is indicative of a
possibly variable, high ionization, high velocity outflow. The variability of
this absorption feature appears to rule out a local (z=0) origin. The analysis
of the XMM RGS spectrum reveals that the soft X-ray emission of MCG-5-23-16 is
likely dominated by several emission lines superimposed on an unabsorbed
scattered power-law continuum. The lack of strong Fe L shell emission together
with the detection of a strong forbidden line in the O VII triplet is
consistent with a scenario where the soft X-ray emission lines are produced in
a plasma photoionized by the nuclear emission.

relatively recent past. The brightest shells in the central regions of the host
are distributed alternately in radius, with at least two distinct shells on one
side of the nucleus and three on the other, out to a distance of ~13 kpc. The
light within the five shells comprises ~6% of the total galaxy light. Lower
surface brightness ripples or tails and other debris extend out to a distance
of ~65 kpc. A simple N-body model for a merger reproduces the inner shell
structure and gives an estimate for the age of the merger between ~30 Myr and
~1.7 Gyr, depending on a range of reasonable assumptions. While the inner shell
structure is suggestive of a minor merger, the total light contribution from
the shells and extended structures are more indicative of a major merger. The
spectrum of the host galaxy is dominated by a population of intermediate age
(~1.4 Gyr), indicating a strong starburst episode that may have occurred at the
time of the merger event. We speculate that the current QSO activity may have
been triggered in the recent past by either a minor merger, or by debris from
an older (~Gyr) major merger that is currently ``raining'' back into the
central regions of the merger remnant.

Baseline Array) and X-ray (XMM-Newton) monitoring observations of the unusual
ultraluminous supernova SN 1978K in NGC 1313 at ~25 years after the explosion.
SN 1978K is a rare example of a Type IIn supernova that has remained bright
enough to have long-term X-ray and radio observations. The observations probe
the dense medium that was ejected by the progenitor star prior to its
explosion; the star might have been a Luminous Blue Variable. The radio imaging
shows that the source remains compact, but it may be marginally resolved. The
radio monitoring shows deviations from a smooth decay suggesting that
inhomogeneities are present in the radio emitting region. It appears that a
major change occurred in the mass-loss rate of the progenitor star shortly
before the supernova event. The X-ray emission between 2000 and 2006 is
consistent with the radiation coming from two shocks. All the X-ray data can be
fit using the same model (with no systematic evolution or short-term
variability) but this has a surprising requirement: the X-ray emitting regions
have a very large abundance of helium. This would be consistent with the X-ray
emitting shocks being located in a helium-rich layer that was ejected by the
progenitor star, or helium-rich material was ejected in the supernova
explosion. The unusual properties of the supernova motivated a search for an
associated gamma-ray burst (GRB). We show that SN 1978K was inside the ~4 sigma
error box of GRB 771029. If this association is correct, the GRB was
exceptionally underluminous. However, the quality of the gamma-ray burst
locations at that time was poor, and this is likely just a chance alignment.

hierachical heavy neutrinos, an extremely high sensitivity of the rates to

PAHs, atomic and molecular lines, and distributions of graphite and silicate

properties to aid in quantifying the strength of star-formation and accretion

from stars is capable of powering the total dust emission from NGC6240,

only in X-rays. The decomposition of Mrk1014 is consistent with ~65% of its
power emerging from an AGN and ~35% from star-formation. We suggest that many
of the variations in our template starburst SEDs may be explained in terms of
the different mean optical depths through the clouds of dust surrounding the
young stars within each galaxy. Prompted by the divergent far-IR properties of
our template AGNs, we suggest that variations in the relative orientation of
their AGN accretion disks with respect to the disks of the galaxies hosting
them may result in different amounts of AGN-heated cold dust emission emerging

the most complete in M31 and has almost the same period distribution as the

perturbation theory approach for the dark energy scalar field. We determine the
range of initial scalar field amplitudes for which perturbation theory is
accurate in describing the development of the pancakes. Notably, we find that
perturbative methods which neglect kinetic terms in the scalar field equation
of motion are not valid for arbitrarily small perturbations. We also examine
whether models that have been tuned to match the constraints of current
observations can produce new observable effects in the nonlinear structure of
pancakes. Our results suggest that a fully realistic three-dimensional
simulation will produce significant new observable features, such as
modifications to the mass function and halo radial density profile shapes, that
can be used to distinguish these models from standard concordance cosmology and
from each other.

with the interstellar magnetic field. Observations of optical polarization of
stars beyond the heliosphere nose, suggest the direction of the upwind
interstellar magnetic field is relatively constant. The polarizations of nearby
stars and offset angle between HeI and HeI flowing into the heliosphere have
position angles in galactic coordinates of 30- 40 deg, indicating a local
magnetic field direction inclined by ~55 deg and ~65 deg, respectively, with
respect to the galactic and ecliptic planes. The hot and cold poles of the
measured Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) dipole moment are nearly symmetric
around the heliosphere nose direction, and the v^{22} quadrupole vector is
directed towards the heliosphere nose. The area vectors of the CMB quadrupole
and ocotopole moments are directed towards the band perpendicular to the
ecliptic plane formed by the alternate locations for the 3 kHz emissions
detected by Voyagers 1 and 2. In the upwind direction, the position angle of
the null plane separating the CMB dipole hot and cold poles is nearly aligned
with the interstellar magnetic field direction at the Sun. Heliospheric
foreground contamination of the low-$\ell$ CMB modes now requires detailed
study.

particle diffusivity) is Sc = 1 + (Omega t_stop)^2, in terms of the particle
stopping time, t_stop, and the orbital frequency, Omega. The standard result,
Sc = 1 + t_stop/t_eddy, in terms of the eddy turnover time, t_eddy, is shown to
be incorrect. The main difference is that Sc rises quadratically, not linearly,
with stopping time. Consequently, particles larger than ~ 10 cm in
protoplanetary disks will suffer less radial diffusion and will settle closer
to the midplane. Such a layer of boulders would be more prone to gravitational
collapse. Our predictions of RMS speeds, vertical scale height and diffusion
coefficients will help interpret numerical simulations. We confirm previous
results for the vertical stirring of particles (scale heights and random
velocities), and add a correction for arbitrary ratios of eddy to orbital
times. The particle layer becomes thinner for t_eddy > 1/Omega, with the

the O VI emission region is described by a Keplerian thin disk. The Raman
scattering occurs in a neutral region near the giant, taking in the form of a
slow stellar wind, part of which is ionized by the strong UV radiation from the
hot white dwarf. Using a Monte Carlo technique, we compute the line profiles
that are modulated by the slow spherical stellar wind from the giant component

for the asymmetry and the existence of a central dip in the profiles, we add an
O VI resonance scattering region between the hot white dwarf and the giant star
which hinders the incidence of slightly blue O VI photons upon the H I region.
Overall good fits to the observed data are obtained from our model, which lends
support to the accretion disk emission model in these objects. The best fitting
parameters for V1016 Cyg are $v_o=30{\rm km s^{-1}}$,
  $v_\infty=11{\rm km s^{-1}}$, and $v_{c}=10{\rm km s^{-1}}$, where $v_o$,

the inspiral and merger of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at z <~ 5 with
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of hundreds to thousands. Because of these high
SNRs, and because these SNRs accrete over periods of weeks to months, it should
be possible to extract the physical parameters of these systems with high
accuracy; for instance, for a ~ 10^6 Msun MBHBs at z = 1 it should be possible
to determine the two masses to ~ 0.1% and the sky location to ~ 1 degree.
However, those are just the errors due to noise: there will be additional
""theoretical"" errors due to inaccuracies in our best model waveforms, which are
still only approximate. The goal of this paper is to estimate the typical
magnitude of these theoretical errors. We develop mathematical tools for this
purpose, and apply them to a somewhat simplified version of the MBHB problem,
in which we consider just the inspiral part of the waveform and neglect
spin-induced precession, eccentricity, and PN amplitude corrections. For this
simplified version, we estimate that theoretical uncertainties in sky position
will typically be ~ 1 degree, i.e., comparable to the statistical uncertainty.
For the mass and spin parameters, our results suggest that while theoretical
errors will be rather small absolutely, they could still dominate over
statistical errors (by roughly an order of magnitude) for the strongest
sources. The tools developed here should be useful for estimating the magnitude
of theoretical errors in many other problems in gravitational-wave astronomy.

in extended systems are derived using quantum-classical ensembles within the
Non-Equilibrium Statistical Operator Method (NESOM). Ions are treated
classically, while their electrons quantum mechanically; however, the
statistical operator is not factorised in any way and no simplifying
assumptions are made concerning the electronic subsystem. Using this method, we
derive kinetic equations of motion for the classical degrees of freedom (atoms)
which account fully for the interaction and energy exchange with the quantum
variables (electrons). Our equations, alongside the usual Newtonian-like terms
normally associated with the Ehrenfest dynamics, contain additional terms,
proportional to the atoms velocities, which can be associated with the
electronic friction. Possible ways of calculating the friction forces which are
shown to be given via complicated non-equilibrium correlation functions, are
discussed. In particular, we demonstrate that the correlation functions are
directly related to the thermodynamic Matsubara Green's functions, and this
relationship allows for the diagrammatic methods to be used in treating
electron-electron interaction perturbatively when calculating the correlation
functions. This work also generalises previous attempts, mostly based on model
systems, of introducing the electronic friction into Molecular Dynamics
equations of atoms.

collisions and vanishing pseudo-rapidity these experiments exhibit suppression
in charged meson production, especially at medium to large transverse momenta.
In the PHENIX experiment similar behavior has been reported for $\pi^0$
spectra.
  In a recent work on the simpler D+Au interaction, to be considered perhaps as
a tune-up for Au+Au, we reported on a pre-hadronic cascade mechanism which
explains the mixed observation of moderately reduced $p_\perp$ suppression at
higher pseudo-rapidity as well as the Cronin enhancement at mid-rapidity. Here
we present the extension of this work to the more massive ion-ion collisions.
  Our major thesis is that much of the suppression is generated in a late stage
cascade of colourless pre-hadrons produced after an initial short-lived
coloured phase. We present a pQCD argument to justify this approach and to
estimate the time duration $\tau_p$ of this initial phase. Of essential
importance is the brevity in time of the coloured phase existence relative to
that of the strongly interacting pre-hadron phase. The split into two phases is
of course not sharp in time, but adequate for treating the suppression of
moderate and high $p_\perp$ mesons.

electron system on a finite wire, partially depleted at the center by a smooth
potential barrier. A uniform one-Tesla Zeeman field is applied throughout the
system. We find that with the increase in the potential barrier, the low
density electrons under it go from a non-magnetic state to an antiferromagnetic
state, and then to a state with a well-localized spin-aligned region isolated
by two antiferromagnetic regions from the high density leads. At this final
stage, in response to a continuously increasing barrier potential, the system
undergoes a series of abrupt density changes, corresponding to the successive
expulsion of a single electron from the spin-aligned region under the barrier.
Motivated by the recent momentum-resolved tunneling experiments in a parallel
wire geometry, we also compute the momentum resolved tunneling matrix elements.
Our calculations suggest that the eigenstates being expelled are spatially
localized, consistent with the experimental observations. However, additional
mechanisms are needed to account for the experimentally observed large spectral
weight at near $k=0$ in the tunneling matrix elements.

distinguishes three metallicity classes (dwarfs - dM, subdwarfs - sdM, and

based on the relative strength of prominent CaH and TiO molecular absorption
bands near 7000A, as quantified by three spectroscopic indices (CaH2, CaH3, and
TiO5). We re-examine this classification system in light of our ongoing
spectroscopic survey of stars with proper motion \mu > 0.45 ""/yr, which has
increased the census of spectroscopically identified metal-poor M stars to over
400 objects. Kinematic separation of disk dwarfs and halo subdwarfs suggest
deficiencies in the current classification system. Observations of common
proper motion doubles indicates that the current dM/sdM and sdM/esdM boundaries
in the [TiO5,CaH2+CaH3] index plane do not follow iso-metallicity contours,
leaving some binaries inappropriately classified as dM+sdM or sdM+esdM. We
propose a revision of the classification system based on an empirical
calibration of the TiO/CaH ratio for stars of near solar metallicity. We
introduce the parameter \zeta_{TiO/CaH} which quantifies the weakening of the
TiO bandstrength due to metallicity effect, with values ranging from
\zeta_{TiO/CaH}=1 for stars of near-solar metallicity to \zeta_{TiO/CaH}~0 for
the most metal-poor (and TiO depleted) subdwarfs. We redefine the metallicity
classes based on the value of the parameter \zeta_{TiO/CaH}; and refine the

  astrophysics","5 pages 1 figure",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Assuming a spherical symmetry, the extreme UV emitted by a very hot source
ionizes low pressure molecular hydrogen making a transparent bubble of H II
(Protons and electrons). For an increase of radius, intensity of extreme UV and
temperature decrease, so that the plasma contains more and more atoms. A
spherical shell, mainly of neutral atoms (H I) appears. If this shell is
optically thick at Lyman frequencies of H I, it is superradiant and a
competition of modes selects modes tangent to a sphere for which many atoms are
excited. Thus, a shell of plasma emits, into a given direction, tangential rays
showing a ring in which selected modes are brighter. While at Lyman
frequencies, absorption of rays emitted by the source excites the atoms able to
amplify the superradiance, a more powerful amplification of superradiance
results from an induced scattering of the radial beams, which extends to feet
of lines and progressively to the whole spectrum. Thermodynamics says that the
brightness of radial and tangential beams tends to be equal; if the solid angle
of observation is much larger for the ring than for the source, almost the
whole light emitted by the source is transferred to the rings, and the source
becomes invisible. Paradoxically, a glow due to incoherent scattering and
impurities around the source remains visible. As the scattering decreases with
the decrease of the radial intensity, the brightness of the ring decreases with
radius. These characteristics are found in supernova remnant 1987A.

p-PCR5 is able of maintaining multiple hypotheses/modes after fusion, when the

interactions between stars, and physical collisions between stars may occur
quite frequently. Simulating a stellar collision event can be an intensive
numerical task, as detailed calculations of this process require hydrodynamic
simulations in three dimensions. We present a computationally inexpensive
method in which we approximate the merger process, including shock heating,
hydrodynamic mixing and mass loss, with a simple algorithm based on
conservation laws and a basic qualitative understanding of the hydrodynamics of
stellar mergers. The algorithm relies on Archimedes' principle to dictate the
distribution of the fluid in the stable equilibrium situation. We calibrate and
apply the method to mergers of massive stars, as these are expected to occur in
young and dense star clusters. We find that without the effects of microscopic
mixing, the temperature and chemical composition profiles in a collision
product can become double-valued functions of enclosed mass. Such an unphysical
situation is mended by simulating microscopic mixing as a post-collision
effect. In this way we find that head-on collisions between stars of the same
spectral type result in substantial mixing, while mergers between stars of
different spectral type, such as type B and O stars ($\sim$10 and $\sim$40\msun
respectively), are subject to relatively little hydrodynamic mixing.

""Surface-Attached Globule"" (SAG) conjectured previously to exist in lattice
models of three-dimensional polymers when they are attached to a wall that has
a short range potential. The bulk phase, where the attractive intra-polymer
interactions are strong enough to cause a collapse of the polymer into a
liquid-like globule and the wall either has weak attractive or repulsive
interactions, is usually denoted Desorbed-Collapsed or DC. Recently this DC
phase was conjectured to harbour two surface phases separated by a boundary
where the bulk free energy is analytic while the surface free energy is
singular. The surface phase for more attractive values of the wall interaction
is the SAG phase. We discuss more fully the properties of this proposed surface
phase and provide Monte Carlo evidence for self-avoiding walks up to length 256
that this surface phase most likely does exist. Importantly, we discuss
alternatives for the surface phase boundary. In particular, we conclude that
this boundary may lie along the zero wall interaction line and the bulk phase
boundaries rather than any new phase boundary curve.

  Nanoscience, in press",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  Current experimental and theoretical studies on the effect of intermolecular
interactions on molecular conduction appear to be in conflict with each other.
In particular, some experimental results, e.g., the observation of
2-dimensional free-particle character for interface bound electrons indicate
strong intermolecular interactions while other observations indicate an
additive character of conduction properties. In this paper we use a generic
tight binding model with a physically motivated choice of parameters in order
to examine this issue. The model encompasses direct intermolecular interactions
as well as through-metal interactions and can be solved exactly to yield
spectral properties (surface density of states) and transport characteristics
(transmission coefficients and current-voltage behaviors) for single molecule
junctions, molecular islands and molecular layers. We find linear scaling of
conduction properties with the number of conducting molecules in junctions
characterized by molecular layers when the probe (STM tip) addresses different
numbers of molecules; however, the conduction per molecule can differ
significantly from that of an isolated single molecule. When a junction
involves finite molecular islands of varying sizes, linear scaling sets in only
beyond a certain molecular island size, of the order of a few tens of
molecules. Implications for current observation of linear scaling behaviors are
discussed.

time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) to evaluate the electronic absorption spectra.
Total-energy differences enabled us to evaluate the electron affinities and
first and second ionisation energies, the quasiparticle correction to the
HOMO-LUMO energy gap and an estimate of the excitonic effects in the neutral
molecules. Electronic absorption spectra have been computed by combining two
different implementations of TD-DFT: the frequency-space method to study
general trends as a function of charge-state and molecular size for the
lowest-lying in-plane long-polarised and short-polarised $\pi\to\pi^\star$
electronic transitions, and the real-time propagation scheme to obtain the
whole photo-absorption cross-section up to the far-UV. Doubly-ionised PAHs are

in the near-IR, visible, and near-UV spectral ranges, like their singly-charged
counterparts. While, as expected, the broad plasmon-like structure with its
maximum at about 17-18 eV is relatively insensitive to the charge-state of the
molecule, a systematic decrease with increasing positive charge of the
absorption cross-section between about 6 and about 12 eV is observed for each

metric cones with reducible holonomy over pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. First we
describe the local structure of the base of the cone when the holonomy of the
cone is decomposable. For instance, we find that the holonomy algebra of the
base is always the full pseudo-orthogonal Lie algebra. One of the global
results is that a cone over a compact and complete pseudo-Riemannian manifold
is either flat or has indecomposable holonomy. Then we analyse the case when
the cone has indecomposable but reducible holonomy, which means that it admits
a parallel isotropic distribution. This analysis is carried out, first in the
case where the cone admits two complementary distributions and, second for
Lorentzian cones. We show that the first case occurs precisely when the local
geometry of the base manifold is para-Sasakian and that of the cone is
para-K\""ahlerian. For Lorentzian cones we get a complete description of the
possible (local) holonomy algebras in terms of the metric of the base manifold.

and the renormalization of this term is presented. This corresponds to a non

Then a non-local term associated with an interaction pair potential is
introduced in the Hamiltonian. It has been shown that there exists a mapping
between this approach and the standard statistical mechanics given in terms of

appealing for this purpose, since electric fields are easy to generate locally
on-chip. We experimentally realize coherent control of a single electron spin
in a quantum dot using an oscillating electric field generated by a local gate.
The electric field induces coherent transitions (Rabi oscillations) between
spin-up and spin-down with pi/2 rotations as fast as ~55ns. Our analysis
indicates that the electrically-induced spin transitions are mediated by the
spin-orbit interaction. Taken together with the recently demonstrated coherent
exchange of two neighboring spins, our results demonstrate the feasibility of
fully electrical manipulation of spin qubits.

  figures",,"10.1109/TSP.2008.927074",,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  In many channel measurement applications, one needs to estimate some
characteristics of the channels based on a limited set of measurements. This is
mainly due to the highly time varying characteristics of the channel. In this
contribution, it will be shown how free probability can be used for channel
capacity estimation in MIMO systems. Free probability has already been applied
in various application fields such as digital communications, nuclear physics
and mathematical finance, and has been shown to be an invaluable tool for
describing the asymptotic behaviour of many large-dimensional systems. In
particular, using the concept of free deconvolution, we provide an
asymptotically (w.r.t. the number of observations) unbiased capacity estimator
for MIMO channels impaired with noise called the free probability based
estimator. Another estimator, called the Gaussian matrix mean based estimator,
is also introduced by slightly modifying the free probability based estimator.
This estimator is shown to give unbiased estimation of the moments of the
channel matrix for any number of observations. Also, the estimator has this
property when we extend to MIMO channels with phase off-set and frequency
drift, for which no estimator has been provided so far in the literature. It is
also shown that both the free probability based and the Gaussian matrix mean
based estimator are asymptotically unbiased capacity estimators as the number
of transmit antennas go to infinity, regardless of whether phase off-set and
frequency drift are present. The limitations in the two estimators are also
explained. Simulations are run to assess the performance of the estimators for
a low number of antennas and samples to confirm the usefulness of the
asymptotic results.
