unitarity limit. The unitarity limit is characterized by a divergent scattering
length between the atoms, and it has been argued that this will result in a
very small viscosity. We show that in the low temperature T limit the shear
viscosity scales as xi^5/T^5, where the universal parameter 'xi' relates the
chemical potential and the Fermi energy, mu=xi E_F. Combined with the high
temperature expansions of the viscosity our results suggest that the viscosity
has a minimum near the critical temperature T_c. A naive extrapolation
indicates that the minimum value of the ratio of viscosity over entropy density
is within a factor of ~ 5 of the proposed lower bound hbar/(4\pi k_B).

quantum nature of electrons in atoms. Although the evidence for this claim is
weak, many have accepted it. This claim has implications for how to present
atoms in classes ranging from elementary school to graduate school. We present
results from a study designed to test this claim by developing a curriculum on
models of the atom, including the Bohr and Schrodinger models. We examine
student descriptions of atoms on final exams in transformed modern physics
classes using various versions of this curriculum. We find that if the
curriculum does not include sufficient connections between different models,
many students still have a Bohr-like view of atoms, rather than a more accurate
Schrodinger model. However, with an improved curriculum designed to develop
model-building skills and with better integration between different models, it
is possible to get most students to describe atoms using the Schrodinger model.
In comparing our results with previous research, we find that comparing and
contrasting different models is a key feature of a curriculum that helps
students move beyond the Bohr model and adopt Schrodinger's view of the atom.
We find that understanding the reasons for the development of models is much
more difficult for students than understanding the features of the models. We
also present interactive computer simulations designed to help students build
models of the atom more effectively.

process that maintains the balance between life and death in cells. The precise
molecular mechanism of apoptosis signaling and how these two pathways are
differentially activated under distinct apoptotic stimuli is poorly understood.
We developed a Monte Carlo-based stochastic simulation model that can
characterize distinct signaling behaviors in the two major pathways of
apoptotic signaling using a novel probability distribution-based approach.
Specifically, we show that for a weak death signal, such as low levels of death
ligand Fas (CD95) binding or under stress conditions, the type 2 mitochondrial
pathway dominates apoptotic signaling. Our results also show signaling in the
type 2 pathway is stochastic, where the population average over many cells does
not capture the cell-to-cell fluctuations in the time course (~1 - 10 hours) of
downstream caspase-3 activation. On the contrary, the probability distribution
of caspase-3 activation for the mitochondrial pathway shows a distinct bimodal
behavior that can be used to characterize the stochastic signaling in type 2
apoptosis. Interestingly, such stochastic fluctuations in apoptosis signaling
happen even in the presence of large numbers of signaling molecules. In a
fluctuating environment, such stochasticity in the timecourse of caspase-3
activation may be an adaptive mechanism for allowing a competing survival
signal to win over a weak death trigger before the critical cell fate decision
is made and thus minimizes the risk of pathologies.

large speeds but in opposite direction. Sigma-Prime itself observes only a

nearest neighbor Ising interaction (KLS model). Earlier studies based on an
approximate mapping of the present system to an effective zero-range process
concluded that the exponents characterising the decays of several static and
dynamical correlation functions of the probes depend continuously on the
strength of the Ising interaction. On the contrary, our numerical simulations
indicate that over a substantial range of the interaction strength, these
exponents remain constant and their values are the same as in the case of no
interaction (when the medium executes an ASEP). We demonstrate this by
numerical studies of several dynamical correlation functions for two probes and
also for a macroscopic number of probes. Our results are consistent with the
expectation that the short-ranged correlations induced by the Ising interaction
should not affect the large time and large distance properties of the system,
implying that scaling forms remain the same as in the medium with no
interactions present.

five z ~ 6 quasars. These are amongst the most distant, currently known quasars
in the universe. The spectra have been obtained using ISAAC at the VLT and
include the CIV, MgII and FeII lines. We measure the FeII/MgII line ratio, as
an observational proxy for the Fe/alpha element ratio. We derive a ratio of
2.7+/-0.8 for our sample, which is similar to that found for lower redshift
quasars, i.e., we provide additional evidence for the lack of evolution in the
FeII/MgII line ratio of quasars up to the highest redshifts. This result
demonstrates that the sample quasars must have undergone a major episode of
iron enrichment in less than one Gyr and star formation must have commenced at
z > 8. The linewidths of the MgII and CIV lines give two estimates for the
black hole masses. A third estimate is given by assuming that the quasars emit
at their Eddington luminosity. The derived masses using these three methods
agree well, implying that the quasars are not likely to be strongly lensed. We
derive central black hole masses of 0.3-5.2 10^9 solar masses. We use the
difference between the redshift of MgII (a proxy for the systemic redshift of
the quasar) and the onset of the Gunn Peterson trough to derive the extent of
the ionized Stromgren spheres around our target quasars. The derived physical
radii are about five Mpc. Using a simple ionization model, the emission of the
central quasars would need of order 10^6-10^8 year to create these cavities in
a surrounding intergalactic medium with a neutral fraction between 0.1 and 1.0.
As the e-folding time scale for the central accreting black hole is on the
order of a few times 10^7 year, it can grow by one e-folding or less within
this time span.

agencies. In this context, both data collection on sexual contact networks and
the modeling of disease spreading, are intensively contributing to the search
for effective immunization policies. Here, the spreading of sexually
transmitted diseases on bipartite scale-free graphs, representing heterosexual
contact networks, is considered. We analytically derive the expression for the
epidemic threshold and its dependence with the system size in finite
populations. We show that the epidemic outbreak in bipartite populations, with
number of sexual partners distributed as in empirical observations from
national sex surveys, takes place for larger spreading rates than for the case
in which the bipartite nature of the network is not taken into account.
Numerical simulations confirm the validity of the theoretical results. Our
findings indicate that the restriction to crossed infections between the two
classes of individuals (males and females) has to be taken into account in the
design of efficient immunization strategies for sexually transmitted diseases.

we use high-resolution simulations of a sample of galaxy clusters spanning a

cosmic ray physics on top of the radiative hydrodynamics. Calibrating the
magnetic fields of our model with Faraday rotation measurements (RM), the
synchrotron emission of our relativistic electron populations matches the radio
synchrotron luminosities and morphologies of observed giant radio halos and
mini-halos surprisingly well. Using the complete sample of the brightest X-ray
clusters observed by ROSAT in combination with our gamma-ray scaling relation,
we predict GLAST will detect about ten clusters allowing for Eddington bias due
to the scatter in the scaling relation. The brightest gamma-ray clusters are
Ophiuchus, Fornax, Coma, A3627, Perseus, and Centaurus. We provide an absolute
lower flux limit for the gamma-ray emission of Coma in the hadronic model which
can be made tighter for magnetic field values derived from RM values to match
the GLAST sensitivity, providing thus a unique test for the possible hadronic
origin of radio halos. Our predicted hard X-ray emission, due to inverse
Compton emission of shock accelerated and hadronically produced relativistic
electrons, falls short of the detections in Coma and Perseus by a factor of 50.

known discrepancy of magnetic field estimates from Faraday RM values and those
obtained by combining synchrotron and inverse Compton emission. [abridged]

Lick indices to characterise the absorption spectra. We define a subset of
galaxies with very low emission contamination, and fit the index-sigma

from single-burst stellar population models, we infer the scaling relations of
age, total metallicity, [Z/H], and alpha-element abundance ratio, [a/Fe]. To
reproduce the observed index-sigma slopes, all three parameters must increase
with increasing velocity dispersion. Specifically, we recover: Age \propto

sigma^0.23+/-0.06 (error reflects systematic effects), derived over a decade

can discriminate between these models because the column densities should
depend on location in the sky, either relative to the Galaxy bulge or to the
M31-Milky Way axis. To search for these signatures, we measured the OVII Kalpha
absorption line strength toward 25 bright AGNs, plus LMC X-3, using XMM-Newton
RGS archival data. The data are in conflict with a purely Local Group model,
but support the Galactic Halo model. The strongest correlation is between the
OVII equivalent widths and the ROSAT background emission measurement in the R45
band (0.4-1 keV), for which OVII emission makes the largest single
contribution. This suggests that much of the OVII emission and absorption are
cospatial, from which the radius of a uniform halo appears to lie the range
15-110 kpc. The present data do not constrain the type of halo gas model and an
equally good fit is obtained in a model where the gas density decreases as a
power-law, such as r^(-3/2). For a uniform halo with a radius of 20 kpc, the
electron density would be 9E-4 cm^(-3), and the gas mass is 4E8 Msolar. The

first objective is to reach a deep degree of starlight cancelation in the range
6 -- 20 microns, in order to observe and to characterize the signal from an
Earth-like planet. Among the numerous technological challenges involved in
these missions, the question of the beam combination and wavefront filtering
has an important place. A single-mode integrated optics (IO) beam combiner
could support both the functions of filtering and the interferometric
combination, simplifying the instrumental design. Such a perspective has been
explored in this work within the project Integrated Optics for Darwin (IODA),
which aims at developing a first IO combiner in the mid-infrared. The solutions
reviewed here to manufacture the combiner are based on infrared dielectric
materials on one side, and on metallic conductive waveguides on the other side.
With this work, additional inputs are offered to pursue the investigation on
mid-infrared photonics devices.

structure formation proceeded as a result of dissipative processes. In
contrast, non-equilibrium distributions of cosmic rays (CR) preserve the
information about their injection and transport processes and provide thus a
unique window of current and past structure formation processes. This
information can be unveiled by observations of non-thermal radiative processes,
including radio synchrotron, hard X-ray, and gamma-ray emission. To explore
this, we use high-resolution simulations of a sample of galaxy clusters
spanning a mass range of about two orders of magnitudes, and follow
self-consistent CR physics on top of the radiative hydrodynamics. We model CR
electrons that are accelerated at cosmological structure formation shocks and
those that are produced in hadronic interactions of CRs with ambient gas
protons. We find that CR protons trace the time integrated non-equilibrium
activities of clusters while shock-accelerated CR electrons probe current
accretion and merging shock waves. The resulting inhomogeneous synchrotron
emission matches the properties of observed radio relics. We propose a unified
model for the generation of radio halos. Giant radio halos are dominated in the
centre by secondary synchrotron emission with a transition to the synchrotron
radiation emitted from shock-accelerated electrons in the cluster periphery.
This model is able to explain the observed correlation of mergers with radio
halos, the larger peripheral variation of the spectral index, and the large
scatter in the scaling relation between cluster mass and synchrotron emission.
Future low-frequency radio telescopes (LOFAR, GMRT, MWA, LWA) are expected to
probe the accretion shocks of clusters. [abridged]

material. We use dynamical simulations of terrestrial planet formation from
planetary embryos and simple scaling arguments to explore the implications of
correlations between terrestrial planet mass, disk mass, and the mass of the
parent star. We assume that the protoplanetary disk mass scales with stellar
mass as Mdisk ~ f Mstar^h, where f measures the relative disk mass, and 1/2 < h
< 2, so that disk mass decreases with decreasing stellar mass. We consider
systems without Jovian planets, based on current models and observations for M
stars. We assume the mass of a planet formed in some annulus of a disk with
given parameters is proportional to the disk mass in that annulus, and show
with a suite of simulations of late-stage accretion that the adopted
prescription is surprisingly accurate. Our results suggest that the fraction of
systems with sufficient disk mass to form > 0.3 Earth mass habitable planets
decreases for low-mass stars for every realistic combination of parameters.
This ""habitable fraction"" is small for stellar masses below a mass in the
interval 0.5 to 0.8 Solar masses, depending on disk parameters, an interval
that excludes most M stars. Radial mixing and therefore water delivery are
inefficient in lower-mass disks commonly found around low-mass stars, such that

laser-cool mechanical devices but have not yet reached the quantum regime. The
outstanding technical challenge in this field is integrating sensitive
micromechanical elements (which must be small, light, and flexible) into high
finesse cavities (which are typically much more rigid and massive) without
compromising the mechanical or optical properties of either. A second, and more
fundamental, challenge is to read out the mechanical element's quantum state:
displacement measurements (no matter how sensitive) cannot determine the energy
eigenstate of an oscillator, and measurements which couple to quantities other
than displacement have been difficult to realize. Here we present a novel
optomechanical system which seems to resolve both these challenges. We
demonstrate a cavity which is detuned by the motion of a thin dielectric
membrane placed between two macroscopic, rigid, high-finesse mirrors. This
approach segregates optical and mechanical functionality to physically distinct
structures and avoids compromising either. It also allows for direct
measurement of the square of the membrane's displacement, and thus in principle
the membrane's energy eigenstate. We estimate it should be practical to use
this scheme to observe quantum jumps of a mechanical system.

obtained optical images of I19134 with the HST to locate the bipolar reflection
nebula in this source for the first time. The spatio-kinematical structure of
the H2O masers indicates the existence of a fast, collimated (precessing) flow
having a projected extent of ~140 mas and an expansion rate of ~1.9 mas/yr on
the sky plane, which gives a dynamical age of only ~40 yr. The two detected
optical lobes are also separated by ~150 mas in almost the same direction as
that of the collimated flow. The good agreement between the extent and
orientation of the H2O maser outflow and optical lobes suggests that the lobes
have been recently formed along the collimated fast flow. The positions of all
of the detected maser features have been measured with respect to the reference
source J1925+2106 over one year. Therefore we analyzed maser feature motions
that consist of the combination of an annual parallax, a secular motion
following Galactic rotation, and the intrinsic motions within the flow. We
obtain an annual-parallax distance to I19134 of D~8 kpc kpc and estimate its
location in the Galaxy to be (R, theta, z)=(7.4 kpc, 62 deg, 0.65 kpc). From

$(D_{ds}/D_{s})^{\rm{other}}$ in this paper. It has been known that there is
lens model degeneracy in using strong gravitational lensing. Thus, we
investigate the model independent observable quantity, Einstein radius
($\theta_E$), which is proportional to both $D_{ds}/D_s$ and velocity
dispersion squared, $\sigma_v^2$. $D_{ds}/D_s$ values depend on the parameters
of each dark energy model individually. However, $(D_{ds}/D_s)^{\Lambda} -
(D_{ds}/D_{s})^{\rm{other}}$ for the various dark energy models, is well within
the error of $\sigma_v$ for most of the parameter spaces of the dark energy
models. Thus, a single strong gravitational lensing by use of the Einstein

However, better understanding to the mass profile of clusters in the future or

proof of this comparison which is simpler, in the sense that it does not use
Saito equivalence. Moreover, our alternative strategy of comparison works in a
context which is a precursor to the Gauss-Manin connection (at the level of
$f^{-1}\cD_Y$-modules, for a morphism $f:X\to Y$), and may be of some intrinsic
interest.

$T^*$ and the pair condensation temperature $T_c$ and must be accommodated by
modifying the fermionic excitation spectrum. This distinction has been omitted
from all other many body approaches in the literature. We show how enforcing
this corollary implies that pairing fluctuation contributions enter into both
the gap and the number equations; this is necessary in order to be consistent
with a generalized Ward identity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we obtain
physical results for the superfluid density $n_s(T)$ at all $T$. In contrast,
previous work in the literature has led to ill-behaved $n_s(T)$. The superfluid
density is a critical measure of the physicality of a given crossover theory.
In order to properly address thermodynamic properties of a trapped Fermi gas,
it is necessary to demonstrate that the particle density profiles are
consistent with experiment. The lack of demonstrable consistency between
theoretical and experimental density profiles, along with problematic behavior
found for $n_s(T)$, casts doubt on previous claims in the literature concerning
quantitative agreement between thermodynamical calculations and experiment.

more than half a century. Recently, a new mode of oscillations, characterized
by periodical plasma motions along the filament axis, was discovered. We
analyze such an event, recorded on 23 January 2002 in Big Bear Solar
Observatory H$\alpha$ filtergrams, in order to infer the triggering mechanism
and the nature of the restoring force. Motion along the filament axis of a
distinct buldge-like feature was traced, to quantify the kinematics of the
oscillatory motion. The data were fitted by a damped sine function, to estimate
the basic parameters of the oscillations. In order to identify the triggering
mechanism, morphological changes in the vicinity of the filament were analyzed.
The observed oscillations of the plasma along the filament was characterized by
an initial displacement of 24 Mm, initial velocity amplitude of 51 km/s, period
of 50 min, and damping time of 115 min. We interpret the trigger in terms of
poloidal magnetic flux injection by magnetic reconnection at one of the
filament legs. The restoring force is caused by the magnetic pressure gradient
along the filament axis. The period of oscillations, derived from the
linearized equation of motion (harmonic oscillator) can be expressed as
$P=\pi\sqrt{2}L/v_{A\phi}\approx4.4L/v_{A\phi}$, where $v_{A\phi}
=B_{\phi0}/\sqrt{\mu_0\rho}$ represents the Alfv\'en speed based on the
equilibrium poloidal field $B_{\phi0}$. Combination of our measurements with
some previous observations of the same kind of oscillations shows a good
agreement with the proposed interpretation.

the UVES spectrograph during two consecutive observing nights (time resolution
of ~12 min) and the Magellan Clay telescope with the MIKE spectrograph.
Combined with previously published results, these data allow us to investigate
changes in the emission line spectrum of 2M1207 on timescales of hours to
years. Most of the emission line profiles of 2M1207 are broad, in particular
that of Halpha, indicating that the dominant fraction of the emission must be
attributed to disk accretion rather than to magnetic activity. From the Halpha
10% width we deduce a relatively stable accretion rate between
10^(-10.1...-9.8) Msun/yr for two nights of consecutive observations.
Therefore, either the accretion stream is nearly homogeneous over (sub-)stellar
longitude or the system is seen face-on. Small but significant variations are
evident throughout our near-continuous observation, and they reach a maximum
after ~8 h, roughly the timescale on which maximum variability is expected
across the rotation cycle. Together with past measurements, we confirm that the
accretion rate of 2M1207 varies by more than one order of magnitude on
timescales of months to years. Such variable mass accretion yields a plausible
explanation for the observed spread in the accretion rate vs. mass diagram. The
magnetic field required to drive the funnel flow is on the order of a few
hundred G. Despite the obvious presence of a magnetic field, no radio nor X-ray
emission has been reported for 2M1207. Possibly strong accretion suppresses
magnetic activity in brown dwarfs, similar to the findings for higher mass T
Tauri stars.

caused by a coupling of the electronic system to a phononic mode at least in

combines the DGLAP evolution equations and Standard Fits for the initial parton

there are not theoretical grounds to exploit them at small x. In practice,
extrapolation of DGLAP into the region of large Q^2 and small x is done with
complementing DGLAP with special, singular (~x^{-a}) phenomenological fits for
the initial parton densities. The factors x^{-a} are wrongly believed to be of
the non-perturbative origin. Actually, they mimic the resummation of logs of x
and should be expelled from the fits when the resummation is accounted for.
Contrary to SA, the resummaton of logarithms of x is a straightforward and
natural way to describe g_1 in the small-x region. This approach can be used at
both large and small Q^2 where DGLAP cannot be used by definition. Confronting
this approach and SA demonstrates that the singular initial parton densities
and the power Q^2-corrections (or at least a sizable part of them) are rather
not real physical phenomena but the artefacts caused by extrapolating DGLAP
into the small-x region.

formulation is presented for flows of an ideal fluid. The fluid is defined
thermodynamically by mass density and entropy density, and its flow fields are
characterized by symmetries of translation and rotation. A structure of
rotation symmetry is equipped with a Lagrangian $\Lambda_A$ including
vorticity, in addition to Lagrangians of translation symmetry. From the action
principle, Euler's equation of motion is derived. In addition, the equations of
continuity and entropy are derived from the variations. Equations of conserved
currents are deduced as the Noether theorem in the space of Lagrangian
coordinate $\ba$. It is shown that, with the translation symmetry alone, there
is freedom in the transformation between the Lagrangian $\ba$-space and
Eulerian $\bx$-space. The Lagrangian $\Lambda_A$ provides non-trivial topology
of vorticity field and yields a source term of the helicity. The vorticity
equation is derived as an equation of the gauge field. Present formulation
provides a basis on which the transformation between the $\ba$ space and the

relativistic magnetised wind in which the matter energy flux is negligible
compared to the Poynting flux. Near the equatorial plane of an obliquely
rotating pulsar magnetosphere, the magnetic field reverses polarity with the
pulsar period, forming a wind with oppositely directed field lines. This
structure is called a striped wind; dissipation of alternating fields in the
striped wind is the object of our study.
  The aim of this paper is to study the conditions required for magnetic energy
release at the termination shock of the striped pulsar wind. Magnetic
reconnection is considered via analytical methods and 1D relativistic PIC
simulations.
  An analytical condition on the upstream parameters for partial and full
magnetic reconnection is derived from the conservation laws of energy, momentum
and particle number density across the relativistic shock. Furthermore, by
using a 1D relativistic PIC code, we study in detail the reconnection process
at the termination shock.
  We found a very simple criterion for dissipation of alternating fields at the
termination shock, depending on the upstream parameters of the flow. 1D
relativistic PIC simulations are in agreement with our criterion.
  Thus, alternating magnetic fields annihilate easily at relativistic highly
magnetised shocks.

These objects are rapid rotators and are believed to shelter large magnetic
fields. We suggest that reduced convective efficiency, due to fast rotation and
large field strengths, and/or to magnetic spot coverage of the radiating
surface significantly affect their evolution, leading to a reduced heat flux
and thus larger radii and cooler effective temperatures than for regular
objects. We have considered such processes in our evolutionary calculations,
using a phenomenological approach. This yields mass-radius and effective
temperature-radius relationships in agreement with the observations. We also
reproduce the effective temperature ratio and the radii of the two components
of the recently discovered puzzling eclipsing brown dwarf system. These
calculations show that fast rotation and/or magnetic activity may significantly
affect the evolution of eclipsing binaries and that the mechanical and thermal
properties of these objects depart from the ones of non-active low-mass
objects. We find that, for internal field strengths compatible with the
observed surface value of a few kiloGauss, convection can be severely
inhibited. The onset of a central radiative zone for rapidly rotating active
low-mass stars might thus occur below the usual $\sim 0.35 \msol$ limit.

spheres are studied. The four samples are assembled with different preparation
procedures, two of which aim to reproduce experimental compaction by vibration
and lubrication. The mechanical properties of the samples are found to change
with the preparation history, and to depend much more on coordination number
than on density.
  Secondly, the fluctuations in the particle displacements from the average
strain are analysed, and the way they affect the macroscopic behavior analyzed.
It is found that only the average over equally oriented contacts of the
relative displacement these fluctuations induce is relevant at the macroscopic
scale. This average depends on coordination number, average geometry of the
contact network and average contact stiffness. As far as the separate
contributions from particle displacements and rotations are concerned, the
former is found to counteract the average strain along the contact normal,
while the latter do in the tangential plane. Conversely, the tangential
components of the center displacements mainly arise to enforce local
equilibrium, and have a small, and generally stiffening effect at the
macro-scale.
  Finally, the fluctuations and the shear modulus that result from two
approaches available in the literature are estimated numerically. These
approaches are both based on the equilibrium of a small-sized representative
assembly. The improvement of these estimate with respect to the average strain
assumption indicates that the fluctuations relevant to the macroscopic behavior
occur with short correlation length.

of the overlay generated by BitTorrent. We start by analyzing how the overlay
properties impact the efficiency of BitTorrent. We focus on the average peer
set size (i.e., average number of neighbors), the time for a peer to reach its
maximum peer set size, and the diameter of the overlay. In particular, we show
that the later a peer arrives in a torrent, the longer it takes to reach its
maximum peer set size. Then, we evaluate the impact of the maximum peer set
size, the maximum number of outgoing connections per peer, and the number of
NATed peers on the overlay properties. We show that BitTorrent generates a
robust overlay, but that this overlay is not a random graph. In particular, the
connectivity of a peer to its neighbors depends on its arriving order in the
torrent. We also show that a large number of NATed peers significantly
compromise the robustness of the overlay to attacks. Finally, we evaluate the
impact of peer exchange on the overlay properties, and we show that it
generates a chain-like overlay with a large diameter, which will adversely
impact the efficiency of large torrents.

at random on the surface of a sphere. The growth mechanism we use adds edges to
the network depending on strictly local gain and cost criteria. Only nodes that
are not too far apart on the sphere may be considered for being joined by an
edge. Given two such nodes, the joining occurs only if the gain of doing it
surpasses the cost. Our model is based on a multiplicative parameter lambda
that regulates, in a function of node degrees, the maximum geodesic distance
that is allowed between nodes for them to be considered for joining. For n
nodes distributed uniformly on the sphere, and for lambda*sqrt(n) within limits
that depend on cost-related parameters, we have found that our growth mechanism
gives rise to power-law distributions of node degree that are invariant for
constant lambda*sqrt(n). We also study connectivity- and distance-related
properties of the networks.

reveal how gas and dust evolve into stars and planets, how the first luminous

black holes grew. FIRI will disentangle the cosmic histories of star formation
and accretion onto black holes and will trace the assembly and evolution of
quiescent galaxies like our Milky Way. Perhaps most importantly, FIRI will
observe all stages of planetary system formation and recognise Earth-like
planets that may harbour life, via its ability to image the dust structures in
planetary systems. It will thus address directly questions fundamental to our
understanding of how the Universe has developed and evolved - the very

in the coniferous forest of Les Landes near Bordeaux, France, using a
multi-angle L-band (1.4 GHz) radiometer to measure upwelling radiation above
the forest. At the same time, ground measurements were taken of soil and litter
moisture content. This experiment was done in the context of the upcoming SMOS
mission in order to improve our understanding of the behaviour of the L-band
signal above forested areas. Very little information exists on this subject at
the moment, especially for varying hydrological conditions. Furthermore,
additional measurements were done at the University of Bordeaux (PIOM
laboratory) to determine the dielectric behaviour of a litter layer such as
that found at the Bray site. There is some evidence that this layer may have a
different influence on the L-band signal than either the soil or the
vegetation, however the exact behaviour of the litter layer and the extent of
its influence on the L-band signal are as yet unknown. This paper presents 1)
results of the Bray experiment describing the behaviour of the above-canopy
L-band emissivity for different conditions of ground moisture and 2) the
relationship between soil and litter moisture content and results of the
laboratory experiments on litter dielectric properties. Together this will give
a first insight into the L-band radiometric properties of the different forest
layers for varying hydrological conditions.

determine a number of its original properties that essentially simplify its
control. These features allow the main control problems to be effectively
overcome by application of the simple kinematic problems. The workspace and
singular configurations of a basic planar manipulator are studied. By using a
graphic simulation method, motions of the designed mechanism are examined. A
prototype of this mechanism was implemented to verify the proposed approach.

large interorbital charge transfer, with simultaneous electron and hole doping
of t2g subbands. The transition is first-order and exhibits phase separation
between insulator and metal. In the metallic phase, subband compressibilities
become very large and have opposite signs. Electron doping gives rise to an
interorbital charge flow in the same direction as hole doping. These results
can be understood in terms of a strong orbital depolarization.
