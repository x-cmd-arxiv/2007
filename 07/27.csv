inflation is governed by closed strings, using N-flation as an example. We find
that coupling the inflaton preferentially to the Standard Model is difficult,
and hidden sectors are typically reheated. Observational constraints are only
met by a fraction of the models. In some working models, relativistic relics in
the hidden sector provide dark matter candidates with masses that range from

Kritsuk et al. (2007) obeys the Kolmogorov scaling, i.e. ${\cal E}_{u}(k)\sim
k^{-5/3}$ for the high Mach number turbulence. Similarly, we find that the
exponents of the third order structure functions for $\boldsymbol{u}$ stay
equal to unity for all Mach numbers studied. The scaling of higher order
correlations obeys the She-L\'{e}v\^{e}que (1994) scalings corresponding to the
two-dimensional dissipative structures, and this result does not change with
the Mach number either. In contrast to velocity $\boldsymbol{v}$ which exhibits
different scaling parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field, the
scaling of $\boldsymbol{u}$ is similar in both directions. In addition, we find
that the peaks of density create a hierarchy in which both physical and column
densities decrease with the scale in accordance to the Fleck (1996)
predictions. This hierarchy can be related ubiquitous small ionized and neutral
structures (SINS) in the interstellar gas. We believe that studies of
statistics of the column density peaks can provide both consistency check for
the turbulence velocity studies and insight into supersonic turbulence, when
the velocity information is not available.

the initially uncertain photon number converges to an integer. The suppression

we propose a control parameter $R$ for a wider class of systems including

is related to the driving and dissipation rates and from similarity analysis we
obtain a relationship $R\sim N^{\beta_N}$ where $N$ is the number of degrees of
freedom. The value of the exponent $\beta_N$ is determined by detailed
phenomenology but its sign follows from our similarity analysis. For SOC,
$R=h/\epsilon$ and we show that $\beta_N<0$ hence we show independent of the
details that the transition to SOC is when $R \to 0$, in contrast to fluid
turbulence, formalizing the relationship between turbulence (since $\beta_N
>0$, $R \to \infty$) and SOC ($R=h/\epsilon\to 0$). A corollary is that SOC
phenomenology, that is, power law scaling of avalanches, can persist for finite
$R$ with unchanged exponent if the system supports a sufficiently large range
of lengthscales; necessary for SOC to be a candidate for physical systems. We
propose a conceptual model ecosystem where $R$ is an observable parameter which
depends on the rate of throughput of biomass or energy; we show this has
$\beta_N>0$, so that increasing $R$ increases the abundance of species,
pointing to a critical value for species 'explosion'.

from single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) connected by Y-like junctions

cylinder. We observed that the ST behavior under tensile tests is similar to
the one presented by fishing nets. This interesting behavior provides a way to
vary the accessible channels to the inner parts of STs by applying external
mechanical load. The Young's modulus is dependent on the ST chirality and it
inversely varies with the ST radius. Smaller reduction of breaking strain
values due to temperature increase is predicted for zigzag STs compared to
SWCNTs. The results show that, for STs with radius ~ 5 nm, the junctions
between the constituent SWCNTs play an important role on the fracture process.
The Young's modulus and tensile strength were estimated for hierarchical
higher-order STs using scaling laws related to the ST fractal dimension. The
obtained mechanical properties suggest that STs may be used in the development
of new porous, flexible, and high-strength materials.

process of double charm production $e^+e^-\to J/\psi+X(4160)$ followed by
$X(4160)\to D^*\bar{D^*}$. We discuss possible interpretations for the X(4160)
based on the NRQCD calculations and the potential model estimates for the
charmonium spectrum. We first focus on the D-wave spin-singlet $2^{-+}$
charmonium $^1D_2(2D)$, which is estimated to have a small production rate of
about 5% of that for $e^+e^-\to J/\psi+\eta_c(1S)$, and therefore is
incompatible with the observed data for X(4160). We then discuss the
possibility that the X(4160) is the known $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ charmonium state
$\psi(4160)$, which can be produced via two photon fragmentation, but the
production rate is much smaller than observed for $e^+e^-\to J/\psi+X(4160)$.
In contrast to above two possibilities, the $\eta_c(4S)$ assignment is a likely
one, which is supported by the observed relatively large production rate and
non-observation of $D\bar D$ decay of X(4160), but we have to understand why
$\eta_c(4S)$ has such a low mass, which deserves further studies. The P-wave
excited state $\chi_{c0}(3P)$ is also an interesting candidate, if the observed
broad peak around 3.8-3.9 GeV in the recoil mass of $D\bar D$ against $J/\psi$
in $e^++e^-\to J/\psi+D\bar D$ is due to the $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ state.
Measurements of production angular distributions will be helpful to distinguish
between $\eta_c(4S)$ and $\chi_{c0}(3P)$ assignments. Production mechanisms in
nonrelativistic QCD are emphasized.

condensate in a one-dimensional optical lattice, in addition to a confining
harmonic trap potential. We start from a two-particle irreducible (2PI)
effective action on the Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time contour path. In
principle, this action involves all information of equilibrium and
non-equilibrium properties of the condensate and noncondensate atoms. By
assuming an ansatz for the variational function, i.e., the condensate order
parameter in an effective action, we derive a coarse-grained effective action,
which describes the dynamics on the length scale much longer than a lattice
constant. Using the variational principle, coarse-grained equations of motion
for the condensate variables are obtained. These equations include a
dissipative term due to collisions between condensate and noncondensate atoms,
as well as noncondensate mean-field. To illustrate the usefulness of our
formalism, we discuss a Landau instability of the condensate in optical
lattices by using the coarse-grained generalized Gross-Pitaevskii
hydrodynamics. We found that the collisional damping rate due to collisions
between the condensate and noncondensate atoms changes sign when the condensate
velocity exceeds a renormalized sound velocity, leading to a Landau instability
consistent with the Landau criterion. Our results in this work give an insight
into the microscopic origin of the Landau instability.

constitutes one of the hallmark effects of quantum physics. When interactions
between the particles compete with their mobility through a tunnel junction,
intriguing novel dynamical behaviour can arise where particles do not tunnel
independently. In single-electron or Bloch transistors, for example, the
tunnelling of an electron or Cooper pair can be enabled or suppressed by the
presence of a second charge carrier due to Coulomb blockade. Here we report on
the first direct and time-resolved observation of correlated tunnelling of two
interacting atoms through a barrier in a double well potential. We show that
for weak interactions between the atoms and dominating tunnel coupling,
individual atoms can tunnel independently, similar to the case in a normal
Josephson junction. With strong repulsive interactions present, two atoms
located on one side of the barrier cannot separate, but are observed to tunnel
together as a pair in a second order co-tunnelling process. By recording both
the atom position and phase coherence over time, we fully characterize the
tunnelling process for a single atom as well as the correlated dynamics of a
pair of atoms for weak and strong interactions. In addition, we identify a
conditional tunnelling regime, where a single atom can only tunnel in the
presence of a second particle, acting as a single atom switch. Our work
constitutes the first direct observation of second order tunnelling events with
ultracold atoms, which are the dominating dynamical effect in the strongly
interacting regime. Similar second-order processes form the basis of
superexchange interactions between atoms on neighbouring lattice sites of a
periodic potential, a central component of quantum magnetism.

detector in Bob to produce a click, she modifies polarization (or other
parameter used to encode quantum states) of the light she sends to Bob such
that the target detector stops receiving light while the other detector(s)
continue to be illuminated. The target detector regains single photon
sensitivity and, when Eve modifies the polarization again, produces a single
click. Thus, Eve has full control of Bob and can do a successful
intercept-resend attack. To check the feasibility of the attack, 3 different
models of passively-quenched detectors have been tested. In the experiment, I
have simulated the intensity diagrams the detectors would receive in a real

about several fundamental properties of galaxies, in particular their missing
mass, both in the form of cosmological Dark Matter and so-called Lost Baryons.
High velocity encounters, which are common in clusters of galaxies, are able to
produce faint tidal debris that may appear as star-less, free floating HI
clouds. These may be mistaken for Dark Galaxies, a putative class of gaseous,
dark matter dominated, objects which for some reason never managed to form
stars. VirgoHI21 is by far the most spectacular and most discussed Dark Galaxy
candidate so far detected in HI surveys. We show here that it is most likely
made out of material expelled 750 Myr ago from the nearby spiral galaxy NGC
4254 during its fly--by at about 1000 km/s by a massive intruder. Our numerical
model of the collision is able to reproduce the main characteristics of the
system: in particular the absence of stars, and its prominent velocity
gradient. Originally attributed to the gas being in rotation within a massive
dark matter halo, we find it instead to be consistent with a combination of
simple streaming motion plus projection effects (Duc & Bournaud, 2007). We
discuss several ways to identify a tidal origin in a Dark Galaxy candidate and
illustrate the method using another HI system in Virgo, VCC 2062, which is most
likely a Tidal Dwarf Galaxy (Duc et al., 2007). Now, whereas tidal debris
should not contain any dark matter from the halo of their parent galaxies, it
may exhibit missing mass in the form of dark baryons, unaccounted for by
classical observations, as recently found in the collisional ring of NGC 5291
(Bournaud et al., 2007) and probably in the TDG VCC 2062. These ""Lost Baryons""
must originally have been located in the disks of their parent galaxies.

methods of celestial mechanics to atomic and molecular physics were highly
sucsessful. With such a success, the birth of new quantum mechanics is

simplicity with which the same type of calculations are done using new methods

introduced for systems exhibiting phase transitions or crossovers controlled by

the quantitative knowledge of various contributions to free energy is
incomplete, and is applied to evaluate the chances of electronic phase
separation associated with the onset of antiferromagnetic correlations in
high-temperature cuprate superconductors. The experimental phenomenology of
lanthanum- and yittrium-based cuprates was used as input to this analysis. It
is also pointed out that Coulomb repulsion between charge carriers separated by
the distances of 1-3 lattice periods strengthens the tendency towards phase
separation by accelerating the decay of antiferromagnetic correlations with
doping. Overall, the present analysis indicates that cuprates are realistically
close to the threshold of phase separation -- nanoscale limited or even
macroscopic with charge density varying between adjacent crystal planes.

galaxies, and YSOs. This represents the first large-scale attempt at blind
source classification based on Spitzer SEDs in another galaxy. We firmly
identify at least 61 YSOs, with another 50 probable YSOs; only one embedded
protostar in the SMC was reported in the literature prior to the S3MC. We
present color selection criteria that can be used to identify a relatively
clean sample of YSOs with IRAC photometry. Our fitted SEDs indicate that the
infrared-bright YSOs in N66 have stellar masses ranging from 2 Msun to 17 Msun,
and that approximately half of the objects are Stage II protostars, with the
remaining YSOs roughly evenly divided between Stage I and Stage III sources. We
find evidence for primordial mass segregation in the HII region, with the most
massive YSOs being preferentially closer to the center than lower-mass objects.
Despite the low metallicity and dust content of the SMC, the observable
properties of the YSOs appear consistent with those in the Milky Way. Although
the YSOs are heavily concentrated within the optically bright central region of
N66, there is ongoing star formation throughout the complex and we place a
lower limit on the star formation rate of 3.2 x 10^-3 Msun/yr over the last ~1

cold fronts have been often found in relaxed galaxy clusters such as Abell 496.
Models that explain cold fronts as surviving cores of head-on subcluster
mergers do not work well for these clusters and competing models involving gas
sloshing have been recently proposed. Here, we test some concrete predictions
of these models in a combined analysis of density, temperature, metal
abundances and abundance ratios in a deep Chandra exposure of Abell 496. We
confirm that the chemical discontinuities found in this cluster are not
consistent with a core merger remnant scenario. However, we find chemical
gradients across a spiral ""arm"" discovered at 73 kpc north of the cluster
center and coincident with the sharp edge of the main cold front in the
cluster. Despite the overall SN Ia iron mass fraction dominance found within
the cooling radius of this cluster, the metal enrichment along the arm,
determined from silicon and iron abundances, is consistent with a lower SN Ia
iron mass fraction (51% +- 14%) than that measured in the surrounding regions
(85% +- 14%). The ""arm"" is also significantly colder than the surroundings by
0.5-1.6 keV. The arm extends from a boxy colder region surrounding the center
of the cluster, where two other cold fronts are found. This cold arm is a
prediction of current high resolution numerical simulations as a result of an
off-center encounter with a less massive pure dark matter halo and we suggest
that the cold fronts in A496 provide the first clear corroboration of such
model, where the closest encounter happened ~ 0.5 Gyr ago. We also argue for a
possible candidate dark matter halo responsible for the cold fronts in the
outskirts of A496.

E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.76.031908",,"cond-mat.soft",,"  Can the presence of molecular-tilt order significantly affect the shapes of
lipid bilayer membranes, particularly membrane shapes with narrow necks?
Motivated by the propensity for tilt order and the common occurrence of narrow
necks in the intermediate stages of biological processes such as endocytosis
and vesicle trafficking, we examine how tilt order inhibits the formation of
necks in the equilibrium shapes of vesicles. For vesicles with a spherical
topology, point defects in the molecular order with a total strength of $+2$
are required. We study axisymmetric shapes and suppose that there is a
unit-strength defect at each pole of the vesicle. The model is further
simplified by the assumption of tilt isotropy: invariance of the energy with
respect to rotations of the molecules about the local membrane normal. This
isotropy condition leads to a minimal coupling of tilt order and curvature,
giving a high energetic cost to regions with Gaussian curvature and tilt order.
Minimizing the elastic free energy with constraints of fixed area and fixed
enclosed volume determines the allowed shapes. Using numerical calculations, we
find several branches of solutions and identify them with the branches
previously known for fluid membranes. We find that tilt order changes the
relative energy of the branches, suppressing thin necks by making them costly,
leading to elongated prolate vesicles as a generic family of tilt-ordered
membrane shapes.

burst (GRB) and Hypernova explosions. They had more than enough rotational
energy to power themselves. In fact, they had so much energy that they would
have disrupted the accretion disk of the black hole that powered them by the
communicated rotational energy, so that the energy delivery was self limiting.
The most important feature in producing high rotational energy in the binary is
low donor (secondary star) mass.
  We suggest that V4641 Sgr (XTE J1819 - 254) and GRS 1915 + 105 underwent less
energetic explosions; because of their large donor masses. These explosions
were one or two orders of magnitude lower in energy than that of Nova Sco. Cyg
X - 1 (1956 + 350) had an even less energetic explosion, because of an even
larger donor mass.
  We find that in the evolution of the soft X-ray transient sources the donor
(secondary star) is tidally locked with the helium star, which evolved from the
giant, as the hydrogen envelope is stripped off in common envelope evolution.
The tidal locking is transferred from the helium star to the black hole into
which it falls. Depending on the mass of the donor, the black hole can be spun
up to the angular momentum necessary to power the GRB and Hypernova explosion.
The donor decouples, acting as a passive witness to the explosion which, for
the given angular momentum, then proceeds as in the Woosley Collapsar model.
  High mass donors which tend to follow from low metallicity give long GRBs
because their lower energy can be accepted by the central engine.

re-defined at each order in loops.) The corresponding parameters implicitly
include short-range effects to all orders in the interaction, so these effects

that must be calculated are nonlocal and resemble those in conventional
nuclear-structure calculations. Nonlinear isoscalar scalar $(\sigma)$ and

evaluate the role of the jet opening angle on certain key parameters that are
inferred from VLBI radio observations of blazar nuclear jets. The key
parameters evaluated are the orientation angle (i.e., the viewing angle) of the
jet and the apparent speed and Doppler factor of the radio knots on parsec
scales. Quantitative comparisons are made of the influence of the jet opening
angle on the above parameters of the radio knots, as would be estimated for two
widely discussed variants of relativistic nuclear jets, namely, those having
uniform bulk speed and those in which the bulk Lorentz factor of the flow
decreases with distance from the jet axis (a `spine--sheath' flow). Our
analysis shows that for both types of jet velocity distributions the
expectation value of the jet orientation angle at first falls dramatically with
increases in the (central) jet Lorentz factor, but it levels off at a fraction
of the opening angle for extremely relativistic jets. We also find that the
effective values of the apparent speeds and Doppler factors of the knots always
decline substantially with increasing jet opening angle, but that this effect
is strongest for ultra-relativistic jets with uniform bulk speed. We suggest
that the paucity of highly superluminal parsec-scale radio components in TeV
blazars can be understood if their jets are highly relativistic and, being
intrinsically weaker, somewhat less well collimated, in comparison to the jets
in other blazars.

The low recovery rate suggests that the emission region of the low velocity

detected both at 230 and 690 GHz. The flux of the 690 GHz continuum emission
seems to be partially resolved out, suggesting dust emission partly

irreducible continuous-time birth-and-death chain on the nonnegative integers
and any d, the passage time from state 0 to state d is distributed as a sum of
d independent exponential random variables. Until now, no probabilistic proof
of the theorem has been known. In this paper we use the theory of strong
stationary duality to give a stochastic proof of a similar result for
discrete-time birth-and-death chains and geometric random variables, and the
continuous-time result (which can also be given a direct stochastic proof) then
follows immediately. In both cases we link the parameters of the distributions
to eigenvalue information about the chain. We also discuss how the
continuous-time result leads to a proof of the Ray-Knight theorem.
  Intimately related to the passage-time theorem is a theorem of Fill that any
fastest strong stationary time T for an ergodic birth-and-death chain on {0,
>..., d} in continuous time with generator G, started in state 0, is
distributed as a sum of d independent exponential random variables whose rate
parameters are the nonzero eigenvalues of the negative of G. Our approach
yields the first (sample-path) construction of such a T for which individual
such exponentials summing to T can be explicitly identified.

  corrections made and improved Fig 10",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20077640",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a study of C IV absorption in a sample of 63 damped Lyman-alpha
(DLA) systems and 11 sub-DLAs in the redshift range 1.75<z_abs<3.61, using a
dataset of high-resolution (6.6 km/s FWHM), high signal-to-noise VLT/UVES
spectra. Narrow and broad C IV absorption line components indicate the presence
of both warm, photoionized and hot, collisionally ionized gas. We report new
correlations between the metallicity (measured in the neutral-phase) and each
of the C IV column density, the C IV total line width, and the maximum C IV
velocity. We explore the effect on these correlations of the sub-DLAs, the
proximate DLAs (defined as those within 5 000 km/s of the quasar), the
saturated absorbers, and the metal line used to measure the metallicity, and we
find the correlations to be robust. There is no evidence for any difference
between the measured properties of DLA C IV and sub-DLA C IV. In 25 DLAs and 4
sub-DLAs, covering 2.5 dex in [Z/H], we directly observe C IV moving above the
escape speed, where v_esc is derived from the total line width of the neutral
gas profiles. These high-velocity C IV clouds, unbound from the central
potential well, can be interpreted as highly ionized outflowing winds, which
are predicted by numerical simulations of galaxy feedback. The distribution of
C IV column density in DLAs and sub-DLAs is similar to the distribution in
Lyman Break galaxies, where winds are directly observed, supporting the idea
that supernova feedback creates the ionized gas in DLAs. The unbound C IV
absorbers show a median mass flow rate of ~22(r/40 kpc) solar masses per year,
where r is the characteristic C IV radius. Their kinetic energy fluxes are
large enough that a star formation rate (SFR) of ~2 solar masses per year is
required to power them.

spin-polarized Fermi gas. Three comparative theoretical methods are used to
explore the phase diagram at zero temperature: the mean-field theory with
either an order parameter in a single-plane-wave form or a self-consistently
determined order parameter using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, as well as
the exact soluble Bethe ansatz method. We find that a spatially inhomogeneous
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase, which lies between the fully paired BCS
state and the fully polarized normal state, dominates most of the phase diagram
of a uniform gas. The phase transition from the BCS state to the
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase is of second order, and therefore there
are no phase separation states in one-dimensional homogeneous polarized gases.
This is in sharp contrast to the three-dimensional situation, where a phase
separation regime is predicted to occupy a very large space in the phase
diagram. We conjecture that the prediction of the dominance of the phase
separation phases in three dimension could be an artifact of the
non-self-consistent mean-field approximation, which is heavily used in the
study of three-dimensional polarized Fermi gases. We consider also the effect
of a harmonic trapping potential on the phase diagram, and find that in this
case the trap generally leads to phase separation, in accord with the
experimental observations for a trapped gas in three dimension. We finally
investigate the local fermionic density of states of the
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov ansatz. A two-energy-gap structure is shown
up, which could be used as an experimental probe of the
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov states.

factor that measures the local differences between the usual orbital-based
kinetic energy density distributions and the approximated ones, allowing to
ensure if the good results obtained for the total kinetic energies with these
semilocal functionals are due to their correct local performance or to error
cancellations. We have also included contributions coming from the laplacian of
the electron density to work with an infinite set of kinetic energy densities.
For all the functionals but one we have found that their success in the
evaluation of the total kinetic energy are due to global error cancellations,
whereas the local behavior of their kinetic energy density becomes worse than
that corresponding to the Thomas-Fermi functional.

identifying them as post common envelope binaries (PCEBs) or strong PCEB
candidates. Strict upper limits to the orbital periods are calculated, ranging
from 0.43 to 7880 d. Given the sparse temporal sampling and relatively low
spectral resolution of the SDSS spectra, our results imply a PCEB fraction of
>=15% among the WDMS in the SDSS data base. Using a spectral
decomposition/fitting technique we determined the white dwarf effective
temperatures and surface gravities, masses, and secondary star spectral types
for all WDMS in our sample. Two independent distance estimates are obtained
from the flux scaling factors between the WDMS spectra, and the white dwarf
models and main sequence star templates, respectively. Approximately one third
of the systems in our sample show a significant discrepancy between the two
distance estimates. In the majority of discrepant cases, the distance estimate
based on the secondary star is too large. A possible explanation for this
behaviour is that the secondary star spectral types that we determined from the
SDSS spectra are systematically too early by 1-2 spectral classes. This
behaviour could be explained by stellar activity, if covering a significant
fraction of the star by cool dark spots will raise the temperature of the
inter-spot regions. Finally, we discuss the selection effects of the WDMS

the critical scaling regime for small k. Close to the critical point, our
method yields the self-energy in the scaling form Sigma (k) = k_c^2 sigma^{-}

the Ginzburg scale, and sigma^{-} (x, y) is a dimensionless two-parameter
scaling function for the broken symmetry phase which we explicitly calculate

system in a GaAs/Al_{0.3}Ga_{0.7}As single quantum well by time-resolved
Faraday rotation and time-resolved Kerr rotation in dependence on the initial
degree of spin polarization, P, of the electrons. By increasing the initial
spin polarization from the low-P regime to a significant P of several percent,
we find that the spin dephasing time, $T_2^\ast$, increases from about 20 ps to
200 ps; Moreover, $T_2^\ast$ increases with temperature at small spin
polarization but decreases with temperature at large spin polarization. All
these features are in good agreement with theoretical predictions by Weng and
Wu [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 68}, 075312 (2003)]. Measurements as a function of spin
polarization at fixed electron density are performed to further confirm the
theory. A fully microscopic calculation is performed by setting up and
numerically solving the kinetic spin Bloch equations, including the
D'yakonov-Perel' and the Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanisms, with {\em all} the
scattering explicitly included. We reproduce all principal features of the
experiments, i.e., a dramatic decrease of spin dephasing with increasing $P$
and the temperature dependences at different spin polarizations.

there is insufficient time for sub-critical nuclei to relax to their lowest
free-energy structure. Such behavior is in direct contradiction with the common
assumption that the phase that crystallizes most readily is the one with the
lowest free-energy barrier for nucleation. The phenomenon that we describe

regions of the local Universe. We characterise the Ha emission, tracing current
star formation, of the 45 largest and less inclined galaxies observed for which
we estimate the torques between the gas and the bulk of the optical matter. We
could subsequently study the Ha morphological aspect of these isolated spiral
galaxies. Using Fourier analysis, we focus on the modes of the spiral arms and
also on the strength of the bars, computing the torques between the gas and
newly formed stars (Ha) and the bulk of the optical matter (Gunn r). We
interpret the various bar/spiral morphologies observed in terms of the secular
evolution experienced by galaxies in isolation. We also classify the different
spatial distributions of star forming regions in barred galaxies. The observed
frequency of particular patterns brings constraints on the lifetime of the
various evolution phases. We propose an evolutive sequence accounting for the
transitions between the different phases we could observe. Isolated galaxies
appear not to be preferentially barred or unbarred. Through numerical
simulations, trying to fit the Ha distributions yields constraints on the star
formation law, which is likely to differ from a genuine Schmidt law. In
particular, it is probable that the relative velocity of the gas in the bar
also needs to be taken into account.

The influence of NLTE effects on the line formation and element abundance is
investigated. Our goal is the derivation of solar log gfe values for manganese
lines, which will later be used in differential abundance analysis of
metal-poor stars. The method of spectrum synthesis is employed, which is based
on a solar model atmosphere with initially specified element abundances. A
manganese abundance of 5.47 dex is used with the theoretical line-blanketed
model atmosphere. Statistical equilibrium calculations are carried out for the
model atom, which comprises 245 and 213 levels for MnI and MnII, respectively.
Photoionization cross-sections are assumed hydrogenic. For line synthesis van
der Waals broadening is calculated according to Anstee & O'Mara's formalism. It
is shown that hyperfine structure of the Mn lines also has strong broadening
effects, and that manganese is prone to NLTE effects in the solar atmosphere.
The nature of the NLTE effects and the validity of the LTE approach are
discussed in detail. The role of photoionization and collisional interaction is
investigated.

be unbounded for the Gaussian source. The result suggests that in such a
setting, the benefit of using successive refinement is not likely to justify
the accompanying performance loss. The MSR problem is also related to the
source coding problem where each decoder has its individual side information,
while the encoder has the complete set of the side informations. The MSR
problem further includes several variations of the MD problem, for which the
specialization of the general result is investigated and the implication is
discussed.

intersection of the set of singular values with the Fatou set is compact and
the intersection of the postsingular set with the Julia set is finite. (In
particular, this includes all entire functions with finite postsingular set.)
If f is geometrically finite, then the Fatou set of f is either empty or
consists of the basins of attraction of finitely many attracting or parabolic
cycles.
  Let z_0 be a repelling or parabolic periodic point of such a map f. We show
that, if f has finite order, then there exists an injective curve consisting of
escaping points of f that connects z_0 to infinity. (This curve is called a
dynamic ray.) In fact, the assumption of finite order can be weakened
considerably; for example, it is sufficient to assume that f can be written as
a finite composition of finite-order functions.

  vol. 372, eds. R. Napiwotzki and M. R. Burleigh, 2007 - 6 pages, 4 figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present PHOENIX atmosphere models for metal-rich cool white dwarfs using
improved line shapes for the Na I and K I resonance doublets. Profiles for
collisional broadening due to H2 and He based on the adiabatic representation
show strong deviations from Van der Waals interaction at short distances.
Comparison with observed spectra that show extremely broadened Na I lines
indicates that a He-rich atmospheric composition is required to explain the
line strengths and spectral energy distributions. Our current synthetic
spectra, using an expansion in powers of density to the third order optimised
for brown dwarf atmosphere conditions, significantly underestimate the observed
absorption in the far wings, even predicting smaller total line strength than a
Lorentzian profile. This is due to the handling of multiple perturber
interactions becoming inadequate for the extreme densities of the coolest white
dwarfs. The density expansion would have to be extended at least to the 7th
order for an accurate treatment of such conditions and might break down
altogether in the densest objects. The results of a direct calculation of the
unified profile should therefore be used for model atmospheres of cool
metal-rich white dwarfs. Qualitative comparison of the full adiabatic profile
to the spectrum of WD2356-209 indicates good agreement with the observed line
shape. Observations of the coolest white dwarfs may therefore serve as a
laboratory for testing the physics of the deeper atmospheres and interiors of
brown dwarfs and giant planets.

inelastic scattering (DIS) in the fixed coupling case. We find that the
description of the DIS data is improved once gluon number fluctuations are
included. Also the values of the parameters, like the saturation exponent and
the diffussion coefficient, turn out reasonable and agree with values obtained
from numerical simulations of toy models which take into account fluctuations.
This outcome seems to indicate the evidence of geometric scaling violations,
and a possible implication of gluon number fluctuations, in the DIS data.
However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the scaling violations may also
come from the diffusion part of the solution to the BK-equation, instead of
gluon number fluctuations.
