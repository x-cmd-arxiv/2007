on a landscape. We propose a class of simple models, ``Gaussian landscapes,''
where Yukawa couplings derive from overlap integrals of Gaussian wavefunctions
on extra-dimensions. Statistics of vacua are generated by scanning the peak
positions of these zero-modes, giving probability distributions for all flavor
observables. Gaussian landscapes can broadly account for all observed flavor
patterns with very few free parameters. For example, the generation structure
in the quark sector follows from the overlap integrals for both the up and down
type Yukawas sharing the localized wavefunctions of the quark doublets and the
Higgs boson. Although Gaussian landscapes predict broad probability
distributions, the flavor observables are correlated and we show that
accounting for measured flavor parameters creates sharper distributions for
future neutrino measurements.

if the theory contains a unified gauge symmetry, the 22 flavor parameters of
the Standard Model, including neutrino masses, may be largely determined by the
statistics of this landscape, and not by any symmetry. Then the measured values
of the flavor parameters do not lead to any fundamental symmetries, but are
statistical accidents; their precise values do not provide any insights into
the fundamental theory, rather the overall pattern of flavor reflects the
underlying landscape. We investigate whether random selection from the
statistics of a simple landscape can explain the broad patterns of quark,
charged lepton, and neutrino masses and mixings. We propose Gaussian landscapes
as simplified models of landscapes where Yukawa couplings result from overlap
integrals of zero-mode wavefunctions in higher-dimensional supersymmetric gauge
theories. In terms of just five free parameters, such landscapes can account
for all gross features of flavor, including: the hierarchy of quark and charged
lepton masses; small quark mixing angles, with 13 mixing less than 12 and 23
mixing; very light Majorana neutrino masses, with the solar to atmospheric
neutrino mass ratio consistent with data; distributions for leptonic 12 and 23
mixings that are peaked at large values, while the distribution for 13 mixing
is peaked at low values; and order unity CP violating phases in both the quark
and lepton sectors. While the statistical distributions for flavor parameters
are broad, the distributions are robust to changes in the geometry of the extra
dimensions. Constraining the distributions by loose cuts about observed values
leads to narrower distributions for neutrino measurements of 13 mixing, CP
violation, and neutrinoless double beta decay.

the impact of i)channel fading, ii) channel inversion power control, and iii)
threshold-based scheduling on capacity. Channel inversion and threshold
scheduling may be viewed as simple ways to exploit channel state information
(CSI) without requiring cooperation across transmitters. We use the
transmission capacity (TC) as our metric, defined as the maximum spatial
intensity of successful simultaneous transmissions subject to a constraint on
the outage probability (OP). By assuming the nodes are located on the infinite
plane according to a Poisson process, we are able to employ tools from
stochastic geometry to obtain asymptotically tight bounds on the distribution
of the signal-to-interference (SIR) level, yielding in turn tight bounds on the
OP (relative to a given SIR threshold) and the TC. We demonstrate that in the
absence of CSI, fading can significantly reduce the TC and somewhat
surprisingly, channel inversion only makes matters worse. We develop a
threshold-based transmission rule where transmitters are active only if the
channel to their receiver is acceptably strong, obtain expressions for the
optimal threshold, and show that this simple, fully distributed scheme can
significantly reduce the effect of fading.

stars has been recently proposed as an alternative mechanism to dynamo
saturation in order to explain the saturation of angular momentum loss. In this
work we study the effect of magnetic surface flux distribution on the coronal
field topology and angular momentum loss rate. We investigate if magnetic flux
concentration towards the pole is a reasonable alternative to dynamo
saturation. We construct a 1D wind model and also apply a 2-D self-similar
analytical model, to evaluate how the surface field distribution affects the
angular momentum loss of the rotating star. From the 1D model we find that, in
a magnetically dominated low corona, the concentrated polar surface field
rapidly expands to regions of low magnetic pressure resulting in a coronal
field with small latitudinal variation. We also find that the angular momentum
loss rate due to a uniform field or a concentrated field with equal total
magnetic flux is very similar. From the 2D wind model we show that there are
several relevant factors to take into account when studying the angular
momentum loss from a star. In particular, we show that the inclusion of force
balance across the field in a wind model is fundamental if realistic
conclusions are to be drawn from the effect of non-uniform surface field
distribution on magnetic braking. This model predicts that a magnetic field
concentrated at high latitudes leads to larger Alfven radii and larger braking
rates than a smoother field distribution. From the results obtained, we argue
that the magnetic surface field distribution towards the pole does not directly
limit the braking efficiency of the wind.

positions. $(M-i\Gamma/2) = (1915\pm50)-i(90\pm25)$ MeV covers both solutions.
The small elasticity of 10% or less explains why it was difficult to observe
the state in $\pi N$ elastic scattering.
  $N(1900)P_{13}$ is a 2-star resonance which is predicted by symmetric
three-quark models. In diquark-quark models, the existence of the state is not
expected.

gases of defects distributed in heavy BPS operators in the dual SU(N)
Yang-Mills theory. These defects describe open strings on spherical D3-branes

them and comparing the results with a partition sum calculation. We display new
decoupling limits in which the field theory of the lightest open strings on the
D-branes becomes dual to a near-horizon region of the black hole geometry. In
the single-charge black hole we find evidence for an infrared duality between
SU(N) Yang-Mills theories that exchanges the rank of the gauge group with an
R-charge. In the two-charge case (where pairs of branes intersect on a line),
the decoupled geometry includes an AdS_3 factor with a two-dimensional CFT
dual. The degeneracy in this CFT accounts for the black hole entropy. In the
three-charge case (where triples of branes intersect at a point), the decoupled
geometry contains an AdS_2 factor. Below a certain critical mass, the
two-charge system displays solutions with naked timelike singularities even
though they do not violate a BPS bound. We suggest a string theoretic
resolution of these singularities.

subsequence (LCS) problem on a pair of strings. We consider its generalisation,
called the semi-local LCS problem, which arises naturally in many
string-related problems. The semi-local LCS problem asks for the LCS scores for
each of the input strings against every substring of the other input string,
and for every prefix of each input string against every suffix of the other
input string. Such a comparison pattern provides a much more detailed picture
of string similarity than a single LCS score; it also arises naturally in many
string-related problems. In fact, the semi-local LCS problem turns out to be
fundamental for string comparison, providing a powerful and flexible
alternative to classical dynamic programming. It is especially useful when the
input to a string comparison problem may not be available all at once: for
example, comparison of dynamically changing strings; comparison of compressed
strings; parallel string comparison. The same approach can also be applied to
permutation strings, providing efficient solutions for local versions of the
longest increasing subsequence (LIS) problem, and for the problem of computing
a maximum clique in a circle graph. Furthermore, the semi-local LCS problem
turns out to have surprising connections in a few seemingly unrelated fields,
such as computational geometry and algebra of semigroups. This work is devoted
to exploring the structure of the semi-local LCS problem, its efficient
solutions, and its applications in string comparison and other related areas,

scales, with no uniform magnetic field. The initial kinetic and magnetic
energies are equal, with negligible correlation. The resulting energy spectrum
is a combination of two components, each moderately resolved. Isotropy obtains
in the large scales, with a spectral law compatible with the
Iroshnikov-Kraichnan theory stemming from the weakening of nonlinear
interactions due to Alfven waves; scaling of structure functions confirms the
non-Kolmogorovian nature of the flow in this range. At small scales, weak
turbulence emerges with a k_{\perp}^{-2} spectrum, the perpendicular direction
referring to the local quasi-uniform magnetic field.

results by numerical simulations. We find a super-linear increase of $K_c$ with
the (average) absolute threshold $|h|$, which approaches $K_c(|h|) \sim
h^2/(2\ln{|h|})$ for large $|h|$, and show that this asymptotic scaling is
universal for RTN with Poissonian distributed connectivity and threshold
distributions with a variance that grows slower than $h^2$. Interestingly, we
find that inhomogeneous distribution of thresholds leads to increased
propagation of perturbations for sparsely connected networks, while for densely
connected networks damage is reduced; the cross-over point yields a novel,
characteristic connectivity $K_d$, that has no counterpart in Boolean networks.
Last, local correlations between node thresholds and in-degree are introduced.
Here, numerical simulations show that even weak (anti-)correlations can lead to
a transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics, and vice versa. It is shown that
the naive mean-field assumption typical for the annealed approximation leads to
false predictions in this case, since correlations between thresholds and
out-degree that emerge as a side-effect strongly modify damage propagation
behavior.

constraints admit polynomial-time upper bounds if the underlying graph has
small treewidth. The same problems often encourage reducing the maximal degree
of vertices to simplify theoretical arguments or address practical concerns.
Such degree reduction can be performed through a sequence of splittings of
vertices, resulting in an _expansion_ of the original graph. We observe that
the treewidth of a graph may increase dramatically if the splittings are not
performed carefully. In this context we address the following natural question:
is it possible to reduce the maximum degree to a constant without substantially
increasing the treewidth?
  Our work answers the above question affirmatively. We prove that any simple
undirected graph G=(V, E) admits an expansion G'=(V', E') with the maximum
degree <= 3 and treewidth(G') <= treewidth(G)+1. Furthermore, such an expansion
will have no more than 2|E|+|V| vertices and 3|E| edges; it can be computed
efficiently from a tree-decomposition of G. We also construct a family of
examples for which the increase by 1 in treewidth cannot be avoided.

fraction of their mass by accretion from a circumstellar disk that forms in the
center of a collapsing protostellar cloud. Throughout this period mass
accretion rates through the disk can reach 10^{-6}-10^{-5} M_Sun/yr leading to
substantial energy release in the vicinity of stellar surface. We study the
impact of irradiation of the stellar surface produced by the hot inner disk on
properties of accreting fully convective low-mass stars, and also look at
objects such as young brown dwarfs and giant planets. At high accretion rates
irradiation raises the surface temperature of the equatorial region above the
photospheric temperature T_0 that a star would have in the absence of
accretion. The high-latitude (polar) parts of the stellar surface, where disk
irradiation is weak, preserve their temperature at the level of T_0. In
strongly irradiated regions an almost isothermal outer radiative zone forms on
top of the fully convective interior, leading to the suppression of the local
internal cooling flux derived from stellar contraction (similar suppression
occurs in irradiated ``hot Jupiters''). Properties of this radiative zone
likely determine the amount of thermal energy that gets advected into the
convective interior of the star. Total intrinsic luminosity integrated over the
whole stellar surface is reduced compared to the non-accreting case, by up to a
factor of several in some systems (young brown dwarfs, stars in quasar disks,
forming giants planets), potentially leading to the retardation of stellar
contraction. Stars and brown dwarfs irradiated by their disks tend to lose

M_HI/L_B as a function of galaxy luminosity. This implies an empirical relation
between the minimum amount of stars a galaxy will form and its initial baryonic
mass. While the stellar mass of a galaxy seems to be only loosely connected to
its baryonic mass, the latter quantity is strongly linked to the galaxy's
dynamical mass as it is observed in the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. We find
that dwarf irregular galaxies with generally high M_HI/L_B-ratios follow the
same trend as defined by lower M_HI/L_B giant galaxies, but are underluminous
for their rotation velocity to follow the trend in a stellar mass Tully-Fisher
relation, suggesting that the baryonic mass of the dwarf galaxies is normal but
they have failed to produced a sufficient amount of stars. Finally, we present
a three dimensional equivalent to the morphology-density relation which shows
that high M_HI/L_B galaxies preferentially evolve and/or survive in low-density
environments. We conclude that an isolated galaxy with a shallow dark matter

values corresponding to critical RBNs. For finite systems it peaks near the
critical value, but slightly in the disordered regime for typical parameter
variations. The source of high values of N<I> is the indirect correlations
between pairs of elements from different long chains with a common starting
point. The contribution from pairs that are directly linked approaches zero for
critical networks and peaks deep in the disordered regime.

to radiative torques (RATs). To describe the action of RATs, we use the
analytical model (AMO) of RATs introduced in Paper I. We focus our discussion
on the alignment by anisotropic radiation flux with respect to magnetic field,
which defines the axis of grain Larmor precession. Such an alignment does not
invoke paramagnetic dissipation (i.e. Davis-Greenstein mechanism), but,
nevertheless, grains tend to be aligned with long axes perpendicular to the
magnetic field. When we account for thermal fluctuations within grain material,
we show that for grains, which are characterized by a triaxial ellipsoid of
inertia, the zero-$J$ attractor point obtained in our earlier study develops
into a low-$J$ attractor point. We study effects of stochastic gaseous
bombardment and show that gaseous bombardment can drive grains from low-$J$ to
high-$J$ attractor points in cases when the high-$J$ attractor points are
present. As the alignment of grain axes with respect to angular momentum is
higher for higher values of $J$, counter-intuitively, gaseous bombardment can
increase the degree of grain alignment in respect to the magnetic field. We
also study the effects of torques induced by H$_2$ formation and show that they
can change the value of angular momentum at high-$J$ attractor point, but
marginally affect the value of angular momentum at low-$J$ attractor points. We
compare the AMO results with those obtained using the direct numerical
calculations of RATs acting upon irregular grains and validate the use of the
AMO for realistic situations of RAT alignment.

few qubits in several systems, many technical difficulties must be overcome in
order to construct a large-scale device. In one proposal for large-scale QIP,
trapped ions are manipulated by precisely controlled light pulses and moved
through and stored in multizone trap arrays. The technical overhead necessary
to precisely control both the ion geometrical configurations and the laser
interactions is demanding. Here we propose methods that significantly reduce
the overhead on laser beam control for performing single and multiple qubit
operations on trapped ions. We show how a universal set of operations can be
implemented by controlled transport of ions through stationary laser beams. At
the same time, each laser beam can be used to perform many operations in
parallel, potentially reducing the total laser power necessary to carry out QIP
tasks. The overall setup necessary for implementing transport gates is simpler
than for gates executed on stationary ions. We also suggest a transport-based
two-qubit gate scheme utilizing microfabricated permanent magnets that can be
executed without laser light.

Their profiles have been successfully modelled with accurate interaction
potentials in the adiabatic theory, computing line profiles from the first few
orders of a density expansion of the autocorrelation function. The line shapes
in the emergent spectrum also depend on the distribution of absorbers as a
function of depth, which can be modelled with improved accuracy by new models
of dust condensation and settling.
  The far red K I wings of the latest T dwarfs still show missing opacity in
these models, a phenomenon similar to what has been found for the Na I line
profiles observed in extremely cool, metal-rich white dwarfs. We show that the

Including such line profiles in stellar atmosphere codes will further improve

applications: the orthoglide. This machine features three fixed parallel linear
joints which are mounted orthogonally and a mobile platform which moves in the
Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation. The main interest of the
orthoglide is that it takes benefit from the advantages of the popular PPP
serial machines (regular Cartesian workspace shape and uniform performances) as
well as from the parallel kinematic arrangement of the links (less inertia and
better dynamic performances), which makes the orthoglide well suited to
high-speed machining applications. Possible extension of the orthoglide to
5-axis machining is also investigated.

paper we focus our attention on pilot-wave theories in which the additional

for the free electromagnetic field. Since Bohm, similar pilot-wave theories
have been proposed for other quantum fields. The purpose of this paper is to
present an overview and further development of these proposals. We discuss
various bosonic quantum field theories such as the Schroedinger field, the free

model. In particular, we compare the pilot-wave theories proposed by Bohm and
by Valentini for the electromagnetic field, finding that they are equivalent.

transition, from normal phase N to an ""exotic"" superdense phase S, in a
rotating neutron star. Such a phase transition, accompanied by a density jump
rho_N --> rho_S, is characterized by rho_S/rho_N > 3/2(1+P_0/rho_N c^2), where
P_0 is the pressure, at which phase transition occurs. Configurations with
small S-phase cores are then unstable and collapse into stars with large
S-phase cores. The energy release is equal to the difference in mass-energies
between the initial (normal) configuration and the final configuration
containing an S-phase core, total stellar baryon mass and angular momentum
being kept constant. The calculations of the energy release are based on
precise numerical 2-D calculations. Polytropic equations of state (EOSs) as
well as realistic EOS with strong first-order phase transition due to kaon
condensation are used. For polytropic EOSs, a large parameter space is studied.
For a fixed ""overpressure"", dP, defined as the relative excess of central
pressure of collapsing metastable star over the pressure of equilibrium
first-order phase transition, the energy release E_rel does not depend on the
stellar angular momentum. It coincides with that for nonrotating stars with the
same dP. Therefore, results of 1-D calculations of E_rel(dP) for non-rotating
stars can be used to predict, with very high precision, the outcome of much
harder to perform 2-D calculations for rotating stars with the same dP. This
result holds also for dP_min < dP < 0, corresponding to phase transitions with
climbing over the energy barrier separating metastable N-phase configurations
from those with an S-phase core. Such phase transitions could be realized in
the cores of newly born, hot, pulsating neutron stars.

limit (no electrons). Surprisingly, with hard-core interactions even the empty
limit is described well by the slave-boson theory, both as an energy density
and with the regard to dynamical properties. The consequences are investigated
in the overdoped superconducting regime, where both phase separation and a d+s
structure of the order parameter is obtained. This s-wave component is already
imminent in the description of the hole in the slave boson theory. The

explains the coexistence of superconductivity and the Mott insulating state,

  Fluid","notes prepared as the basis for six lectures at the Second Warsaw
  School on Statistical Physics held in Kazimierz, Poland, June 2007",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft",,"  Granular fluids consist of collections of activated mesoscopic or macroscopic
particles (e.g., powders or grains) whose flows often appear similar to those
of normal fluids. To explore the qualitative and quantitative description of
these flows an idealized model for such fluids, a system of smooth inelastic
hard spheres, is considered. The single feature distinguishing granular and
normal fluids being explored in this way is the inelasticity of collisions. The
dominant differences observed in real granular fluids are indeed captured by
this feature. Following a brief introductory description of real granular
fluids and motivation for the idealized model, the elements of nonequilibrium
statistical mechanics are recalled (observables, states, and their dynamics).
Peculiarities of the hard sphere interactions are developed in detail. The
exact microscopic balance equations for the number, energy, and momentum
densities are derived and their averages described as the origin for a possible
macroscopic continuum mechanics description. This formally exact analysis leads
to closed, macroscopic hydrodynamic equations through the notion of a ""normal""
state. This concept is introduced and the Navier-Stokes constitutive equations
are derived, with associated Green-Kubo expressions for the transport
coefficients. A parallel description of granular gases is described in the
context of kinetic theory, and the Boltzmann limit is identified critically.
The construction of the ""normal"" solution to the kinetic equation is outlined,
and Navier-Stokes order hydrodynamic equations are re-derived for a low density
granular gas.

connecting the physics of neutrinos and supersymmetry. We examine the
theoretical structure of the seesaw-extended MSSM, retaining the full
complexity of three generations of neutrinos and sneutrinos. In this general
framework, new flavor-changing and CP-violating sneutrino processes are
allowed, and are parameterized in terms of two $3\times 3$ matrices that
respectively preserve and violate lepton number. The elements of these matrices
can be bounded by analyzing the rate for rare flavor-changing decays of charged
leptons and the one-loop contribution to neutrino masses. In the former case,
new contributions arise in the seesaw extended model which are not present in
the ordinary MSSM. In the latter case, sneutrino--antisneutrino mixing
generates the leading correction at one-loop to neutrino masses, and could
provide the origin of the observed texture of the light neutrino mass matrix.
Finally, we derive general formulae for sneutrino--antisneutrino oscillations
and sneutrino flavor-oscillations. Unfortunately, neither oscillation phenomena
is likely to be observable at future colliders.

that transverse waves propagating parallel to the mean magnetic field are
unstable to anisotropies in the cosmic ray distribution, and may provide a
mechanism to substantially amplify the ambient magnetic field. We quantify the
extent to which temperature and ionisation fractions modify this picture. Using
a kinetic description of the plasma we derive the dispersion relation for a
collisionless thermal plasma with a streaming cosmic ray current. Fluid
equations are then used to discuss the effects of neutral-ion collisions. We
calculate the extent to which the environment into which the cosmic rays
propagate influences the growth of the magnetic field, and determines the range
of possible growth rates. If the cosmic ray acceleration is efficient, we find
that very large neutral fractions are required to stabilise the growth of the
non-resonant mode. For typical supernova parameters in our galaxy, thermal
effects do not significantly alter the growth rates. For weakly driven modes,
ion-neutral damping can dominate over the instability at more modest ionisation
fractions. In the case of a supernova shock interacting with a molecular
clouds, such as in RX J1713.7-3946, with high density and low ionisation, the

orientations, interacting via a 3D dipole-dipole interaction plus a nearest
neighbor ferromagnetic term, has periodic striped ground states. As the
strength of the ferromagnetic term is increased, the size of the stripes in the
ground state increases, becoming infinite, i.e., giving a ferromagentic ground
state, when the ferromagentic interaction exceeds a certain critical value. We
also give a rigorous proof of the reorientation transition in the ground state
of a 2D system of discrete dipoles with six possible orientations, interacting
via a 3D dipole-dipole interaction plus a nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic
term. As the strength of the antiferromagnetic term is increased the ground
state flips from being striped and in-plane to being staggered and
out-of-plane. An example of a rotator model with a sinusoidal ground state is
also discussed.

  analysis of polymer extrusion dynamics",,"J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics, 151, 59-68 (2008)",,,"math.DS",,"  We discuss how matrix-free/timestepper algorithms can efficiently be used
with dynamic non-Newtonian fluid mechanics simulators in performing systematic
stability/bifurcation analysis. The timestepper approach to bifurcation
analysis of large scale systems is applied to the plane Poiseuille flow of an
Oldroyd-B fluid with non-monotonic slip at the wall, in order to further
investigate a mechanism of extrusion instability based on the combination of
viscoelasticity and nonmonotonic slip. Due to the nonmonotonicity of the slip
equation the resulting steady-state flow curve is nonmonotonic and unstable
steady-states appear in the negative-slope regime. It has been known that
self-sustained oscillations of the pressure gradient are obtained when an
unstable steady-state is perturbed [Fyrillas et al., Polymer Eng. Sci. 39
(1999) 2498-2504].
  Treating the simulator of a distributed parameter model describing the
dynamics of the above flow as an input-output black-box timestepper of the
state variables, stable and unstable branches of both equilibrium and periodic
oscillating solutions are computed and their stability is examined. It is shown
for the first time how equilibrium solutions lose stability to oscillating ones
through a subcritical Hopf bifurcation point which generates a branch of
unstable limit cycles and how the stable periodic solutions lose their
stability through a critical point which marks the onset of the unstable limit
cycles. This implicates the coexistence of stable equilibria with stable and
unstable periodic solutions in a narrow range of volumetric flow rates.

broadening of domain walls, the formation of so-called ``tiger-tail'' patterns,
and a ``mixed state'' of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic domains in
[CoPt]/Ru multilayers. The derived analitical relations between the values of
the shift and the strength of antiferromagnetic coupling provide an effective
method for a quantitative determination of the interlayer exchange
interactions.

behavior of cells. Recent high-throughput genomic studies of cancer cells have
shown that the mutational landscape of cancer is complex and that individual
cancers may evolve through mutations in as many as 20 different
cancer-associated genes. We use data published by Sjoblom et al. (2006) to
develop a new mathematical model for the somatic evolution of colorectal
cancers. We employ the Wright-Fisher process for exploring the basic parameters
of this evolutionary process and derive an analytical approximation for the
expected waiting time to the cancer phenotype. Our results highlight the
relative importance of selection over both the size of the cell population at
risk and the mutation rate. The model predicts that the observed genetic
diversity of cancer genomes can arise under a normal mutation rate if the
average selective advantage per mutation is on the order of 1%. Increased
mutation rates due to genetic instability would allow even smaller selective
advantages during tumorigenesis. The complexity of cancer progression thus can
be understood as the result of multiple sequential mutations, each of which has
a relatively small but positive effect on net cell growth.

generalization of the Smorodinsky-Winternitz system to the above six spaces,
while the latter is a generalization of the Kepler-Coulomb potential, for which
the Laplace-Runge-Lenz N-vector is also given. All the systems and constants of
