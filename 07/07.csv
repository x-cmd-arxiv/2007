For galaxies of total mass M > 10^11 Msun and star formation rates SFR ~ 1-5
Msun/yr, we find angular averaged escape fractions of 0.01-0.03 over the entire
redshift interval studied (3<z<9). In addition, we find that the escape
fraction varies by more than an order of magnitude along different
lines-of-sight within individual galaxies, from the largest values near
galactic poles to the smallest along the galactic disk. The escape fraction
declines steeply at lower masses and SFR. We show that the low values of escape
fractions are due to a small fraction of young stars located just outside the
edge of HI disk. We compare our predicted escape fraction of ionizing photons
with previous results, and find a general agreement with both other simulation
results and available direct detection measurements at z ~ 3. We also compare
our simulations with a novel method to estimate the escape fraction in galaxies
from the observed distribution of neutral hydrogen column densities along the

escape fractions of the GRB host galaxies of 2-3%, consistent with our

gates can be implemented with sufficiently low error. One method for

tomography. However, standard process tomography is limited by errors in state
preparation, measurement and one-qubit gates. It suffers from inefficient
scaling with number of qubits and does not detect adverse error-compounding
when gates are composed in long sequences. An additional problem is due to the
fact that desirable error probabilities for scalable quantum computing are of
the order of 0.0001 or lower. Experimentally proving such low errors is
challenging. We describe a randomized benchmarking method that yields estimates
of the computationally relevant errors without relying on accurate state
preparation and measurement. Since it involves long sequences of randomly
chosen gates, it also verifies that error behavior is stable when used in long
computations. We implemented randomized benchmarking on trapped atomic ion
qubits, establishing a one-qubit error probability per randomized pi/2 pulse of

investigate the possibility that these two asteroids evolved from the Vesta
family to their present orbits by drifting in semi-major axis due to the
Yarkovsky effect. The main problem with this scenario is that the asteroids
need to cross the 3/1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter, which is highly
unstable. Combining numerical simulations of the orbital evolution, that
include the Yarkovsky effect, with Monte Carlo models, we compute the
probability of an asteroid of given diameter D to evolve from the Vesta family
and to cross over the 3/1 resonance, reaching a stable orbit in the middle
belt. Our results indicate that an asteroid like (21238) 1995WV7 has a low
probability of having evolved through this mechanism due to its large size (~5
km). However, the mechanism might explain the orbit of smaller bodies like
(40521) 1999RL95 (~3 km), provided that we assume that the Vesta family formed
> 3.5 Gy ago. We estimate that about 10% or more of the V-type bodies with D>1

wavelengths smaller than l_c = [B B/(d_h - d_l) g] are suppressed (where d_h
and d_l are the densities of the heavy and light fluids respectively), whereas
modes perpendicular to B are unaffected. We study strong fields with l_c
varying between 0.01 and 0.36 of the horizontal extent of the computational
domain. Even a weak field produces tension forces on small scales that are
significant enough to reduce shear (as measured by the distribution of the
amplitude of vorticity), which in turn reduces the mixing between fluids, and
increases the rate at which bubbles and finger are displaced from the interface
compared to the purely hydrodynamic case. For strong fields, the highly
anisotropic nature of unstable modes produces ropes and filaments. However, at
late time flow along field lines produces large scale bubbles. The kinetic and
magnetic energies transverse to gravity remain in rough equipartition and
increase as t^4 at early times. The growth deviates from this form once the
magnetic energy in the vertical field becomes larger than the energy in the
initial field. We comment on the implications of our results to Z-pinch
experiments, and a variety of astrophysical systems.

dwarf, the most popular scenario of a type Ia supernova (SN Ia), is presented.
The underlying modeling is pursued in a self-consistent way, treating the
combustion wave as a turbulent deflagration using well tested methods developed
for laboratory combustion and based on the concept of `large eddy simulations'
(LES). Such consistency requires to capture the onset of the turbulent cascade
on resolved scales. This is achieved by computing the dynamical evolution on a
1024$^3$ moving grid, which resulted in the best-resolved three-dimensional SN
Ia simulation carried out thus far, reaching the limits of what can be done on
present supercomputers. Consequently, the model has no free parameters other
than the initial conditions at the onset of the explosion, and therefore it has
considerable predictive power. Our main objective is to determine to which
extent such a simulation can account for the observations of normal SNe Ia.
Guided by previous simulations with less resolution and a less sophisticated
flame model, initial conditions were chosen that yield a reasonably strong
explosion and a sufficient amount of radioactive nickel for a bright display.
We show that observables are indeed matched to a reasonable degree. In
particular, good agreement is found with the light curves of normal SNe Ia.
Moreover, the model reproduces the general features of the abundance
stratification as inferred from the analysis of spectra. This indicates that it
captures the main features of the explosion mechanism of SNe Ia. However, we
also show that even a seemingly best-choice pure deflagration model has
shortcomings that indicate the need for a different mode of nuclear burning at
late times, perhaps the transition to a detonation at low density.

increases with time after star formation. Nordstrom et al. (2004) is the most
recent observational attempt to constrain the age-velocity dispersion relation.
They fitted the age-velocity dispersion relations of each Galactic cardinal
direction space velocity component, U (towards the Galactic centre), V (in the
direction of Galactic rotation) and W (towards the North Galactic Pole), with
power laws and interpreted these as evidence for continuous heating of the disc
in all directions throughout its lifetime. We re-visit these relations with
their data and use Famaey et al. (2005) to show that structure in the local
velocity distribution function distorts the in-plane (U and V) velocity
distributions away from Gaussian so that a dispersion is not an adequate
parametrization of their functions. The age-sigma(W) relation can however be
constrained because the sample is well phase-mixed vertically. We do not find
any local signature of the stellar warp in the Galactic disc. Vertical disc
heating does not saturate at an early stage. Our new result is that a power law
is not required by the data: disc heating models that saturate after ~ 4.5 Gyr
are equally consistent with observations.

near critical mass. That mass is actually a factor of 1.94 less than the
critical mass, and this is found to be consistent with the baryon density
inferred from nucleosynthesis in our universe; it is also precisely verified as
a cosmological effect. That factor seems to have originated in the multiverse
for causing intersecting expansions of its universes, such that mixing occurs
of debris from aging galaxies (over proton-decaying time scales). It follows
that there is an inter-universal medium (IUM), probably having the demand of
new universes in balance with the supply of dark radiation and sub-atomic
particles from the decaying galaxies. The mixing causes the universes to have
the same quantum, relativity, gravity, and particle physics as our universe.
The making of a universe from the radiation and sub-atomic particles occurs
through re-vitalizing the protons, and other particles as well, by
gravitational energy obtained in accretion of the IUM. This process therefore
begins wherever the IUM space density reaches proton density, near 10 E18 kg m
E-3. The process continues quietly as the sweeping-up and gravitational
accretion proceeds, until the near-critical mass is reached. Some of the IUM
debris must also be pervading our present universe, steadily or in partially
accreted lumps. The model therefore predicts that the IUM sub-atomic particles
appear as our dark matter, and its radiation component as our dark energy, both
near 0 K temperatures. The dark energy may cause expansion phenomena, in
addition to the above non-flatness expansion, from an accretion lump that
arrived at our universe at age near 9 x 10 E9 y.

as well as from 32 additional epochs of spectral monitoring data from 1994 to
the present, acquired with the VLA, Effelsberg, and GBT. The warp of the disk
has been defined precisely. The thickness of the maser disk has been measured
to be 12 microarcseconds (FWHM), which is slightly smaller than previously
quoted upper limits. Under the assumption that the masers trace the true
vertical distribution of material in the disk, from the condition of
hydrostatic equilibrium the sound speed is 1.5 km/s, corresponding to a thermal
temperature of 600K. The accelerations of the high velocity maser components
have been accurately measured for many features on both the blue and red side
of the spectrum. The azimuthal offsets of these masers from the midline (the
line through the disk in the plane of the sky) and derived projected offsets
from the midline based on the warp model correspond well with the measured
offsets. This result suggests that the masers are well described as discrete
clumps of masing gas, which accurately trace the Keplerian motion of the disk.
However, we have continued to search for evidence of apparent motions caused by
``phase effects.'' This work provides the foundation for refining the estimate
of the distance to NGC 4258 through measurements of feature acceleration and
proper motion. The refined estimate of this distance is expected to be

the range of H2 excitation temperature consistent with the observations, T(H2)

insights into the formation of the earliest massive galaxies. We have examined
in detail the stellar populations of six z~1.5 galaxies that appear to be

formation or active nuclei. The implied formation redshifts for the oldest of

problem on distributions of inputs, each of which is a tournament obtained as a
noisy perturbations of a linear order. Note that when $\ga < 1/2$ and $n$ is

  It is known that the weighted feedback are set problem on tournaments is
NP-hard in general. Here we present an algorithm of running time

formally, with high probability it holds that $\sum_i |\sigma(i) - \pi(i)| =

advertisers, and allows advertisers to estimate the true value of clicks
generated at the auction site. This exploratory mechanism deviates only
minimally from the mechanism being currently used by Google and Yahoo! in the
sense that it retains the same pricing rule, similar ranking scheme, as well
as, similar mathematical structure of payoffs. In particular, the estimations
of the relevance scores and true-values are achieved by providing a chance to
lower ranked advertisers to obtain better slots. This allows the search engine
to potentially test a new pool of advertisers, and correspondingly, enables new
advertisers to estimate the value of clicks/leads generated via the auction.
Both these quantities are unknown a priori, and their knowledge is necessary
for the auction to operate efficiently. We show that such an exploration policy
can be incorporated without any significant loss in revenue for the auctioneer.
We compare the revenue of the new mechanism to that of the standard mechanism
at their corresponding symmetric Nash equilibria and compute the cost of
uncertainty, which is defined as the relative loss in expected revenue per
impression. We also bound the loss in efficiency, as well as, in user
experience due to exploration, under the same solution concept (i.e. SNE). Thus
the proposed exploration mechanism learns the relevance scores while
incorporating the incentive constraints from the advertisers who are selfish
and are trying to maximize their own profits, and therefore, the exploration is
essentially achieved via mechanism design. We also discuss variations of the
new mechanism such as truthful implementations.

introduced in prior work, who have no monetary incentives, and are driven by

constraints from the advertisers who do dot use its services. A simple
intuition behind the above result comes from the observation that the mediator
has more information about and more control over the bid profile than any
individual advertiser, allowing her to reduce the payments made to the
auctioneer, while still maintaining incentive constraints. Further, our results
indicate that there are significant opportunities for diversification in the

convenient to describe grain boundary cohesive laws as a function of the

and 5 parameters in 3D. However, we find that the cohesive law is not a smooth
function of these parameters. In fact, it is discontinuous at geometries for
which the two grains have repeat distances that are rational with respect to
one another. Using atomistic simulations, we extract grain boundary energies

potential for all possible geometries which can be simulated within periodic
boundary conditions with a maximum box size. We introduce a model where grain
boundaries are represented as high symmetry boundaries decorated by extra

distribution, has for decades stood as the prime evidence for parity mixing in
nuclear states. The experiment, based on ion implantation of the newly
developed mass-separated $^{\rm 180}$Hf$^{\rm m}$ beam at ISOLDE, CERN into an
iron foil maintained at millikelvin temperatures, produces higher degrees of
polarization than were achieved in previous studies of this system. The value
found for the E2/M2 mixing ratio, $\epsilon$ = -0.0324(16)(17), is in close
agreement with the previous published average value $\epsilon$ = - 0.030(2), in
full confirmation of the presence of the irregular E2 admixture in the 501 keV
transition. The temperature dependence of the forward-backward asymmetry has
been measured over a more extended range of nuclear polarization than
previously possible, giving further evidence for parity mixing of the 8$^{\rm
-}$ and 8$^{\rm +}$ levels and the deduced E2/M2 mixing ratio.

investigate the gravitational field produced by the magnetic field of a

gravitate as predicted by Einstein's theory. A previous study of this problem
by Braginsky, Caves and Thorne predicted that the contribution to the
gravitational field resulting from the stresses of the magnetic field and of
the solenoid walls would cancel the gravitational field produced by the
mass-energy of the magnetic field, resulting in a null magnetically-generated
gravitational force outside the solenoid. They claim that this null result,
once proved experimentally, would demonstrate the stress contribution to
gravity. We show that this result is incorrect, as it arises from an incomplete
analysis of the stresses, which neglects the axial stresses in the walls. Once
the stresses are properly evaluated, we find that the gravitational field
outside a long solenoid is in fact independent of Maxwell and material
stresses, and it coincides with the newtonian field produced by the linear mass
distribution equivalent to the density of magnetic energy stored in a unit
length of the solenoid. We argue that the gravity of Maxwell stress can be
directly measured in the vacuum region inside the solenoid, where the newtonian
noise is absent in principle, and the gravity generated by Maxwell stresses is
not screened by the negative gravity of magnetic-induced stresses in the
solenoid walls.

modifications of Einstein gravity or new forms of energy. An example of
modified gravity is the braneworld Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model, an
example of dark energy is Chaplygin gas. Both are characterized by a cross-over
length scale $r_c$ which marks the transition between physics occurring on our
four-dimensional brane, and in a five-dimensional bulk space. Assuming that the
scales $r_c$ in the two models are the same, we study Chaplygin gas dark energy

model, it causes too much acceleration. We derive the Hubble function and the
luminosity distance for the self-decelerating branch, and then fit a

exact for models of liquid water in which the intermolecular interactions
vanish outside a finite spatial range, and therefore provides a precise
analysis tool for investigating the effects of longer-ranged intermolecular
interactions. We show how local order can be introduced through quasi-chemical
theory. Long-ranged interactions are characterized generally by a conditional
distribution of binding energies, and this formulation is interpreted as a
regularization of the primitive statistical thermodynamic problem. These
binding-energy distributions for liquid water are observed to be unimodal. The
gaussian approximation proposed is remarkably successful in predicting the
Gibbs free energy and the molar entropy of liquid water, as judged by
comparison with numerically exact results. The remaining discrepancies are
subtle quantitative problems that do have significant consequences for the
thermodynamic properties that distinguish water from many other liquids. The
basic subtlety of liquid water is found then in the competition of several
effects which must be quantitatively balanced for realistic results.

distinct in many ways are called quasi-black holes. Quasi-black holes are
defined here and treated in a unified way through the displaying of their
properties. The main ones are (i) there are infinite redshift whole regions,
(ii) the spacetimes exhibit degenerate, almost singular, features but their
curvature invariants remain perfectly regular everywhere, (iii) in the limit
under discussion, outer and inner regions become mutually impenetrable and
disjoint, although, in contrast to the usual black holes, this separation is of
a dynamical nature, rather than purely causal, (iv) for external far away
observers the spacetime is virtually indistinguishable from that of extremal
black holes. It is shown, in addition, that quasi-black holes must be extremal.
Connections with black hole and wormhole physics are also drawn.

  Saurabh","Better Algorithms and Bounds for Directed Maximum Leaf Problems",,,,,"cs.DS cs.DM",,"  The {\sc Directed Maximum Leaf Out-Branching} problem is to find an
out-branching (i.e. a rooted oriented spanning tree) in a given digraph with
the maximum number of leaves. In this paper, we improve known parameterized
algorithms and combinatorial bounds on the number of leaves in out-branchings.
We show that
  \begin{itemize} \item every strongly connected digraph $D$ of order $n$ with
minimum in-degree at least 3 has an out-branching with at least $(n/4)^{1/3}-1$
leaves; \item if a strongly connected digraph $D$ does not contain an
out-branching with $k$ leaves, then the pathwidth of its underlying graph is
$O(k\log k)$; \item it can be decided in time $2^{O(k\log^2 k)}\cdot n^{O(1)}$
whether a strongly connected digraph on $n$ vertices has an out-branching with
at least $k$ leaves. \end{itemize}
  All improvements use properties of extremal structures obtained after
applying local search and of some out-branching decompositions.
