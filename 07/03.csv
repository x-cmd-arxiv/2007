a high degree of symmetry that also exhibits exciting physics. We exploit the
simplicity of this ``test case'' to study more closely the role of spin in
black-hole recoil and find that: the recoil is with good accuracy proportional
to the difference between the $(l = 2, m = \pm 2)$ modes of $\Psi_4$, the major
contribution to the recoil occurs within $30M$ before and after the merger, and
that this is after the time at which a standard post-Newtonian treatment breaks

suggested the existence of a large inner hole, possibly caused by interactions
with a growing protoplanet. We used interferometric observations in the N-band
obtained with the MIDI instrument on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer,
together with 10 micron spectra recorded by the infrared satellite Spitzer. The
fact that we were able to determine N-band correlated fluxes and visibilities
for this comparatively faint source shows that MIR interferometry can be
applied to a large number of low-mass young stellar objects.
  The MIR spectra obtained with Spitzer reveal emission lines from HI (6-5), HI
(7-6), and [Ne II] and show that over 90% of the dust we see in this wavelength
regime is amorphous. According to the correlated flux measured with MIDI, most
of the crystalline material is in the inner, unresolved part of the disk, about
1 AU in radius. The visibilities exclude the existence of a very large (3-4 AU
radius) inner hole in the circumstellar disk of TW Hya, which was required in
earlier models. We propose instead a geometry of the inner disk where an inner
hole still exists, but at a much reduced radius, with the transition from zero
to full disk height between 0.5 and 0.8 AU, and with an optically thin
distribution of dust inside. Such a model can comply with SED and MIR
visibilities, as well as with visibility and extended emission observed in the
NIR at 2 micron. If a massive planet was the reason for this inner hole, as has
been speculated, its orbit would have to be closer to the star than 0.3 AU.
Alternatively, we may be witnessing the end of the accretion phase and an early
phase of an inward-out dispersal of the circumstellar disk.

larger than the cosmic signal. We illustrate this by considering a dark matter
model in which the principal annihilation products are neutrinos. Since
neutrinos are the least detectable Standard Model particles, a limit on their
flux conservatively bounds the dark matter total self-annihilation cross

Each irreducible representation $S^\lambda$ of $W$ corresponds to a standard
module $M(\lambda)$ for $\HH$. This paper deals with the infinite family
$G(r,1,n)$ of complex reflection groups; our goal is to study the standard
modules using a commutative subalgebra $\ttt$ of $\HH$ discovered by Dunkl and
Opdam. In this case, the irreducible $W$-modules are indexed by certain
sequences $\lambda$ of partitions. We first show that $\ttt$ acts in an upper
triangular fashion on each standard module $M(\lambda)$, with eigenvalues
determined by the combinatorics of the set of standard tableaux on $\lambda$.
As a consequence, we construct a basis for $M(\lambda)$ consisting of
orthogonal functions on $\CC^n$ with values in the representation $S^\lambda$.
For $G(1,1,n)$ with $\lambda=(n)$ these functions are the non-symmetric Jack
polynomials. We use intertwining operators to deduce a norm formula for our

lattice of submodules of $M(\lambda)$ in the case in which the orthogonal
functions are all well-defined.

explosion following the birth of a magnetar with the dipolar magnetic field of
B=10^{15}G and the rotational period of 2ms, which was studied by means of
axisymmetric general relativistic MHD simulations. The numerical models exhibit
highly collimated magnetically-driven jets very early on. The jets are
super-Alfvenic but remain sub-fast until the end of the simulations (t=0.2s).
The power released in the jets is about 3x10^{50}erg/s which implies the
spin-down time of ~37s. The total rotational energy of the magnetar,
E~10^{52}erg, is sufficient to drive hypernova but it is not clear as to how
large a fraction of this energy can be transfered to the stellar envelope.
Given the observed propagation speed of the jets, v_p~0.17c, they are expected
to traverse the progenitor in few seconds and after this most of the released
rotational energy would be simply carried away by these jets into the
surrounding space. Our results provide the first more or less self-consistent
numerical model of a central engine capable of producing, in the supernova
setting and on a long-term basis, collimated jets with sufficient power to
explain long duration GRBs and their afterglows. Although the flow speed of our
jets is relatively low, v_j~0.5c$, the cooling of proto-neutron star will
eventually result in much higher magnetization of its magnetospheres and
ultra-relativistic asymptotic speeds of the jets. Given the relatively long
cooling time-scale we still expect the jets to be only weakly relativistic by
the time of break out. This leads to a model of GRB jets with systematic
longitudinal variation of Lorentz factor which may have specific observational
signatures both in the prompt and the afterglow emission.

NGC 1893 to explore the effects of massive stars on low-mass star formation.
Using near-infrared colours, slitless spectroscopy and narrow-band $H\alpha$
photometry in the cluster region we have identified candidate young stellar
objects (YSOs) distributed in a pattern from the cluster to one of the nearby
nebulae Sim 129. The $V, (V-I)$ colour-magnitude diagram of the YSOs indicates
that majority of these objects have ages between 1 to 5 Myr. The spread in the
ages of the YSOs may indicate a non-coeval star formation in the cluster. The
slope of the KLF for the cluster is estimated to be $0.34\pm0.07$, which agrees
well with the average value ($\sim 0.4$) reported for young clusters. For the
entire observed mass range $0.6 < M/M_\odot \le 17.7$ the value of the slope of
the initial mass function, $`\Gamma$', comes out to be $-1.27\pm0.08$, which is
in agreement with the Salpeter value of -1.35 in the solar neighborhood.
However, the value of $`\Gamma$' for PMS phase stars (mass range $0.6 <
M/M_\odot \le 2.0$) is found to be $-0.88\pm0.09$ which is shallower than the
value ($-1.71\pm0.20$) obtained for MS stars having mass range $2.5 < M/M_\odot
\le 17.7$ indicating a break in the slope of the mass function at $\sim 2
M_\odot$. Estimated $`\Gamma$' values indicate an effect of mass segregation
for main-sequence stars, in the sense that massive stars are preferentially
located towards the cluster center. The estimated dynamical evolution time is
found to be greater than the age of the cluster, therefore the observed mass
segregation in the cluster may be the imprint of the star formation process.
There is evidence for triggered star formation in the region, which seems to
govern initial morphology of the cluster.

between HST/STIS echelle spectra obtained in 2001, 2003, and 2004 and HST/GHRS
echelle spectra obtained in 1994--1995 indicate the following: (1) The
absorption from the dominant species S II, O I, Si II, and Fe II is roughly
constant in all four sets of spectra -- suggesting that the total N(H) and the
(mild) depletions have not changed significantly over a period of nearly ten
years. (2) The column densities of the trace species C I (both ground and
excited fine-structure states) and of the excited state C II* all increased by
factors of 2--5 between 1995 and 2001 -- implying increases in the hydrogen
density n_H (from about 20 cm^{-3} to about 45 cm^{-3}) and in the electron
density n_e (by a factor >= 3) over that 6-year period. (3) The column
densities of C I and C II* -- and the corresponding inferred n_H and n_e --
then decreased slightly between 2001 and 2004. (4) The changes in C I and C II*
are very similar to those seen for Na I and Ca II. The relatively low total
N(H) and the modest n_H suggest that the -38 km/s cloud toward HD 219188 is not
a very dense knot or filament. Partial ionization of hydrogen appears to be
responsible for the enhanced abundances of Na I, C I, Ca II, and C II*. In this
case, the variations in those species appear to reflect differences in density
and ionization [and not N(H)] over scales of tens of AU.

regions of the angular power spectrum, corresponding to a resolution of a few
arcminutes. Dust emission from merging haloes is one of the foregrounds that
will affect such very small scales. We estimate the contribution to CMB angular
fluctuations from objects that are bright in the sub-millimeter band due to
intense star formation bursts following merging episodes. We base our approach
on the Lacey-Cole merger model and on the Kennicutt relation which connects the
star formation rate in galaxies with their infrared luminosity. We set the free
parameters of the model in order to not exceed the SCUBA source counts, the
Madau plot of star formation rate in the universe and COBE/FIRAS data on the
intensity of the sub-millimeter cosmic background radiation. We show that the
angular power spectrum arising from the distribution of such star-forming
haloes will be one of the most significant foregrounds in the high frequency
channels of future CMB experiments, such as PLANCK, ACT and SPT. The
correlation term, due to the clustering of multiple haloes at redshift z~2-6,
is dominant in the broad range of angular scales 200<l<3000. Poisson
fluctuations due to bright sub-millimeter sources are more important at higher
l, but since they are generated from the bright sources, such contribution
could be strongly reduced if bright sources are excised from the sky maps. The
contribution of the correlation term to the angular power spectrum depends
strongly on the redshift evolution of the escape fraction of UV photons and the
resulting temperature of the dust. The measurement of this signal will
therefore give important information about galaxies in the early stage of their
evolution.

homotopy colimit of a diagram of spaces over the small category cat(K), whose

several illustrative calculations, often over the rationals, including proofs

final recoil velocity (within ~2%) and that only a few dominant modes
contribute significantly to it (within ~5%). We describe how the relative
amplitudes, and more importantly, the relative phases, of these few modes
control the way in which the recoil builds up throughout the inspiral, merger,

by an ``effective Newtonian'' formula for the multipole moments obtained by
replacing the radial separation in the Newtonian formulae with an effective
radius computed from the numerical data. Beyond the merger, the numerical
results are reproduced by a superposition of three Kerr quasi-normal modes
(QNMs). Analytic formulae, obtained by expressing the multipole moments in
terms of the fundamental QNMs of a Kerr BH, are able to explain the onset and
amount of ``anti-kick'' for each of the simulations. Lastly, we apply this

amplitudes of planar and non-planar kicks for equal-mass spinning black holes.

noncommutativity and usual quantum mechanical features of the corresponding

article, we discuss the problem of constructing $\theta$-modified actions for
relativistic QM. We construct such actions for relativistic spinless and
spinning particles. The key idea is to extract $\theta$-modified actions of the
relativistic particles from path integral representations of the corresponding
noncommtative field theory propagators. We consider Klein-Gordon and Dirac
equations for the causal propagators in such theories. Then we construct for
the propagators path-integral representations. Effective actions in such
representations we treat as $\theta$-modified actions of the relativistic
particles. To confirm the interpretation, we quantize canonically these
actions. Thus, we obtain the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations in the
noncommutative field theories. The $\theta$-modified action of the relativistic
spinning particle is just a generalization of the Berezin-Marinov
pseudoclassical action for the noncommutative case.

non-2-colorability. We prove that for any k-uniform hypergraph with
Omega(n^{k-epsilon}) edges, adding omega(n^{k epsilon/2}) random edges makes
the hypergraph almost surely non-2-colorable. This is essentially tight, since
there is a 2-colorable hypergraph with Omega(n^{k-\epsilon}) edges which almost
surely remains 2-colorable even after adding o(n^{k \epsilon / 2}) random
edges.

(T$_{C1}$) as well as at temperatures when anomalous changes in the
polarization, dielectric constant and spin wave commensurability have been
previously reported. In particular, the step in the dielectric constant at low

quenched upon passing an $R$-dependent critical pressure. This was shown to
correlate with the stabilization of the high ferroelectric polarization state

is suggested to be due to a pressure induced phase transition into a
commensurate magnetic structure as exemplified by the pressure-temperature

truncated at a cutoff distance r_c such that the requirement of charge
neutrality holds. Various static and dynamic quantities are computed and
compared to results from simulations using Ewald summations. We find very good

structure is affected which is accompanied by a slight acceleration of dynamic
properties. In a second approach, the Coulomb interaction is replaced by an
effective Yukawa interaction with two new parameters determined by a force
fitting procedure. The same trend as for the Wolf method is seen. However,
slightly larger cutoffs have to be used in order to obtain the same accuracy

that there cannot be more than K/2 degrees of freedom, it has been conjectured
that in general the constant interference channel with any number of users has
only one degree of freedom. In this paper, we explore the spatial degrees of
freedom per orthogonal time and frequency dimension for the K user wireless
interference channel where the channel coefficients take distinct values across
frequency slots but are fixed in time. We answer five closely related
questions. First, we show that K/2 degrees of freedom can be achieved by
channel design, i.e. if the nodes are allowed to choose the best constant,
finite and nonzero channel coefficient values. Second, we show that if channel
coefficients can not be controlled by the nodes but are selected by nature,
i.e., randomly drawn from a continuous distribution, the total number of
spatial degrees of freedom for the K user interference channel is almost surely
K/2 per orthogonal time and frequency dimension. Thus, only half the spatial
degrees of freedom are lost due to distributed processing of transmitted and
received signals on the interference channel. Third, we show that interference
alignment and zero forcing suffice to achieve all the degrees of freedom in all
cases. Fourth, we show that the degrees of freedom $D$ directly lead to an
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ capacity characterization of the form
$C(SNR)=D\log(1+SNR)+\mathcal{O}(1)$ for the multiple access channel, the

analytical approach and demonstrate why, under certain sampling conditions, we
may not expect intermediates to be found. Using a simple null model, we show
mathematically that the question of whether a taxon sampled from some time in

$j=1,2,3$ for monolayer, bilayer and trilayer, respectively. The degeneracy
manifests itself in the quantum Hall (QH) effect. We study how the degeneracy
is removed by the Coulomb interactions. With respect to the zero-energy level,
an excitonic gap opens by making a BCS-type condensation of electron-hole pairs

contains up-spin and down-spin electrons belonging to different Landau levels.

self-organisation, dynamic reconfigurations, decentralisation and performance
becomes more and more essential. Since such properties are exhibited by P2P
systems, the convergence of grid computing and P2P computing seems natural. In
this context, this paper evaluates the scalability and performance of P2P tools
for discovering and registering services. Three protocols are used for this
purpose: Bonjour, Avahi and Free-Pastry. We have studied the behaviour of
theses protocols related to two criteria: the elapsed time for registrations

which the initial heavy neutrino density vanishes, the inclusion of CP
asymmetries in scatterings can enforce a cancellation between the lepton
asymmetry generated at early times and the asymmetry produced at later times.
We argue that a sizeable amount of washout is crucial for spoiling this
cancellation, and we show that in the regimes in which the washouts are
particularly weak, the inclusion of CP violation in scatterings yields a
reduction in the final value of the lepton asymmetry. In the strong washout
regimes the inclusion of CP violation in scatterings still leads to a
significant enhancement of the lepton asymmetry at high temperatures; however,
due to the independence from the early conditions that is characteristic of
these regimes, the final value of the lepton asymmetry remains approximately
unchanged.

of 26.3 (AB). We have measured the photometric redshifts of the SN host
galaxies, obtained Keck spectroscopic redshifts for 17 of the host galaxies,
and classified the SNe using the Bayesian photometric algorithm of Poznanski et
al. (2007) that relies on template matching. After correcting for biases in the
classification, 55% of our sample consists of Type Ia supernovae and 45% of
core-collapse SNe. The redshift distribution of the SNe Ia reaches z ~ 1.6,
with a median of z ~ 1.2. The core-collapse SNe reach z ~ 1.0, with a median of
z ~ 0.5. Our SN sample is comparable to the Hubble Space Telescope/GOODS sample
both in size and redshift range. The redshift distributions of the SNe in the
SDF and in GOODS are consistent, but there is a trend (which requires
confirmation using a larger sample) for more high-z SNe Ia in the SDF. This
trend is also apparent when comparing the SN Ia rates we derive to those based
on GOODS data. Our results suggest a fairly constant rate at high redshift that
could be tracking the star-formation rate. Additional epochs on this field,
already being obtained, will enlarge our SN sample to the hundreds, and
determine whether or not there is a decline in the SN Ia rate at z >~ 1.

extends previous extragalactic surveys of H2, the most abundant constituent of
the molecular ISM, to more common systems (L_FIR = e7 to 6e10 L_sun) of all
morphological and nuclear types. The S(1) transition is securely detected in
the nuclear regions of 86% of SINGS galaxies with stellar masses above 10^9.5
M_sun. The derived column densities of warm H2 (T > ~100 K), even though
averaged over kiloparsec-scale areas, are commensurate with those of resolved
PDRs; the median of the sample is 3e20 cm-2. They amount to between 1% and >30%
of the total H2. The power emitted in the sum of the S(0) to S(2) transitions
is on average 30% of the [SiII] line power, and ~4e-4 of the total infrared
power (TIR) within the same area for star-forming galaxies, which is consistent
with excitation in PDRs. The fact that H2 emission scales tightly with PAH
emission, even though the average radiation field intensity varies by a factor
ten, can also be understood if both tracers originate predominantly in PDRs,
either dense or diffuse. A large fraction of the 25 LINER/Sy targets, however,
strongly depart from the rest of the sample, in having warmer H2 in the excited
states, and an excess of H2 emission with respect to PAHs, TIR and [SiII]. We
propose a threshold in H2 to PAH power ratios, allowing the identification of
low-luminosity AGNs by an excess H2 excitation. A dominant contribution from
shock heating is favored in these objects. Finally, we detect, in nearly half
the star-forming targets, non-equilibrium ortho to para ratios, consistent with
FUV pumping combined with incomplete ortho-para thermalization by collisions,
or possibly non-equilibrium PDR fronts advancing into cold gas.

many applications using audio watermarking, D/A and A/D conversions (denoted by
DA/AD in this paper) are often involved. In previous works, however, the
robustness issue of audio watermarking against the DA/AD conversions has not
drawn sufficient attention yet. In our extensive investigation, it has been
found that the degradation of a watermarked audio signal caused by the DA/AD
conversions manifests itself mainly in terms of wave magnitude distortion and
linear temporal scaling, making the watermark extraction failed. Accordingly, a
DWT-based audio watermarking algorithm robust against the DA/AD conversions is
proposed in this paper. To resist the magnitude distortion, the relative energy
relationships among different groups of the DWT coefficients in the
low-frequency sub-band are utilized in watermark embedding by adaptively
controlling the embedding strength. Furthermore, the resynchronization is
designed to cope with the linear temporal scaling. The time-frequency
localization characteristics of DWT are exploited to save the computational
load in the resynchronization. Consequently, the proposed audio watermarking
algorithm is robust against the DA/AD conversions, other common audio
processing manipulations, and the attacks in StirMark Benchmark for Audio,
which has been verified by experiments.

fixed by the masses of K and K^* mesons, for which the size parameter is taken
to be two possible values. When it is chosen as the same as baryons', the
numerical results show that the masses of all the ud anti-s anti-s

when the size parameter for the K and K^* mesons is adjusted to be smaller than
that for the baryons, the ud anti-s anti-s configuration with I=0 and J^P=1^+
is found to lie lower than the K^*K^* threshold, furthermore, this state has a
very small KK^* component and the interaction matrix elements between this

important developments in the foundations of physics. It has even been
described as ""the most profound discovery of science."" Yet even as we approach
the 50th anniversary of Bell's discovery, its meaning and implications remain
controversial. Many textbooks and commentators report that Bell's theorem
refutes the possibility (suggested especially by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen
in 1935) of supplementing ordinary quantum theory with additional (""hidden"")
variables that might restore determinism and/or some notion of an
observer-independent reality. On this view, Bell's theorem supports the
orthodox Copenhagen interpretation. Bell's own view of his theorem, however,
was quite different. He instead took the theorem as establishing an ""essential
conflict"" between the now well-tested empirical predictions of quantum theory
and relativistic \emph{local causality}. The goal of the present paper is, in
general, to make Bell's own views more widely known and, in particular, to
explain in detail Bell's little-known mathematical formulation of the concept
of relativistic local causality on which his theorem rests. We thus collect and
organize many of Bell's crucial statements on these topics, which are scattered
throughout his writings, into a self-contained, pedagogical discussion
including elaborations of the concepts ""beable"", ""completeness"", and
""causality"" which figure in the formulation. We also show how local causality
(as formulated by Bell) can be used to derive an empirically testable Bell-type
inequality, and how it can be used to recapitulate the EPR argument.

that the first collision is typically driven by the most massive stars in the
cluster. Upon arrival in the cluster core, by dynamical friction, massive stars
tend to form binaries. The enhanced cross section of the binary compared to a
single star causes other stars to engage the binary. A collision between one of
the binary components and the incoming third star is then mediated by the
encounters between the binary and other cluster members. Due to the geometry of
the binary-single star engagement the relative velocity at the moment of impact
is substantially different than in a two-body encounter. This may have profound
consequences for the further evolution of the collision product.

  Magnetic Field","Accepted by ApJ",,"10.1086/521388",,"astro-ph",,"  The disk-corona evaporation model naturally interprets many observational
phenomena in black hole X-ray binaries, such as the truncation of an accretion
disk and the spectral state transitions. On the other hand, magnetic field is
known to play an important role in transporting angular momentum and producing
viscosity in accretion flows. In this work, we explicitly take the magnetic
field in the accretion disk corona into account and numerically calculate the
coronal structure on the basis of our two-temperature evaporation code. We show
that the magnetic field influences the coronal structure by its contribution to
the pressure, energy and radiative cooling in the corona and by decreasing the
vertical heat conduction. We found that the maximal evaporation rate keeps more
or less constant ($\sim 0.03$ Eddington rate) while the strength of magnetic
fields changes, but that the radius corresponding to the maximal evaporation
rate decreases with increasing magnetic field. This predicts that the spectral
state transition always occurs at a few percent of Eddington accretion rate,
while the inner edge of thin disk can be at $\sim 100 R_{\rm S} $ or even less
in the hard state before the transition to the soft state. These results
alleviate the problem that previous evaporation models predict too large a
truncation radius, and are in better agreement with the observational results
of several black hole X-ray binaries, though discrepancies remain.

particles orbiting primary star in a close circular binary system with
particular focus on the gas drag effects. These are the first calculations with
particles ranging in size from 1m to 10km, which account for the presence of a
tidally perturbed gaseous disk. We have found numerically that the radial mass
transport by the tidal waves plays a crucial role in the orbital evolution of
particles. Numerical results are confirmed analytical calculations that do not
assume anything about origin of the radial flow in the disk. We demonstrate
that the migration rate of a particle in a disk out of radial equilibrium is
enhanced due to the enhanced mass flux of gas colliding with the particle and
the migration is always directed inward regardless of the sign of the radial
gas velocity. Within the framework of the perturbation theory we derive
general, formulae for short-term variations of the particle semi-major axis,
eccentricity and inclination in such disk. The formulae account for departures
from axial symmetry by introducing effective components of the gas velocity.
They agree with numerical results within several percent. We have also found in
numerical simulations that the tidal waves introduce coherence in periastron
longitude and eccentricity for particles on neighbouring orbits. The degree of
the coherence depends on the particle size and on the distance from the primary
star, being most prominent for particles with 10m radius. The results are
important mainly in the context of planetesimal formation and, to a lesser
degree, during the early planetesimal accretion stage.

tests we used in earlier papers, but which have subsequently been identified
either as planet hosts or as astrophysical false positives. We determine the
system parameters using Markov-chain Monte Carlo analysis of the SuperWASP
light curves. We use a constrained optimisation of chi-squared combined with a
Bayesian prior based on the main-sequence mass and radius expected from the
2MASS J-H colour. The Bayesian nature of the analysis allows us to quantify
both the departure of the host star from the main-sequence mass-radius relation
and the probability that the companion radius is less than 1.5 Jupiter radii.
When augmented by direct light curve analyses that detect binaries with unequal
primary and secondary eclipses, and objects with aperture blends that are
resolved by SuperWASP, we find that only 13 of the original 67 stars, including
the three known planets in the sample, would qualify for follow-up. This
suggests that planet discovery ""hit rates"" better than one-in-five should be
achievable. In addition, the stellar binaries that qualify are likely to have
astrophysically interesting stellar or sub-stellar secondaries.

expected that the effect of the magnetic interchain coupling will be to reduce

the spin one-half solitons corresponding to each isolated chain. We show that
this is the case when these interactions are not frustrated. On the other hand,
in the frustrated case we show that the amplitude of dimerization in the ground
state is independent of the strength of the interchain magnetic interaction in
a broad range of values of this parameter. We also show that free solitons
could be the elementary excitations when only nearest neighbor interactions are
considered. The case of an elastic interchain coupling is analyzed on a general
energetic consideration. To study the effect of the magnetic interchain
interaction the problem is simplified to a two-leg ladder which is solved using
DMRG calculations. We show that the deconfinement mechanism is effective even
with a significantly strong antiferromagnetic interchain coupling.

Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) on a commercial NVIDIA GeForce 8800GTX designed
for gaming computers. The force evaluation of the $N$-body problem is
implemented in ``Compute Unified Device Architecture'' (CUDA) using the GPU to
speed-up the calculations. We tested the implementation on three different
$N$-body codes: two direct $N$-body integration codes, using the 4th order
predictor-corrector Hermite integrator with block time-steps, and one
Barnes-Hut treecode, which uses a 2nd order leapfrog integration scheme. The
integration of the equations of motions for all codes is performed on the host
CPU.
  We find that for $N > 512$ particles the GPU outperforms the GRAPE-6Af, if
some softening in the force calculation is accepted. Without softening and for
very small integration time steps the GRAPE still outperforms the GPU. We
conclude that modern GPUs offer an attractive alternative to GRAPE-6Af special
purpose hardware. Using the same time-step criterion, the total energy of the
$N$-body system was conserved better than to one in $10^6$ on the GPU, only
about an order of magnitude worse than obtained with GRAPE-6Af. For $N \apgt

about the same speed as the GRAPE-6Af.

passing through the target point. At this point of tangency the fluctuations
obey a new statistics: the Airy process with r outliers (in short: {\bf r-Airy

by the Fredholm determinant of a new kernel (extending the Airy kernel) and it
satisfies a non-linear PDE in x and the time.
