Cepheids and construct their period-luminosity (P-L) relations. For our cluster
main-sequence fitting we extend previous Hyades-based empirical
color-temperature corrections to hotter stars using the Pleiades as a template.
We use BVI_{C}JHK_{s} data to test the reddening law, and include metallicity
effects to perform a more comprehensive study for our clusters than prior
efforts. The ratio of total to selective extinction R_V that we derive is
consistent with expectations. Assuming the LMC P-L slopes, we find <M_V> =
-3.93 +/- 0.07 (statistical) +/- 0.14 (systematic) for 10-day period Cepheids,
which is generally fainter than those in previous studies. Our results are
consistent with recent HST and Hipparcos parallax studies when using the
Wesenheit magnitudes W(VI). Uncertainties in reddening and metallicity are the
major remaining sources of error in the V-band P-L relation, but a higher
precision could be obtained with deeper optical and near-infrared cluster
photometry. We derive distances to NGC4258, the LMC, and M33 of (m - M)_0 =
29.28 +/- 0.10, 18.34 +/- 0.06, and 24.55 +/- 0.28, respectively, with an
additional systematic error of 0.16 mag in the P-L relations. The distance to
NGC4258 is in good agreement with the geometric distance derived from water
masers [\Delta (m - M)_0 = 0.01 +/- 0.24]; our value for M33 is less consistent
with the distance from an eclipsing binary [\Delta (m - M)_0 = 0.37 +/- 0.34];
our LMC distance is moderately shorter than the adopted distance in the HST Key
Project, which formally implies an increase in the Hubble constant of 7% +/-
8%.

conductors and the current generated through rectification of an alternating
external bias. To leading order in applied voltages both the nonlinear and the
rectified current are quadratic. This current response can be described in
terms of second order conductance coefficients and for a generic mesoscopic
conductor they fluctuate randomly from sample to sample. Due to Coulomb
interactions the symmetry of transport under magnetic field inversion is broken
in a two-terminal setup. Therefore, we consider both the symmetric and
antisymmetric nonlinear conductances separately. We treat interactions
self-consistently taking into account nearby gates.
  The nonlinear current is determined by different combinations of second order
conductances depending on the way external voltages are varied away from an
equilibrium reference point (bias mode). We discuss the role of the bias mode
and circuit asymmetry in recent experiments. In a photovoltaic experiment the
alternating perturbations are rectified, and the fluctuations of the nonlinear
conductance are shown to decrease with frequency. Their asymptotical behavior
strongly depends on the bias mode and in general the antisymmetric conductance
is suppressed stronger then the symmetric conductance.
  We next investigate nonlinear transport and rectification in chaotic rings.
To this extent we develop a model which combines a chaotic quantum dot and a
ballistic arm to enclose an Aharonov-Bohm flux. In the linear two-probe
conductance the phase of the Aharonov-Bohm oscillation is pinned while in
nonlinear transport phase rigidity is lost. We discuss the shape of the
mesoscopic distribution of the phase and determine the phase fluctuations.

increasing HfO2, and (UO2 + ThO2) content and decreasing ZrO2/HfO2 ratio and
ZrO2 content from inner to outer parts within each growth zone or from core to

controlled by the crystal chemical features of ions themselves and the

microprobe analysis. We found notable differences between these two kinds of
zircons exhibited by the variation trend of Raman peak intensity from core to
rim of a crystal. In magmatic zircons, the intensity and the ratio H/W of Raman
spectrum peaks gradually decrease from core to rim of a crystal, which is
produced by an increase in metamictization degree and suggests an increase in U
and Th concentrations from core to rim. In metamorphic zircons, there are two
kinds of crystals according to their Raman spectra: the first group of zircons
exhibits a variation trend opposite to those of magmatic zircons, tending to
increase in the Raman peak intensity and H/W value from core to rim of a
crystal, which is produced by a decrease in metamictization degree and
indicates a decrease of U and Th concentrations from core to rim of a crystal.
The second group of zircons exhibits no change in Raman peak intensity and H/W
value through a crystal. The data of infrared and Raman spectra of these
crystals show that they are well crystallized and have no lattice destruction
induced by metamictization, and are thought to crystallize in high temperature
stages of metamorphism. During these stages, the U and Th ions have been
removed by metamorphic fluids from the parent rocks of these zircons. The other
difference between magmatic and metamorphic zircons is the background level of
their Raman spectra, which is high and sloped in magmatic zircons, but low and
horizontal in metamorphic zircons. The differences between magmatic and
metamorphic zircons can be used to identify the genesis of zircons and

civilization remained one enigma. The hypothesis of the Indian origin remained,
with controversies, without serious rival. It was the dominant hypothesis since
more of one century. Its partisans found to it and constructed a lot of
arguments. The testimonies of the medieval authors have been interpreted to its
advantage. The opposite opinions have been dismissed and ignored. An amalgam
between the history of our modern numerals and the Indian mathematics history
is made. Rational contradictions often passed under silence. A meticulous
observation of the numerals permits to affirm that our numerals are in fact
more or less modified Arabic letters. The ""Ghubari"" shape of the numerals shows
that the symbol of a numeral corresponds to the Arabic letter whose numerical
value is equal to this numeral. The numerals don't have a simple resemblance
with some Arabic letters, but every number looks like the Arabic letter whose
numerical value is equal to this numeral. The elements of the ''Abjadi''
calculation gives us a theoretical support, independent of the letters and
numerals, witch explains our observation. Besides a re-lecture of the
testimonies of the medieval authors, particularly the testimony of Al-Biruni,
that is probably at the origin of all others testimonies speaking of the Indian
origin of the numerals, is in agreement with the fact that our numerals are
Arabic letters. We have there a second way concerning the origin of our modern
numerals that is only to its beginnings. The deepened researches are necessary
to understand the history of our numerals better. A rigorous re-lecture of the
medieval testimonies with a new mind imposes itself.

greatly enhance the utility of cosmological probles in HI. ALFALFA will

differentially rotating star, in which a poloidal field of fossil origin is
sheared into a toroidal field. We focus on the non-axisymmetric instability
that affects the toroidal magnetic field in a rotating star, which was first
studied by Pitts and Tayler in the non-dissipative limit. According to Spruit,
it could also drive a dynamo. The Pitts & Tayler instability is manifestly
present in our simulations, with its conspicuous m=1 dependence in azimuth. But
its analytic treatment used so far is too simplified to be applied to the real
stellar situation. Although the instability generated field reaches an energy
comparable to that of the mean poloidal field, that field seems unaffected by
the instability: it undergoes Ohmic decline, and is neither eroded nor
regenerated by the instability. The toroidal field is produced by shearing the
poloidal field and it draws its energy from the differential rotation. The
small scale motions behave as Alfven waves; they cause negligible
eddy-diffusivity and contribute little to the net transport of angular
momentum. In our simulations we observe no sign of dynamo action, of either
mean field or fluctuation type, up to a magnetic Reynolds number of 10^5.
However the Pitts & Tayler instability is sustained as long as the differential
rotation acting on the poloidal field is able to generate a toroidal field of
sufficient strength.

fine structure constant of electromagnetism, $\alpha$, has been increasing
(Webb et al. 2001; Murphy et al. 2003). The conclusion is achieved after
looking at the separation between lines of ions like CIV, MgII, SiII, FeII,
among others in the absorption spectra of very distant quasars, and comparing
them with their counterparts obtained in the laboratory.
  However, in the meantime, other teams has claimed either a null result or a
decreasing $\alpha$ with respect to the cosmic time (Chand et al. 2004;
Levshakov et al. 2004). Also, the current precision of laboratory tests does
not allow one to either comfort or reject any of these astronomical
observations. Here we suggest that as photons are the sidereal messengers, a
nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) description of the interaction of photons with
the weak local background magnetic fields of a gas cloud absorber around the
emitting quasar can reconcile the Chand et al. (2004) and Levshakov et al.

positive variation argued more recently by Levshakov et al. (2006a, 2007). We
also show that nonlinear electrodynamics photon propagation in a vacuum
permeated by a background magnetic field presents a full agreement with
constraints from Oklo natural reactor data. Finally, we show that NLED may
render a null result only in a narrow range of the local background magnetic
field which should be the case of both the claims by Chand et al.(2004) and by
Srianand et al. (2004).

three-dimensional, single-size grain models of an optically thin dust ring to
our image and the SED using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm in a Bayesian
framework. The best-fit effective grain sizes are submicron, suggesting the
same dust population is responsible for the bulk of the scattered light. The
inner boundary of the warm dust is located 0.5""-0.7"" (~65 AU) from the star,
which is approximately cospatial with the outer boundary of the scattered-light
asymmetry inward of 0.5"". The addition of a separate component of larger,
cooler grains that provide a portion of the 60 um flux improves both the
fidelity of the model fit and consistency with the slopes of the
scattered-light brightness profiles. Previous indirect estimates of the stellar
age (~30 Myr) indicate the dust is composed of debris. The peak vertical
optical depths in our models (~0.3-1 x 1e-2) imply that grain-grain collisions
likely play a significant role in dust dynamics and evolution. Submicron grains
can survive radiation pressure blow-out if they are icy and porous. Similarly,
the inferred warm temperatures (130-200 K) suggest that ice sublimation may
play a role in truncating the inner disk.

spin-orbit interaction the field-induced pair correlation between the

effects; i.e. the Pauli depairing effect is anisotropic in the momentum space,
and as a result, magnetic fields induce point-node-like anisotropic gap
structure of the quasiparticle energy even for isotropic s-wave states, which
seriously affects thermodynamic quantities at low temperatures. Also, it is
shown that when the magnitude of the spin-orbit interaction is smaller than the
superconducting gap, the specific heat as a function of a magnetic field
exhibit a two-gap-like behavior, even when there is only a single gap. These
features characterize parity violated Cooper pairs in weakly noncentrosymmetric
systems. We suggest the possible detection of these effects in the

primary particles with the synchrotron and the curvature radiation process and
the pair-creation process. We show a solved gap structure which produces a
consistent gamma-ray spectrum with EGRET observation. Based on the
two-dimensional model, we conduct a three-dimensional emission model to
calculate the synchrotron and the inverse-Compton processes of the secondary
pairs produced outside the outer gap. We calculate the pulse profiles, the
phase-resolved spectra and the polarization characteristics in optical to
$\gamma$-ray bands to compare the observation of the Crab pulsar and PSR

from near the stellar surface to near the light cylinder produces a complex
morphology change of the pulse profiles as a function of the photon energy.
This predicted morphology change is quite similar with that of the
observations. The calculated phase-resolved spectra are consistent with the
data through optical to the $\gamma$-ray bands. We demonstrate that the

Frank and Larson and operator valued frames on a Hilbert space have been
studied in arXiv.0707.3272v1.[math.FA]. Goal of the present paper is to
introduce operator valued frames on a Hilbert C*-module for a sigma-unital
C*-algebra. Theorem 1.4 reformulates the definition given by Frank and Larson
in terms of a series of rank-one operators converging in the strict topology.
Theorem 2.2. shows that the frame transform and the frame projection of an
operator valued frame are limits in the strict topology of a series of elements
in the multiplier algebra and hence belong to it. Theorem 3.3 shows that two
operator valued frames are right similar if and only if they share the same
frame projection. Theorem 3.4 establishes a one to one correspondence between
Murray-von Neumann equivalence classes of projections in the multiplier algebra
and right similarity equivalence classes of operator valued frames and provides
a parametrization of all Parseval operator-valued frames on a given Hilbert
C*-module. Left similarity is then defined and Proposition 3.9 establishes when
two left unitarily equivalent frames are also right unitarily equivalent.

Boundary Condition (HBC) method, where anti-periodic and periodic boundary
conditions are imposed on quarks and antiquarks, respectively. By applying HBC
on a finite-volume lattice, the threshold of the two-meson scattering state is
raised up, while the mass of a compact 4Q resonance is almost unchanged.In HBC,
the lowest 4Q state appears slightly below the two-meson threshold. To clarify
the nature of the 4Q system, we apply the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) for the
4Q correlator and obtain the spectral function of the 4Q system.From the
combination analysis of MEM with HBC, we finally conclude that the 4Q system

quantum amplitudes have been evaluated for bosonic and fermionic fields,
showing that no information is lost in collapse to a black hole. On the other
hand, recent developments in noncommutative geometry have shown that, in
general relativity, the effects of non-commutativity can be taken into account
by keeping the standard form of the Einstein tensor on the left-hand side of
the field equations and introducing a modified energy-momentum tensor as a
source on the right-hand side. Relying on the recently obtained
non-commutativity effect on a static, spherically symmetric metric, we have
considered from a new perspective the quantum amplitudes in black hole
evaporation. The general relativity analysis of spin-2 amplitudes has been
shown to be modified by a multiplicative factor F depending on a constant
non-commutativity parameter and on the upper limit R of the radial coordinate.
Limiting forms of F have been derived which are compatible with the adiabatic
approximation.

immense, and there is a connection with the study of relic gravitational waves

One part of the paper is essentially a detailed justification of the very
existence of relic gravitational waves, account of their properties related to
the quantum-mechanical origin, derivation of the expected magnitude of their
effects, and reasoning why they should be detectable in the relatively near
future. This line of argument includes the comparison of relic gravitational
waves with density perturbations of quantum-mechanical origin, and the severe
criticism of methods and predictions of inflationary theory. Another part of
the paper is devoted to active searches for relic gravitational waves in cosmic
microwave background radiation (CMB). Here, the emphasis is on the
temperature-polarization TE cross-correlation function of CMB. The expected
numerical level of the correlation, its sign, statistics, and the most
appropriate interval of angular scales are identified. Other correlation
functions are also considered. The overall conclusion is such that the
observational discovery of relic gravitational waves looks like the matter of a
few coming years, rather than a few decades.

streptavidin-coated sphere (i.e. anchor sphere) one by one using an XYZ piezo
scanner controlled by a haptic device. The positions of all spheres in the
scene are detected using a CCD camera and a collision-free path for each
manipulated sphere is generated using the potential field approach. The forces
acting on the manipulated particle due to the viscosity of the fluid and the
artificial potential field are scaled and displayed to the user through the
haptic device for better guidance and control during steering. In addition, a
virtual fixture is implemented such that the desired angle of approach and
strength are achieved during the binding phase. Our experimental studies in
virtual and real environments with 8 human subjects show that haptic feedback
significantly improves the user performance by reducing the task completion
time, the number of undesired collisions during steering, and the positional
errors during binding. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a haptic
device is coupled with OT to guide the user during an optical manipulation task
involving steering and assembly of microspheres to construct a coupled
microresonator.

to be an important method of indirect dark matter detection. In the case of
circular particle orbits, the density profile of dark matter has a plateau at
small radii, the maximal density being limited by the annihilation
cross-section. However, in the general case of arbitrary velocity anisotropy
the situation is different. Particulary, for isotropic velocity distribution
the density profile cannot be shallower than r^{-1/2} in the very centre.
Indeed, a detailed study reveals that in many cases the term ``annihilation
plateau'' is misleading, as the density actually continues to rise towards
small radii and forms a weak cusp, rho ~ r^{-(beta+1/2)}, where beta is the
anisotropy coefficient. The annihilation flux, however, does not change much in
the latter case, if averaged over an area larger than the annihilation radius.

QSOs at z>5 aimed at detecting molecular gas in their host galaxies as traced
by CO transitions. CO (5-4) is detected in SDSSJ033829.31+002156.3 at z=5.0267,
placing it amongst the most distant sources detected in CO. The CO emission is
unresolved with a beam size of ~1"", implying that the molecular gas is
contained within a compact region, less than ~3kpc in radius. We infer an upper
limit on the dynamical mass of the CO emitting region of ~3x10^10
Msun/sin(i)^2. The comparison with the Black Hole mass inferred from near-IR
data suggests that the BH-to-bulge mass ratio in this galaxy is significantly
higher than in local galaxies. From the CO luminosity we infer a mass reservoir
of molecular gas as high as M(H2)=2.4x10^10 Msun, implying that the molecular
gas accounts for a significant fraction of the dynamical mass. When compared to
the star formation rate derived from the far-IR luminosity, we infer a very
short gas exhaustion timescale (~10^7 yrs), comparable to the dynamical
timescale. CO is not detected in the other two QSOs (SDSSJ083643.85+005453.3

content. When combined with CO observations of other type 1 AGNs, spanning a
wide redshift range (0<z<6.4), we find that the host galaxy CO luminosity
(hence molecular gas content) and the AGN optical luminosity (hence BH
accretion rate) are correlated, but the relation is not linear: L(CO) ~
[lambda*L_lambda(4400A)]^0.72. Moreover, at high redshifts (and especially at
z>5) the CO luminosity appears to saturate. We discuss the implications of
these findings in terms of black hole-galaxy co-evolution.

  physics","74 pages, Review based on Talks",,,,"hep-ph astro-ph gr-qc hep-th",,"  In this brief review we will discuss how a well motivated particle theory
beyond the eletroweak Standard Model provides ingredients and conditions for a
successful inflation. We will mainly focus on a low energy supersymmetric
Standard Model which provides plenty of scalars. In particular, these scalars
span a multidimensional moduli space of {\it gauge invariant} operators which
carry the Standard Model charges. The inflationary predictions which matches
the current observations are robust due to the fact that inflation occurs
within our own gauge sector where the couplings are well known. We further
argue that based on our current understandings if there exists a {\it string
landscape} of multiple vacua, then it is very natural that the last phase of
inflation would be driven by one of the many supersymmetric Standard Model
modulii. Only such a graceful exit from inflation would provide hot thermal
Standard Model baryons, cold dark matter, conditions for baryogenesis and
foremost the seed density perturbations for the cosmic microwave background
radiation in just {\it one package}. Furthermore we will also discuss how some
of the ingredients of inflation can be tested already by the LHC.

significantly improved by asymmetric couplings, and increase of coupling
gradient is always in favor of network synchronization. Here we argue and
demonstrate that, for typical complex networks, there usually exists an optimal

achieved. After this optimal value, increase of coupling gradient could
deteriorate synchronization. We attribute the suppression of network
synchronization at large gradient to the phenomenon of network breaking, and
find that, in comparing with sparsely connected homogeneous networks, densely
connected heterogeneous networks have the superiority of adopting large

power, Bondi rate and the kinetic luminosity of sub-Eddington active galactic
nuclear (AGN) jets. Besides the recently discovered correlation between jet
kinetic and Bondi power, we show that a clear correlation exists also between
Eddington-scaled kinetic power and bolometric luminosity, given by:
Log(L_kin/L_Edd)=0.49*Log(L_bol/L_Edd)-0.78. The measured slope suggests that
these objects are in a radiatively inefficient accretion mode, and has been
used to put stringent constraints on the properties of the accretion flow. We
found no statistically significant correlations between Bondi power and
bolometric AGN luminosity, apart from that induced by their common dependence
on L_kin. Analyzing the relation between kinetic power and radio core
luminosity, we are then able to determine, statistically, both the probability
distribution of the mean jets Lorentz factor, peaking at \Gamma~7, and the
intrinsic relation between kinetic and radio core luminosity, that we estimate
as: Log(L_kin)=0.81*Log(L_R)+11.9, in good agreement with theoretical
predictions of synchrotron jet models. With the aid of these findings,
quantitative assessments of kinetic feedback from supermassive black holes in
the radio mode will be possible based on accurate determinations of the central
engine properties alone. As an example, Sgr A* may follow the correlations of
radio mode AGN, based on its observed radiative output and on estimates of the
accretion rate both at the Bondi radius and in the inner flow. If this is the
case, the SMBH in the Galactic center is the source of ~ 5 times 10^38 ergs/s
of mechanical power, equivalent to about 1.5 supernovae every 10^5 years.

collisional rates between objects in an external resonance are by about a
factor of two higher than those in a similar belt of objects not locked in a

profile evolution of a free surface film of a binary mixture. An example is a
thin film of a polymer blend on a solid substrate undergoing simultaneous phase
separation and dewetting. The model is based on model-H describing the coupled
transport of the mass of one component (convective Cahn-Hilliard equation) and
momentum (Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations) supplemented by appropriate
boundary conditions at the solid substrate and the free surface.
  General transport equations are derived using phenomenological
non-equilibrium thermodynamics for a general non-isothermal setting taking into
account Soret and Dufour effects and interfacial viscosity for the internal
diffuse interface between the two components. Focusing on an isothermal setting
the resulting model is compared to literature results and its base states
corresponding to homogeneous or vertically stratified flat layers are analysed.

account the impact of infalling gas on both the star formation history and the
corresponding outflow structure, the apparition of a supernovae-driven wind
being highly sensitive to the halo mass, the galaxy spin and the star formation
efficiency. We model our galaxies as cooling and collapsing NFW spheres. The
dark matter component is modelled as a static external potential, while the
baryon component is described by the Euler equations using the AMR code RAMSES.
Metal-dependent cooling and supernovae-heating are also implemented using
state-of-the-art recipes coming from cosmological simulations. We allow for 3
parameters to vary: the halo circular velocity, the spin parameter and the star
formation efficiency. We found that the ram pressure of infalling material is
the key factor limiting the apparition of galactic winds. We obtain a very low
feedback efficiency, with supernovae to wind energy conversion factor around
one percent, so that only low cicrular velocity galaxies give rise to strong
winds. For massive galaxies, we obtain a galatic fountain, for which we discuss
the observational properties. We conclude that for quiescent isolated galaxies,
galactic winds appear only in very low mass systems. Although that can quite
efficiently enrich the IGM with metals, they don't carry away enough cold
material to solve the overcooling problem.

for converting observed CO line widths into the stellar velocity dispersion of
the bulge (sigma), and then apply it to a sample of low-redshift (z < 0.2) and
high-redshift (1.4 < z < 6.4) quasars to study their host galaxies. Nearby
quasars roughly fall on the correlation between black hole mass and bulge
stellar velocity dispersion established for inactive galaxies, but the host
galaxies of the high-z quasars systematically deviate from the local M_BH-sigma
relation. At a given sigma, high-z quasars have black hole masses larger by a
factor of 4 relative to local galaxies, suggesting that early in the life-cycle
of galaxies the development of the bulge lags behind the growth of the central
black hole. An alternative explanation for these observations, which currently
cannot be ruled out rigorously, is that high-redshift quasars are
preferentially viewed at face-on orientations.
