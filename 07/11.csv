further consolidated by proving that the conditions of remote parameter
independence and remote outcome independence are duly respected within the
recently constructed exact, local realistic model for the EPR-Bohm
correlations. Since the conjunction of these two conditions is equivalent to
the locality condition of Bell, this provides an independent geometric proof of
the local causality of the model, at the level of microstates. In addition to
local causality, the model respects at least seven other conceptual and
operational requirements, arising either from the predictions of quantum
mechanics or the premises of Bell's theorem, including the Malus's law for
sequential spin measurements. Since the agreement between the predictions of
the model and those of quantum mechanics is quantitatively precise in all
respects, the ensemble interpretation of the entangled singlet state becomes
amenable.

plasma collective effect among the ordinary matter would suppress the large
scale structure formation. The imperfect Debye shielding at finite temperature
would induce a residual long-range electrostatic potential which, working
together with the baryon thermal pressure, would counter the gravitational
collapse. As a result the effective Jean's length, $\tilde{\lambda}_J$, is
increased by a factor, $\tilde{\lambda}_J/\lambda_J=\sqrt{8/5}$, relative to
the conventional one. For scales smaller than the effective Jean's scale the
plasma would oscillate at the ion-acoustic frequency. The modes that would be
influenced by this effect depend on the starting time and the initial
temperature of reionization, but roughly lie in the range $0.5 h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}<
k$, which corresponds to the region of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest from the
inter-galactic medium. We predict that in the linear regime of density-contrast
growth, the plasma suppression of the matter power spectrum would approach
$1-(\Omega_{dm}/\Omega_m)^2\sim 1-(5/6)^2\sim 30%$.

electron-phonon coupling in electron-doped graphene using electron-phonon
matrix elements extracted from density functional theory simulations. From the
electron self-energies we calculate angle resolved photoemission spectra. We
demonstrate that the measured kink at $\approx -0.2$ eV from the Fermi level is
actually composed of two features, one at $\approx -0.195$ eV due to the
twofold degenerate E$_{2g}$ mode, and a second one at $\approx -0.16$ eV due to
the A$_{1}^{'}$ mode. The electron-phonon coupling extracted from the kink
observed in ARPES experiments is roughly a factor of 5.5 larger than the
calculated one. This disagreement can only be partially reconciled by the
inclusion of resolution effects. Indeed we show that a finite resolution
increases the apparent electron-phonon coupling by underestimating the
renormalization of the electron velocity at energies larger than the kinks
positions. The discrepancy between theory and experiments is thus reduced to a
factor of $\approx$ 2.2. From the linewidth of the calculated ARPES spectra we
obtain the electron relaxation time. A comparison with available experimental
data in graphene shows that the electron relaxation time detected in ARPES is
almost two orders of magnitudes smaller than what measured by other
experimental techniques.

be reconstructed with significant error. This error manifests itself as
opposite, in respect to the true sign of even low multipole modes, and leads to
significant changes of the coefficient of cross-correlation with the
foreground. We show that the CMB realizations, whose the sign of quadrupole

corresponding probability to get the positive sign after implementation of the

been identified as AGN by the detected optical emission lines. Using a large
sample of 795 supercluster galaxies we define control samples of massive
galaxies with no detected AGN. The local environments of the AGN and control
samples differ at >98 per cent significance. The AGN host galaxies lie
predominantly in areas of moderate projected galaxy density and with more local
blue galaxies than the control sample, with the exception of one very bright
Type I AGN very near the centre of a cluster. These environments are similar
to, but not limited to, cluster outskirts and blue groups. Despite the large
number of potential host galaxies, no AGN are found in regions with the highest
galaxy density (excluding some cluster cores where emission from the ICM
obscures moderate luminosity AGN). AGN are also absent from the areas with
lowest galaxy density. We conclude that the prevalence of cluster AGN is linked
to their environment.

emission lines, a substantial fraction (likely as high as 30%) of nearby red
sequence galaxy spectra contain emission lines with line ratios characteristic
of low ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs). We use spectra of
~6000 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in a narrow redshift
slice (0.06 < z < 0.08) to compare the stellar populations of red sequence
galaxies with and without LINER-like emission. The spectra are binned by
internal velocity dispersion and by emission properties to produce high S/N
stacked spectra. The recent stellar population models of R. Schiavon (2007)
make it possible to measure ages, [Fe/H], and individual elemental abundance
ratios [Mg/Fe], [C/Fe], [N/Fe], and [Ca/Fe] for each of the stacked spectra. We
find that red sequence galaxies with strong LINER-like emission are
systematically 2-3.5 Gyr (10-40%) younger than their emission-free counterparts
at the same velocity dispersion. This suggests a connection between the
mechanism powering the emission (whether AGN, post-AGB stars, shocks, or
cooling flows) and more recent star formation in the galaxy. We find that mean
stellar age and [Fe/H] increase with velocity dispersion for all galaxies.
Elemental abundance [Mg/Fe] increases modestly with velocity dispersion in
agreement with previous results, and [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] increase more strongly
with velocity dispersion than does [Mg/Fe]. [Ca/Fe] appears to be roughly solar
for all galaxies. At fixed velocity dispersion, galaxies with fainter r-band
luminosities have lower [Fe/H] and older ages but similar abundance ratios
compared to brighter galaxies.

in metals measure two competing physical phenomena. Electrons interact with the

Knight shift, (ii) as moving electric charges, resulting in the chemical (or
orbital) shift. The latter is treated through an extension to metals of the
Gauge Invariant Projector Augment Wave(GIPAW) developed for insulators. The
former is modeled as the hyperfine interaction between the electronic spin
polarization and the nuclear dipoles. NMR shifts are obtained with respect to
the computed shieldings of reference compounds, yielding fully ab-initio
quantities which are directly comparable to experiment. The method is validated
by comparing the magnetic susceptibility of interacting and non-interacting
homogeneous gas with known analytical results, and by comparing the computed

algorithms obtain information about a poset by queries that compare two
elements. We present an algorithm that sorts, i.e. completely identifies, a
width w poset of size n and has query complexity O(wn + nlog(n)), which is
within a constant factor of the information-theoretic lower bound. We also show
that a variant of Mergesort has query complexity O(wn(log(n/w))) and total
complexity O((w^2)nlog(n/w)). Faigle and Tur\'{a}n have shown that the sorting
problem has query complexity O(wn(log(n/w))) but did not address its total
complexity.
  For the related problem of determining the minimal elements of a poset, we
give efficient deterministic and randomized algorithms with O(wn) query and
total complexity, along with matching lower bounds for the query complexity up
to a factor of 2. We generalize these results to the k-selection problem of

epoch of its evolution. This assumption may lead to very different
observational consequences compared to the case of a standard cosmology where
the energy density of the Universe is dominated by radiation. We show that,
depending on the choice of the temperature T_r above which kination dominates

regime are equally viable for leptogenesis, even with the RHN Yukawa coupling
fixed to provide the observed atmospheric neutrino mass scale ~ 0.05 eV. For M<

violation in the RHN decay, can be larger than in the standard scenario of
radiation domination. This possibility is limited to the case when the neutrino
mass scale is larger than about 0.01 eV. The super--weak wash--out regime is
obtained for T_r << M/100, and includes the case when T_r is close to the
nucleosynthesis temperature ~ 1 MeV. Irrespective of T_r, we always find a
sufficient window above the electroweak temperature T ~ 100 GeV for the
sphaleron transition to thermalize, so that the lepton asymmetry can always be
converted to the observed baryon asymmetry.

degrees of freedom far away from the chemical potential. The exact low-energy
theory contains degrees of freedom that cannot be obtained from projective
schemes. In particular a new charge $\pm 2e$ bosonic field emerges at low
energies that is not made out of elemental excitations. Such a field accounts
for dynamical spectral weight transfer across the Mott gap. At half-filling, we
show that two such excitations emerge which play a crucial role in preserving
the Luttinger surface along which the single-particle Green function vanishes.
In addition, the interactions with the bosonic fields defeat the artificial
local SU(2) symmetry that is present in the Heisenberg model. We also apply
this method to the Anderson-U impurity and show that in addition to the Kondo
interaction, bosonic degrees of freedom appear as well. Finally, we show that
as a result of the bosonic degree of freedom, the electron at low energies is
in a linear superposition of two excitations--one arising from the standard
projection into the low-energy sector and the other from the binding of a hole
and the boson.

inhomogeniety is considered to be an outcome of the formation of orbital domain
state of e$_g$-electrons having hole rich (metallic) walls separating the hole
deficient (insulating) regions. The resulting complexity brings in
metastability and glassy behaviour within the FM phase at low temperature,
however, with no resemblance to spin glass, cluster glass or reentrant phases.
It shows ageing effect without memory but magnetic relaxation shows signatures
of inter-cluster interaction. The energy landscape picture of this glassy phase
is described in terms of hierarchical model. Further, it is shown that this
inhomogeneity disappear in La${_{0.9}}$Sr$_{0.1}$MnO$_{3.08}$ where, the
orbital domain state is destroyed by self doping resulting in reduction of
Mn$^{3+}$ and hence e$_g$-electrons. The ferromagnetic phase of the

inhomogeneous systems. Its magnetic response can be explained simply from the

that such false positives are unlikely on any planet that possesses abundant
liquid water, as rainout of oxidized species onto a reduced planetary surface
should ensure that atmospheric H2 concentrations remain relatively high, and
that O2 and O3 remain low. Our aim is to determine the amount of O3 and O2
formed in a high CO2 atmosphere for a habitable planet without life. We use a
photochemical model that considers hydrogen (H2) escape and a detailed hydrogen
balance to calculate the O2 and O3 formed on planets with 0.2 of CO2 around the
Sun, and 0.02, 0.2 and 2 bars of CO2 around a young Sun-like star with higher
UV radiation. The concentrations obtained by the photochemical model were used
as input in a radiative transfer model that calculated the spectra of the
modeled planets. The O3 and O2 concentrations in the simulated planets are
extremely small, and unlikely to produce a detectable signature in the spectra
of those planets. We conclude that with a balanced hydrogen budget, and for
planets with an active hydrological cycle, abiotic formation of O2 and O3 is
unlikely to create a possible false positive for life detection in either the

result of galaxy evolution during these epochs. However, using the UV continuum

the most probable state of this model corresponds to the usual equilibrium
distribution of the lattice Boltzmann equation. Thermal fluctuations about this
equilibrium are controlled by the mean number of particles at a lattice site.
Stochastic collision rules are described by a Monte Carlo process satisfying
detailed balance. This allows for a straightforward derivation of discrete
Langevin equations for the fluctuating modes. It is shown that all
non-conserved modes should be thermalized, as first pointed out by Adhikari et
al.; any other choice violates the condition of detailed balance. A
Chapman-Enskog analysis is used to derive the equations of fluctuating
hydrodynamics on large length and time scales; the level of fluctuations is
shown to be thermodynamically consistent with the equation of state of an
isothermal, ideal gas. We believe this formalism will be useful in developing
new algorithms for thermal and multiphase flows.

companion on both the real, and the observed apsidal motion period. We
investigate how the observed period derived mainly from some variants of the
O-C relates to the real apsidal motion period. We carried out both analytical
and numerical investigations and give the time variations of the orbital
elements of the binary both in the dynamical and the observational reference
frames. We give the direct analytical form of an eclipsing O-C affected
simultaneously by the mutual tidal forces and the gravitational interactions
with a tertiary. We also integrated numerically simultaneously the orbital and
rotational equations for the possible hierarchical triple stellar system AS
Camelopardalis. We find that there is a significant domain of the possible
hierarchical triple system configurations, where both the dynamical and the
observational effects tend to measure longer apsidal advance rate than is
expected theoretically. This happens when the mutual inclination of the close

coincides with the plane of the sky. We also obtain new numerical results on
the interaction of the orbital evolution and stellar rotation in such triplets.
The most important fact is that resonances might occur as the stellar

cosmological large-scale structure by relating the non-linear spectrum of
cosmological density fluctuations to the linear primordial power at longer
wavelengths. Here we generalize this approach to investigate the usefulness of
scale transformations for nonlinear higher-order statistics, specifically the
bispectrum. We find that the bispectrum predicted by perturbation theory at
tree-level can be rescaled to match the results of full numerical simulations
in the weakly and intermediately nonlinear regimes, especially at high
redshifts, with an accuracy that is surprising given the simplicity of the
procedure used. This discovery not only offers a simple practical way of
calculating the matter bispectrum, but also suggests that scale transformations
may yet yield even deeper insights into the physics of hierarchical clustering.

mathematics. First, we describe numerical methods for the acceleration of the
convergence of series. These provide a useful toolbox for theoretical physics
which has hitherto not received the attention it actually deserves. The
unifying concept for convergence acceleration methods is that in many cases,
one can reach much faster convergence than by adding a particular series term
by term. In some cases, it is even possible to use a divergent input series,
together with a suitable sequence transformation, for the construction of
numerical methods that can be applied to the calculation of special functions.
This review both aims to provide some practical guidance as well as a
groundwork for the study of specialized literature. As a second topic, we
review some recent developments in the field of Borel resummation, which is
generally recognized as one of the most versatile methods for the summation of
factorially divergent (perturbation) series. Here, the focus is on algorithms
which make optimal use of all information contained in a finite set of
perturbative coefficients. The unifying concept for the various aspects of the
Borel method investigated here is given by the singularities of the Borel
transform, which introduce ambiguities from a mathematical point of view and
lead to different possible physical interpretations. The two most important
cases are: (i) the residues at the singularities correspond to the decay width
of a resonance, and (ii) the presence of the singularities indicates the
existence of nonperturbative contributions which cannot be accounted for on the
basis of a Borel resummation and require generalizations toward resurgent
expansions. Both of these cases are illustrated by examples.

of a usual monad and a distributive law between the monad and the action of C,
morphisms of monads respecting the distributive law, and transformations of
monads satisfying some compatibility with the actions and distributive laws
involved. The monads in this picture may be generalized to actions of monoidal
categories, and actions of PRO-s in particular. If C is a PRO as well, then in
special cases one gets various distributive laws of a given classical type, for
example between a comonad and an endofunctor or between a monad and a comonad.
The usual pentagons are in general replaced by multigons, and there are also
``mixed'' multigons involving two distinct distributive laws. Beck's bijection
between the distributive laws and lifts of one monad to the Eilenberg-Moore

of temperatures below and above their respective dynamical transition. The
system is modeled in two distinct states whereby the protein is decoupled from
the bulk solvent at low temperatures, and communicates with it through a
vicinal layer at physiological temperatures. A linear viscoelastic model
elucidates the less-than-expected increase in the relaxation times observed in
the backbone dynamics of the protein. The model further explains the increase
in the flexibility of the protein once the transition takes place and the
differences in the flexibility under the different solvent environments.
Coupling between the vicinal layer and the protein fluctuations is necessary to
interpret these observations. The vicinal layer is postulated to form once a
threshold for the volumetric fluctuations in the protein to accommodate
solvents of different sizes is reached. Compensation of entropic-energetic
contributions from the protein-coupled vicinal layer quantifies the scaling of
the dynamical transition temperatures in various solvents. The protein adapts
different conformational routes for organizing the required coupling to a
specific solvent, which is achieved by adjusting the amount of conformational
jumps in the surface-group dihedrals.

probably located in the immediate vicinity of the black hole. The mechanisms at
work in this so called Compton corona can be unveiled through hard X-ray

different spectral states are observed suggesting that the nature and geometry
of the corona depends on mass accretion rate. In many instances the spectral
behaviour as a function of luminosity shows some degree of hysteresis. The
mechanisms triggering the transition between spectral states is very unclear
although it could be related to an evaporation/condensation equilibrium in an
accretion disc corona system. From the observation of correlation between the

attracting, slow manifolds in systems of differential equations with multiple

the m-th member of the class of algorithms (m = 0, 1, ...) finds iteratively an
approximation of the appropriate zero of the (m+1)-st time derivative of the
remaining variables and uses this root to approximate the location of the point
on the slow manifold corresponding to these values of the observables. This
article is the first of two articles in which the accuracy and convergence of
the iterative algorithms are analyzed. Here, we work directly with explicit
fast--slow systems, in which there is an explicit small parameter, epsilon,
measuring the separation of time scales. We show that, for each m = 0, 1, ...,
the fixed point of the iterative algorithm approximates the slow manifold up to
and including terms of O(epsilon^m). Moreover, for each m, we identify
explicitly the conditions under which the m-th iterative algorithm converges to
this fixed point. Finally, we show that when the iteration is unstable (or
converges slowly) it may be stabilized (or its convergence may be accelerated)

Newton-Krylov Generalized Minimal Residual Method may be used. In the

examined, (a) its augmentation by an LDA for short-range correlation, (b) its
combination with the second order exchange term, and (c) its combination with a
partial resummation of the perturbation series including the second order
exchange. It is found that the ground state and correlation energies as well as
the ionization potentials resulting from the extensions (a) and (c) for closed
sub-shell atoms are clearly superior to those obtained with the unmodified RPA.
Quite some effort is made to ensure highly converged RPA data, so that the
results may serve as benchmark data. The numerical techniques developed in this
context, in particular for the inherent frequency integration, should also be
useful for applications of RPA-type functionals to more complex systems.

  Patterns",,,,,"cs.HC cs.GR",,"  Space time cube representation is an information visualization technique
where spatiotemporal data points are mapped into a cube. Fast and correct
analysis of such information is important in for instance geospatial and social
visualization applications. Information visualization researchers have
previously argued that space time cube representation is beneficial in
revealing complex spatiotemporal patterns in a dataset to users. The argument
is based on the fact that both time and spatial information are displayed
simultaneously to users, an effect difficult to achieve in other
representations. However, to our knowledge the actual usefulness of space time
cube representation in conveying complex spatiotemporal patterns to users has
not been empirically validated. To fill this gap we report on a
between-subjects experiment comparing novice users error rates and response
times when answering a set of questions using either space time cube or a
baseline 2D representation. For some simple questions the error rates were
lower when using the baseline representation. For complex questions where the
participants needed an overall understanding of the spatiotemporal structure of
the dataset, the space time cube representation resulted in on average twice as
fast response times with no difference in error rates compared to the baseline.
These results provide an empirical foundation for the hypothesis that space
time cube representation benefits users when analyzing complex spatiotemporal
patterns.

used to acquire visible spectra at six epochs between 2004 August and 2006
July, following the evolution of the SN from age 661 to 1358 days. Few optical
spectra of Type II supernovae with ages greater than one year exist. In
addition, g'r'i' images were acquired at all six epochs. The spectral and
photometric evolution of SN 2002hh has been very unusual. Measures of the
brightness of this SN, both in the R and I bands as well as in the H-alpha
emission flux, show no significant fading over an interval of nearly two years.
The most straightforward explanation for this behavior is that the light being
measured comes not only from the SN itself but also from an echo off of nearby
dust. Echoes have been detected previously around several SNe but these echoes,
at their brightest, were ~8 mag below the maximum brightness of the SN. At V~21
mag, the putative echo dominates the light of SN 2002hh and is only ~4 mag
below the outburst's peak brightness. There is an estimated 6 magnitudes of
total extinction in V towards SN 2002hh. The proposed explanation of a
differential echo/SN absorption is inconsistent with the observed BVRI colors.

much simpler than the full N=4 SYM but still contain many of its interesting
features. The decoupling limits correspond to being in a near-critical region,
near a point with zero temperature and critical chemical potentials. The new
decoupling limits are found by generalizing the limits of hep-th/0605234 to
include not only the chemical potentials for the SU(4) R-symmetry of N=4 SYM
but also the chemical potentials corresponding to the SO(4) symmetry. In the
decoupled theories it is possible to take a strong coupling limit in a
controllable manner since the full effective Hamiltonian is known. For planar
N=4 SYM on R x S^3 all the decoupled theories correspond to fully integrable
spin chains. We study the thermodynamics of the decoupled theories and find the
Hagedorn temperature for small and large values of the effective coupling. We
find an alternative formulation of the decoupling limits in the microcanonical
ensemble. This leads to a characterization of certain regimes of weakly coupled
N=4 SYM in which there are string-like states. Finally, we find a similar
decoupling limit for pure Yang-Mills theory, which for the planar limit leads
to a fully integrable decoupled theory.

  The main principle exploiting interface groups is that when composing a
closed system of a collection of interacting components, the sum of their
interfaces must vanish in the interface group modulo reflection. This certainly
matters for financial transfer interfaces.
  As an example of this, we specify an interface group and within it some
specific interfaces concerning the financial transfer architecture for a part
of our local academic organization.
  Financial transfer interface groups arise as a special case of more general
service architecture interfaces.

measure ${\bf p}=(p_i: {i\in{\cal I}})$ and throws balls independently at
random in boxes labeled by ${\cal I}$, such that $p_i$ is the probability that
a given ball falls into the box $i$. In this work, we are interested in
asymptotic regimes of this scheme in the situation induced by a refining
sequence $({\bf p}(k) : k\in\N)$ of random probability measures which arise
from some multiplicative cascade. Our motivation comes from the study of the
asymptotic behavior of certain fragmentation chains

sometimes showing multiple, roughly aligned lobes. In addition, many PPN flows
have been shown to have short acceleration times. In this paper we explore
whether jet or ``bullet'' (a massive clump) models fit the observations of
individual collimated lobes adequately by comparing simulations of both
radiatively cooled (stable) jets and bullets. We find that the clump model is
somewhat favored over jets because (1) it leads to greater collimation of
outflows (2) it accounts better and more naturally for ring-like structures
observed in the PPN CRL 618, and (3) it is more successful in reproducing the
Hubble-flow character of observed kinematics in some PPN. In addition, bullets
naturally account for observed multipolar flows, since the likely MHD launch
mechanisms required to drive outflows make multiple non-aligned jets unlikely.
Thus we argue that PPN outflows may be driven by explosive MHD launch
mechanisms such as those discussed in the context of supernovae (SNe) and
gamma-ray bursts(GRB).

representation system for uncertain databases. U-relations support
attribute-level uncertainty using vertical partitioning. If we consider
positive relational algebra extended by an operation for computing possible
answers, a query on the logical level can be translated into, and evaluated as,
a single relational algebra query on the U-relation representation. The
translation scheme essentially preserves the size of the query in terms of
number of operations and, in particular, number of joins. Standard techniques
employed in off-the-shelf relational database management systems are effective
for optimizing and processing queries on U-relations. In our experiments we
show that query evaluation on U-relations scales to large amounts of data with
high degrees of uncertainty.

complements and expands the concept of overlapping community structure. Our
approach allows each vertex of the graph to belong to multiple communities at
the same time, determined by exact numerical membership degrees, even in the
presence of uncertainty in the data being analyzed. We created an algorithm for
determining the optimal membership degrees with respect to a given goal
function. Based on the membership degrees, we introduce a new measure that is
able to identify outlier vertices that do not belong to any of the communities,
bridge vertices that belong significantly to more than one single community,
and regular vertices that fundamentally restrict their interactions within
their own community, while also being able to quantify the centrality of a
vertex with respect to its dominant community. The method can also be used for
prediction in case of uncertainty in the dataset analyzed. The number of
communities can be given in advance, or determined by the algorithm itself
using a fuzzified variant of the modularity function. The technique is able to
discover the fuzzy community structure of different real world networks
including, but not limited to social networks, scientific collaboration
networks and cortical networks with high confidence.

roughly 5 times larger for f_{WI} than for f_{NL}. Using 3 year WMAP data gives
