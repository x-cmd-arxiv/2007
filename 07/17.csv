which is the equal mixture of the Giddings-Marolf states that are
asymptotically single de Sitter spacetimes in both past and future and are
regular on the throat or neck of minimal three-volume. That is, states are
excluded that have a big bang or big crunch or which split into multiple
asymptotic de Sitter spacetimes. (For simplicity, transitions between different
values of the cosmological constant are assumed not to occur, though different
positive values are allowed.) The entropy of this mixed state appears to be of
the order of the three-fourths power of the Bekenstein-Hawking A/4 entropy of
de Sitter spacetime. Most of the component pure states do not have rapid
inflation, but when an inflaton is present and the states are weighted by the
volume at the end of inflation, a much smaller number of states may dominate
and give a large amount of inflation and hence may agree with observations.

us to fix all the freedom in the three-particle S-matrix, which we argue to be
constrained up to four scalar functions due to the symmetries of the model. We
demonstrate that these amplitudes are given by corresponding products of the
known two-particle S-matrix elements, from which it follows that the scattering
of any three world-sheet excitations factorizes. This provides an explicit and
direct check of the quantum integrability of string theory in near-flat AdS_5 x

computing further amplitudes we also obtain an indirect confirmation of the
supersymmetries of the near-flat-space model.

Spitzer (MIPS) 160 micron channel. After the on-orbit discovery of a near-IR

adopted a strategy utilizing asteroids to transfer the absolute calibrations of
the MIPS 24 and 70 micron channels to the 160 micron channel. Near-simultaneous
observations at all three wavelengths are taken, and photometry at the two
shorter wavelengths is fit using the Standard Thermal Model. The 160 micron
flux density is predicted from those fits and compared with the observed 160
micron signal to derive the conversion from instrumental units to surface
brightness. The calibration factor we derive is 41.7 MJy/sr/MIPS160 (MIPS160
being the instrumental units). The scatter in the individual measurements of
the calibration factor, as well as an assesment of the external uncertainties
inherent in the calibration, lead us to adopt an uncertainty of 5.0
MJy/sr/MIPS160 (12%) for the absolute uncertainty on the 160 micron flux
density of a particular source as determined from a single measurement. For
sources brighter than about 2 Jy, non-linearity in the response of the 160
micron detectors produces an under-estimate of the flux density: for objects as
bright as 4 Jy, measured flux densities are likely to be ~20% too low. This
calibration has been checked against that of ISO (using ULIRGS) and IRAS (using
IRAS-derived diameters), and is consistent with those at the 5% level.

quantum mechanics are the two most pressing problems in all of gravitational
theory. While string theory nicely addresses the latter, it has so far failed
to provide any compelling solution to the former. On the other hand, while
conformal gravity nicely addresses the cosmological constant problem (by
naturally quenching the amount by which the cosmological constant gravitates
rather than by quenching the cosmological constant itself), the fourth order
derivative conformal theory has long been thought to possess a ghost when
quantized. However, it has recently been shown by Bender and Mannheim that not
only do theories based on fourth order derivative equations of motion not have
ghosts, they actually never had any to begin with, with the apparent presence
of ghosts being due entirely to treating operators which were not Hermitian on
the real axis as though they were. When this is taken care of via an underlying
$\cal P$$\cal T$ symmetry that such theories are found to possess, there are
then no ghosts at all and the $S$-matrix is fully unitary. Conformal gravity is
thus advanced as a fully consistent four-dimensional alternative to

5 the number of dust scattering X-ray halos observed around GRBs. Although
these two halos were particularly faint, a sensitive analysis can be performed
that optimizes the method originally developed by Tiengo & Mereghetti (2006) to
analyze dust scattering rings observed with XMM-Newton for the Swift satellite.
In the case of GRB 061019, a known giant molecular cloud is identified as the
one responsible for the scattering process, and its distance is accurately
measured (d=940$\pm$40 pc) through the dynamics of the expanding ring. In the
second case, XRT observed both the main peak of the prompt emission of GRB

prevents us from distinguish between different dust models.

noting that each surface polariton corresponds to a particular Regge pole of

particular surface polariton which corresponds, in the large radius limit, to

  model, new numerical solutions",,"10.1086/521619",,"astro-ph",,"  A number of studies have shown that the convective stability criterion for
the intracluster medium (ICM) is very different from the Schwarzchild criterion
due to the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction and cosmic rays. Building
on these studies, we develop a model of the ICM in which a central active
galactic nucleus (AGN) accretes hot intracluster plasma at the Bondi rate and
produces cosmic rays that cause the ICM to become convectively unstable. The
resulting convection heats the intracluster plasma and regulates its
temperature and density profiles. By adjusting a single parameter in the model
(the size of the cosmic-ray acceleration region), we are able to achieve a good
match to the observed density and temperature profiles in a sample of eight
clusters. Our results suggest that convection is an important process in
cluster cores. An interesting feature of our solutions is that the cooling rate
is more sharply peaked about the cluster center than is the convective heating
rate. As a result, in several of the clusters in our sample, a compact cooling
flow arises in the central region with a size R that is typically a few kpc.
The cooling flow matches onto a Bondi flow at smaller radii. The mass accretion
rate in the Bondi flow is equal to, and controlled by, the rate at which mass
flows in through the cooling flow. Our solutions suggest that the AGN regulates
the mass accretion rate in these clusters by controlling R: if the AGN power
rises above the equilibrium level, R decreases, the mass accretion rate drops,
and the AGN power drops back down to the equilibrium level.

set (or more generally, a word w over the vertex set) that describes the order
in which these local functions are to be applied. In this article we
investigate the special case where Y is a circular graph with n vertices and
all of the local functions are identical. The 256 possible local functions are
known as Wolfram rules and the resulting sequential dynamical systems are
called finite asynchronous elementary cellular automata, or ACAs, since they
resemble classical elementary cellular automata, but with the important
distinction that the vertex functions are applied sequentially rather than in
parallel. An ACA is said to be pi-independent if the set of periodic states
does not depend on the choice of pi, and our main result is that for all n>3

diagrams. We find that ~30% of red sequence galaxies in the optical C-M diagram
show signs of ongoing star-formation from their spectra having EW(Halpha)>2A.
This contamination is greatest at faint magnitudes (Mr>-19) and in field
regions where as many as three-quarters of red sequence galaxies are
star-forming, and as such has important consequences for following the build-up
of the red sequence. We find that the NUV-r colour instead allows a much more
robust separation of passively-evolving and star-forming galaxies, which allows
the build-up of the UV-selected red sequence with redshift and environment to
be directly interpreted in terms of the assembly of stellar mass in
passively-evolving galaxies. We find that in isolated field regions the number
density of UV-optical red sequence galaxies declines rapidly at magnitudes
fainter than Mr~-19 and appears completely truncated at Mr~-18. This confirms
the findings of Haines et al. (2007) that no passively-evolving dwarf galaxies
are found more than two virial radii from a massive halo, whether that be a
group, cluster or massive galaxy. These results support the downsizing paradigm
whereby the red sequence is assembled from the top down, being already largely
in place at the bright end by z~1, and the faint end filled in at later epochs
in clusters and groups through environment-related processes such as
ram-pressure stripping or galaxy harassment.

is close to the solar value. Diagnostic diagram identifies the shocked regions
within this galaxy. The narrow band H$\alpha$ flux and its equivalent width are
used to determine the star formation rates of the complexes and the
distribution of ages. Star formation rates for a few of the complexes are found
to be as high as 0.5 $M_{\odot}$/year. The star forming complexes lie in the
age range 3 Myr to 6.5 Myr. U-B vs V-I colour-colour mixed population model

stellar populations present within these regions. Using this technique, it is
found that the star formation in NGC 1084 has taken place in a series of short
bursts over the last 40 Myr or so. It is proposed that the likely trigger for
enhanced star formation is merger with a gas rich dwarf galaxy.

  asymmetry in molecular conductors","12 pages, 10 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.77.125427",,"cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  We outline the qualitatively different physics behind charging-induced
current asymmetries in molecular conductors operating in the weakly interacting
self-consistent field (SCF) and the strongly interacting Coulomb Blockade (CB)
regimes. A conductance asymmetry arises in SCF because of the unequal
mean-field potentials that shift a closed-shell conducting level differently
for positive and negative bias. A very different current asymmetry arises for
CB due to the unequal number of open-shell excitation channels at opposite bias
voltages. The CB regime, dominated by single charge effects, typically requires
a computationally demanding many-electron or Fock space description. However,
our analysis of molecular Coulomb Blockade measurements reveals that many novel
signatures can be explained using a {{simpler}} orthodox model that involves an
incoherent sum of Fock space excitations and {\it{hence treats the molecule as
a metallic dot or an island}}. This also reduces the complexity of the Fock
space description by just including various charge configurations only, thus
partially underscoring the importance of electronic structure, while retaining
the essence of the single charge nature of the transport process. We finally
point out, however, that the inclusion of electronic structure and hence
well-resolved Fock space excitations is crucial in some notable examples.

evidencing a wind that is partly occulted by the accretion disk. There is weak
red-shifted emission from N V and He II. The profiles of these lines vary

depends on their accretion luminosity and the central black hole mass. We find
that AGNs form two distinct and well separated sequences on the radio-loudness
- Eddington-ratio plane. We argue that these sequences mark the real upper
bounds of radio-loudness of two distinct populations of AGNs: those hosted
respectively by elliptical and disk galaxies. Both sequences show the same
dependence of the radio-loudness on the Eddington ratio (an increase with
decreasing Eddington ratio), which suggests that another parameter in addition
to the accretion rate must play a role in determining the jet production
efficiency in active galactic nuclei, and that this parameter is related to
properties of the host galaxy. The revealed host-related radio dichotomy breaks
down at high accretion rates where the dominant fraction of luminous quasars
hosted by elliptical galaxies is radio quiet. We argue that the huge difference
between the radio-loudness reachable by AGNs in disc and elliptical galaxies
can be explained by the scenario according to which the spin of a black hole
determines the outflow's power, and central black holes can reach large spins
only in early type galaxies (following major mergers), and not (in a

ionized, weakly to moderately coupled plasma, using an exact treatment of the

quantum-mechanical Born approximation to the scattering is valid. At the heart
of this calculation lies the method of dimensional continuation, a technique
that we borrow from quantum field theory and use in a novel fashion to regulate
the kinetic equations in a consistent manner. We can then perform a systematic
perturbation expansion and thereby obtain a finite first-principles result to
leading and next-to-leading order. Unlike model building, this systematic
calculation yields an estimate of its own error and thus prescribes its domain
of applicability. The calculational error is small for a weakly to moderately
coupled plasma, for which our result is nearly exact. It should also be
emphasized that our calculation becomes unreliable for a strongly coupled
plasma, where the perturbative expansion that we employ breaks down, and one
must then utilize model building and computer simulations. Besides providing
new and potentially useful results, we use this calculation as an opportunity
to explain the method of dimensional continuation in a pedagogical fashion.
Interestingly, in the regime of relevance for many inertial confinement fusion
experiments, the degeneracy corrections are comparable in size to the
subleading quantum correction below the Born approximation. For consistency, we
therefore present this subleading quantum-to-classical transition correction in
addition to the degeneracy correction.

giant branch (RGB) stars may also exist. Our new data, once combined with
archival HST/ACS data, provide a deep and uncontaminated optical
color-magnitude diagram (CMD) that now strongly indicates an RGB. The RGB tip
(TRGB) magnitude yields a distance modulus (m-M)_0 = 31.30 +/- 0.17, i.e., D =
18.2 +/- 1.5 Mpc. The time-series nature of our observations allows us to also
detect and characterize for the first time three classical Cepheids in I~Zw~18.
The time-averaged Cepheid <V> and <I> magnitudes are compared to the VI
reddening-free Wesenheit relation predicted from new non-linear pulsation
models specifically calculated at the metallicity of I Zw 18. For the one
bona-fide classical Cepheid with a period of 8.63 days this implies a distance
modulus (m-M)_0 = 31.42 +/- 0.26. The other two Cepheids have unusually long
periods (125.0 and 129.8 d) but are consistent with this distance. The coherent
picture that emerges is that I Zw 18 is older and farther away than previously
believed. This rules out the possibility that I Zw 18 is a truly primordial
galaxy formed recently (z < 0.1) in the local universe.

properties are in general similar to jets seen around T Tauri stars, though it
has a relatively large mass flux of (1.2e-7 +- 0.3e-7) M_sun/year, near the
high end of the observed mass flux range around T Tauri stars. We also
spatially resolve an inclined circumstellar disk around LkHa 233, which

of its intrinsic flux. Because previous estimates of its stellar properties did
not account for this, either LkHa 233 must be located closer than the

supposed, consistent with its being a ~4 M_sun star near the stellar birthline.

limit. Subsequent radiative decay produces high vibrational levels of the
ground state, $X ^1\Sigma_g^+$. The population distribution of these $X$ state
vibrational levels is monitored by resonance-enhanced two-photon ionization
through the $2 ^1\Sigma_u^+$ state. We find that the populations of vibrational
levels $v''$=112$-$116 are far larger than can be accounted for by the
Franck-Condon factors for $0_u^+(P_{1/2}) \to X ^1\Sigma_g^+$ transitions with
the $0_u^+(P_{1/2})$ state treated as a single channel. Further, the
ground-state molecule population exhibits oscillatory behavior as the PA laser
is tuned through a succession of $0_u^+$ state vibrational levels. Both of
these effects are explained by a new calculation of transition amplitudes that
includes the resonant character of the spin-orbit coupling of the two $0_u^+$
states. The resulting enhancement of more deeply bound ground-state molecule
formation will be useful for future experiments on ultracold molecules.

The real data are from DLS photometry and two spectroscopic surveys, and
explore a range of S/N by adding noise to initially very high S/N photometry.
Precision degrades steadily as S/N drops, both because of direct S/N effects
and because lower S/N is linked to fainter galaxies with a weaker magnitude
prior. If a simple S/N cut were used, S/N>17 in R (corresponding, in the DLS,
to lower S/N in other bands) would be required to keep the scatter in Deltaz =
(zspec-zphot)/(1+zspec) to less than 0.1. However, cutting on ODDS (a measure
of the peakiness of the probability density function provided by BPZ) greater
than 0.4 provides roughly double the number of usable galaxies with the same
scatter. Ellipticals form the tightest zspec-zphot relation, and cutting on
type=elliptical provides better precision than the ODDS>0.9 cut, but this
eliminates the vast majority of galaxies in a deep survey. In addition to being
more efficient than a type cut, ODDS also has the advantages of working with

reducing the rms from 12.5 m/s to 6.32 m/s. A false-alarm test yields a 1.1%
probability that the curvature in the residuals of the single-planet fit is due
to random fluctuations, lending additional credibility to the two-planet model.
However, our data only marginally constrain a two-planet fit and further
monitoring is necessary to fully characterize the properties of the second
planet. To study the effect of stellar mass on Jovian planet occurrence we
combine our samples of M stars, Solar-mass dwarfs and intermediate-mass
subgiants. We find a positive correlation between stellar mass and the
occurrence rate of Jovian planets within 2.5 AU; the former A-type stars in our
sample are nearly 5 times more likely than the M dwarfs to harbor a giant
planet. Our analysis shows that the correlation between Jovian planet
occurrence and stellar mass remains even after accounting for the effects of
stellar metallicity.

power-law emission, a heavily absorbed power-law component, cold reflection,
and many emission lines. The heavily absorbed component, absorbed by gas with a
column density of 1.1x10^24 cm^-2, has an intrinsic 2--10 keV luminosity of
~1.6x10^43 erg s^-1, and is considered to be direct emission from the Mrk 3
nucleus. The reflection component was interpreted as reflection of the direct
light off cold, thick material; the reflection fraction $R$ was 1.36+/-0.20.
The cold material is inferred to be located > 1 pc from the central black hole
of Mrk 3 due to the low ionization parameter of iron (xi < 1 erg cm s^-1) and
the narrow iron line width (s < 22 eV). A Compton shoulder to the iron line was
detected, but the intensity of the shoulder component was less than that
expected from spherically distributed Compton-thick material. The weak, soft
power-law emission is considered to be scattered light by ionized gas. The
existence of many highly-ionized lines from O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, and Fe in the
observed spectrum indicates that the ionized gas has a broad ionized structure,
with xi=10--1000. The scattering fraction with respect to the direct light was
estimated to be 0.9+/-0.2%, which indicates that the column density of the
scattering region is about 3.6x10^22 cm^-2. This high-quality spectrum obtained
by Suzaku can be considered a template for studies of Seyfert 2 galaxies.

the dynamics of particle motion. The resulting energy levels of Hydrogen atom
are exactly same as the Dirac theory. The theory accounts for the energy due to
spin-orbit interaction and for the additional potential energy due to spin and
spin-orbit coupling. Spin angular momentum operator is integrated into the
equation of motion. This requires modification to classical Laplacian operator.
Consequently the Dirac matrices and the k operator of Dirac's theory are
dispensed with. The theory points out that the curvature of the orbit draws on
certain amount of kinetic and potential energies affecting the momentum of
electron and the spin-orbit interaction energy constitutes a part of this
energy. The theory is developed for spin 1/2 bound state single electron in
Coulomb potential and then further extended to quarkonium physics by
introducing the linear confining potential. The unique feature of this
quarkonium model is that the radial distance can be exactly determined and does

Moreover, it allows treating condensates containing an axisymmetric vortex with

derive fully analytical expressions for ground-state properties such as the
chemical potential, axial length, axial density profile, and local sound

widely. As an example of pulse-coupled networks, fireflies display many kinds
of flashing patterns. Mirollo and Strogatz (1990) proposed a pulse-coupled
oscillator model to explain the synchronization of South East Asian fireflies
({\itshape Pteroptyx malaccae}). However, transmission delays were not
considered in their model. In fact, the presence of transmission delays can
lead to desychronization. In this paper, pulse-coupled oscillator networks with
delayed excitatory coupling are studied. Our main result is that under
reasonable assumptions, pulse-coupled oscillator networks with delayed
excitatory coupling can not achieve complete synchronization, which can explain
why another species of fireflies ({\itshape Photinus pyralis}) rarely
synchronizes flashing. Finally, two numerical simulations are given. In the
first simulation, we illustrate that even if all the initial phases are very
close to each other, there could still be big variations in the times to
process the pulses in the pipeline. It implies that asymptotical
synchronization typically also cannot be achieved. In the second simulation, we
exhibit a phenomenon of clustering synchronization.

light particle mass scale and the Kaluza-Klein mass scale. Remarkably, when we
take the unbroken limit both the chiral asymmetry and the non-invariant terms
disappear.

emission in the EPIC band is dominated by the intra-cluster medium thermal
emission. We found that the quasar contributes ~35% of the total flux in the
2-10 keV band. Both a transmission- (through a Compton-thin absorber with a
Compton optical depth of \tau_C~0.3, i.e. Nh~5 x 10^{23} cm^-2) and a
reflection-dominated (\tau_C>1) model provide an excellent fit to the quasar
continuum emission. However, the value measured for the EW of Fe Kalpha
emission line is only marginally consistent with the presence of a
Compton-thick absorber in a reflection-dominated scenario, which had been
suggested by a previous, marginal (i.e. 2.5\sigma) detection with the hard
X-ray (15-50 keV), non-imaging BeppoSAX/PDS instrument. Moreover, the value of
luminosity in the 2-10 keV band measured by the transmission-dominated model is
fully consistent with that expected on the basis of the bolometric luminosity
of IRAS 09104+4109. From the analysis of the XMM-Newton data we therefore
suggest the possibility that the absorber along the line of sight to the
nucleus of IRAS 09104+4109 is Compton-thin. Alternatively, the absorber column
density could have changed from Compton-thick to -thin in the five years

stable for a given time step for both models. This means that the time up to
which we can follow the temporal evolution of a given system is larger for the
pseudospectral method. Moreover, for the KPZ model, a pseudospectral scheme
gives results closer to the predictions of the continuum model than those
obtained through finite difference methods. On the other hand, some numerical
instabilities appearing with finite difference methods for the LDV model are
absent when a pseudospectral integration is performed. These numerical
instabilities give rise to an approximate multiscaling observed in the
numerical simulations. With the pseudospectral approach no multiscaling is seen
in agreement with the continuum model.

haloes are identified with a friends of friends algorithm in a large LCDM
simulation at two redshift snapshots (z=0 and 1), while halo substructure is
determined using an observationally driven method. We find in both epochs a
clear and significant signal by which haloes with substructure are more
clustered than those with no-substructure. This is true for all the considered
halo mass ranges, although for the highest halo masses the signal is noisy and
present only out to ~20 h^{-1} Mpc. There is also a smooth increase of the halo
correlation length with increasing amplitude of the halo substructure. We also
find that substructured haloes are typically located in high-density
large-scale environments, while the opposite is true for non-substructured
haloes. If the haloes found in high-density regions have a relatively earlier
formation time, as suggested by recent works, then they do indeed have more
time to cluster than haloes, of a similar mass, which form later in the
low-density regions. In such a case one would have naively expected that the
former (earlier formed) haloes would typically be dynamically more relaxed than
the latter (later formed). However, the higher merging and interaction
rate,expected in high-density regions, could disrupt their relatively relaxed
dynamical state and thus be the cause for the higher fraction of haloes with
substructure found in such regions.

separating invariants in the sense of Liouville. It is widely claimed that no
more than three adiabatic invariants can exist for the motion of a point

do exist. For a force free motion, the components of angular momentum provide
two additional constants of motion. This result can be generalized to the
Hamilton Jacobi equation. The number of independent constants of motion is
reduced if there is a global symmetry. For a gyrating particle, neglecting a
gyro helix type of invariant, four 'useful' invariants could exist. A radial
drift invariant, corresponding to the average of the radial coordinate of the
particle, is a constant of motion for a confined gyrating particle. For the
special case of a screw pinch where each gyro center moves on a magnetic flux
surface without mirror trapping, the radial drift invariant is the radial
coordinate of the gyro center. For a screw pinch, the set of constants of
motion consising of the energy, parallel velocity and radial drift invariant is
convenient to model the equilibrium. Local Maxwellian distribution functions
expressed in this set of invariants are demonstrated to provide MHD-type of

to a so-called pancake configuration of the star at the instant of maximal

particular attention to the development of shock waves;to deduce reliable
estimates of the thermodynamical quantities involved in the pancake star; and
to solve a controversy about whether or not thermonuclear reactions can be
triggered in the core of a tidally compressed star. We have set up a
one-dimensional hydrodynamical model well-adapted to the geometry of the
problem. Based on the high-resolution shock-capturing Godunov-type approach, it
allows to study the compression phase undergone by the star in the direction
orthogonal to its orbital plane. We show the existence of two regimes depending
on whether shock waves develop before or after the instant of maximal core
compression. In both cases we confirm high compression and heating factors in
the stellar core able to trigger a thermonuclear explosion. Moreover, we show
that the shock waves carry outwards a brief but very high peak of temperature
from the centre to the surface of the star. We tentatively conclude that the
phenomenon could give rise to hard electromagnetic radiation, to be compared to
some X-ray flares already observed in some galactic nuclei harbouring massive
black holes. Finally, we estimate that the rate of pancake stars should be
about $10^{-5}$ per galaxy per year. If generated in hard X- or $\gamma$-ray

eigenvectors of R for cluster identification, analogous to several recent
attempts at group identification using eigenvectors of the correlation matrix.
All of these approaches assumed a one-to-one correspondence of dominant
eigenvectors and clusters, which has however been shown to be wrong in
important cases. We clarify the usefulness of eigenvalue decomposition for
synchronization cluster analysis by translating the problem into the language
of stochastic processes, and derive an enhanced clustering method harnessing
recent insights from the coarse-graining of finite-state Markov processes. We
illustrate the operation of our method using a simulated system of coupled
Lorenz oscillators, and we demonstrate its superior performance over the
previous approach. Finally we investigate the question of robustness of the
algorithm against small sample size, which is important with regard to field

can couple the neutral hydrogen spin temperature to the kinetic gas
temperature, providing the opportunity to observe the gas in emission or
absorption in the 21-cm line. Given the bright foregrounds, it is of prime
importance to determine precisely the fluctuations signature of the signal, to
be able to extract it by its correlation power.
  LICORICE is a Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code, coupled to the dynamics
via an adaptative Tree-SPH code. We present here the Ly-alpha part of the
implementation, and validate it through three classical tests. Contrary to
previous works, we do not assume that P_alpha, the number of scatterings of
Ly-alpha photons per atom per second, is proportional to the Ly-alpha
background flux, but take into account the scatterings in the Ly-alpha line
wings. The latter have the effect to steepen the radial profile of P_alpha
around each source, and re-inforce the contrast of the fluctuations. In the
particular geometry of cosmic filaments of baryonic matter, Ly-alpha photons
are scattered out of the filament, and the large scale structure of P_alpha is
significantly anisotropic. This could have strong implications for the possible
detection of the 21-cm signal.

differences are discussed in terms of a proximity effect, where carriers from
the $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$ layer are injected into the $SrRuO_3$ layer and vice versa.

problem as an instance of combinatorial optimization for which we formulate a
mixed integer linear program (MILP). The optimal solution of the MILP directly
yields an optimal joint-policy for the Dec-Pomdp. Computational experience
shows that formulating and solving the MILP requires significantly less time to

While both large bandwidth and large dissipation have similar effects in

traversal times near the resonant frequencies. We have also investigated the
traversal times and Wigner delay times for obliquely incident pulses and

equally harmoniously with physics notation, be called ""entropy per volume"",

$\hat p^0$, uniformly in the volume. It is the uniformity requirement that

of pressure of tilings. Though at the same time, perhaps non-glamorous, being

promising tool for bandwidth-efficient transmission in a fading environment.
The main motivation behind employing ACM schemes is to improve the spectral
efficiency of wireless communication systems. In this paper, using a finite
number of capacity achieving component codes, we propose new transmission
schemes employing constant power transmission, as well as discrete and
continuous power adaptation, for slowly varying flat-fading channels.
  We show that the proposed transmission schemes can achieve throughputs close
to the Shannon limits of flat-fading channels using only a small number of
codes. Specifically, using a fully discrete scheme with just four codes, each
associated with four power levels, we achieve a spectral efficiency within 1 dB
of the continuous-rate continuous-power Shannon capacity. Furthermore, when
restricted to a fixed number of codes, the introduction of power adaptation has
significant gains with respect to ASE and probability of no transmission
compared to a constant power scheme.

possible to infer the mass distribution of such gravitational lens systems

the prediction of a large number of spurious images, and to reliably
reconstruct the lens mass density. While the total mass of the lens is usually
constrained within a few percent, the fidelity of the reconstruction of the
lens mass distribution depends on the number and position of the images. The
technique employed to include null space information can be extended in a
straightforward way to add additional constraints, such as weak lensing data or

symmetry-breaking disorder, the order parameter and the energy gap of an
excitonic insulator are gradually suppressed up to a critical disorder
strength. Recently, Marchetti, Simons, and Littlewood have used a replica trick
to investigate the effects of disorder on the condensation of cavity
polaritons. Within their nonlinear sigma model, it was found that the
saddle-point equations assume the form reported previously by Zittartz in the
contest of the symmetry broken excitonic insulator, but with an order
parameter, to which both photons and excitons contribute. In this paper, we
apply a closed-path time Green's function approach as an alternative to the
replica technique to formulate a nonperturbative description of cavity
polaritons in the presence of a symmetry-breaking disorder. A field theoretical
method is used to derive the Schwinger-Dyson equations for the average photon
field and the average single-particle Green's function. In contrast with the
nonlinear sigma model and the corresponding saddle-point equations, we obtain
that the exact Schwinger-Dyson equations cannot be mapped to the corresponding
equations derived by Zittartz. This result not only shows that the theory of
Zittartz cannot be applied to the excitons in a disordered quantum well coupled
to the cavity photons with only minor modifications, but arises a question
about the validity of the replica trick as well.

vortices or of half flux quanta generated by frustrated superconducting rings
is noisy. It is found that the flux noise generated intrinsically by a
superconductor is, in good approximation, not enhanced by stationary vortices.
Half flux quanta generated by $\pi$-rings are characterized by considerably
larger noise.

cell-matrix adhesion, mechanical force triggers signaling through the
Rho-pathway, which leads to structural reinforcement and increased
contractility in the actin cytoskeleton. The resulting force acts back to the
sites of adhesion, resulting in a positive feedback loop for mature adhesion.
Here we model this biochemical-mechanical feedback loop for the special case
when the actin cytoskeleton is organized in stress fibers, which are
contractile bundles of actin filaments. Activation of myosin II molecular
motors through the Rho-pathway is described by a system of reaction-diffusion
equations, which are coupled into a viscoelastic model for a contractile actin
bundle. We find strong spatial gradients in the activation of contractility and
in the corresponding deformation pattern of the stress fiber, in good agreement
with experimental findings.

  Photometric Data","20 pages","Acta Astron.57:149-172,2007",,,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Based on analysis of photometric observations of nearby M type stars obtained
with ASAS, 31 periodic variables were detected. The determined periods are
assumed to be related to rotation periods of the investigated stars. Among them
10 new variables with periods longer than 10 days were found, which brings the
total number of slowly rotating M stars with known rotation periods to 12
objects.
  X-ray activity and rotation evolution of M stars follows the trends observed
in G-K type stars. Rapidly rotating stars are very active and activity
decreases with increasing rotation period but the period-activity relation is
mass-dependent which suggests that the rotation period alone is not a proper
measure of activity. The investigated stars were grouped according to their
mass and the empirical turnover time was determined for each group. It
increases with decreasing mass more steeply than for K type stars for which a
flat dependence had been found. The resulting Rossby number-activity relation
shows an exponential decrease of activity with increasing Rossby number.
  The analysis of space motions of 27 single stars showed that all rapidly
rotating and a few slowly rotating stars belong to young disk (YD) whereas all
old disk (OD) stars are slowly rotating. The median rotation period of YD stars
is about 2 days and that of OD stars is equal to 47 days, i.e. nearly 25 times
longer. The average X-ray flux of OD stars is about 1.7 dex lower than YD stars
in a good agreement with the derived Rossby number-activity formula
supplemented with rotation-age relation and in a fair agreement with recent
observations but in a disagreement with the Skumanich formula supplemented with
the activity-rotation relation.
