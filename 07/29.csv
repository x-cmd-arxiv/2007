of the Jovian atmosphere that cannot otherwise be found. These properties
include the potential vorticity of the GRS and its neighboring jet streams, the
shear imposed on the GRS by the jet streams, and the vertical entropy gradient
(i.e., Rossby deformation radius). The cloud cover of the GRS, which is often
used to define the GRS's area and aspect ratio, is found to differ
significantly from the region of the GRS's potential vorticity anomaly. The
westward-going jet stream to the north of the GRS and the eastward-going jet
stream to its south are each found to have a large potential vorticity
``jump''. The jumps have opposite sign and as a consequence of their
interaction with the GRS, the shear imposed on the GRS is reduced. The
east-west to north-south aspect ratio of the GRS's potential vorticity anomaly
depends on the ratio of the imposed shear to the strength of the anomaly. The
aspect ratio is found to be $\approx$2:1, but without the opposing jumps it
would be much greater. The GRS's high-speed collar and quiescent interior
require that the potential vorticity in the interior be approximately half that
in the collar. No other persistent geophysical vortex has a significant minimum
of potential vorticity in its interior and laboratory vortices with such a
minimum are unstable.

excess electron to the many-electron case corresponding to finite metal
concentrations in metal-ammonia solutions (MAS). We evaluate dielectric,
optical, and thermodynamical properties of MAS at low metal concentrations. Our
semi-analytical calculations based on a mean-spherical approximation correlate
well with the experimental data on the concentration and the temperature
dependencies of the dielectric constant and the optical absorption spectrum.
The properties are found to be mainly determined by the induced dipolar
interactions between localized solvated electrons, which result in the two main
effects: the dispersion attractions between the electrons and a sharp increase
in the static dielectric constant of the solution. The first effect provides a
classical phase separation for the light alkali metal solutes (Li, Na, K) below
a critical temperature. The second effect leads to a dielectric instability,
i.e., polarization catastrophe, which is the onset of metallization. The locus
of the calculated critical concentrations is in a good agreement with the
experimental phase diagram of Na-NH3 solutions. The proposed mechanism of the
metal-nonmetal transition is quite general and may occur in systems involving
self-trapped quantum quasiparticles.

magnitude, for which the abundance of fluorine has been measured. Using

non-trivial relation between the anomalous dimension and the Wilson
interpretations of f(lambda) is well-understood on the perturbative gauge
theory side of the AdS/CFT duality. In the first part of this paper we present
the dual string-theory counterpart of this relation, to all orders in
lambda^(-1/2) expansion. As a check, we explicitly compute the leading 1-loop
string sigma model correction to the cusp Wilson loop, reproducing the same
subleading coefficient in f(lambda) as found earlier in the spinning closed
string case. The same function f(lambda) appears also in the resummed form of
the 4-gluon amplitude as discussed at weak coupling by Bern, Dixon and Smirnov
and recently found at the leading order at strong coupling by Alday and
Maldacena (AM). Here we attempt to extend this approach to subleading order in
lambda^(-1/2) by computing the IR singular part of 1-loop string correction to
the corresponding T-dual Wilson loop. We discuss explicitly the 1-cusp case and
comment on apparent problems with the dimensional regularization proposal of AM
when directly applied order by order in strong coupling (inverse string
tension) expansion.

have been computed for the Heisenberg Antiferromagnet with spatially
anisotropic exchange on the kagome lattice on clusters up to N=24 spins from
the full spectra obtained by exact diagonalization. This approach is shown to
provide a good represention of these thermodynamic properties above
temperatures of about $J_{\rm av}/5$ where $J_{\rm av}$ is an average of the
coupling constants. Comparison with experimental Volborthite data obtained by
Hiroi {\it {et al}} [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 70},3377 (2001)] shows that
Volborthite is best described by a model with nearly isotropic exchanges in
spite of the significant distortion of the kagom\'{e} lattice of magnetic sites
in this compound and suggests that additional interactions are present.
Comparison of the specific heat at low temperature raise the possibility that
the density of states at low energy in Volborthite might be much lower than in
the Heisenberg model. Magnetization curves under an applied field of the model
are also investigated. The M=1/3 plateau is found to subsist in the anisotropic
case and extend to lower field with increased anisotropy. For sufficient
anisotropy, this plateau would then be observable for a field reasonably
accessible to experiment. The absence of a plateau well below $\sim$ 70 Teslas
would further support a nearly isotropic model.

extended, simplified, and confirmed as mathematical identities. Forms of
derivative dispersion relations (DDR) valid for the whole energy interval,
recently obtained and presented as double infinite series, are simplified
through the use of new sum rules of the incomplete $\Gamma$ functions, being
reduced to single summations, where the usual convergence criteria are easily
applied. For the forms of the imaginary amplitude used in phenomenology of
hadronic scattering, we show that expressions for the DDR can represent, with
absolute accuracy, the IDR of scattering theory, as true mathematical
identities. Besides the fact that the algebraic manipulation can be easily
understood, numerical examples show the accuracy of these representations up to
the maximum available machine precision. As consequence of our work, it is
concluded that the standard simplified forms sDDR, originally intended for the
high energy limits, are an inconvenient and incomplete separation of terms of
the full expression, leading to wrong evaluations. Since the correspondence
between IDR and the DDR expansions is linear, our results have wide
applicability, covering more general functions, built as combinations of well
studied basic forms.

analysis we find that: (1) the X-ray (2-10 keV) luminosities of both pulsar and
PWN (L_{psr} and L_{pwn}) display a strong correlation with pulsar spin down
power Edot and characteristic age, and the scalings resulting from a simple
linear fit to the data are L_{psr} \propto Edot^{0.92 \pm 0.04} and L_{pwn}
\propto Edot^{1.45 \pm 0.08} (68% confidence level), respectively, however,

PWN photon index Gamma_{pwn} is positively correlated with L_{pwn} and
L_{pwn}/Edot. We also found that the PWN X-ray luminosity is typically 1 to 10
times larger than that from the underlying pulsar, and the PWN photon indices
span a range of ~1.5 to ~2. The statistic study of PWN spectral properties

perfomance-verification phase. We find that the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal
galaxy (Sgr) Sgr contains a youngest stellar population with [O/H] -0.2 and age
t>1 Gyr, and an oldest population with [O/H]=-2.0. The values are based on
spectra of two planetary nebulae (PNe), using empirical abundance
determinations. We calculated abundances for O, N, Ne, Ar, S, Cl, Fe, C and He.
We confirm the high abundances of PN StWr2-21 with 12+log(O/H) = 8.57+/-0.02
dex. The other PN studied, BoBn1, is an extraordinary object in that the neon
abundance exceeds that of oxygen. The abundances of S, Ar and Cl in BoBn1 yield
the original stellar metallicity, corresponding to 12+log(O/H) = 6.72+/-0.16
dex which is 1/110 of the solar value. The actual [O/H] is much higher: third
dredge-up enriched the material by a factor of ~12 in oxygen, ~240 in nitrogen
and ~70 in neon. Neon as well as nitrogen and oxygen content may have been
produced in the intershell of low-mass AGB stars. Well defined broad WR lines

reduced curve singularity $(X,0) \subset (\c^n,0)$. The main new results are
explicit formulas, in terms of classical invariants of (X,0), for the cotangent
cohomology groups $T^i, i = 0,1,2,$ of these functors. Thus we obtain precise
statements about smoothness and dimension of the corresponding local moduli
spaces. We apply the results to obtain explicit formulas resp. estimates for
the $\hoa{A}_e$-codimension of a parametrized curve singularity, where
$\hoa{A}_e$ denotes the Mather-Wall group of left-right equivalence.

the isospin invariance of nuclear force has been proposed. According to the
model the excess neutron pairs fill out the free space in the core determined
by the difference in the charge and matter radii of the alpha-clusters. Then
the number of excess neutrons in beta-stable nuclei depends on the number of
the core alpha-clusters. In such a representation the specific density of
binding energy of core is the only parameter to fit the experimental binding
energies of beta-stable nuclei and it turned out to be a constant value equal
to 2.57 MeV/fm^3. Knowing the value allows one to estimate the size of a
nucleus from its experimental binding energy.

observations of black holes and neutron stars come from dense stellar systems,
where stars are crowded close enough to each other to undergo frequent
interactions. It is the interplay between black holes, neutron stars and other
objects in a dense environment that allows us to use observations to draw firm
conclusions about the properties of these extreme forms of matter, through
comparisons with simulations. The art of modeling dense stellar systems through
computer simulations forms the main topic of this review.

two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) have been studied experimentally by means
of a picosecond pump-probe Kerr rotation technique. CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum
wells with a diluted 2DEG were investigated. The strong Coulomb interaction
between electrons and holes, which results in large binding energies of neutral
excitons and negatively charged excitons (trions), allows one to address
selectively the exciton or trion states by resonant optical excitation.
Different scenarios of spin coherence generation were analyzed theoretically,
among them the direct trion photocreation, the formation of trions from
photogenerated excitons and the electron-exciton exchange scattering. Good
agreement between experiment and theory is found.

This notion depends on the tasks for which a quantum state is used as the
resource. This concept may be more fruitful than that of a general maximally
entangled state in the case of a multipartite system. We illustrate this idea
by giving an operational definition of maximally entangled states on the basis
of communication tasks of teleportation and superdense coding. We also give
examples and a procedure to obtain such TMESs for {\em n}-qubit systems.
