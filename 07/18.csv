  Collisions Using Hadronic Probes","Dissertation submitted for PhD at Stony Brook University (December
  2004) as part of the PHENIX collaboration",,,,"nucl-ex",,"  It has been theorized that if heavy nuclei (e.g. Au, Pb) are collided at
sufficiently high energies, we might be to recreate the conditions that existed
in the universe a few microseconds after the Big Bang. The kinetic energy of
the colliding nuclei gets converted into heat, leading to a phase transition
into a new state of matter: the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), in which quarks and
gluons are deconfined. However, we never directly get to see the QGP because as
the matter cools it recombines (hadronizes) into ordinary subatomic particles.
We can only hope to infer its existence from indirect experimental signatures,
after hadronization. In this dissertation we attempt to shed some light on:
  Properties of the final state of produced matter in Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. As the hot, dense system of particles from the
collision zone cools and expands, light nuclei like deuterons and
anti-deuterons can be formed, with a probability proportional to the product of
the phase space densities of its constituent nucleons. Thus, invariant yield of
deuterons, compared to the protons and neutrons from which they coalesce,
provides information about the size of the emitting system and its space-time
evolution.
  The initial conditions that led to this. This is done by looking at the
nuclear modification factor $R_{cp}$ from particle production in forward and
backward directions in a ``control'' experiment using d+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. This can allow us to distinguish between effects that
could potentially be due to deconfinement, versus effects of cold nuclear
matter.

momentum are of special interest, as studies indicate that this configuration
is preferred in nature. If the spins of the two bodies differ, there can be a
prominent beaming of the gravitational radiation during the late plunge,
causing a recoil of the final merged black hole. We perform an accurate and
systematic study of recoil velocities from a sequence of equal-mass black holes
whose spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum, and whose individual
spins range from a = +0.584 to -0.584. In this way we extend and refine the
results of a previous study and arrive at a consistent maximum recoil of 448 +-
5 km/s for anti-aligned models as well as to a phenomenological expression for
the recoil velocity as a function of spin ratio. This relation highlights a
nonlinear behavior, not predicted by the PN estimates, and can be readily
employed in astrophysical studies on the evolution of binary black holes in
massive galaxies. An essential result of our analysis is the identification of
different stages in the waveform, including a transient due to lack of an
initial linear momentum in the initial data. Furthermore we are able to
identify a pair of terms which are largely responsible for the kick, indicating
that an accurate computation can be obtained from modes up to l=3. Finally, we
provide accurate measures of the radiated energy and angular momentum, finding
these to increase linearly with the spin ratio, and derive simple expressions
for the final spin and the radiated angular momentum which can be easily
implemented in N-body simulations of compact stellar systems. Our code is
calibrated with strict convergence tests and we verify the correctness of our
measurements by using multiple independent methods whenever possible.

$1/N_f$-expansion and results in a logarithmically divergent perturbation
theory in arbitrary high space-time dimension. First, we consider a simple
example of $N$-component scalar filed theory and then extend this approach to
Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories with $N_f$ fermions. In the latter case,
due to self-interaction of non-Abelian fields the proposed recipe requires some
modification which, however, does not change the main results. The resulting
effective coupling is dimensionless and is running in accordance with the usual
RG equations. The corresponding beta function is calculated in the leading
order and is nonpolynomial in effective coupling. It exhibits either UV
asymptotically free or IR free behaviour depending on the dimension of
space-time. The original dimensionful coupling plays a role of a mass and is
also logarithmically renormalized. We analyze also the analytical properties of
a resulting theory and demonstrate that in general it acquires several ghost
states with negative and/or complex masses. In the former case, the ghost state
can be removed by a proper choice of the coupling. As for the states with
complex conjugated masses, their contribution to physical amplitudes cancels so
that the theory appears to be unitary.

luminosity functions of our starburst galaxies and compare to random control
samples. The starburst galaxies are also classified morphologically in terms of
their broad Hubble type and evidence of tidal merger/interaction signatures. We
find the starburst galaxies to be much less clustered on large (5-15 Mpc)
scales compared to the overall 2dFGRS galaxy population. In terms of their
environments, we find just over half of the starburst galaxies to reside in low
to intermediate luminosity groups, and a further ~30 per cent residing in the
outskirts and infall regions of rich clusters. Their luminosity functions also
differ significantly from that of the overall 2dFGRS galaxy population, with
the sense of the difference being critically dependent on the way their star
formation rates are measured. In terms of pin-pointing what might trigger the
starburst, it would appear that factors relating to their local environment are
most germane. Specifically, we find clear evidence that the presence of a near
neighbour of comparable luminosity/mass within 20 kpc is likely to be important
in triggering a starburst. We also find that a significant fraction (20-30 per
cent) of our starburst galaxies have morphologies indicative of either an
ongoing or recent tidal interaction and/or merger. These findings
notwithstanding, there remain a significant portion of starburst galaxies where
local environmental influences are not in any obvious way playing a triggering

embedding the polymer network with charged colloidal inclusions. Matos and
co-workers (2006) recently used the concept to enhance the diffusion-limited
flux of uncharged molecules across polyacrylamide hydrogel membraness for the
purpose of improving the performance of biosensors. This paper seeks to link
their reported macroscale diagnostics to physicochemical characteristics of the
composite microstructure. A mathematical model for the bulk electroosmotically
enhanced tracer flux is proposed, which is combined with the electrokinetic
model to ascertain the electroosmotic pumping velocity from measured flux
enhancements. Because the experiments are performed with a known current
density, but unknown bulk conductivity and electric field strength, theoretical
estimates of the bulk electrical conductivity are adopted. These account for
nano-particle polarization, added counterions, and non-specific adsorption.
Theoretical predictions of the flux enhancement, achieved without any fitting
parameters, are within a factor of two of the experiments. Alternatively, if
the Brinkman screening length of the polymer skeleton is treated as a fitting
parameter, then the best-fit values are bounded by the range 0.9-1.6 nm,
depending on the inclusion size and volume fraction. Independent
pressure-driven flow experiments reported in the literature for polyacrylamide
gels without inclusions suggest 0.4 or 0.8 nm. The comparison can be improved
by allowing for hindered ion migration, while uncertainties regarding the
inclusion surface charge are demonstrated to have a negligible influence on the
electroosmotic flow.

us to evaluate the optical depth of the host ISM, according to the neutral
hydrogen column density N(HI) observed along the sightlines toward the
star-forming regions where the GRBs are found. Different from previous effort
in searching for faint, transmitted Lyman continuum photons, our method is not
subject to background subtraction uncertainties and does not require prior
knowledge of either the spectral shape of the host galaxy population or the IGM
Lya forest absorption along these GRB sightlines. Because most GRBs occur in
sub-L_* galaxies, our study also offers the first constraint on fesc for
distant low-mass galaxies that dominate the cosmic luminosity density. We have
compiled a sample of 27 GRBs at redshift z>2 for which the underlying N(HI) in
the host ISM are known. These GRBs together offer a statistical sampling of the
integrated optical depth to ionizing photons along random sightlines from
star-forming regions in the host galaxies, and allow us to estimate the mean
escape fraction <fesc> averaged over different viewing angles. We find
<fesc>=0.02\pm 0.02 and place a 95% c.l. upper limit <fesc> <= 0.075 for these
hosts. We discuss possible biases of our approach and implications of the
result. Finally, we propose to extend this technique for measuring <fesc> at

timescales; much shorter than the typical cooling time of X-ray emitting gas in
elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters. Using the Langevin approach it is
shown that, for a simple feedback system, this can induce variability in the
AGN power output that is of much larger amplitude, and persists for longer
timescales, than the initial fluctuations. An implication of this is that rich
galaxy clusters are expected to show the largest and longest-lived
fluctuations. Stochastic variations in the accretion rate also mean that the
AGN injects energy across a wide range of timescales. This allows the AGN to
maintain a much closer balance with its surroundings than if it was
periodically activated. The possible non-linear correlation between Bondi
accretion rate and jet power, found by Allen et al 2006, can be explained if
the instantaneous accretion rate, scaled by jet power, varies log-normally.
This explanation also implies that the duty cycle of AGN activity increases
with the radiative losses of the surroundings, in qualitative agreement with
Best et al 2005.

core-collapse massive supernovae (SNe). We calculate the evolution of several
very massive stars with initial masses M <~ 100 Msun from the main-sequence to
the beginning of the Fe-core collapse and simulate their explosions and
nucleosynthesis. In order to avoid complications associated with strong
mass-loss, we only consider metal-poor stars with initial metallicity Z =
Zsun/200. However, our results are applicable to higher metallicity models with
similar C+O core masses. The C+O core mass for the 100Msun model is M_CO =
42.6Msun and this is the heaviest model in the literature for which Fe-core
collapse SN is explored. The synthesized 56Ni mass increases with the
increasing explosion energy and progenitor mass. For the explosion energy of
E_51 = E/10^{51} erg =30, for example, the 56Ni masses of M(56Ni) = 2.2, 2.3,
5.0, and 6.6 Msun can be produced for the progenitors with initial masses of

technique applied to a simulation of an ideal observation. We obtain no
detection, getting a S/N ratio of 0.1, thereby demonstrating that the kinetic
SZ effect can also safely be ignored as a CMB foreground. However we provide
maps of the expected signal for inclusion in future high precision data
processing. Furthermore, we rule out the significant contamination of the
polarised CMB signal by second scattering of galactic kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich
photons, since we show that the scattering of the CMB quadrupole photons by
galactic electrons is a stronger effect than the Sunyaev Zeldovich second
scattering, and has already been shown to produce no significant polarised

volume-covering of the volume-weighted velocity and density fields throughout

Delaunay tessellation defined by the spatial galaxy sample, DTFE involves the
estimate of density values on the basis of the volume of the related Delaunay
tetrahedra and the subsequent use of theDelaunay tessellation as natural
multidimensional (linear) interpolation grid for the corresponding density and
velocity fields throughout the sample volume. The linearized model of the
spatial galaxy distribution and the corresponding peculiar velocities of the
PSCz galaxy sample, produced by Brachini et al. (1999), forms the input sample

regions in optimal detail, both their internal structure as well as their
elongated or flattened shape. The corresponding velocity flows trace the bulk
and shear flows marking the region extending from the Pisces-Perseus
supercluster, via the Local superclusters, towards the Hydra-Centaurus and the
Shapley concentration. The most outstanding and unique feature of the DTFE maps
is the sharply defined radial outflow regions in and around underdense voids,
marking the dynamical importance of voids in the Local Universe. The maximum
expansion rate of voids defines a sharp cutoff in the DTFE velocity divergence
pdf. We found that on the basis of this cutoff DTFE manages to consistently

mixture is depleted in carbon, nitrogen and oxygen with respect to the GN93

frequent due to the availability of powerful X-ray telescope with excellent
spatial and spectral resolutions. The information which can be extracted from
the measurements of the alpha-elements, like Oxygen, Magnesium and Silicon with
respect to the Iron abundance is extremely important to better understand the
stellar formation and its evolutionary history. In this paper we investigate
possible source of bias connected to the plasma physics when recovering metal
abundances from X-ray spectra. To do this we analyze 6 simulated galaxy
clusters processed through the new version of our X-ray MAp Simulator, which
allows to create mock XMM-Newton EPIC MOS1 and MOS2 observations. By comparing
the spectroscopic results to the input values we find that: i) Fe is recovered
with high accuracy for both hot (T>3 keV) and cold (T<2 keV) systems; at
intermediate temperatures, however, we find a systematic overestimate which
depends on the number counts; ii) O is well recovered in cold clusters, while
in hot systems its measure may overestimate by a factor up to 2-3; iii) Being a
weak line, the measurement of Mg is always difficult; despite of this, for cold
systems (T<2 keV) we do not find any systematic behavior, while for very hot
systems (T>5 keV) the spectroscopic measurement may be strongly overestimated
up to a factor of 4; iv) Si is well recovered for all the clusters in our
sample. We investigate in detail the nature of the systematic effects and
biases found. We conclude that they are mainly connected with the
multi-temperature nature of the projected observed spectra and to the intrinsic
limitation of the XMM-Newton EPIC spectral resolution that does not always
allow to disentangle among the emission lines produced by different elements.

differencing (including the recent symmetric algorithm) do not preserve
monotonicity. In the context of anisotropic thermal conduction, this can lead
to the violation of the entropy constraints of the second law of
thermodynamics, causing heat to flow from regions of lower temperature to
higher temperature. In regions of large temperature variations, this can cause
the temperature to become negative. Test cases to illustrate this for centered
asymmetric and symmetric differencing are presented. Algorithms based on slope
limiters, analogous to those used in second order schemes for hyperbolic
equations, are proposed to fix these problems. While centered algorithms may be
good for many cases, the main advantage of limited methods is that they are
guaranteed to avoid negative temperature (which can cause numerical
instabilities) in the presence of large temperature gradients. In particular,
limited methods will be useful to simulate hot, dilute astrophysical plasmas
where conduction is anisotropic and the temperature gradients are enormous,
e.g., collisionless shocks and disk-corona interface.

behavior from collisionless dark matter. Nevertheless, the evolved field of
baryon fluid is scale-covariant in the range from the Jeans length to a few ten
h^{-1} Mpc, in which the dynamical equations and initial perturbations are
scale free. We show that in the scale-free range, the non-Gaussian features of
the cosmic baryon fluid, governed by the Navier-Stokes equation in an expanding
universe, can be well described by a log-Poisson hierarchical cascade. The
log-Poisson scheme is a random multiplicative process (RMP), which causes
non-Gaussianity and intermittency even when the original field is Gaussian. The
log-Poisson RMP contains two dimensionless parameters: $\beta$ for the
intermittency and $\gamma$ for the most singular structure. All the predictions
given by the log-Poisson RMP model, including the hierarchical relation, the
order dependence of the intermittent exponent, the moments, and the scale-scale
correlation, are in good agreement with the results given by hydrodynamic
simulations of the standard cold dark matter model. The intermittent parameter
$\beta$ decreases slightly at low redshift and indicates that the density field
of baryon fluid contains more singular structures at lower redshifts. The
applicability of the model is addressed.

theoretical predictions based on the Chandrasekhar formula. In contrast to
Navarro et al., our numerical results indicate, that the commonly used equation
for the merger timescale given by Lacey and Cole, systematically underestimates
the merger timescales for minor mergers and overestimates those for major
mergers. This behavior is partly explained by the poor performance of their
expression for the Coulomb logarithm, \ln (m_pri/m_sat). The two alternative
forms \ln (1+m_pri/m_sat) and 1/2\ln [1+(m_pri/m_sat)^2] for the Coulomb
logarithm can account for the mass dependence of merger timescale successfully,
but both of them underestimate the merger time scale by a factor 2. Since \ln
(1+m_pri/m_sat) represents the mass dependence slightly better we adopt this
expression for the Coulomb logarithm. Furthermore, we find that the dependence
of the merger timescale on the circularity parameter \epsilon is much weaker
than the widely adopted power-law \epsilon^{0.78}, whereas
0.94*{\epsilon}^{0.60}+0.60 provides a good match to the data. Based on these
findings, we present an accurate and convenient fitting formula for the merger

flow are relatively well known, but we are still far from a complete
understanding of its nature. The evolution of the flow with time, which is
mainly due to appearance of velocity packets called Evershed clouds (ECs), may
provide information to further constrain its origin. Here we undertake a
detailed analysis of the evolution of the Evershed flow by studying the
properties of ECs. In this first paper we determine the sizes, proper motions,
location in the penumbra, and frequency of appearance of ECs, as well as their
typical Doppler velocities, linear and circular polarization signals, Stokes V
area asymmetries, and continuum intensities. High-cadence, high-resolution,
full vector spectropolarimetric measurements in visible and infrared lines are
used to derive these parameters. We find that ECs appear in the mid penumbra
and propage outward along filaments with large linear polarization signals and
enhanced Evershed flows. The frequency of appearance of ECs varies between 15
and 40 minutes in different filaments. ECs exhibit the largest Doppler
velocities and linear-to-circular polarization ratios of the whole penumbra. In
addition, lines formed deeper in the atmosphere show larger Doppler velocities,
much in the same way as the ''quiescent'' Evershed flow. According to our
observations, ECs can be classified in two groups: type I ECs, which vanish in
the outer penumbra, and type II ECs, which cross the outer penumbral boundary
and enter the sunspot moat. Most of the observed ECs belong to type I. On
average, type II ECs can be detected as velocity structures outside of the spot
for only about 14 min. Their proper motions in the moat are significantly
reduced with respect to the ones they had in the penumbra.

agreeable with recent experiments. We consider, but rule out, the possibility
of a steeper slope in the energy spectrum of the turbulent fluctuations, due to
compressibility, as a possible mechanism that may lead to an increased
lower-bound for the transition scale. Instead, we argue that Winterberg
overestimated the intensity of the ZPF turbulent fluctuations. We calculate a
very generous corrected lower bound for the transition distance which is
consistent with current experiments.

6946. The predominantly molecular inner gas disk transitions smoothly into an
atomic outer gas disk, with equivalent atomic and molecular gas surface
densities at R = 3.5' (6 kpc). We estimate that the total H2 mass is 3 X 10^9
Mo, roughly 1/3 of the interstellar hydrogen gas mass, and about 2% of the
dynamical mass of the galaxy at our assumed distance of 6 Mpc. The value of the
CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) line ratio ranges from 0.35 to 2; 50% of the map is covered by
very high ratio, >1, gas. The very high ratios are predominantly from interarm
regions and appear to indicate the presence of wide-spread optically thin gas.
Star formation tracers are better correlated with the total neutral gas disk
than with the molecular gas by itself implying SFR is proportional to
Sigma_gas. Using the 100 FIR and 21 cm continuum from NGC 6946 as star
formation tracers, we arrive at a gas consumption timescale of 2.8 Gyr, which
is relatively uniform across the disk. The high star formation rate at the
nucleus appears to be due to a large accumulation of molecular gas rather than
a large increase in the star formation efficiency. The mid-plane gas pressure
in the outer (R > 10 kpc) HI arms of NGC 6946 is close to the value at the
radial limit (10 kpc) of our observed CO disk. If the mid-plane gas pressure is
a factor for the formation of molecular clouds, these outer HI gas arms should
contain molecular gas which we do not see because they are beyond our detection

correspondence between the fifth-dimension coordinate z of AdS space and a
specific impact variable zeta which measures the separation of the quark
constituents within the hadron in ordinary space-time. This connection allows
one to compute the analytic form of the frame-independent light-front
wavefunctions of mesons and baryons, the fundamental entities which encode
hadron properties and allow the computation of exclusive scattering amplitudes.
I also discuss a number of novel phenomenological features of QCD. Initial- and
final-state interactions from gluon-exchange, normally neglected in the parton
model, have a profound effect in QCD hard-scattering reactions, leading to
leading-twist single-spin asymmetries, diffractive deep inelastic scattering,
diffractive hard hadronic reactions, the breakdown of the Lam Tung relation in
Drell-Yan reactions, and nuclear shadowing and non-universal
antishadowing--leading-twist physics not incorporated in the light-front
wavefunctions of the target computed in isolation. I also discuss tests of
hidden color in nuclear wavefunctions, the use of diffraction to materialize
the Fock states of a hadronic projectile and test QCD color transparency, and
anomalous heavy quark effects. The presence of direct higher-twist processes
where a proton is produced in the hard subprocess can explain the large

processing. The studies dealing with this phenomenon are seldom and most of the
scientific work has been focused on flow electrification of aqueous and
insulating Newtonian liquids. From that prior art it is well established that
the flow electrification in Newtonian liquids is a consequence of the formation
of an ionic double layer. Convection of this layer induces the electrification
of the liquid at the outlet of the pipe. In those models, the key parameters
governing the flow electrification are thus the intrinsic electrical properties
of the polymer and the flow characteristics. In this work, we reconsider the
assumptions made previously and we propose a new approach to modelise the flow
electrification in the particular case of non-Newtonian polymer materials in
laminar flow conditions. We establish that, a key parameter for the
electrification quantification in the polymer melt is the shape of the velocity
profile. Additionally, in some cases, we show that a slip velocity at the
polymer/die wall interface must be considered to describe accurately the
electrification. As a consequence, we deduce that the slip velocity at the
interface can be calculated by measuring the electrification: this work gives
an alternative manner to measure the slip velocity during polymer flow.

electrical charges is characteristic of the interaction between the polymer
melt and the die walls. In our study, the capillary extrusion of a metallocene
polyethylene (mPE) through a tungsten carbide die is characterized through
accurate electrical measurements thanks a Faraday pail. No significant charges
are observed since the extrudate surface remains smooth. However, as soon as
the sharkskin distortion appears, measurable charges are collected (around 5
10-8 C/m2). Higher level of charges are measured during the spurt or the
gross-melt fracture (g.m.f) defects. This work is focused on the electrical
charging during the sharkskin instability. The variation of the electrical
charges versus the apparent wall shear stress is investigated for different die
geometries. This curve exhibits a linear increase, followed by a sudden growth
just before the onset of the spurt instability. This abrupt charging
corresponds also to the end of the sharkskin instability. It is also well-known
that wall slip appears just at the same time, with smaller velocity values than
during spurt flow. Our results indicate that electrification could be a
signature of the wall slip. We show also that the electrification curves can be
shifted according to the time-temperature superposition principle, leading to
the conclusion that molecular features of the polymer are also involved in this
process.

as a theory of five-dimensional gravity containing a certain class
four-dimensional branes. From this perspective, the model suffers from a number
of pathologies which went unnoticed before. By generalizing the 5D geometry
from Minkowski to Schwarzschild, we find that when the bulk mass is large
enough, the brane hits a pressure singularity at finite radius. Further, on the
self-accelerating branch, the five-dimensional energy is unbounded from below,
implying that the self-accelerating backgrounds are unstable. Even in an empty
Minkowski bulk, standard Euclidean techniques suggest that the spontaneous
nucleation of self-accelerating branes is unsuppressed. If so, quantum effects
will strongly modify any classical intuition about the theory. We also note
that unless considered as Z_2-orbifold boundaries, self-accelerating branes
correspond to `wormhole' configurations, which introduces the usual problematic
issues associated with wormholes. Altogether these pathologies present a
serious challenge that any proposed UV completion of the DGP model must
overcome.

protoplanet/planetesimal disk find that the giant shepherds a portion of the
material it encounters into interior orbits, whilst scattering the rest into
external orbits. Scattering tends to dominate, leaving behind abundant material
that can accrete into terrestrial planets. Aims: We add to the possible realism
of our model by simulating type I migration forces which cause an inward drift,
and strong eccentricity and inclination damping of protoplanetary bodies. This
extra dissipation might be expected to enhance shepherding at the expense of
scattering, possibly modifying our previous conclusions. Methods: We employ an
N-body code that is linked to a viscous gas disk algorithm capable of
simulating: gas accretion onto the central star; gap formation in the vicinity
of the giant planet; type II migration of the giant planet; type I migration of
protoplanets; and the effect of gas drag on planetesimals. We use the code to
re-run three scenarios from a previous work where type I migration was not
included. Results: The additional dissipation introduced by type I migration
enhances the inward shepherding of material but does not severely reduce
scattering. We find that > 50% of the solids disk material still survives the
migration in scattered exterior orbits: most of it well placed to complete
terrestrial planet formation at < 3 AU. The shepherded portion of the disk
accretes into hot-Earths, which survive in interior orbits for the duration of
our simulations. Conclusions: Water-rich terrestrial planets can form in the
habitable zones of hot-Jupiter systems and hot-Earths and hot-Neptunes may also
be present. These systems should be targets of future planet search missions.

Falomo et al. (2005) discovered a disk-like galaxy at ~ 1.2 arcsec from
the QSO Q0045-3337 by means of ESO VLT adaptive optics. They estimated a galaxy
Einstein radius (for a point mass) of comparable size, thus pointing up the
existence of a new, rare, spiral lens candidate, despite no evident image
splitting.
  Here we discuss the possible lensing effect of the galaxy in some more
detail.
  Methods. We performed two dimensional surface photometry on the VLT image of
the galaxy, confirming its spiral nature. We then verified if simple mass
models, partially constrained by observational data, require unrealistic
parameters to produce a still hidden second quasar image. We also evaluated the
respective viability of an instrumental or a lensing origin of the observed QSO
deformation.
  Results. After galaxy model subtraction, we found a residual image, likely
not related to gravitational lensing. Existing data are not sufficient to
assess the presence of image splitting, nor to constrain the number of images
or discriminate between galaxy mass models.
  Conclusion. Further observations are mandatory to progress in the study of
this remarkable system, that could shed more light on the lensing behaviour of
spiral galaxies.

embedded in circumbinary accretion disks. The aim is to examine the migration
and long term orbital evolution of the protoplanets, in order to establish the
stability properties of planets that form in circumbinary disks. Simulations
were performed using a grid--based hydrodynamics code. First we present a set
of calculations that study how a binary interacts with a circumbinary disk. We
evolve the system for 10^5 binary orbits, which is the time needed for the
system to reach a quasi-equilibrium state. From this time onward the apsidal
lines of the disk and the binary are aligned, and the binary eccentricity
remains essentially unchanged with a value of e_b ~ 0.08. Once this stationary
state is obtained, we embed a low mass protoplanet in the disk and let it
evolve under the action of the binary and disk forces. We consider protoplanets
with masses of 5, 10 and 20 Earth masses. In each case, we find that inward
migration of the protoplanet is stopped at the edge of the tidally truncated
cavity formed by the binary. This effect is due to positve corotation torques,
which can counterbalance the net negative Lindblad torques in disk regions
where the surface density profile has a sufficiently large positive gradient.
Halting of migration occurs in a region of long-term stability, suggesting that
low mass circumbinary planets may be common, and that gas giant circumbinary
planets should be able to form in circumbinary disks.

collections of 40 to 60 independent simulations at each of six different

their conclusion and is rejected. We clarify why their argument for rejecting
this point is flawed. The median $\tau$ is estimated from the distribution of

used. The data is sufficiently well determined to show that the exponential

magnetic field but ions cannot. In a fully-ionized plasma this occurs for
frequencies between the ion and electron cyclotron frequencies because of the
larger ion inertia. Typically this frequency range lies well above the
frequencies of interest (such as the dynamical frequency of the system under
consideration) and can be ignored. In a weakly-ionized medium, however, the
Hall effect arises through a different mechanism -- neutral collisions
preferentially decouple ions from the magnetic field. This typically occurs at
much lower frequencies and the Hall effect may play an important role in the
dynamics of weakly-ionised systems such as the Earth's ionosphere and
protoplanetary discs.
  To clarify the relationship between these mechanisms we develop an
approximate single-fluid description of a partially ionized plasma that becomes
exact in the fully-ionized and weakly-ionized limits. Our treatment includes
the effects of ohmic, ambipolar, and Hall diffusion. We show that the Hall
effect is relevant to the dynamics of a partially ionized medium when the
dynamical frequency exceeds the ratio of ion to bulk mass density times the
ion-cyclotron frequency, i.e. the Hall frequency. The corresponding length
scale is inversely proportional to the ion to bulk mass density ratio as well
as to the ion-Hall beta parameter.

light curves that exhibit flux variability on the time scales sampled by our

flux on long time scales. The mean relative intrinsic amplitude of flux
variability was found to be ~0.15 although with a large dispersion in measured
values, from ~0.1 to ~0.65. The flux variability properties of our samples of
AGN do not significantly depend on the redshift or X-ray luminosity of the
objects and seem to be similar for the two AGN types. Using a broad band X-ray
colour we found that the fraction of sources showing spectral variability with
a significance >3sigma is ~40% i.e. less common than flux variability. Spectral
variability was found to be more common in type-2 AGN than in type-1 AGN with a
significance >99%. This result is consistent with the fact that part of the
soft emission in type-2 AGN comes from scattered radiation, and this component
is expected to be much less variable than the hard component. The observed flux
and spectral variability properties of our objects cannot be explained as being
produced by variability of one spectral component alone, for example changes in
the continuum shape associated with changes in the mass accretion rate, or
variability in the amount of X-ray absorption. At least two spectral components
must vary in order to explain the X-ray variability of our objects.

Model and give rise to characteristic dimming and polarization effects in a
light beam travelling in a magnetic field. In this Letter, we demonstrate that
photon-ALP mixing in cosmic magnetic fields produces an observable distortion
in the energy spectra of distant gamma-ray sources (like AGN) for ranges of the
ALP parameters allowed by all available constraints. The resulting effect is
expected to show up in the energy band 100 MeV - 100 GeV, and so it can be
serched with the upcoming GLAST mission.

orbits with such short ram pressure peaks are unlikely to occur in other than

behind a dust torus. If this were true, then their nuclear structure would
fundamentally differ from that of Sy2s with polarised broad lines: in
particular, they would not be explained by orientation-based AGN unification.
Further arguments for two physically different Sy2 populations have been
derived from the warm and cool IRAS F25/F60 ratios. These ratios, however,
refer to the entire host galaxies and are unsuitable to conclusively establish
the absence of a nuclear dust torus. Instead, a study of the Seyfert-2
dichotomy should be performed on the basis of nuclear properties only. Here we
present the first comparison between [OIII] 5007A and mid-infrared imaging at
matching spatial resolution. Exploring the Seyfert-2 dichotomy we find that the
distributions of nuclear mid-infrared/[OIII] luminosity ratios are
indistinguishable for Sy1s and Sy2s with and without detected polarised broad
lines and irrespective of having warm or cool IRAS F25/F60 ratios. We find no
evidence for the existence of a population of real Sy2s with a deficit of
nuclear dust emission. Our results suggest 1) that all Seyfert nuclei possess
the same physical structure including the putative dust torus and 2) that the
cool IRAS colours are caused by a low contrast of AGN to host galaxy. Then the
Seyfert-2 dichotomy is explained in part by unification of non-HBLRs with
narrow-line Sy1s and to a larger rate by observational biases caused by a low
AGN/host contrast and/or an unfavourable scattering geometry.

consider three major theoretical issues in a self consistent ways, viz.,
predictions on neutrino mass and mixing parameters, stability under RG analysis

works on parametrisation of neutrino mass matrices using only two parameters,
in addition to an overall mass scale $m_0$, and the ratio of these two
parameters fixes the value of solar mixing angle. Such parametrisation though
phenomenological gives a firm handle on the analysis of the mass matrices and
predicts lower values of solar mixing angle in the range
$\tan^2\theta_{12}=0.50-0.35$.We check the stability of the model under
radiative corrections in MSSM for large $\tan\beta\sim 58-60$ region and
observe that the evolution of $\bigtriangleup m^2_{21}$ with energy scale, is
highly dependent on the input high scale value of solar mixing angle. Solar
angle predicted by tri-bimaximal mixings and also values lower than this, do
not lead to stability of the model. Similarly, the evolution of the atmospheric
mixing angle with energy scale at large $\tan\beta$ values, shows sharp
decrease for the case with non-zero value of m_3. We apply these mass matrices

find that normal hierarchical model leads to the best result. Considering all

to search for intensity related oscillatory signatures, and periodicities
ranging from 20 to 370 s are found with significance levels exceeding 95%.
Observations in the H-alpha blue wing show more penumbral oscillatory phenomena
when compared to simultaneous G-band observations. The H-alpha oscillations are
interpreted as the signatures of plasma motions with a mean velocity of 20

some results on the both two methods. The first method is based on a

into account ergonomic constraints or joint and mechanical limits. In order to
solve this problem, the human operator is integrated in the process
optimization to contribute to a global perception of the environment. This
operator cooperates, in real-time, with several automatic local elementary
agents. In the case of the second approach, we worked with the CEA and EADS/CCR
to solve the constraints related to the evolution of human virtual in its

approach using of the virtual guides was developed to allow to the user the
realization of precise trajectory in absence of force feedback. The result of
this work validates solutions through the digital mock-up; it can be applied to

completely filled with $N_f$ flavor branes, the gravity back reaction produces
charged AdS black hole where the effect of charge on the metric is proportional
to $N_f/N_c$. As a consequence, phase diagram changes qualitatively if we allow
$N_f/N_c$ finite: it closes at the finite density unlike the probe brane
embedding approach.
  Another issue we discuss here is the question whether there is any chemical
potential dependence in the confining phase. We consider this problem in the

  Protoplanetary Disk Mass Distribution","Accepted by MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The probability of a star hosting a planet that is detectable in radial
velocity surveys increases Ppl(Z) oc 10^2Z, where Z is metallicity. Core
accretion models reproduce this trend, since the protoplanetary disk of a high
metallicity star has a high density of solids and so forms cores which accrete
gas before the primordial gas disk dissipates. This paper considers the origin
of the form of Ppl(Z). We introduce a simple model in which detectable planets
form when the mass of solids in the protoplanetary disk, Ms, exceeds a critical
value. In this model the form of Ppl(Z) is a direct reflection of the
distribution of protoplanetary disk masses, Mg, and the observed Ppl(Z) is
reproduced if P(Mg>Mg') oc 1/Mg'^2. We argue that a protoplanetary disk's
sub-mm dust mass is a pristine indicator of the mass available for
planet-building and find the observed sub-mm disk mass distribution is
consistent with the observed Ppl(Z) if Ms>0.5M_J is required to form detectable
planets. Any planet formation model which imposes a critical solid mass for
planet formation would reproduce the observed Ppl(Z), and core accretion models
are empirically consistent with a threshold criterion. We identify 7
protoplanetary disks which, by rigid application of this criterion, would be
expected to form detectable planets. A testable prediction is that Ppl(Z)
should flatten both for Z>0.5dex and as more distant and lower mass planets are
discovered. Further, combining this model with one in which the evolution of a
star's debris disk is also influenced by the solid mass in its protoplanetary
disk, results in the prediction that debris disks detected around stars with
planets should be more infrared luminous than those around stars without
planets in tentative agreement with recent observations.

$0\nu\beta\beta$-) amplitudes within the continuum random phase approximation
(cQRPA) is formulated. Calculations of the $\beta\beta$ transition amplitudes
within the cQRPA are performed for ^{76}Ge, ^{100}Mo and ^{130}Te. A rather
simple nuclear Hamiltonian consisting of phenomenological mean field and
zero-range residual particle-hole and particle-particle interaction is used.
The calculated M^{2\nu} are almost not affected when the single-particle
continuum is taken into account. At the same time, a regular suppression of the
$0\nu\beta\beta$-amplitude is found that can be associated with additional
ground state correlations due to collective states in the continuum. It is
expected that future inclusion of the nucleon pairing in the single-particle
continuum will somewhat compensate the suppression.

of interstellar dust particles profoundly affects the growth of molecules in
the interstellar medium. An important set of surface reactions produces icy
mantles of many monolayers in cold and dense regions. The monolayers are
dominated by water ice, but also contain CO, CO_{2}, and occasionally methanol
as well as minor constituents. In this paper, the rate of production of
water-ice dominated mantles is calculated for different physical conditions of
interstellar clouds and for the first time images of the morphology of
interstellar ices are presented. For this purpose, the continuous-time
random-walk Monte Carlo simulation technique has been used. The visual
extinction, density, and gas and grain temperatures are varied. It is shown
that our stochastic approach can reproduce the important observation that ice
mantles only grow in the denser regions.

investigated by means of the differential renormalization group (RG) method. In
the limit of small fermion mass the linearized RG flow is sufficient to
determine the low-energy behavior of the N-flavor model, if it has been rotated
by a suitable rotation in the internal space. For large fermion mass, the exact
RG flow has been solved numerically. The low-energy behavior of the
multi-flavor model is rather different depending on whether N=1 or N>1, where N
is the number of flavors. For N>1 the reflection symmetry always suffers
breakdown in both the weak and strong coupling regimes, in contrary to the N=1
case, where it remains unbroken in the strong coupling phase.

observational biases by comparing the observations with simulated observations

70% with 3sigma confidence), with a large probability that all intermediate
mass stars in Sco OB2 are part of a binary system. The binary systems have a
mass ratio distribution of the form f(q) ~ q^-0.4. Sco OB2 has a semi-major
axis distribution of the form f(log a) ~ constant (Opik's law), in the range
5-5e6 Rsun. The log-normal period distribution of Duquennoy & Mayor results in
too few spectroscopic binaries, even if the model binary fraction is 100%. Sco
OB2 is a young association with a low stellar density; its current population
is expected to be very similar to the primordial population. The fact that
practically all stars in Sco OB2 are part of a binary (or multiple) system
demonstrates that multiplicity is a fundamental factor in the star formation
process, at least for intermediate mass stars.

we analyse the case of a droplet of Meissner fluid, and compute the elongation
of the droplet and its quadrupole frequency as a function of the applied field.
Next, the influence of an applied field on the flow of the liquid is studied
for the case of a surface wave. We derive the dispersion relation for surface
waves on an incompressible Meissner fluid. We discuss some candidate
realizations of the Meissner fluids and for the case of a superconducting
colloid discuss which regime of wave lengths would be most affected by the

therefore, interesting enough to deserve further investigation. From this
perspective, an alternative title of the present paper could be ``why are we
still unable to write a guide on how to propose viable alternatives to general
relativity?''. Attempting to answer this question, it is argued here that
earlier efforts to turn qualitative statements, such as the Einstein
Equivalence Principle, into quantitative ones, such as the metric postulates,
stand on rather shaky grounds -- probably contrary to popular belief -- as they
appear to depend strongly on particular representations of the theory. This
includes ambiguities in the identification of matter and gravitational fields,
dependence of frequently used definitions, such as those of the stress-energy
tensor or classical vacuum, on the choice of variables, etc. Various examples
are discussed and possible approaches to this problem are pointed out. In the
course of this study, several common misconceptions related to the various
forms of the Equivalence Principle, the use of conformal frames and equivalence
between theories are clarified.

the classical and the quantum: {spontaneous creations and annihilations of
particle-antiparticle pairs are impossible in the classical world but possible
in the quantum world}. We show that it is sufficient to {change the overall
sign of the spacetime signature in the classical picture of field propagation
for it to be treated as its associated quantum picture}. To describe a
self-gravitating object at the last stage of its classical evolution, we
propose to use the Foldy--Wouthuysen representation of the Dirac equation in
curved spacetimes, and the Gozzi classical path integral. In both approaches,
maintaining the dynamics in the classical regime is controlled by
supersymmetry.

measured from the initial value. In the case of independent, identically
distributed (iid) variables, we classify the limiting distribution of the
maximum according to the properties of the parent distribution from which the
variables are drawn. Then we turn to correlated periodic Gaussian signals with
a 1/f^alpha power spectrum and study the distribution of the maximum relative
height with respect to the initial height (MRH_I). The exact MRH_I distribution
is derived for alpha=0 (iid variables), alpha=2 (random walk), alpha=4 (random
acceleration), and alpha=infinity (single sinusoidal mode). For other,
intermediate values of alpha, the distribution is determined from simulations.
We find that the MRH_I distribution is markedly different from the previously
studied distribution of the maximum height relative to the average height for
all alpha. The two main distinguishing features of the MRH_I distribution are
the much larger weight for small relative heights and the divergence at zero
height for alpha>3. We also demonstrate that the boundary conditions affect the
shape of the distribution by presenting exact results for some non-periodic
boundary conditions. Finally, we show that, for signals arising from
time-translationally invariant distributions, the density of near extreme
states is the same as the MRH_I distribution. This is used in developing a
scaling theory for the threshold singularities of the two distributions.
