local group. As a consequence the microlensed source stars are often blended
with nearby unresolved stars. The presence of `blending' is a cause of major
uncertainty when determining the lensing properties of events towards the
Galactic centre. After demonstrating empirical cases of blending we utilize
Monte Carlo simulations to probe the effects of blending. We generate
artificial microlensing events using an HST luminosity function convolved to
typical ground-based seeing, adopting a range of values for the stellar density
and seeing. We find that a significant fraction of bright events are blended,
contrary to the oft-quoted assumption that bright events should be free from
blending. We probe the effect that this erroneous assumption has on both the
observed event timescale distribution and the optical depth, using realistic
detection criteria relevent to the different surveys. Importantly, under this
assumption the latter quantity appears to be reasonably unaffected across our
adopted values for seeing and density. The timescale distribution is however
biased towards smaller values, even for the least dense fields. The dominant
source of blending is from lensing of faint source stars, rather than lensing
of bright source stars blended with nearby fainter stars. We also explore other
issues, such as the centroid motion of blended events and the phenomena of
`negative' blending. Furthermore, we breifly note that blending can affect the
determination of the centre of the red clump giant region from an observed
luminosity function. This has implications for a variety of studies, e.g.
mapping extinction towards the bulge and attempts to constrain the parameters
of the Galactic bar through red clump giant number counts. (Abridged)

in core-collapse explosions of massive stars. In particular, they may be
important in the collapsar scenario for gamma-ray bursts (GRB), where the
central engine is a hyper-accreting black hole or a millisecond magnetar. The
present paper is focussed on the magnetar scenario, with a specific emphasis on
the interaction of the magnetar magnetosphere with the infalling stellar
envelope. First, the ``Pulsar-in-a-Cavity'' problem is introduced as a paradigm
for a magnetar inside a collapsing star. The basic set-up of this fundamental
plasma-physics problem is described, outlining its main features, and simple
estimates are derived for the evolution of the magnetic field. In the context
of a collapsing star, it is proposed that, at first, the ram pressure of the
infalling plasma acts to confine the magnetosphere, enabling a gradual build-up
of the magnetic pressure. At some point, the growing magnetic pressure
overtakes the (decreasing) ram pressure of the gas, resulting in a
magnetically-driven explosion. The explosion should be highly anisotropic, as
the hoop-stress of the toroidal field, confined by the surrounding stellar
matter, collimates the magnetically-dominated outflow into two beamed
magnetic-tower jets. This creates a clean narrow channel for the escape of
energy from the central engine through the star, as required for GRBs. In
addition, the delayed onset of the collimated-explosion phase can explain the
production of large quantities of Nickel-56, as suggested by the GRB-Supernova
connection. Finally, the prospects for numerical simulations of this scenario
are discussed.

hydrogen, H2, is detected in all nine Seyfert 1 galaxies and, in the majority
of galaxies, has a spatially resolved flux distribution. In contrast, the
narrow component of the BrG emission has a distribution consistent with that of
the K-band continuum. In general, the kinematics of H2 are consistent with thin
disk rotation, with a velocity gradient of over 100 km/s measured across the
central 0''.5 in three galaxies, and across the central 1''.5 in two galaxies.
The kinematics of BrG are in agreement with the H2 rotation, except in all four
cases the central 0''.5 is either blue- or redshifted by more than 75 km/s. The
highly ionized gas, measured with the [Ca VIII] and [Si VII] coronal lines, is
spatially and kinematically consistent with BrG in the central 0''.5. Dynamical
models have been fitted to the two-dimensional H2 kinematics, taking into
account the stellar mass distribution, the emission line flux distribution, and
the point spread function. For NGC 3227 the modeling indicates a black hole
mass of Mbh = 2.0{+1.0/-0.4} x 10^7 Msun, and for NGC 4151 Mbh =

inclination angle, which is consistent with the unification theory of active
galaxies. The direct black hole mass estimates verify that masses determined
from the technique of reverberation mapping are accurate to within a factor of
three with no additional systematic errors.

dense-$k$-subgraph problems. Formally, given a metric space on $n$ vertices
$V$, with $m$ demand pairs $\subseteq V \times V$ and a ``target'' $k\le m$,
the goal is to find a minimum cost subgraph that connects at least $k$ demand
pairs. In this paper, we give an $O(\min\{\sqrt{n},\sqrt{k}\})$-approximation
algorithm for $k$-forest, improving on the previous best ratio of
$O(n^{2/3}\log n)$ by Segev & Segev.
  We then apply our algorithm for k-forest to obtain approximation algorithms
for several Dial-a-Ride problems. The basic Dial-a-Ride problem is the
following: given an $n$ point metric space with $m$ objects each with its own
source and destination, and a vehicle capable of carrying at most $k$ objects
at any time, find the minimum length tour that uses this vehicle to move each
object from its source to destination. We prove that an $\alpha$-approximation

$O(\alpha\cdot\log^2n)$-approximation algorithm for Dial-a-Ride. Using our
results for $k$-forest, we get an $O(\min\{\sqrt{n},\sqrt{k}\}\cdot\log^2 n)$-
approximation algorithm for Dial-a-Ride. The only previous result known for
Dial-a-Ride was an $O(\sqrt{k}\log n)$-approximation by Charikar &

lattice and where travel distance between cities is computed with the Manhattan
metric. In this last problem the amount of neutrality varies with the city
concentration on the grid ; assuming the concentration below one, this TSP
reasonably remains a NP-hard problem.

revealed by a survey of dc transport and optical studies over a wide range of
Mn concentrations. A thermally activated valence band contribution to dc
transport, a mid-infrared peak at energy hbar omega approx 200 meV in the ac-
conductivity, and the hot photoluminescence spectra indicate the presence of an
impurity band in low doped (<<1% Mn) insulating GaAs:Mn materials. Consistent
with the implications of this picture, both the impurity band ionization energy
inferred from the dc transport and the position of the mid-infrared peak move
to lower energies and the peak broadens with increasing Mn concentration. In
metallic materials with > 2% doping, no traces of Mn-related activated
contribution can be identified in dc-transport, suggesting that the impurity
band has merged with the valence band. No discrepancies with this perception
are found when analyzing optical measurements in the high-doped GaAs:Mn. A
higher energy (hbar omega approx 250 meV) mid-infrared feature which appears in
the metallic samples is associated with inter-valence band transitions. Its
red-shift with increased doping can be interpreted as a consequence of
increased screening which narrows the localized-state valence-band tails and
weakens higher energy transition amplitudes. Our examination of the dc and ac
transport characteristics of GaAs:Mn is accompanied by comparisons with its
shallow acceptor counterparts, confirming the disordered valence band picture
of high-doped metallic GaAs:Mn material.

  Method: We performed multi epoch B, V, R, I, z, and K imaging of McNeil's
nebula and V1647 Ori as well as K_S imaging polarimetry. The multiband imaging
allows us to reconstruct the extinction map inside the nebula. Through
polarimetric observations we attempt to disentangle the emission from the
nebula from that of the accretion disk around V1647 Ori. We also attempt to
resolve the small spatial scale structure of the illuminating source.
  Results: The energy distribution and temporal evolution of McNeil's nebula
mimic that of the illuminating source. The extinction map reveals a region of
higher extinction in the direction of V1647 Ori. Excluding foreground
extionction, the optical extinction due to McNeil's nebula in the direction of
V1647 Ori is A_V ~ 6.5 mag. The polarimetric measurement shows a compact high
polarization emission around V1647 Ori. The percentage of K_S band linear
polarization goes from 10 -- 20 %. The vectors are all well aligned with a
position angle of 90 +/- 9 degree East of North. This may correspond to the
orientation of a possible accretion disk around V1647 Ori. These findings
suggest that the appearance of McNeil's nebula is due to reflection of light by
pre-existing material in the surroundings of V1647 Ori. We also report on the
discovery of a new candidate brown dwarf or protostar in the vicinity of V1647
Ori as well as the presence of clumpy structure within HH 22A.

into account constraints of branching ratios and time dependent CP asymmetries.
Generic plots are shown and it turns out that there exist parameters for which
the CP violation is maximal. A prediction of a large CP asymmetry in B_d ->
D^+D^- is difficult to achieve in other models without contradicting the
current data in other channels. The prediction of a CP asymmetry in leptonic

due to the unparticles and show explicitly that it exactly cancels the CP
asymmetry of B^+ -> tau^+ nu as demanded by CPT invariance. Building up on
earlier works we investigate the breaking of scale invaricance, due to the

massive, star-forming galaxies at 1 < z < 2.5, selected from the FDF

constrained from a parametric description of the UV spectral energy

radiative transfer models for different geometries, dust/stars configurations
and dust properties. In at least one third of the sample, there is a robust
evidence for extinction curves with at least a moderate UV bump. The presence
of the carriers of the UV bump is more evident in galaxies with UV SEDs
suffering from heavy reddening. We interpret these results as follows. The
sample objects possess different mixtures of dust grains and molecules
producing extinction curves in between the average ones of the Small and Large
Magellanic Cloud, where the UV bump is absent or modest, respectively. Most of
the dust embeds the UV-emitting stellar populations or is distributed out of

albedo with wavelength or an age-dependent extinction are not sufficient to
explain the previous trend with reddening. Hence, additional extraplanar dust
has to be invoked. The data suggest that the carriers of the UV bump are
associated with intermediate-age stellar populations, while they survive in the
harshest UV-radiation fields owing to dust self-shielding. [abridged]

systems is to realise their potential as quantum computers. Probably the most
significant obstacle in this direction is the problem of ""decoherence"": the
extreme fragility of quantum systems to environmental noise and other control
limitations. The theory of fault-tolerant quantum error correction has shown
that quantum computation is possible even in the presence of decoherence
provided that the noise affecting the quantum system satisfies certain
well-defined theoretical conditions. However, existing methods for noise
characterisation have become intractable already for the systems that are
controlled in today's labs. In this paper we introduce a technique based on
symmetrisation that enables direct experimental characterisation of key
properties of the decoherence affecting a multi-body quantum system. Our method
reduces the number of experiments required by existing methods from exponential
to polynomial in the number of subsystems. We demonstrate the application of
this technique to the optimisation of control over nuclear spins in the solid
state.

between the recent DC data as well as a discrepancy of the three reports of the

dominates at higher energies and must be subtracted from measured data to
extrapolate to zero energy. Hence the uncertainty of the measured slope leads
to an additional uncertainty of the extrapolated zero energy cross section
factor, S17(0). This uncertainty must be alleviated by future experiments to
allow a precise determination of S17(0), a goal that so far has not be achieved

luminosity (10^10.3 L_\odot), UV surface brightness (10^9.4 L_\odot kpc^-2),
SFR, and metallicity to that observed in Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). We show
that Haro 11 has extended, soft thermal (kT~0.68 keV) X-ray emission with a
luminosity and size which scales with the physical properties (e.g. SFR,
stellar mass) of the host galaxy. An enhanced alpha/Fe, ratio of ~4 relative to
solar abundance suggests significant supernovae enrichment. These results are
consistent with the X-ray emission being produced in a shock between a
supernovae driven outflow and the ambient material. The FUV spectra show strong
absorption lines similar to those observed in LBG spectra. A blueshifted
absorption component is identified as a wind outflowing at ~200-280 km/s.
OVI\lambda\lambda1032,1038 emission, the dominant cooling mechanism for coronal
gas at T~10^5.5 K is also observed. If associated with the outflow, the
luminosity of the OVI emission suggests that <20% of the total mechanical
energy from the supernovae and solar winds is being radiated away. This implies
that radiative cooling through OVI is not significantly inhibiting the growth
of the outflowing gas. In contradiction to the findings of Bergvall et al 2006,
we find no convincing evidence of Lyman continuum leakage in Haro 11. We
conclude that the wind has not created a `tunnel' allowing the escape of a
significant fraction of Lyman continuum photons and place a limit on the escape
fraction of f_{esc}<2%. Overall, both Haro 11 and a previously observed LBG

results are quite general and are applicable to different processes, e.g.

we find that when the energy injection velocity is smaller than the Alfven
speed the heat transfer is partially suppressed, while in the opposite regime
the effects of turbulence depend on the intensity of driving. In fact, the
scale $l_A$ at which the turbulent velocity is equal the Alfven velocity is a
new important parameter. When the electron mean free path $\lambda$ is larger
than $l_A$, the stronger the the turbulence, the lower thermal conductivity by
electrons is. The turbulent motions, however, induces their own advective

be regarded as topological versions of recent algebraic theorems. One is on
recollements of triangulated categories, which have been studied in the
algebraic case by J{\o}rgensen. We give a criterion which answers the following
question: When is there a recollement for the derived category of a given
symmetric ring spectrum in terms of two other symmetric ring spectra? The other
result is on well generated triangulated categories in the sense of Neeman.
Porta characterizes the algebraic well generated categories as localizations of
derived categories of DG categories. We prove a topological analogon: a
topological triangulated category is well generated if and only if it is
triangulated equivalent to a localization of the derived category of a
symmetric ring spectrum with several objects. Here `topological' means
triangulated equivalent to the homotopy category of a spectral model category.
Moreover, we show that every well generated spectral model category is Quillen
equivalent to a Bousfield localization of a category of modules via a single
Quillen functor.

a cool core, the size of which is found to correlate with the mean temperature
of the group derived outside this core. When scaled to this mean temperature,
the temperature profiles are remarkably similar, being analogous to those of
more massive clusters at large radii but significantly flatter inwards of the
temperature peak. The Fe abundance generally shows a central excess followed by
a radial decline, reaching a typical value of 0.1 solar within r_500, a factor
of two lower than corresponding results for clusters. Si shows less systematic
radial variation, on average displaying a less pronounced decline than Fe and
showing evidence for a flattening at large radii. Off-centre abundance peaks
are seen both for Fe and Si in a number of groups with well-resolved cores.
Derived abundance ratios indicate that supernovae type Ia are responsible for
80 per cent of the Fe in the group core, but the type II contribution increases
with radius and completely dominates at r_500. We present fitting formulae for
the radial dependence of temperature and abundances, to facilitate comparison

homogeneous and anisotropic universe of the Bianchi I type. Starting from a
general parameterisation of the perturbed spacetime a la Bardeen, a complete
set of gauge invariant variables is constructed. Three physical degrees of
freedom are identified and it is shown that, in the case where matter is
described by a scalar field, they generalize the Mukhanov-Sasaki variables. In
order to show that they are canonical variables, the action for the
cosmological perturbations at second order is derived. Two major physical
imprints of the primordial anisotropy are identified: (1) a scalar-tensor
``see-saw'' mechanism arising from the fact that scalar, vector and tensor
modes do not decouple and (2) an explicit dependence of the statistical
properties of the density perturbations and gravity waves on the wave-vector
instead of its norm. This analysis extends, but also sheds some light on, the
quantization procedure that was developed under the assumption of a
Friedmann-Lemaitre background spacetime, and allows to investigate the
robustness of the predictions of the standard inflationary scenario with
respect to the hypothesis on the symmetries of the background spacetime. These
effects of a primordial anisotropy may be related to some anomalies of the
cosmic microwave background anisotropies on large angular scales.

observations find quite round halos. This is most likely due to the
condensation of baryons leading to rounder halos. We examine the halo phase
space distribution basis for such shape changes. Triaxial halos are supported
by box orbits, which pass arbitrarily close to the density center. The decrease
in triaxiality caused by baryons is thought to be due to the scattering of
these orbits. We test this hypothesis with simulations of disks grown inside
triaxial halos. After the disks are grown we check whether the phase space
structure has changed by evaporating the disks and comparing the initial and
final states. While the halos are substantially rounder when the disk is at
full mass, their final shape after the disk is evaporated is not much different
from the initial. Likewise, the halo becomes (more) radially anisotropic when
the disk is grown, but the final anisotropy is consistent with the initial.
Only if the baryons are unreasonably compact or massive does the halo change
irreversibly. We show that the character of individual orbits is not generally
changed by the growing mass. Thus the central condensation of baryons does not
destroy enough box orbits to cause the shape change. Rather, box orbits merely
become rounder along with the global potential. However, if angular momentum is
transferred to the halo, either via satellites or via bars, a large
irreversible change in the halo distribution occurs. The ability of satellites
to alter the phase space distribution of the halo is of particular concern to
galaxy formation simulations since halo triaxiality can profoundly influence
the evolution of disks.

We detail the DIANA (Data Intensive and Network Aware) scheduling algorithm and
its queue management system for coping with the load distribution and for
supporting bulk job scheduling. We demonstrate that such a system is beneficial
for dynamic, distributed and self-organizing resource management and can assist
in optimizing load or job distribution in complex Grid infrastructures.

coupled electronic states, taking into account the possibility of multi-state
conical intersections. The general situation of an arbitrary number of states
and arbitrary number of nuclear degrees of freedom (modes) is considered. The
macrosystem is decomposed into a system part carrying a few, strongly coupled
modes, and an environment, comprising the vast number of remaining modes. By
successively transforming the modes of the environment, a hierarchy of
effective Hamiltonians for the environment is constructed. Each effective
Hamiltonian depends on a reduced number of effective modes, which carry
cumulative effects. By considering the system's Hamiltonian along with a few
members of the hierarchy, it is shown mathematically by a moment analysis that
the quantum dynamics of the entire macrosystem can be numerically exactly
computed on a given time-scale. The time scale wanted defines the number of
effective Hamiltonians to be included. The contribution of the environment to
the quantum dynamics of the macrosystem translates into a sequential coupling
of effective modes. The wavefunction of the macrosystem is known in the full
space of modes, allowing for the evaluation of observables such as the
time-dependent individual excitation along modes of interest, as well a spectra

types of ensembles, with particular statistical characteristics. In the present
work, the statistical theory of nonequilibrium processes which is based on
nonequilibrium ensemble formalism is discussed. The kinetic approach to dynamic
many-body problems, which is important from the point of view of the
fundamental theory of irreversibility, is alluded to. The emphasis is on the
method of the nonequilibrium statistical operator (NSO) developed by D. N.
Zubarev. The NSO method permits one to generalize the Gibbs ensemble method to
the nonequilibrium case and to construct a nonequilibrium statistical operator
which enables one to obtain the transport equations and calculate the transport
coefficients in terms of correlation functions, and which, in the case of
equilibrium, goes over to the Gibbs distribution. Although some space is
devoted to the formal structure of the NSO method, the emphasis is on its
utility. Applications to specific problems such as the generalized transport
and kinetic equations, and a few examples of the relaxation and dissipative
processes, which manifest the operational ability of the method, are
considered.

spatio-temporal intermittency of two distinct types: spatio-temporal
intermittency of the directed percolation (DP) class, and spatial intermittency

be special cases of the spreading and non-spreading regimes seen in the system.
In the spreading regime, each site can infect its neighbours permitting an
initial disturbance to spread, whereas in the non-spreading regime no infection
is possible. The two regimes are separated by a line which we call the
infection line. The coupled map lattice can be mapped on to an equivalent
cellular automaton which shows a transition from a probabilistic cellular
automaton (PCA) to a deterministic cellular automaton (DCA) at the infection

assuming that most of the transport on the network flows along the shortest
paths. However, there are different scenarios in which non-shortest paths are
used to reach the network destination. Thus the consideration of the shortest
paths only does not account for the global communicability of a complex
network. Here we propose a new measure of the communicability of a complex
network, which is a broad generalization of the concept of the shortest path.
According to the new measure, most of real-world networks display the largest
communicability between the most connected (popular) nodes of the network
(assortative communicability). There are also several networks with the
disassortative communicability, where the most ""popular"" nodes communicate very
poorly to each other. Using this information we classify a diverse set of
real-world complex systems into a small number of universality classes based on
their structure-dynamic correlation. In addition, the new communicability
measure is able to distinguish finer structures of networks, such as
communities into which a network is divided. A community is unambiguously
defined here as a set of nodes displaying larger communicability among them
than to the rest of nodes in the network.

supports four trapped normal modes in which the loops move rigidly in the

is increasingly complex, and the use of most classical engineering practices is
unsuccessful. Not only is the development of such applications a
time-consuming, error prone and expensive task, but also the resulting
applications are often hard-coded for specific Grid configurations, platforms

Grid-based application is a paradox since there are many existing architectural
approaches for distributed computing, which could ease and promote rigorous
engineering methods based on the re-use of software components. It is our

dimensional Luttinger liquid from a localized non-homogeneous magnetic field,
which might be brought about by the stray field of magnetic tip near a uniform

liquids.
  From a renormalization group treatment of the electron interactions we deduce
scaling equations for the transmission and reflection amplitudes as the
bandwidth is progressively reduced to an energy scale set by the temperature.
The repulsive interactions dictate two possible zero temperature insulator
fixed points: one in which electrons are reflected in the same spin channel and
another where the electron spin is reversed upon reflection. In the latter
case, a finite spin current emerges in the absence of a charge current at zero
temperature and the Friedel oscillations form a transverse spiraling spin
density. Adding a purely potential scattering term has no effect on the fixed
points of a uniformly magnetized liquid. For a DW we find that the introduction
of potential scattering stabilizes the spin-flip insulator phase even if the
single-particle spin-flip scattering produced by the DW is arbitrarily weak.
The potential can be induced externally, e.g. by a local gate voltage or a
constriction, providing a means for controlling the transport properties of the
wire.

between dwarfs and giants to the much larger masses of giants' convective
envelopes. If the metal excess on the main sequence is due to pollution, the
effects of dilution naturally explains why it is not observed among evolved

Subdwarf B stars are core helium burning objects, but their formation is poorly
understood as neither single star nor binary evolution can fully explain their
observed properties. Since 1997 an increasing number of sdB stars has been
found to pulsate forming two classes of stars (the V361 Hya and V1093 Her
stars). We focus on the bright V 361 Hya star PG1605+072 to characterize its
frequency spectrum. While most previous studies relied on light variations, we
have measured radial velocity variations for as much as 20 modes. In this paper
we aim at characterizing the modes from atmospheric parameter and radial
velocity variations. Time resolved spectroscopy ($\approx$9000 spectra) has
been carried out to detect line profile variations from which variations of the
effective temperature and gravity are extracted by means of a quantitative
spectral analysis. We measured variations of effective temperatures and
gravities for eight modes with semi-amplitudes ranging from $\Delta
T_{\rm{eff}}=880$ K to as small as 88 K and $\Delta\log{g}$ of 0.08 dex to as
low as 0.008 dex. Gravity and temperature vary almost in phase, whereas phase
lags are found between temperature and radial velocity. This profound analysis
of a unique data set serves as sound basis for the next step towards an
identification of pulsation modes. As rotation may play an important role the
modelling of pulsation modes is challenging but feasible.

experiments such as pump-probe spectroscopy and coherent quantum control,
including spin and photon echo techniques. However, in the terahertz (THz)
region of the spectrum, beam divergence due to diffraction limits the useful
length of traditional free space delay lines. We present a novel double-folded
variable delay line for light in the frequency range 0.24-1.2 THz, which
incorporates a symmetric arrangement of lenses whose spacing can be adjusted to
compensate for diffraction at each delay. Scalable for use in other wavelength
regimes, the design relays an input Gaussian beam waist to the output with up
to 25 ns (~8 m) total delay and is enclosed in a desiccated volume of <0.5 m^3.
The delay line can deliver two or three pulses with relative amplitudes
controlled via variable spacing silicon etalon beam splitters. Beam profiles of
a 0.24 THz beam show good agreement with calculations at long delays, with
insertion loss per delay stage of~3 dB.

have extremely high enhancements of the light elements C, N, and O relative to
Fe and appear to represent a statistically significant excess population
relative to the halo metallicity distribution extrapolated from [Fe/H] > -3.
This study weighs the available evidence for and against three hypothetical
origins for these stars: (1) that they formed from gas enriched by a primordial
``faint supernova'', (2) that they formed from gas enriched by core-collapse
supernovae and C-rich gas ejected in rotation-driven winds from massive stars,
and (3) that they formed as the low-mass secondaries in binary systems at Z ~
10^{-5.5} Zsun and acquired their light-element enhancements from an
intermediate-mass companion as it passed through an AGB phase. The observations
interpreted here, especially the depletion of lithium seen in HE1327-2326,
favor the binary mass-transfer hypothesis. If HE0107-5240 and HE1327-2326
formed in binary systems, the statistically significant absence of isolated
and/or C-normal stars at similar [Fe/H] implies that low-mass stars could form
at that metallicity, but that masses M ~< 1.4 Msun were disfavored in the IMF.
This result is also explained if the abundance-derived top-heavy IMF for
primordial stars persists to [Fe/H] ~ -5.5. This finding indicates that
low-mass star formation was possible at extremely low metallicity, and that the
typical stellar mass may have had a complex dependence on metallicity rather
than a sharp transition driven solely by gas cooling.
