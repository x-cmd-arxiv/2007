the holographic bulk, this translates to an apparent horizon splitting the
space into two regions - with the UV completion of the PFT sitting at the
horizon. We unravel this intricate UV-IR setting and devise a prescription for
computing correlators that extends the original dictionary of holographic
renormalization group. We then implement a cosmological scenario where PFT

equivalent structures on principal bundles, the general conditions for
equivalence of their Lagrangians have not been explicitly stated. In this paper
we address the conditions for equivalence. The formulation of these conditions
is based on previous work in which the Dirac and Einstein equations were
unified in a tetrad formulation of the Kaluza-Klein model. This Kaluza-Klein
model is derived from mapping a bispinor field to a set of SL(2,R) x U(1) gauge
potentials and a complex scalar field. (A straightforward derivation of this
map using Hestenes' tetrad for the spin connection in a Riemannian space-time
is included in this paper.) Investigation of this Kaluza-Klein model reveals
two general conditions for establishing an exact equivalence between
Kaluza-Klein and Yang-Mills theories. The first condition is that only
horizontal vector fields occur in the Kaluza-Klein Lagrangian. The second is
that the scalar curvature be restricted to a sum over horizontal sectional
curvatures. We conclude that all known fields (including fermion fields) can
then be represented as components of a Kaluza-Klein metric together with scalar
fields.

Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star to an asymmetric post-AGB (pAGB) object is
poorly understood. In particular, excess momenta in the outflows of pAGB
objects suggest that a binary may be required to supply an additional source of
energy and angular momentum. The extraction of rotational energy from the
engine is likely fundamental and may be facilitated if a dynamo is operating in
the interior. In this regard, single star magnetic outflow models have been
proposed as mechanisms for producing and shaping PNe, however these models
neglect the back-reaction of the large-scale magnetic field on the flow.
  Here we present a transient $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo operating in the envelope
of an AGB star in (1) an isolated setting and (2) a common envelope in which
the secondary is a low-mass companion in-spiraling in the AGB interior. The
back reaction of the fields on the shear is included and differential rotation
and rotation deplete via turbulent dissipation and Poynting flux. For an
isolated star, the shear must be resupplied in order to sufficiently sustain
the dynamo. We comment on the energy requirements that convection must satisfy
to accomplish this. For the common envelope case, a robust dynamo can result as
the companion provides an additional source of energy and angular momentum.

tables. In particular, the subclass of graphical log-linear models provides a
general framework for modelling conditional independences. However, with the
exception of special structures, marginal independence hypotheses cannot be
accommodated by these traditional models. Focusing on binary variables, we
present a model class that provides a framework for modelling marginal
independences in contingency tables. The approach taken is graphical and draws
on analogies to multivariate Gaussian models for marginal independence. For the
graphical model representation we use bi-directed graphs, which are in the
tradition of path diagrams. We show how the models can be parameterized in a
simple fashion, and how maximum likelihood estimation can be performed using a
version of the Iterated Conditional Fitting algorithm. Finally we consider
combining these models with symmetry restrictions.

sites called replication origins. Locally, each replication origin is
""licensed"", or specified, at the end of the M and the beginning of G1 phases of

activated in stages corresponding to early and late replicating domains. The
staged and progressive activation of replication origins reflects the need to
maintain a strict balance between the number of active replication forks and
the rate at which DNA synthesis procedes. This suggests that origin densities
(frequency of intiation) and replication fork movement (rates of elongation)
must be co-regulated in order to guarantee the efficient and complete
duplication of each subchromosomal domain. Emerging evidence supports this
proposal and suggests that the ATM/ATR intra-S phase checkpoint plays an

matter power spectrum on small scales. Although this function is well-studied
for Local Group dwarfs, theoretical predictions and observational measurements
are difficult for satellite galaxies, because of ram pressure and tidal
stripping. By contrast, isolated dwarf galaxies are less affected by these
processes, and almost always have enough 21cm emission to trace their dynamics
robustly. Here, we test cold dark matter cosmology using isolated low mass
dwarf galaxies from the SDSS with measured 21cm widths. We find consistency
between the predicted and observed number density of isolated galaxies down to
circular velocities of 50 km/s. Our technique yields a direct test of
small-scale cosmology independent of the Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum, but
our sample is currently statistically less powerful: warm dark matter particles
heavier than 0.5 keV cannot be ruled out. Our major systematic uncertainty is
the surface brightness limit of the SDSS. Blind HI surveys, such as the ALFALFA
survey on Arecibo, will uncover a larger number of isolated low mass galaxies
and increase the power of our constraints. With our sample, we also find that
the Tully-Fisher relation for dwarf galaxies is a strong function of
environment, and that the baryonic fraction is only a weak function of mass.

sufficient in this group to remove the cold disk gas from a V_rot~150 km s^-1

timescale of approximately 1 Gyr. Since the cooling of the hot gas component
provides a source for new cold gas, the stripping of the hot component
effectively cuts off the supply of cold gas. This in turn leads to a quenching
of star formation. The galaxy maintains the disk component after the cold gas
is consumed, which may lead to a galaxy similar to an S0. Our self-consistent
simulation suggests that this strangulation mechanism works even in low mass
groups, providing an explanation for the lower star formation rates in group

evolution of the dust cloud. Preliminary models for the charge evolution on
fractal aggregates immersed in a plasma environment calculated using a
modification to the orbital-motion-limited (OML) theory are presented in this
paper. The model calculates currents to each point on the aggregate surface
using a line-of-sight (LOS) approximation: only those electron or ion
trajectories which are not blocked by another grain within the aggregate
contribute to the charging current. Both the total charge and the dipole moment
are calculated for the dust aggregate. While most coagulation theories assume
that it is difficult for like-charged grains to coagulate, the OML_LOS
approximation indicates that the electric potentials of aggregate structures
are often reduced enough to allow significant coagulation.

considered impurities, either boron or phosphorous (doping) or both (codoping),
located at different substitutional sites of silicon nanocrystals with size
ranging from 1.1 nm to 1.8 nm in diameter. We have found that the codoped
nanocrystals have the lowest impurity formation energies when the two
impurities occupy nearest neighbor sites near the surface. In addition, such
systems present band-edge states localized on the impurities giving rise to a
red-shift of the absorption thresholds with respect to that of undoped
nanocrystals. Our detailed theoretical analysis shows that the creation of an
electron-hole pair due to light absorption determines a geometry distortion
that in turn results in a Stokes shift between adsorption and emission spectra.
In order to give a deeper insight in this effect, in one case we have
calculated the absorption and emission spectra going beyond the single-particle
approach showing the important role played by many-body effects. The entire set

dielectric-conductor interface the scattering matrix is no longer unitary due
to the presence of losses at the conductor. However, the dissipative term
appearing in the Poynting theorem can be interpreted as a single absorbing mode
at the conductor such that a whole S, satisfying flux conservation and

relation: A law of inertia in Beltrami atlas with Beltrami time simultaneity
for the PoR on one side. The proper-time simultaneity and a RW-like dS-space
with entropy and an accelerated expanding S^3 fitting the cosmological
principle on another. If our universe is asymptotic to the RW-like dS-space, it
should be slightly closed with an entropy bound. Contrarily, via its asymptotic
behavior, it can fix on Beltrami frames without `an argument in a circle' and
acts as the origin of inertia. There is a triality of conformal extensions of
three kinds of SR and their null physics on the projective boundary of a 5-d
AdS-space. Thus there is a dS-spacetime on the boundary of a vacuum of
supergravity. Gravity should be based on the localized PoR of full maximum
symmetry with a gauge-like dynamics. Thus, this may lead to theory of gravity
of corresponding local maximum symmetry. A simple model of dS-gravity
characterized by a dimensionless constant shows the features. Our universe may
already indicate that the dS SR and the dS-gravity be the foundation of large
scale physics.

allow the computation of decay constants, form factors and other exclusive
scattering amplitudes. Relativistic light-front equations in ordinary

2005 September 22--23, for a net exposure of 35 ks with the X-ray Imaging
Spectrometer (XIS) and 20 ks with the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD). The source was
detected over a broad and continuous energy range of 0.7--300 keV, with an
intensity of $\sim$50 mCrab at 20 keV. At a distance of 3.2 kpc, the 0.7--300
keV luminosity is $ \sim 5.1 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\sim 0.7$ % of the
Eddington luminosity for a 6 $M_{\odot}$ black hole). The source was in a
typical low/hard state, exhibiting a power-law shaped continuum with a photon
index of $\sim 1.6$. During the observation, the source intensity gradually
decreased by 25% at energies above $\sim 3$ keV, and by 35% below 2 keV. This,
together with the soft X-ray spectra taken with the XIS, suggests the presence
of an independent soft component that can be represented by emission from a
cool ($\sim 0.2$ keV) disk. The hard X-ray spectra obtained with the HXD reveal
a high-energy spectral cutoff, with an e-folding energy of $\sim 200$ keV.
Since the spectral photon index above 10 keV is harder by $\sim 0.4$ than that
observed in the softer energy band, and the e-folding energy is higher than
those of typical reflection humps, the entire 0.7--300 keV spectrum cannot be
reproduced by a single thermal Comptonization model, even considering
reflection effects. Instead, the spectrum (except the soft excess) can be
successfully explained by invoking two thermal-Comptonization components with
different $y$-parameters. In contrast to the high/soft state spectra of this
object in which narrow iron absorption lines are detected with equivalent
widths of 60--100 eV, the present XIS spectra bear no such features beyond an
upper-limit equivalent width of 25 eV.

ellipticals (dEs) with -16.6<M_V<-8.8 mag in the following three steps: (1) To
verify cluster membership, we measured I-band surface brightness fluctuations
(SBF) distances to candidate dEs known from previous surveys; (2) We
re-assessed morphological classifications for those candidate dEs that are too
faint for SBF detection; and (3) We searched for new candidate dEs in the
size-luminosity regime close to the resolution limit of previous surveys. The
resulting fiducial dE sample follows a well-defined surface brightness -
magnitude relation, showing that Fornax dEs are about 40% larger than Local
Group dEs. The sample also defines a colour-magnitude relation similar to that
of Local Group dEs. The early-type dwarf galaxy luminosity function in Fornax
has a very flat faint end slope alpha = -1.1 +/- 0.1. We compare the number of
dwarfs per unit mass with those in other environments and find that the Fornax

They can be interpreted as the uncertainty relations between measurement errors

measurement error and back-action of measurement. A no-cloning inequality is
derived from the trade-off relations. Furthermore, our formulation and the
obtained results can be applied to analyze quantum state tomography. We also
show that the accuracy matrix is closely related to the maximum-likelihood

the accuracy matrix tells us how accurately we can estimate the probability

example is the ``opinion swing'' problem: ``Has the proportion of people
favoring a politician changed after his recent speech to the nation on TV?''.
Since the same group of individuals is interviewed before and after the speech,
the two proportions are correlated. A natural null hypothesis to be tested is
whether the corresponding population proportions are equal. A standard Bayesian
approach to this problem has already been considered in the literature, based
on a Dirichlet prior for the cell-probabilities of the underlying two-by-two
table under the alternative hypothesis, together with an induced prior under
the null. In lack of specific prior information, a diffuse (e.g. uniform)
distribution may be used. We claim that this approach is not satisfactory,
since in a testing problem one should make sure that the prior under the
alternative be adequately centered around the region specified by the null, in
order to obtain a fair comparison between the two hypotheses. Following an
intrinsic prior methodology, we develop two strategies for the construction of
a collection of objective priors increasingly peaked around the null. We
provide a simple interpretation of their structure in terms of weighted
imaginary sample scenarios. We illustrate our method by means of three
examples, carrying out sensitivity analysis and providing comparison with
existing results.

waves propagating in divergent stratified coronal structures are presented.
These show that the enhanced phase mixing mechanism can dissipate Alfven waves
at heights less than half that is predicted by the previous analytical
solutions. The enhanced phase mixing of 0.1 Hz harmonic Alfven waves
propagating in strongly divergent, H_b=5 Mm, stratified coronal structures,
H_rho=50 Mm, can fulfill 100% of an active region heating requirement, by
generating viscous heating fluxes of F_H~2100 J /m^2 /s. The Alfven waves in
this configuration are fully dissipated within 20 Mm, which is six times lower
than would occur as a result of standard phase mixing in uniform magnetic
fields. This results in the heating scale height, s_H, being lowered by a
factor of six, to less than half of an active regions density scale height.
Using the corrected analytical solutions it was found that, for a given wave
frequency, the generation of a heating scale height of s_H<=50 Mm, by enhanced
phase mixing in strongly divergent magnetic fields, requires a shear viscosity
eight orders of magnitude lower, than required by standard phase mixing in
uniform magnetic fields. It was also found that the enhanced phase mixing of
observable, 0.01 rads /s Alfven waves, in strongly divergent magnetic fields,
H_b=5 Mm, can generate heating scale heights within a density scale height,
H_rho=50 Mm, using classical Braginskii viscosity. It is therefore not
necessary to invoke anomalous viscosity in corona, if phase mixing takes place
in strongly divergent magnetic fields. This study shows that the importance of
enhanced phase mixing as a mechanism for dissipating Alfven waves in the solar
corona (a stratified and divergent medium), has been seriously underestimated.

be described with a tsunami-like distribution function we derive the
expressions of the dispersion law of the collective modes. Then the behavior of
the unstable gauge modes of the system is analyzed for various values of the
velocity of the jet, of the momentum of the collective modes and of the angle
between these two quantities. We find that the most unstable modes are those
with momentum orthogonal to the velocity of the jet and that these
instabilities appear when the velocity of the jet is higher than a threshold

called colouring polynomials, and studies their relationship to Yang-Baxter
invariants and quandle 2-cocycle invariants.
  For a knot K in the 3-sphere let \pi_K be the fundamental group of the knot
complement, and let (m_K,l_K) be a meridian-longitude pair in \pi_K. Given a
finite group G and an element x in G, we consider the set of representations
\rho from \pi_K to G that map the meridian m_K to x, and define the colouring
polynomial P(K) as the sum over all longitude images \rho(l_K). The resulting
invariant maps knots to the group ring Z[G]. It is multiplicative with respect
to connected sum and equivariant with respect to symmetry operations of knots.
Examples are given to show that colouring polynomials distinguish knots for
which other invariants fail, in particular they can distinguish knots from
their mutants, obverses, inverses, or reverses.
  We prove that every quandle 2-cocycle state-sum invariant of knots is a
specialization of some knot colouring polynomial. This provides a complete
topological interpretation of these invariants in terms of the knot group and
its peripheral system. Furthermore, we show that P can be presented as a
Yang-Baxter invariant, i.e. as the trace of some linear braid group
representation. This entails in particular that Yang-Baxter invariants can
detect non-inversible and non-reversible knots.

quasiparticles in non-trivial backgrounds from the quantum field theory point
of view. By ""non-trivial background"" we mean either a non-vacuum state in
Minkowski spacetime or an arbitrary state in a curved spacetime. Starting with
the case of a flat spacetime, the basic properties of the particle and
quasiparticle propagation are analyzed using two different methods other than
the conventional mean-field-based techniques: on the one hand, the quantum
state corresponding to the quasiparticle excitation is explicitly constructed;
on the other hand, the spectral representation of the two-point propagators is
analyzed. Both methods lead to the same results: the energy and decay rate of
the quasiparticles are determined by the real and imaginary parts of the
retarded self-energy respectively. These general results are applied to two
particular quantum systems: first, a scalar particle immersed in a thermal
graviton bath; second, a simplified atomic model, seizing the opportunity to
connect with other statistical and first-quantized approaches. In the second
part of the thesis the results are extended to curved spacetime. Working with a
quasilocal quasiparticle concept the flat-spacetime results are recovered. In
cosmology, within the adiabatic approximation, it is possible to go beyond the
flat spacetime results and find additional effects due to the universe
expansion. The cosmologically-induced effects are analyzed, obtaining that
there might be an additional contribution to the particle decay due to the
universe expansion. In the de Sitter case, this additional contribution
coincides with the decay rate in a thermal bath in a flat spacetime at the
corresponding de Sitter temperature.

simulate fluxes and polarization of horizontally inhomogeneous planets by
weighting results for homogeneous planets. Like the flux, F, the degree of
polarization, P, of the reflected starlight is shown to depend strongly on the
phase angle, on the composition and structure of the planetary atmosphere, on
the reflective properties of the underlying surface, and on the wavelength, in

tells us that the competition between the frequency $\omega_{out}$ of the

medium is the key point responsible for the emergence of negative phase
velocity and the corresponding antiwaves. $\omega_{out}\omega_{0}>0$ and
$|\omega_{out}|<|\omega_{0}|$ are the criterions for the waves with negative

a calibration of the synthetic HeI full-widths at half maximum versus stellar
vsini. A grid of synthetic spectra of HeI line profiles was calculated in
non-LTE using an extensive helium model atom and updated atomic data. The
vsini's for all stars were derived using the He I FWHM calibrations but also,
for those target stars with relatively sharp lines, vsini values were obtained
from best fit synthetic spectra of up to 40 lines of CII, NII, OII, AlIII,
MgII, SiIII, and SIII. This calibration is a useful and efficient tool for
estimating the projected rotational velocities of O9-B5 main-sequence stars.
The distribution of vsini for an unbiased sample of early B stars in the
unbound association Cep OB2 is consistent with the distribution reported
elsewhere for other unbound associations.

optimization framework there is a single decision maker who assigns network
resources and in the game framework users share the network resources according
to Nash equilibrium. The solution of these problems is based on so-called
water-filling technique, which in turn uses bisection method for solution of
non-linear equations for Lagrange multiplies. Here we provide a closed form
solution to the water-filling problem, which allows us to solve it in a finite
number of operations. Also, we produce a closed form solution for the Nash
equilibrium in symmetric Gaussian interference game with an arbitrary number of
users. Even though the game is symmetric, there is an intrinsic hierarchical
structure induced by the quantity of the resources available to the users. We
use this hierarchical structure to perform a successive reduction of the game.
In addition, to its mathematical beauty, the explicit solution allows one to
study limiting cases when the crosstalk coefficient is either small or large.
We provide an alternative simple proof of the convergence of the Iterative
Water Filling Algorithm. Furthermore, it turns out that the convergence of
Iterative Water Filling Algorithm slows down when the crosstalk coefficient is
large. Using the closed form solution, we can avoid this problem. Finally, we
compare the non-cooperative approach with the cooperative approach and show
that the non-cooperative approach results in a more fair resource distribution.

v_2 to jet suppression is examined. A study of Mach shocks generated by fast

convective envelope of a young (10 Myr) one-solar-mass star, obtained with the
Anelastic Spherical Harmonic code. Since young stars are known to be faster
rotators than their main sequence counterparts, we have systematically studied
the impact of the stellar rotation speed, by considering stars spinning up to
five times as fast as the Sun. The aim of these nonlinear models is to
understand the complex interactions between convection and rotation. We discuss
the influence of the turbulence level and of the rotation rate on the intensity
and the topology of the mean flows. For all of the computed models, we find a
solar-type superficial differential rotation, with an equatorial acceleration,
and meridional circulation that exhibits a multicellular structure. Even if the
differential rotation contrast decreases only marginally for high rotation
rates, the meridional circulation intensity clearly weakens according to our
simulations. We have also shown that, for Taylor numbers above a certain
threshold (Ta>10^9), the convection can develop a vacillating behavior. Since
simulations with high turbulence levels and rotation rates exhibit strongly
cylindrical internal rotation profiles, we have considered the influence of
baroclinic effects at the base of the convective envelope of these young Suns,
to see whether such effect can modify the otherwise near cylindrical profiles
to produce more conical, solar-like profiles.

two capacitively coupled Josephson junctions. In the classical case the
equations of motion admit discrete breather solutions, which are time periodic
and localized predominantly on one of the junctions. In the quantum case
breather states are found in the central part of the energy spectrum of the
confined nonescaping states of the system. We perform a systematic analysis of
their tunneling frequency, site correlations, fluctuations of the number of
quanta, and entanglement. Quantum breather states show strong site correlation
of quanta and are characterized by a strong excitation of quanta on one
junction which perform slow coherent tunneling motion from one junction to the
other. They suppress fluctuations of the total number of excited quanta.
Quantum breather states are the least entangled states among the group of
eigenstates in the same range of the energy spectrum. We describe how quantum
breather excitations could be experimentally observed by employing the already
developed techniques for quantum information processing using Josephson
junctions.
