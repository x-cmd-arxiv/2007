but anisotropic universes. We present an exhaustive computation for the case of
a Bianchi I model, with a residual isotropy between two spatial dimensions,
which is undergoing complete isotropization at the onset of inflation; we also
show how the computation can be further extended to more general backgrounds.
In presence of a single inflaton field, there are three physical perturbations
(precisely as in the isotropic case), which are obtained (i) by removing gauge
and nondynamical degrees of freedom, and (ii) by finding the combinations of
the remaining modes in terms of which the quadratic action of the perturbations
is canonical. The three perturbations, which later in the isotropic regime
become a scalar mode and two tensor polarizations (gravitational wave), are
coupled to each other already at the linearized level during the anisotropic
phase. This generates nonvanishing correlations between different modes of the
CMB anisotropies, which can be particularly relevant at large scales (and,
potentially, be related to the large scale anomalies in the WMAP data). As an
example, we compute the spectrum of the perturbations in this Bianchi I
geometry, assuming that the inflaton is in a slow roll regime also in the
anisotropic phase. For this simple set-up, fixing the initial conditions for
the perturbations appears more difficult than in the standard case, and
additional assumptions seem to be needed to provide predictions for the CMB
anisotropies.

structure, formed by a chain of bright knots of enhanced emission with
individual proper motions. Though it is generally accepted that internal shocks
play an important role in the formation and dynamics of such structures, their
precise origin and the mechanisms behind the observed proper motions is still a
matter of debate. Our goal is to study numerically the origin, dynamics, and
emission properties of such knots. Axisymmetric simulations are performed with
a shock-capturing code for gas dynamics, allowing for molecular, atomic, and
ionized hydrogen in non-equilibrium concentrations subject to
ionization/recombination processes. Radiative losses in SII lines are computed,
and the resulting synthetic emission maps are compared with observations. We
show that a pattern of regularly spaced internal oblique shocks, characterized
by individual proper motions, is generated by the pressure gradient between the
propagating jet and the time variable external cocoon. In the case of
under-expanded, light jets the resulting emission knots are found to move
downstream with the jet flow, with increasing velocity and decaying brightness
toward the leading bow shock. This suggests that the basic properties of the
knots observed in stellar jets can be reproduced even without invoking ad hoc
pulsating conditions at the jet inlet, though an interplay between the two
scenarios is certainly possible.

with colour--magnitude diagrams on opposite sides of the average warp mid-plane
being different. We witnessed the rise and fall of the blue plume population,
first attributed to young stars in a disrupting dwarf galaxy and now discarded
as a normal disc population. Similarly, there is nothing anomalous in the outer
thin+thick disc metallicities being low (-1<[Fe/H]<-0.5), and spiral arms (as

unambiguously that, contrary to previous claims, the warp produces a stellar
overdensity that is distance-compatible with that observed in CMa.The CMa
over-density remains fully accounted for in a first order approach by Galactic
models without new substructures. Given the intrinsic uncertainties (concerning
the properties of the warp, flare and disc cutoff, the role of extinction and
degeneracy), minor deviations with respect to these models are not enough to
support the hypothesis of an accreted dwarf galaxy or new substructure within

base for the analysis is composed of the overlap between a composite catalog of
selected, high-dispersion spectroscopic abundances for 1801 stars on the
metallicity scale of Valenti and Fischer (2005) and a merged catalog of
high-precision uvbyHbeta photometry for over 35,000 stars. While [Fe/H] for F
dwarfs is best estimated from m_1, with a modest dependence on c_1 as expected,
for hotter G dwarfs the pattern reverses and c_1 becomes the dominant index.
For cooler G dwarfs and K stars, the c_1 dominance continues, but a
discontinuity appears such that stars between (b-y) = 0.50 and 0.58 with [Fe/H]
>= +0.25 have m_1 and c_1 indices that classify them as subgiants, confirming
an earlier result based upon a much smaller sample. The reversal in the
sensitivity to m_1 and c_1 is traced, in part, to the metallicity sensitivity
of the (b-y) index. Moreover, (b-y) grows larger in a non-linear fashion for
stars above solar metallicity, leading to an overestimate of the reddening for
super-metal-rich stars from some standard intrinsic color relations. Based upon
successful tests using indices from synthetic spectra and the empirical trends
among the observations, metallicity calibrations tied to Hbeta rather than
(b-y) have been derived for [Fe/H] >= -1.0, generating dispersions among the
residuals ranging from 0.061 dex to 0.085 dex over the entire temperature range
of interest. The new calibrations have the added advantage of being
significantly less sensitive to errors in reddening than previous calibrations.

is weaker than in fracture, the experimental results are close to 0.5, while

differential equations (SDEs). Weak convergence is usually expressed in terms
of the convergence of expected values of test functions of the trajectories.
Here we present an alternative formulation of weak convergence in terms of the
well-known Prokhorov metric on spaces of random variables. For a general class
of methods, we establish bounds on the rates of convergence in terms of the
Prokhorov metric. In doing so, we revisit the original proofs of weak
convergence and show explicitly how the bounds on the error depend on the
smoothness of the test functions. As an application of our result, we use the
Strassen - Dudley theorem to show that the numerical approximation and the true
solution to the system of SDEs can be re-embedded in a probability space in
such a way that the method converges there in a strong sense. One corollary of
this last result is that the method converges in the Wasserstein distance,
another metric on spaces of random variables. Another corollary establishes
rates of convergence for expected values of test functions assuming only local
Lipschitz continuity. We conclude with a review of the existing results for
pathwise convergence of weakly converging methods and the corresponding strong
results available under re-embedding.

general family of variational, multisymplectic numerical methods for solving
Maxwell's equations that automatically preserve key symmetries and invariants.
  In doing so, we demonstrate several new results, which apply both to some
well-established numerical methods and to new methods introduced here. First,
we show that Yee's finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) scheme, along with a
number of related methods, are multisymplectic and derive from a discrete
Lagrangian variational principle. Second, we generalize the Yee scheme to
unstructured meshes, not just in space but in 4-dimensional spacetime. This
relaxes the need to take uniform time steps, or even to have a preferred time
coordinate at all. Finally, as an example of the type of methods that can be
developed within this general framework, we introduce a new asynchronous
variational integrator (AVI) for solving Maxwell's equations. These results are
illustrated with some prototype simulations that show excellent energy and
conservation behavior and lack of spurious modes, even for an irregular mesh
with asynchronous time stepping.

to the attractor which represents the FRW model with the cosmological constant.
We demonstrate that dynamical system admits invariant two-dimensional

on behavior of the system on the phase plane $(\psi, \psi')$. We formulate
simple conditions on the value of coupling constant $\xi$ for which
trajectories tend to the focus in the phase plane and hence damping
oscillations around the mysterious value $w=-1$. We describe this condition in
terms of slow-roll parameters calculated at the critical point. We discover
that the generic trajectories in the focus-attractor scenario come from the

the equation of state parameter $w(z)$ (directly determined from dynamics)

double-peaked velocity distribution in the z direction. We use the results of
modeling of the H99 streams by Helmi and collaborators to test how one might
use v_z velocity information and radial velocity information to detect
kinematic substructure in the halo. We find that detecting the H99 streams with
radial velocities alone would require a large sample. We use the velocity
distribution of the H99 streams to estimate their age. From our model of the
progenitor of the H99 streams, we determine that it was accreted between 6 and

substructure, but the prograde outliers are most likely part of the smooth

we set a lower limit the their collimation corrected energy Eg and find that a
68% of our sample are at high enough redshift and/or low enough fluence to
accommodate a jet break occurring beyond the last XRT observation and still be
consistent with the pre-Swift Eg distribution for long GRBs. We find that
relatively few of the X-ray light curves for the remaining events show evidence
for late-time decay slopes that are consistent with that expected from post jet
break emission. The breaks in the X-ray light curves that do exist tend to be
shallower and occur earlier than the breaks previously observed in optical
light curves, yielding a Eg distribution that is far lower than the pre-Swift
distribution. If these early X-ray breaks are not due to jet effects, then a
small but significant fraction of our sample have lower limits to their
collimation corrected energy that place them well above the pre-Swift Eg
distribution. Either scenario would necessitate a much wider post-Swift Eg
distribution for long cosmological GRBs compared to the narrow standard energy
deduced from pre-Swift observations. We note that almost all of the pre-Swift
Eg estimates come from jet breaks detected in the optical whereas our sample is
limited entirely to X-ray wavelengths, furthering the suggestion that the
assumed achromaticity of jet breaks may not extend to high energies.

such H2 system was known previously. The depletion patterns for Si, S, Ti, Cr,

show that the width (Doppler parameter) of the H2 lines increases with
increasing J and that the kinetic energy derived from the Doppler parameter is
linearly dependent on the relative energy of the rotational levels. The
excitation temperature is found to be 90 K for J = 0 to J = 2 and ~500 K for
higher J levels. Single isothermal PDR models fail to reproduce the observed
rotational excitations. A two-component model is needed: one component of low

rotational levels and another of high density (~500 cm-3) with strong
illumination (chi = 30) for J >= 3 levels. However, the juxtaposition of these
two PDR components may be ad-hoc and the multicomponent structure could result

the nature of surface brightness excesses at large radii observed in some

produce the antitruncation via two competing effects: (1) merger-driven gas
inflows that concentrate mass in the center of the primary galaxy and contract
its inner density profile; and (2) angular momentum transferred outwards by the
interaction, causing the outer disk to expand. In our experiments, this
requires both a significant supply of gas in the primary disk, and that the
encounter be prograde with moderate orbital angular momentum. The stellar
surface mass density profiles of our remnants both qualitatively and
quantitatively resemble the broken exponentials observed in local face--on
spirals that display antitruncations. Moreover, the observed trend towards more
frequent antitruncation relative to classical truncation in earlier Hubble
types is consistent with a merger-driven scenario.

pure quantum interference terms between the primary decay $(\Lambda N \to NN)$

class of entangled mixed states and then subjected to local dephasing noise.
Together with previous results, this proves the existence of ESD for some
states in all quantum systems for which rigorously defined mixed-state
entanglement measures have been identified. We conjecture that ESD exists in
all quantum systems prepared in appropriate bipartite states.

Dirichlet series, and was first studied by Euler in response to a letter from
Goldbach in 1742. By calculating many examples, Euler inferred a closed form
evaluation of the double zeta function in terms of values of the Riemann zeta
function, in the case when the two arguments are positive integers with
opposite parity. Here, we consider a signed analog of Euler's evaluation:
namely a reduction formula for the signed double zeta function that reduces to
Euler's evaluation when the signs are specialized to 1. This formula was first
stated in a 1997 paper by Borwein, Bradley and Broadhurst and was subsequently
proved by Flajolet and Salvy using contour integration. The purpose here is to
give an elementary proof based on a partial fraction identity.

neuron cultures includes `first to fire' cells that consistently fire earlier
than others. Here we analyze the behavior of these neurons in long term
recordings of spontaneous activity of rat hippocampal and rat cortical neuron
cultures from three different laboratories. We identify precursor events that
may either subside (`small events') or can lead to a full-blown burst
(`pre-bursts'). We find that the activation in the pre-burst typically has a
first neuron (`leader'), followed by a localized response in its neighborhood.
Locality is diminished in the bursts themselves. The long term dynamics of the
leaders is relatively robust, evolving with a half-life of 23-34 hours.
Stimulation of the culture can temporarily alter the leader distribution, but
it returns to the previous distribution within about 1 hour. We show that the
leaders carry information about the identity of the burst, as measured by the
signature of the number of spikes per neuron in a burst. The number of spikes
from leaders in the first few spikes of a precursor event is furthermore shown
to be predictive with regard to the transition into a burst (pre-burst versus
small event). We conclude that the leaders play a r\^ole in the development of
the bursts, and conjecture that they are part of an underlying sub-network that
is excited first and then act as nucleation centers for the burst.

are characterized by means of the average size of spatial domains of equivalent
spin variables that define the phases. It is found that the rate at which phase
domains grow becomes smaller when impurities are present and that the average
size of the resulting domains in the inhomogeneous state of the system
decreases when the density of impurities is increased. The phase diagram
showing regions where homogeneous, heterogeneous, and chessboard patterns occur

separates the regime of slow growth of domains from the regime of fast growth
in the heterogeneous region of the phase diagram is calculated. The transition
between these two growth regimes is explained in terms of the stability
properties of the local phase configurations. Our results show that the
inclusion of spatial inhomogeneities can be used as a control mechanism for the

emission from a radio compact jet as well as a strong non-thermal hard X-ray

synchrotron spectrum of the compact jet, which is consistent with being flat
over four orders of magnitude in frequency. Moreover, using this unprecedented
coverage, and especially thanks to the new Spitzer observations, we can test
broadband disk and jet models during the hard state. Two of the hard state
broadband spectra are reasonably well fitted using a jet model with parameters
overall similar to those previously found for Cyg X-1 and GX 339-4. Differences
are also present; most notably, the jet power in GRO J1655-40 appears to be a

described by the normal form for a system near a Hopf bifurcation. Here we
demonstrate that experimental results from three-frequency suppression

clusters of various ages, indicating that angular momentum is somehow removed
from these rotating masses. The mechanism by which spin-up is regulated as
young stars contract has been one of the longest-standing problems in star
formation. Attempts to observationally confirm the prevailing theory that
magnetic interaction between the star and its circumstellar disk regulates
these rotation periods have produced mixed results. In this paper, we use the
unprecedented disk identification capability of the Spitzer Space Telescope to
test the star-disk interaction paradigm in two young clusters, NGC 2264 and the
Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We show that once mass effects and sensitivity
biases are removed, a clear increase in the disk fraction with period can be
observed in both clusters across the entire period range populated by cluster
members. We also show that the long-period peak (P $\sim$8 days) of the bimodal
distribution observed for high-mass stars in the ONC is dominated by a
population of stars possessing a disk, while the short-period peak (P $\sim$2
days) is dominated by a population of stars without a disk. Our results
represent the strongest evidence to date that star-disk interaction regulates
the angular momentum of these young stars. This study will make possible
quantitative comparisons between the observed period distributions of stars
with and without a disk and numerical models of the angular momentum evolution

brane with n dimensions compactified on the brane, in a (5+n)-dimensional bulk.
By assuming that the size of the internal space is static, that the bulk
energy-momentum tensor can be neglected, we determine the effect of the bulk
geometry on the Kaluza-Klein braneworld. Then we derive the effective Friedmann
equation on the brane. It turns out that the Friedmann equation explicitly
depends on the equation of state, in contrast to the braneworld in a
5-dimensional bulk spacetime. In particular, in a radiation-dominated era, the
effective Newton constant depends on the scale factor logarithmically. If we
include a pressureless matter on the brane, this dependence disappears after
the radiation-matter equality. This may be interpreted as stabilization of the
Newton constant by the matter on the brane. Our findings imply that the
Kaluza-Klein braneworld cosmology is quite different from the conventional
Kaluza-Klein cosmology even at low energy.

find that, compared to forming in the field environment, the inner Oort Cloud

the next 4.4 Gyrs. In addition, the outer Oort Cloud trapping efficiencies we
observe in our simulations are lower than previous formation models by about a
factor of 2, possibly implying an even more massive early planetesimal disk.
Furthermore, some of our simulations reproduce the orbits of observed extended

interior of VO_{2} thin films that exhibit a strong first-order metal-insulator
transition (MIT). Using the crystal structural change that accompanies a VO_{2}
MIT, we used bulk-sensitive X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements to estimate
the fraction of metallic volume p^{XRD} in our VO_{2} film. The temperature
dependence of the p$^{XRD}$ was very closely correlated with the dc
conductivity near the MIT temperature, and fit the percolation theory
predictions quite well: $\sigma$ $\sim$ (p - p_{c})^{t} with t = 2.0$\pm$0.1
and p_{c} = 0.16$\pm$0.01. This agreement demonstrates that in our VO$_{2}$
thin film, the MIT should occur during the percolation process. We also used
surface-sensitive scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) to investigate the
microscopic evolution of the MIT near the surface. Similar to the XRD results,
STS maps revealed a systematic decrease in the metallic phase as temperature
decreased. However, this rate of change was much slower than the rate observed
with XRD, indicating that the electronic inhomogeneity near the surface differs
greatly from that inside the film. We investigated several possible origins of
this discrepancy, and postulated that the variety in the strain states near the
surface plays an important role in the broad MIT observed using STS. We also
explored the possible involvement of such strain effects in other correlated
electron oxide systems with strong electron-lattice interactions.

eliminated by making use of an alternative flat metric without weak field
approximation. PR satisfies Einstein's field equations. Theory allows every two
body system to deviate differently from the flat Minkowski metric. PR differs
from general relativity (GR) in predictions of the proper time intervals of
distant objects. PR proposes a definite connection between the proper time
interval of an object and Doppler frequency shift of its constituent particles
as the object makes a relative motion with respect to the rest frame of the
coordinate time. This is because fundamentally time is periodic in nature.
Coordinate and proper time in GR are linear time. Periodic time of PR is the
key parameter in development of quantum gravity theory in which the universe
begins with a quantum fluctuation in the fundamental substance of the universe
which is infinite, motionless and indivisible. PR is based on the dynamic weak
equivalence principle which equates the gravitational mass with the
relativistic mass. PR provides accurate solutions for the rotation curves of
galaxies and the energy levels of the Hydrogen spectra including Lamb shift
using common formalism. Flat space time with Lorentz invariant acceleration
presented here makes it possible to unite PR with quantum mechanics. PR
satisfies Einstein's field equations with respect to the three major GR tests
within the solar system and with respect to the derivation of Friedmann
equation in cosmology. PR predicts limiting radius of the event horizon of M87
black hole to be 3R_g and the range of prograde and retrograde spin a_* between
\pm0.385 and \pm0.73. Theory shows that the electromagnetic wave is held
together by gravitational forces. Theory predicts powerful gravitational
radiation at Planck epoch. Proper time of photon is discussed.

refractive optics system as light collector and the use of single photoelectron
counting as detector working mode. The optics system allows to achieve a large

fair bandwidth allocation of network capacities, in terms of the
Fenchel--Legendre transform of the network capacity region. We use this
characterization to prove stability (i.e., ergodicity) of network dynamics
under proportionally fair sharing, by exhibiting a suitable Lyapunov function.
Our stability result extends previously known results to a more general model
including Markovian users routing. In particular, it implies that the stability
condition previously known under exponential service time distributions remains
valid under so-called phase-type service time distributions. We then exhibit a
modification of proportional fairness, which coincides with it in some
asymptotic sense, is reversible (and thus insensitive), and has explicit
stationary distribution. Finally we show that the stationary distributions
under modified proportional fairness and balanced fairness, a sharing criterion
proposed because of its insensitivity properties, admit the same large
deviations characteristics. These results show that proportional fairness is an
attractive bandwidth allocation criterion, combining the desirable properties
of ease of implementation with performance and insensitivity.

the absence of geographical separation, originally proposed by U. Dieckmann and

type model and study its stationary distribution. We show that speciation may
occur, that is, the stationary distribution puts most of the mass on a
configuration that does not concentrate on the phenotype with maximum carrying
capacity, if competition between phenotypes is intense enough. Conversely, if
competition between phenotypes is not intense, then speciation will not occur
and most of the population will have the phenotype with the highest carrying
capacity. The length of time it takes speciation to occur also has a delicate
dependence on the mutation parameter, and the exact shape of the carrying
capacity function and the competition kernel.

simultaneous measurement of an effective stiffness and the conductance using
our newly developed mechanically controllable break junction (MCBJ) technique
with a tuning fork as a force sensor. When stretching a monatomic contact
(two-atom chain), the stiffness and conductance increases at the early stage of
stretching and then decreases just before breaking, which is attributed to a
transition of the chain configuration and bond weakening. A statistical
analysis was made to investigate the mechanical properties of monatomic chains.
The average stiffness shows minima at the peak positions of the
length-histogram. From this result we conclude that the peaks in the
length-histogram are a measure of the number of atoms in the chains, and that
the chains break from a strained state. Additionally, we find that the smaller
the initial stiffness of the chain is, the longer the chain becomes. This shows
that softer chains can be stretched longer.

at production has definite helicity (i.e., $\nu_L$ and $(\nu_L)^c$ neutrinos
are separately produced and then neutrino is not in the superposition state).
This helicity cannot change after production without any external interactions.
Thus we see that for unsuitable helicity the neutrinoless double $\beta$ decay
is not possible even if neutrino is a Majorana particle. Also transition of
Majorana neutrino into antineutrino at their oscillations is forbidden since
helicity in vacuum holds. Then only possibility to prove that neutrino is a
Dirac but not Majorana particle is detection transition of $\nu_L$ neutrino

``ultra-compact dwarf'' (UCD) galaxies are significantly smaller than those of
other galaxy populations in the Fornax and the Virgo clusters of galaxies. In
order to understand the origin of the observed lower velocity dispersions of
UCDs, we numerically investigate line-of-sight velocity dispersion (sigma_los)
of galaxy populations with variously different orbits in clusters of galaxies
with the total masses of M_cl. We particularly investigate radial velocity
dispersion profiles (sigma_los(R)) and velocity dispersions within the central
200 kpc of a cluster model (sigma_m) for galaxies with different pericenter
distances (r_p) and orbital eccentricities (e) in the model with M_cl = 7.0 x
10^13 M_sun reasonable for the Fornax cluster. We find that sigma_los(R) and
sigma_m of galaxies with smaller r_p are steeper and smaller, respectively, for
a given initial e distribution of galaxies. For example, we find that sigma_m
is ~ 260 km/s for galaxies with r_p <50 kpc and ~ 336 km/s for all galaxies in
the model with the mean e of 0.6. These results imply that the observed lower
velocity dispersion of UCD population is consistent with the UCDs having
significantly smaller r_p than other galaxy populations in the Fornax. We
discuss these results in the context of the ``galaxy threshing'' scenario in
which UCDs originate from nuclei of nucleated dwarf galaxies. We suggest that
the observed differences in kinematical properties between UCDs and other dwarf
galaxy populations in clusters of galaxies can be understood in terms of the
differences in orbital properties between UCDs and the dwarf populations.

runaway in white dwarfs (WDs) that approach the Chandrasekhar limit, either
through accretion from a companion or a merger with another WD. I compile
observational estimates of the fraction eta of intermediate-mass stars that
eventually explode as SNe-Ia, supplement them with several new estimates, and
compare them self-consistently. The estimates are based on five different
methods, each utilising some observable related to the SN-Ia rate, combined
with assumptions regarding the IMF: the ratio of SN-Ia to core-collapse rates
in star-forming galaxies; the SN-Ia rate per unit star-formation rate; the
SN-Ia rate per unit stellar mass; the iron to stellar mass ratio in galaxy
clusters; and the abundance ratios in galaxy clusters. The five methods
indicate that a fraction in the range eta~2-40% of all stars with initial
masses of 3-8 M_sun (the generally assumed SN-Ia progenitors) explode as
SNe-Ia. A fraction of eta~15% is consistent with all five methods for a range
of plausible IMFs. Considering also the binarity fraction among such stars, the
mass ratio distribution, the separation distribution, and duplicity (every
binary can produce only one SN-Ia explosion), this implies that nearly every
intermediate mass close binary ends up as a SN-Ia, or possibly more SNe-Ia than
progenitor systems. Theoretically expected fractions are generally one to two
orders of magnitude lower. The problem could be solved: if all the
observational estimates are in error; or with a ``middle-heavy'' IMF; or by
some mechanism that strongly enhances the efficiency of binary evolution toward
SN-Ia explosion; or by a non-binary origin for SNe-Ia.

isophotal maps, colour maps, surface brightness profiles along the bar major

We discuss how projection effects can influence these measurements and the
uncertainties introduced by deprojecting galaxy images. We show that analytical
expressions can be used to obtain reliable estimates of deprojected bar
lengths, ellipticities and position angles directly from the observed images.
These expressions are based on the assumption that the outer parts of the bar
are vertically thin, as shown by theoretical work. The usefulness of our data
in addressing issues on bar formation and evolution is also discussed. In
particular, we present results showing a steep drop in the ellipticity profile,
as expected for bar formation processes in which the dark matter halo plays a
fundamental role. Furthermore, we show that the location of this drop is a good

properly in the negative energy domain of nuclear matter. The EoS of SNM, thus
obtained, is not only free from the superluminosity problem but also provides
excellent estimate of nuclear incompressibility. The EoS of asymmetric nuclear

which electron acceleration via stochastic Fermi acceleration (STFA) becomes
comparable to further cascade of the turbulence defines the inner scale. For
any magnetic turbulent spectra equal to or shallower than Goldreich-Sridhar
this turns out to be $\ge 10^{12}$cm, which is much larger than the shortest
length scales observed in radio scintillation measurements. While STFA for such
spectra then contradict models of scintillation which appeal directly to an
extended, continuous turbulent cascade, such a separation of scales is
consistent with the recent work of \citet{Boldyrev2} and \citet{Boldyrev3}
suggesting that interstellar scintillation may result from the passage of radio
waves through the galactic distribution of thin ionized boundary surfaces of
HII regions, rather than density variations from cascading turbulence. The
presence of STFA dissipation also provides a mechanism for the non-ionizing
heat source observed in the Reynolds Layer of the interstellar medium

massive known in an apparently non-interacting giant galaxy. It contains a
number of smaller clusters and is bordered by a sharp C-shaped rim. We found
that the complex is additionally unusual in having peculiar gas kinematics. The
velocity field of the ionized gas reveals a deep oval minimum, ~300 pc in size,
centered 7"" east of the supercluster. The Vr of the ionized gas in the dip
center is 100 km/s lower than in its surroundings, and emission lines within
the dip appear to be shock excited. This dip is near the center of an HI hole
and a semi-ring of HII regions. The HI (and less certainly, HII) velocity
fields reveal expansion, with the velocity reaching ~30 km/s at a distance
about 300 pc from the center of expansion, which is near the deep minimum
position. The super star cluster is at the western rim of the minimum. The
sharp western rim of the whole complex is plausibly a manifestation of a

current does not flow. This electronic trapping is removed either by finite
spin relaxation or when the Zeeman splitting is different in each quantum dot.

get information on the spin relaxation time. In the last case, we will show
that applying a resonant bichromatic magnetic field, the electrons become
trapped in a coherent superposition of states and electronic transport is
blocked. Then, manipulating AC magnetic fields, electrons are driven to perform
coherent spin rotations which can be unambiguously detected by direct

behavior. To explore how accurate is the scaling and therefore understand the
underlined non-linear mechanism, we investigate intraday datasets of 500 stocks
which consist of the Standard & Poor's 500 index. We show that the cumulative
distribution of return intervals has systematic deviations from scaling. We
support this finding by studying the m-th moment $\mu_m \equiv
<(\tau/<\tau>)^m>^{1/m}$, which show a certain trend with the mean interval
$<\tau>$. We generate surrogate records using the Schreiber method, and find
that their cumulative distributions almost collapse to a single curve and
moments are almost constant for most range of $<\tau>$. Those substantial
differences suggest that non-linear correlations in the original volatility
sequence account for the deviations from a single scaling law. We also find
that the original and surrogate records exhibit slight tendencies for short and
long $<\tau>$, due to the discreteness and finite size effects of the records
respectively. To avoid as possible those effects for testing the multiscaling
behavior, we investigate the moments in the range $10<<\tau>\leq100$, and find
the exponent $\alpha$ from the power law fitting $\mu_m\sim<\tau>^\alpha$ has a
narrow distribution around $\alpha\neq0$ which depend on m for the 500 stocks.
The distribution of $\alpha$ for the surrogate records are very narrow and
centered around $\alpha=0$. This suggests that the return interval distribution
exhibit multiscaling behavior due to the non-linear correlations in the
original volatility.

kinematical self-similarity (KSS). We compare both tactics since they are quite
similar (symmetry principles). We arrive to the conclusion that the LM is too
restrictive and brings us to get only the flat FRW solution. The SS, MC and KSS
approaches bring us to obtain all the quantities depending on \int c(t)dt.
Therefore, in order to study their behavior we impose some physical
restrictions like for example the condition q<0 (accelerating universe). In
this way we find that $c$ is a growing time function and Lambda is a decreasing
time function whose sing depends on the equation of state, w, while the
exponents of the scale factor must satisfy the conditions

of state $\omega$ and $\epsilon,$ a parameter that controls the behavior of
$c(t),$ therefore $G$ may be growing or decreasing.We also show that through
the Lie method, there is no difference between to study the field equations
under the assumption of a $c-$var affecting to the curvature tensor which the
other one where it is not considered such effects.Nevertheless, it is essential
to consider such effects in the cases studied under the SS, MC, and KSS

iterative approach, the adaptive group finder then uses the average
mass-to-light ratios of groups, obtained from the previous iteration, to assign
a tentative mass to each group. This mass is then used to estimate the size and
velocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turn
is used to determine group membership in redshift space. Finally, each
individual group is assigned two different halo masses: one based on its
characteristic luminosity, and the other based on its characteristic stellar
mass. Applying the group finder to the SDSS DR4, we obtain 301237 groups in a

velocities. Stars at a given effective temperature have a spread in their
geometrically estimated projected radii that is larger than can be accounted
for with a coeval model, observational uncertainties and randomly oriented
rotation axes. It is shown that the required dispersion in radius (a factor of
2-3 full width half maximum) can be modelled in terms of a spread in stellar
ages larger than the median age of the cluster, although the detailed star
formation history cannot be uniquely determined using present data. This
technique is relatively free from systematic uncertainties (binarity,
extinction, variability, distance) that have hampered previous studies of the
ONC star formation history using the conventional Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.
However, the current ONC rotational data are biased against low luminosity
objects, so the deduced dispersions in radius and inferred age are probably
underestimates. In particular, the ages of a tail of PMS stars that appear to
be >=10Myr old in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram cannot be verified with
present data. If projected equatorial velocities were measured for these
objects it could easily be checked whether their radii are correspondingly
smaller than the bulk of the ONC population.

been developed which allow in an all-electric manner to determine the plane of
polarization of linearly polarized radiation and the Stokes parameters of
elliptically polarized radiation, respectively. The operation of the detectors
is based on photogalvanic effects in semiconductor quantum well structures of
low symmetry. The photogalvanic effects have nanoseconds time constants at room
temperature making a high time resolution of the polarization detectors
possible.
