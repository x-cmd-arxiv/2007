outside a dilaton black hole with magnetic charge Q. The electromagnetic
angular momentum which is stored in the electromagnetic field outside the black
hole shows several common features regardless of the dilaton coupling strength,
though the dilaton black holes are drastically different in their spacetime
structure depending on it. First, the electromagnetic angular momentum depends
on the separation distance between the two objects and changes monotonically
from eQ to 0 as the charge goes down from infinity to the horizon, if
rotational effects of the black hole are discarded. Next, as the black hole
approaches extremality, however, the electromagnetic angular momentum tends to
be independent of the distance between the two objects. It is then precisely
$eQ$ as in the electric charge and monopole system in flat spacetime. We
discuss why these effects are exhibited and argue that the above features are
to hold in widely generic settings including black hole solutions in theories
with more complicated field contents, by addressing the no hair theorem for
black holes and the phenomenon of field expulsion exhibited by extremal black
holes.

Four-dimensional, supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacua with all moduli
stabilized appear when appropriate Ramond and Neveu--Schwarz fluxes are
introduced in IIA. Geometric fluxes are not necessary. Then the whole setup is
analyzed from the perspective of the sources, namely D/NS-branes or
Kaluza--Klein monopoles. Orientifold planes are also required for tadpole
cancellation. The solutions found in four dimensions correspond to domain walls
interpolating between AdS4 and flat spacetime. The various consistency

conditions) are always satisfied, albeit with source terms. We also speculate
on the possibility of assigning (formal) entropies to AdS4 flux vacua via the

applications, the idea is used to analyze the Compton effect and the
electron-positron annihilation. It is found that the calculation becomes
simple, and the physical meaning gets clear. The simplicity comes from the
power of the three postulates. To illustrate this, the basic conclusions of the
special theory of relativity such as the relations of mass-velocity,
mass-energy, energy-momentum, time dilation and length contraction are further
deduced. In addition, the significance of the investigation of vacuum

typical scattered disk orbits (scattered TNOs) by performing simulations using
several thousand particles lying initially on Neptune-encountering orbits. We
explore the role of resonance sticking in the scattered disk, a phenomenon
characterized by multiple temporary resonance captures ('resonances' refers to
external mean motion resonances with Neptune, which can be described in the
form r:s, where the arguments r and s are integers). First, all scattered TNOs
evolve through intermittent temporary resonance capture events and
gravitational scattering by Neptune. Each scattered TNO experiences tens to
hundreds of resonance captures over a period of 4 Gyr, which represents about
38% of the object's lifetime (mean value). Second, resonance sticking plays an
important role at semimajor axes a < 250 AU, where the great majority of such
captures occurred. It is noteworthy that the stickiest (i.e., dominant)
resonances in the scattered disk are located within this distance range and are
those possessing the lowest argument s. This was evinced by r:1, r:2 and r:3
resonances, which played the greatest role during resonance sticking evolution,
often leading to captures in several of their neighboring resonances. Finally,
the timescales and likelihood of temporary resonance captures are roughly
proportional to resonance strength. The dominance of low s resonances is also
related to the latter. In sum, resonance sticking has an important impact on
the evolution of scattered TNOs, contributing significantly to the longevity of
these objects.

metrics and we thus obtain global information about the metric. We illustrate
these general considerations by focusing on six-dimensional Ricci flat metrics
and obtain Ricci flat metrics associated with real cones over L^{pqr} and
Y^{pq} manifolds. The metrics associated with cones over Y^{pq} manifolds turn
out to be partially resolved with two blowup parameters taking special
(non-zero)values. For a fixed Y^{pq} manifold, we find explicit metrics for
several inequivalent blow-ups parametrised by a natural number k in the range

it must also satisfy the known entropic inequalities. Now the questions arises
whether on the assumption that stronger criteria based on positive but not
completely positive maps are satisfied, it is possible to derive some scalar
inequalities stronger than the entropic ones. In this paper we show that under
some assumptions the extended reduction criterion [H.-P. Breuer, Phys. Rev.
Lett 97, 080501 (2006); W. Hall, J. Phys. A 40, 6183 (2007)] leads to some
entropic--like inequalities which are much stronger than their entropic
counterparts. The comparison of the derived inequalities with other
separability criteria shows that such approach might lead to strong scalar
criteria detecting both distillable and bound entanglement. In particular, in
the case of SO(3)-invariant states it is shown that the present inequalities
detect entanglement in regions in which entanglement witnesses based on
extended reduction map fail. It should be also emphasized that in the case of
$2\otimes N$ states the derived inequalities detect entanglement efficiently,
while the extended reduction maps are useless when acting on the qubit
subsystem. Moreover, there is a natural way to construct a many-copy
entanglement witnesses based on the derived inequalities so, in principle,
there is a possibility of experimental realization. Some open problems and
possibilities for further studies are outlined.

isotropic orbits through an ICM typical of rich clusters. An introduction of
the galaxies immediately produces gravitational wakes, providing perturbations
that can potentially grow via resonant interaction with the background gas.
When Ng^{1/2}Mg_11 < 100, where Mg_11 is each galaxy mass in units of 10^{11}
Msun, the perturbations are in the linear regime and the resonant excitation of
gravity waves is efficient to generate kinetic energy in the ICM, resulting in
the velocity dispersion sigma_v ~ 2.2 Ng^{1/2}Mg_11 km/s. When Ng^{1/2}Mg_11 >
100, on the other hand, nonlinear fluctuations of the background ICM destroy
galaxy wakes and thus render resonant excitation weak or absent. In this case,
the kinetic energy saturates at the level corresponding to sigma_v ~ 220 km/s.
The angle-averaged velocity power spectra of turbulence driven in our models
have slopes in the range of -3.7 to -4.3. With the nonlinear saturation of
resonant excitation, none of the cooling models considered are able to halt
cooling catastrophe, suggesting that the galaxy motions alone are unlikely to
solve the cooling flow problem.

it has been shown that the size of the rich-club controlling half of the

international trade, etc, here for the first time we studied a non-conservative

around a stalled prompt shock. To quantitatively assess the importance of this
process for the revival of the stalled shock, we perform 1D time-dependent
hydrodynamical simulations, taking into account the heating via the dissipation
of Alfven waves that propagate radially outwards along open flux tubes. We show
that the shock revival occurs if the surface field strength is larger than
~2e15 G and if the amplitude of velocity fluctuation at the PNS surface is
larger than 20% of the local sound speed. Interestingly, the Alfven wave
mechanism is self-regulating in the sense that the explosion energy is not very
sensitive to the surface field strength and initial amplitude of Alfven waves
as long as they are larger than the threshold values given above.

the centers of the most massive halos, whereas late spiral galaxies tend to
occupy their outskirts or the centers of less massive halos. This analysis also

of highly non-linear effects such as tidal stripping of halos near larger mass
concentrations. Therefore, we use a simplified dynamical scheme where these

approximation, which prevents orbit mixing by coalescing particles coming
within a critical distance of each other. A numerical implementation of this
approximation is fast, allowing us to run a large number of simulations to
study assembly bias. We measure an assembly bias from 60 PZ simulations, each
with 512^3 cold particles in a 128h^-1 Mpc cubic box. The assembly bias
estimated from the correlation functions at separations < 5h^-1 Mpc for objects
(halos) at z=0 is comparable to that obtained in full N-body simulations. For
masses 4x10^11 h^-1 Mo the ""oldest"" 10% haloes are 3-5 times more correlated
than the ""youngest"" 10%. The bias weakens with increasing mass, also in
agreement with full N-body simulations. We find that that halo ages are
correlated with the dimensionality of the surrounding linear structures as
measured by the parameter (\lambda_1+\lambda_2+\lambda_3)/
(\lambda_1^2+\lambda_2^2+\lambda_3^2)^{1/2} where \lambda_i are proportional to
the eigenvalues of the velocity deformation tensor. Our results suggest that

fractional abundance to remain more or less constant in the envelope out to a
radius of about 4E16 cm, where the HCN molecules are effectively destroyed,
most probably, by photodissociation. The large amount of HCN present in the
inner wind provides effective line cooling that can dominate over that
generated from CO line emission. It is also shown that great care needs to be
taken in the radiative transfer modelling where non-local, and non-LTE, effects
are important and where the radiation field from thermal dust grains plays a
major role in exciting the HCN molecules. The amount of HCN present in the
circumstellar envelope around IRC+10216 is consistent with predicted
photospheric values based on equilibrium chemical models and indicates that any
non-equilibrium chemistry occurring in the extended pulsating atmosphere has no
drastic net effect on the fractional abundance of HCN molecules that enters the
outer envelope. It further suggests that few HCN molecules are incorporated
into dust grains.

The interaction of primary particles with atmospheric nuclei produces a huge
Extensive Air Shower together with isotropic emission of UV fluorescence light
and highly directional Cherenkov photons, that are reflected/diffused
isotropically by the impact on the Earth's surface or on high optical depth
clouds. For space-based observations, detecting the reflected Cherenkov signal
in a delayed coincidence with the fluorescence light improves the accuracy of
the shower reconstruction in space and in particular the measurement of the
shower maximum, giving a strong signature for discriminating hadrons and
neutrinos, and helping to estimate the primary chemical composition. Since the
Earth's surface is mostly covered by water, the ULTRA (UV Light Transmission
and Reflection in the Atmosphere)experiment has been designed to provide the
diffusing properties of sea water, overcoming the lack of information in this
specific field. A small EAS array, made up of 5 particle detectors, and an UV
optical device, have been coupled to detect in coincidence both electromagnetic
and UV components. The detector was in operation from May to December, 2005, in
a small private harbor in Capo Granitola (Italy); the results of these

quantum Hall effect are related to semiconductor heterostructures (and more
recently with graphene). The common characteristic of all these systems is the
presence of a reservoir of electrons, which, in fact, in the initial stage is
the source of the electrons, providing the two-dimensional electron gas (2DES).
Then, any physical realization of a 2DES is necessarily embedded in a 3D
structure, which establishes the Fermi level. Hence, the 2DES appears to be an
open system. In this paper we present an analytical approach to the integer
quantum Hall effect (IQHE) and the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) phenomena in the
2DES, basing us in fundamental principles and showing the secondary role of the
localized electron states in both phenomena. In fact, we show that the IQHE is
a consequence of the fluctuations of electrons in the 2DES. Once we obtain the
density of states of the 2DES under the application of a magnetic field we
calculate both magnetoconductivities (diagonal and Hall) deducing them from the
Boltzman semiclassical equation. The model proposed reproduces both phenomena,
the width of the Hall plateaus (with the precision reached in the experimental
measurements, of the order of 10-8-10-9) and the corresponding minima of the
diagonal magnetoresistivity, and also the dependence with temperature of the
IQHE and SdH.

forced circle homeomorphisms with rather complicated minimal sets. For example,
we show that, in some of the examples we construct, the unique minimal set is a
Cantor set and its intersection with each vertical fibre is uncountable and
nowhere dense (but may contain isolated points). We also prove that minimal
sets of the later kind cannot occur when the dynamics are given by the
projective action of a quasiperiodic SL(2,R)-cocycle. More precisely, we show
that, for a quasiperiodic SL(2,R)-cocycle, any minimal strict subset of the

two points on generic fibres.

in a well-observed nearby disc galaxy, the Andromeda galaxy. From photometrical
and chemical evolution models constructed in the first part of the study (Tamm,
Tempel & Tenjes 2007 (arXiv:0707.4375), hereafter Paper I) we can calculate the
mass distribution of visible components (the bulge, the disc, the stellar halo,
the outer diffuse stellar halo). In the dynamical model we calculate stellar
rotation velocities along the major axis and velocity dispersions along the
major, minor and intermediate axes of the galaxy assuming triaxial velocity
dispersion ellipsoid. Comparing the calculated values with the collected
observational data, we find the amount of DM, which must be added to reach an
agreement with the observed rotation and dispersion data.
  We conclude that within the uncertainties, the DM distributions by Moore,
Burkert, Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) and the Einasto fit with observations
nearly at all distances. The NFW and Einasto density distributions give the
best fit with observations.
  The total mass of M 31 with the NFW DM distribution is 1.19*10^12 M_sun, the
ratio of the DM mass to the visible mass is 10.0. For the Einasto DM
distribution, these values are 1.28*10^12 M_sun and 10.8. The ratio of the DM
mass to the visible mass inside the Holmberg radius is 1.75 for the NFW and the
Einasto distributions. For different cuspy DM distributions, the virial mass is
in a range 6.9-7.9*10^11 M_sun and the virial radius is ~150 kpc. The DM mean
densities inside 10 pc for cusped models are 33 and 16 M_sun pc^-3 for the NFW

four axially symmetric stellar components: a bulge, a disc, an inner halo and
an extended diffuse halo. By using far-infrared imaging data of M31 and a thin
dust disc assumption, we derive dust-free surface brightness and colour
distributions. We find the total absorption corrected luminosity of M31 to be
L_B = (3.3+/-0.7)x10^10 L_sun, corresponding to an absolute luminosity M_B =
-20.8+/-0.2 mag. Of the total luminosity, 41% (0.57 mag) is obscured from us by
the dust inside M31. Using chemical evolution models, we calculate

the charge-carrier density. The difference in the Casimir force in the presence

microscope as a function of separation at different powers of the absorbed

separation of 100 nm varies from 10 to 20% in different measurements. The
experimental results are compared with theoretical computations using the
Lifshitz theory at both zero and laboratory temperatures. The total theoretical
error determined mostly by the uncertainty in the concentration of charge

less than 140 nm. The experimental data are consistent with the Lifshitz theory
at laboratory temperature, if the static dielectric permittivity of
high-resistivity Si in the absence of light is assumed to be finite. If the dc
conductivity of high-resistivity Si in the absence of light is included into
the model of dielectric response, the Lifshitz theory at nonzero temperature is
shown to be experimentally inconsistent at 95% confidence. The demonstrated
phenomenon of the modification of the Casimir force through a change of the

into the flux function is necessary. Second, to achieve second-order accuracy
of a well-balanced scheme, the Chapman-Enskog expansion of the Boltzmann

artificial heating in an isolated system under a gravitational field, the
source term treatment inside each cell has to be evaluated consistently with
the flux evaluation at the cell interface. Fourth, the multidimensional
approach with the inclusion of tangential gradients in two-dimensional and
three-dimensional cases becomes important in order to maintain the accuracy of
the scheme. Many numerical examples are used to validate the above issues,
which include the comparison between the solutions from the current scheme and
the Strang splitting method. The methodology developed in this paper can also
be applied to other systems, such as semi-conductor device simulations under

fermions with positive weights. In the example of the Hubbard model close to
half filling it fails to reproduce all the symmetries of the ground state
leading to systematic errors at low temperatures. In a previous work [Phys.
Rev. B {\bf 72}, 224518 (2005)] we proposed to restore the broken symmetries by
projecting the density matrix obtained from the simulation onto the ground
state symmetry sector. For ground state properties, the accuracy of this method
depends on a {\it large overlap} between the GQMC and exact density matrices.
Thus, the method is not rigorously exact. We present the limits of the approach
by a systematic study of the method for 2 and 3 leg Hubbard ladders for
different fillings and on-site repulsion strengths. We show several indications
that the systematic errors stem from non-vanishing boundary terms in the
partial integration step in the derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation.
Checking for spiking trajectories and slow decaying probability distributions
provides an important test of the reliability of the results. Possible
solutions to avoid boundary terms are discussed. Furthermore we compare results
obtained from two different sampling methods: Reconfiguration of walkers and
the Metropolis algorithm.

separated by a thin, insulating barrier in the presence of misaligned in-plane
exchange fields. We find an interesting interplay between the superconducting
phase difference and the relative orientation of the exchange fields,
manifested in the Josephson current across the junction. Specifically, this may
be written $I_\text{J}^\text{C} = (I_0+I_m ~ \cos\phi) \sin\Delta\theta$, where
I_0 and I_m are constants, and $\phi$ is the relative orientation of the
exchange fields while $\Delta\theta$ is the superconducting phase difference.
Similar results have recently been obtained in other S/I/S junctions coexisting
with helimagnetic or ferromagnetic order. We calculate the superconducting
order parameter self-consistently, and investigate quantitatively the effect
which the misaligned exchange fields constitute on the Josephson current, to
see if I_m may have an appreciable effect on the Josephson current. It is found
that I_0 and I_m become comparable in magnitude at sufficiently low
temperatures and fields close to the critical value, in agreement with previous
work. From our analytical results, it then follows that the Josephson current
in the present system may be controlled in a well-defined manner by a rotation
of the exchange fields on both sides of the junction. We discuss a possible
experimental realization of this proposition.

life systems such as acquaintance networks where people are more likely to
maintain a social connection if their views and values are similar. In our
study, we consider different variants of a model for consensus formation. Our
investigations reveal that the adaptation of the network topology fosters
cluster formation by enhancing communication between agents of similar opinion,
though it also promotes the division of these clusters. The temporal behavior
is also strongly affected by adaptivity: while, on static networks, it is
influenced by percolation properties, on adaptive networks, both the early and
late time evolution of the system are determined by the rewiring process. The
investigation of a variant of the model reveals that the scenarios of
transitions between consensus and polarized states are more robust on adaptive
networks.

of the cores in terms of rotation, turbulence, and fragmentation. Eight of the
nine objects have compact N2H+ cores with FWHM radii of 1200 -- 3500 AU,
spatially coinciding with the thermal dust continuum emission. The only more
evolved (Class I) object in the sample (CB 188) shows only faint and extended
N2H+ emission. The mean N2H+ line width was found to be 0.37 km/s. Estimated
virial masses range from 0.3 to 1.2 M_sun. We find that thermal and turbulent
energy support are about equally important in these cores, while rotational
support is negligible. The measured velocity gradients across the cores range
from 6 to 24 km/s/pc. Assuming these gradients are produced by bulk rotation,
we find that the specific angular momenta of the observed Class 0 protostellar
cores are intermediate between those of dense (prestellar) molecular cloud
cores and the orbital angular momenta of wide PMS binary systems. There appears
to be no evolution (decrease) of angular momentum from the smallest prestellar
cores via protostellar cores to wide PMS binary systems. In the context that
most protostellar cores are assumed to fragment and form binary stars, this
means that most of the angular momentum contained in the collapse region is
transformed into orbital angular momentum of the resulting stellar binary
systems.

on the scale of T, but at the cutoff scale set by the momentum dependence of
the interaction around 2k_F. The running amplitude g_1 (T) appears only at

banish any neuroprotection. Our new model will henceforth allow a better
understanding of neurochemical and biochemical alterations resulting from
traumatic brain injury, using microdialysis and PtiO2 techniques already
monitored in our Intensive Care Unit. Studies on efficiency and therapeutic
window of neuroprotective pharmacological molecules are now conceivable to
ameliorate severe head-injury treatment.

in an optical lattice. Local dipole-dipole interactions produce a long lived
antisymmetric and a short lived symmetric superposition of individual atomic
excitations as the lowest internal on-site excitations. Due to the much larger
dipole moment the symmetric states couple efficiently to neighbouring lattice
sites and can be well represented by Frenkel excitons, while the antisymmetric
dark states stay localized. Within a cavity only symmetric states couple to
cavity photons inducing long range interactions to form polaritons. We
calculate their dispersion curves as well as cavity transmission and reflection
spectra to observe them. For a lattice with aspherical sites bright and dark
states get mixed and their relative excitation energies depend on photon
polarizations. The system should allow to study new types of solid state
phenomena in atom filled optical lattices.
