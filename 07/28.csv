of entanglement in stabilizer states (or graph states). This conjecture states
that every two stabilizer states which are related by a local unitary
operation, must also be related by a local operation within the Clifford group.
The contribution of this paper is a reduction of the LU-LC conjecture to a
simpler problem - which, however, remains to date unsolved. As our main result,
we show that, if the LU-LC conjecture could be proved for the restricted case
of diagonal local unitary operations, then the conjecture is correct in its
totality. Furthermore, the reduced version of the problem, involving such
diagonal local operations, is mapped to questions regarding quadratic forms
over the finite field GF(2). Finally, we prove that correctness of the LU-LC
conjecture for stabilizer states implies a similar result for the more general
case of stabilizer codes.

bulge appear to depend on the method used to obtain them. Those values based on
the lensing of red clump giants (RCGs) appear to be significantly lower than
those based on the lensing of all stars along the line of sight. This
discrepancy is still not understood. Through Monte Carlo simulations, it is
found that the discrepancy cannot be explained by a dependance on the flux
limits of the two methods. The optical depth is expected to be generally
constant as a function of source apparent magnitude for I_0 >~ 13.0, except in
the range 13.5 <~ I_0 <~ 15.5. Here many RCGs are detected, causing a
significant oscillation in tau. The amplitude of this oscillation is a function
of the inclination angle of the Galactic bar, theta_bar, which may thus be
constrained. A further constraint comes from a similar dependance of tau with
theta_bar: combining the predicted trends with the measured values provides
1-sigma upper limits, which exclude the large bar angles recently reported by
the GLIMPSE and EROS surveys. The latest survey data from EROS-2 appear to show
the predicted tau oscillation, though currently at a low significance. However,
a further sign comes from EROS-2 event counts, which show a clear skew towards
fainter magnitudes.

linearized channel flow using balanced proper orthogonal decomposition (BPOD).
The models are obtained from three-dimensional simulations in physical space as
opposed to the traditional single-wavenumber approach, and are therefore better
able to capture the effects of localized disturbances or localized actuators.
In order to assess the performance of the models, we consider the impulse
response and frequency response, and variation of the Reynolds number as a
model parameter. We show that the BPOD procedure yields models that capture the
transient growth well at a low order, whereas standard POD does not capture the
growth unless a considerably larger number of modes is included, and even then
can be inaccurate. In the case of a localized actuator, we show that POD modes
which are not energetically significant can be very important for capturing the
energy growth. In addition, a comparison of the subspaces resulting from the
two methods suggests that the use of a non-orthogonal projection with adjoint
modes is most likely the main reason for the superior performance of BPOD. We
also demonstrate that for single-wavenumber perturbations, low-order BPOD
models reproduce the dominant eigenvalues of the full system better than POD
models of the same order. These features indicate that the simple, yet accurate
BPOD models are a good candidate for developing model-based controllers for
channel flow.

brighter magnitudes than the blue cloud. The bright-end of the red sequence
comprises elliptical galaxies (Es) with boxy isophotes and luminosity profiles
with shallow central cores, while fainter Es have disky isophotes and power-law
inner surface-brightness (SB) profiles. An analysis of published data reveals
that the centres of galaxies with power-law central SB profiles have younger
stellar populations than the centres of cored galaxies. We argue that thermal
evaporation of cold gas by virial-temperature gas plays an important role in
determining these phenomena. In less massive galaxies, thermal evaporation is
not very efficient, so significant amounts of cold gas can reach the galaxy
centre and fill a central core with newly formed stars, consistent with the
young stellar ages of the cusps of Es with power-law SB profiles. In more
massive galaxies, cold gas is evaporated within a dynamical time, so star
formation is inhibited, and a core in the stellar density profile produced by
dissipationless dynamics cannot be refilled. The different observed properties
of AGN in higher-mass and lower-mass ellipticals are also explained because in
the former the central black holes invariably accrete hot gas, while in the
latter they typically accrete cold gas. An important consequence of our results
is that at the present time there cannot be blue, star-forming galaxies in the
most massive galactic halos, consistent with the observed truncation of the
blue cloud at L*. [abridged]

the average and apparent optical depth of a disk section. Hence, they depend
differently on the average number and optical depth of ISM structures in the
disk. The small scale geometry of the cold ISM is critical for accurate models
of the overall energy budget of spiral disks. ISM geometry, relative
contributions of different stellar populations and dust emissivity are all free
parameters in galaxy Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) models; they are also
sometimes degenerate, depending on wavelength coverage. Our aim is to constrain
typical ISM geometry. The apparent optical depth measurement comes from the
number of distant galaxies seen in HST images through the foreground disk. We
measure the IR flux in images from the {\it Spitzer} Infrared Nearby Galaxy
Survey in the same section of the disk that was covered by HST. A physical
model of the dust is fit to the SED to estimate the dust surface density, mean
temperature, and brightness in these disk sections. The surface density is
subsequently converted into the average optical depth estimate. The two
measurements generally agree. The ratios between the measured average and

these disks. Optically thick disks, are likely to have more than a single cloud

sections in thirteen nearby galaxies, to determine the scale of the dusty ISM
responsible for disk opacity: one using stellar reddening and the other a known
background source. In our earlier papers, we presented extinction measurements
of 29 galaxies, based on calibrated counts of distant background objects
identified though foreground disks in HST/WFPC2 images. For the 13 galaxies
that overlap with the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS), we now
compare these results with those obtained from an I-L color map. Our goal is to
determine whether or not a detected distant galaxy indicates a gap in the dusty

extinction.
  We find that distant galaxies are predominantly in low-extinction sections
marked by the color maps, indicating that their number depends both on the
cloud cover of {\it Spitzer}-resolved dust structures --mostly the spiral

a metallic shell with free spin-down fermions moving in a fully filled

disappears to give room for a metallic phase, with a partially polarized

MS0451-03 (z=0.54). We identify and study several key classes of `transition
objects' whose stellar populations or dynamical states indicate a recent or
ongoing change in morphology and star formation rate. For the first time, we
have been able to conclusively identify spiral galaxies in the process of
transforming into S0 galaxies. This has been accomplished by locating both
spirals whose star formation is being quenched as well as their eventual
successors, the recently created S0s. Differences between the two clusters in
both the timescales and spatial location of this conversion process allow us to
evaluate the relative importance of several proposed physical mechanisms that
could be responsible for the transformation. Combined with other diagnostics
that are sensitive to either ICM-driven galaxy evolution or galaxy-galaxy
interactions, we describe a self-consistent picture of galaxy evolution in
clusters. We find that spiral galaxies within infalling groups have already
begun a slow process of conversion into S0s primarily via gentle galaxy-galaxy
interactions. The fates of spirals upon reaching the core of the cluster depend
heavily on the cluster ICM, with rapid conversion of all remaining spirals into
S0s via ram-pressure stripping in clusters where the ICM is dense. In the
presence of a less-dense ICM, the conversion continues at a slower pace, with
galaxy-galaxy interactions continuing to play a role along with `starvation' by
the ICM. We conclude that the buildup of the local S0 population through the
transformation of spiral galaxies is a heterogeneous process that nevertheless
proceeds robustly across a variety of different environments.

within the nuclear ring which can be attributed to (1) streaming motions along
the nuclear spiral arms and (2) a bipolar outflow which seems to be associated

calculated the scalar perturbations corresponding to the normal displacements
of the brane. This is performed in the probe brane limit where the
gravitational back-reaction of the brane on the bulk throat is absent. Our
model provides a framework for studying the transfer of fluctuations from a
contracting to an expanding phase. We find that the spectral index of the
dominant mode of the metric fluctuation is un-changed, unlike what is obtained
by gluing contracting to expanding Einstein universes with the help of the
usual matching conditions. Assuming that the fluctuations start off in a vacuum

the Spitzer Space Telescope. The detected 6.2 micron PAH equivalent widths
(EQWs) in the sample span more than two orders of magnitude (0.006-0.8 micron),
and ULIRGs with HII-like optical spectra or steep far-infrared spectral slopes
(S_{25} / S_{60} < 0.2) typically have 6.2 micron PAH EQWs that are half that
of lower-luminosity starbursts. A significant fraction (~40-60%) of HII-like,
LINER-like, and cold ULIRGs have very weak PAH EQWs. Many of these ULIRGs also
have large (tau_{9.7} > 2.3) silicate optical depths. The far-infrared spectral
slope is strongly correlated with PAH EQW, but not with silicate optical depth.
In addition, the PAH EQW decreases with increasing rest-frame 24 micron
luminosity. We argue that this trend results primarily from dilution of the PAH
EQW by continuum emission from dust heated by a compact central source,
probably an AGN. High luminosity, high-redshift sources studied with Spitzer
appear to have a much larger range in PAH EQW than seen in local ULIRGs, which
is consistent with extremely luminous starburst systems being absent at low

with rate \lambda and the (attempted) services with rate \rho>\lambda. Then put
the first class particles at the instants of departures (effective services)

a coupling (different from Liggett's basic coupling), having as invariant
measure the product of Poisson processes. The definition of the multi-line

the SFA2 theory, we confirmed that the yield along the back rescattered ridge

The characteristics of the extracted electron wave packets for different laser

the hard X-ray emission from solar flares, the latter is normally ignored. Such
an omission is not justified at electron (and photon) energies above $\sim 300$
keV, and inclusion of the additional electron-electron bremsstrahlung in
general makes the electron spectrum required to produce a given hard X-ray
spectrum steeper at high energies.
  Unlike electron-ion bremsstrahlung, electron-electron bremsstrahlung cannot
produce photons of all energies up to the maximum electron energy involved. The
maximum possible photon energy depends on the angle between the direction of
the emitting electron and the emitted photon, and this suggests a diagnostic
for an upper cutoff energy and/or for the degree of beaming of the accelerated
electrons.
  We analyze the large event of January 17, 2005 observed by RHESSI and show
that the upward break around 400 keV in the observed hard X-ray spectrum is
naturally accounted for by the inclusion of electron-electron bremsstrahlung.
Indeed, the mean source electron spectrum recovered through a regularized
inversion of the hard X-ray spectrum, using a cross-section that includes both
electron-ion and electron-electron terms, has a relatively constant spectral
index $\delta$ over the range from electron kinetic energy $E = 200$ keV to $E
= 1$ MeV. However, the level of detail discernible in the recovered electron
spectrum is not sufficient to determine whether or not any upper cutoff energy
exists.

  Dixmier property","48 pages, final version, to appear in J. Funct. Anal",,,,"math.OA math.FA",,"  In this paper we set up a representation theorem for tracial gauge norms on
finite von Neumann algebras satisfying the weak Dixmier property in terms of Ky
Fan norms. Examples of tracial gauge norms on finite von Neumann algebras
satisfying the weak Dixmier property include unitarily invariant norms on
finite factors (type ${\rm II}\sb 1$ factors and $M_n(\cc)$) and symmetric
gauge norms on $L^\infty[0,1]$ and $\cc^n$. As the first application, we obtain
that the class of unitarily invariant norms on a type ${\rm II}\sb 1$ factor
coincides with the class of symmetric gauge norms on $L^\infty[0,1]$ and von
Neumann's classical result \cite{vN} on unitarily invariant norms on
$M_n(\cc)$. As the second application, Ky Fan's dominance theorem \cite{Fan} is
obtained for finite von Neumann algebras satisfying the weak Dixmier property.
As the third application, some classical results in non-commutative
$L^p$-theory (e.g., non-commutative H$\ddot{\text{o}}$lder's inequality,
duality and reflexivity of non-commutative $L^p$-spaces) are obtained for
general unitarily invariant norms on finite factors. We also investigate the
extreme points of $\NN(\M)$, the convex compact set (in the pointwise weak
topology) of normalized unitarily invariant norms (the norm of the identity
operator is 1) on a finite factor $\M$. We obtain all extreme points of
$\NN(M_2(\cc))$ and many extreme points of $\NN(M_n(\cc))$ ($n\geq 3$). For a
type ${\rm II}\sb 1$ factor $\M$, we prove that if $t$ ($0\leq t\leq 1$) is a
rational number then the Ky Fan $t$-th norm is an extreme point of $\NN(\M)$.

namely, heat transports preferably in one direction. This phenomenon is also
called thermal rectification. The rectification is weakly dependent on the
detailed structure of connection part, but is strongly dependent on the
temperature gradient. We also study the effect of the tube radius and
intramolecular junction length on the rectification. Our study shows that the
tensile stress can increase rectification. The physical mechanism of the

  response to referee comments, to appear in Statistics and Computing",,,,"stat.CO stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Simulated tempering (ST) is an established Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
method for sampling from a multimodal density $\pi(\theta)$. Typically, ST
involves introducing an auxiliary variable $k$ taking values in a finite subset
of $[0,1]$ and indexing a set of tempered distributions, say $\pi_k(\theta)
\propto \pi(\theta)^k$. In this case, small values of $k$ encourage better
mixing, but samples from $\pi$ are only obtained when the joint chain for
$(\theta,k)$ reaches $k=1$. However, the entire chain can be used to estimate
expectations under $\pi$ of functions of interest, provided that importance
sampling (IS) weights are calculated. Unfortunately this method, which we call
importance tempering (IT), can disappoint. This is partly because the most
immediately obvious implementation is na\""ive and can lead to high variance
estimators. We derive a new optimal method for combining multiple IS estimators
and prove that the resulting estimator has a highly desirable property related
to the notion of effective sample size. We briefly report on the success of the
optimal combination in two modelling scenarios requiring reversible-jump MCMC,
where the na\""ive approach fails.

over the extensive galactic radio continuum shell, W 50, which surrounds the
remarkable stellar system SS 433. Two of these mosaics in the Halpha+[N II] and
[O III] 5007 A emission lines respectively cover a field of ~2.3 x 2.5 degr^2
which contains all of W 50 but at a low angular resolution of 5 arcsec. The
third and fourth mosaics cover the eastern (in [O III] 5007 A) and western (in
Halpha+[N II]) filamentary nebulosity respectively but at an angular resolution
of 1 arcsec. These observations are supplemented by new low dispersion spectra
and longslit, spatially resolved echelle spectra. The [O III] 5007 A images
show for the first time the distribution of this emission in both the eastern
and western filaments while new Halpha+[N II] emission features are also found
in both of these regions. Approaching flows of faintly emitting material from
the bright eastern filaments of up 100 km/s in radial velocity are detected.
The present observations also suggest that the heliocentric systemic radial
velocity of the whole system is 56+-2 km/s. Furthermore, very deep imagery and
high resolution spectroscopy of a small part of the northern radio ridge of W
50 has revealed for the first time the very faint optical nebulosity associated
with this edge. It is suggested that patchy foreground dust along the ~5 kpc
sightline is inhibiting the detection of all of the optical nebulosity
associated with W 50. The interaction of the microquasar jets of SS 433 with
the W 50 shell is discussed.

surface epithelial cells. By analyzing the noise in real and imaginary
electrical impedance, we demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish the two
cell types purely from signatures of their electrical noise. Our measures
include power-spectral exponents, Hurst and detrended fluctuation analysis, and
estimates of correlation time; principal-component analysis combines all the
measures. The noise from both cancerous and non-cancerous cultures shows
correlations on many time scales, but these correlations are stronger for the
non-cancerous cells.
