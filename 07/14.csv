the sources of mid-infrared emission in AGNs. A speckle processing of VISIR
BURST mode images was performed to extract very low spatial-frequency
visibilities, first considering the full field of VISIR BURST mode images and
then limiting it to the mask used for the acquisition of MIDI data. Extracted
visibilities are reproduced with a multi-component model. We identify two major
sources of emission: one compact < 85 mas, associated with the dusty torus, and
an elliptical one, (< 140) mas x 1187 mas at P.A.=-4 degrees from N to E. This
is consistent with previous deconvolution processes. The combination with MIDI
data reveals the close environment of the dusty torus to contribute to about 83
percent of the MIR flux seen by MIDI. This strong contribution has to be
considered in modeling long baseline interferometric data. It must be related
to the NS elongated component which is thought to originate from individually
unresolved dusty clouds and is located inside the ionization cone. Low
temperatures of the dusty torus are not challenged, emphasizing the scenarios

geometry. As a plausible means of efficiently separating a small population of
nonthermal particles from the bulk accretion flows, we investigate the
formation of standing dissipative shocks, i.e. shocks at which fraction of the
energy, angular momentum and mass fluxes do not participate in the shock
transition of the flow that accretes onto the compact object but are lost into
collimated (jets) or uncollimated (winds) outflows. The mass loss fraction (at
a shock front) is found to vary over a wide range (0 - 95%) depending on flow's
angular momentum and energy. On the other hand, the associated energy loss
fraction appears to be relatively low (<1%) for a flow onto a non-rotating
black hole case, whereas the fraction could be an order of magnitude higher
(<10%) for a flow onto a rapidly-rotating black hole. By estimating the escape
velocity of the outflowing particles with a mass-accretion rate relevant for
typical active galactic nuclei, we find that nearly 10% of the accreting mass
could escape to form an outflow in a disk around a non-rotating black hole,
while as much as 50% of the matter may contribute to outflows in a disk around
a rapidly-rotating black hole. In the context of disk-jet paradigm, our model
suggests that shock-driven outflows from accretion can occur in regions not too
far from a central engine. Our results imply that a shock front under some
conditions could serve as a plausible site where (nonthermal) seed particles of
the outflows (jets/winds) are efficiently decoupled from bulk accretion.

rate). On the other hand, their cool disk components, large characteristic
inner-disk radii and low characteristic timescales have been interpreted as
evidence of black hole masses ~ 1000 Msun (intermediate-mass black holes). Here
we re-examine the physical interpretation of the cool disk model, in the
context of accretion states of stellar-mass black holes. In particular, XTE
J1550-564 can be considered the missing link between ULXs and stellar-mass
black holes, because it exhibits a high-accretion-rate, low-disk-temperature
state (ultraluminous branch). On the ultraluminous branch, the accretion rate
is positively correlated with the disk truncation radius and the bolometric
disk luminosity, while it is anti-correlated with the peak temperature and the
frequency of quasi-periodic-oscillations. Two prototypical ULXs (NGC1313 X-1
and X-2) also seem to move along that branch. We use a phenomenological model
to show how the different range of spectral and timing parameters found in the
two classes of accreting black holes depends on both their masses and accretion
rates. We suggest that ULXs are consistent with black hole masses ~ 50-100
Msun, moderately inefficiently accreting at ~20 times Eddington.

interpreted as outflows from the central engine in the polar direction,
consistent with recent numerical models of inflow/outflows in AGNs. In
addition, it could possibly be caused by the interaction between the blazar jet

concentration of high mass ratio ultracool binary systems is a fundamental
feature of the companion distribution, not an observational or selection bias;
2) Determine that the wide (>~20 AU) binary frequency can be no more the 1-2%;
3) Show that the decreasing binary frequency with later spectral types is a
real trend; 4) Demonstrate that a large population of currently undetected low
mass ratio systems are not consistent with the current data; 5) Find that the
population of spectroscopic binaries must be be at least 30% that of currently
known ultracool binaries. The best fit value for the overall M6 and later
binary frequency is ~20%-22%, of which only ~6% consists of currently
undetected companions with separations less than 1 AU. If this is correct, then
the upper limit of the ultracool binary population discovered to date is ~75%.
I find that the numerical simulation results of the ejection formation method
are inconsistent with the outcome of this analysis. However, dynamics do seem
to play an important role as simulations of small-N clusters and triple system
decays produce results similar to those of this work. The observational efforts
required to improve these constraints are shown to be primarily large

decay into a pair of top quarks. With its large cross section, t\bar t

to search for such particles. The identification of very energetic top quarks
is crucial in such an analysis. We consider in detail the t\bar t\to\ell^\pm\nu
b\bar bq\bar q' (\ell=e, \mu) final state for high p_T top quarks. In this
phase space region, two or more of the final state quarks can merge into a
single jet due to the large Lorentz boost of the parent top quark. As a result,
a large fraction of t\bar t\to\ell^\pm\nu b\bar bq\bar q' events with an
invariant mass in the TeV region contains less than four observable jets.
Requiring one or two tagged b-quarks, we calculate the W+jets, Wb+jets, Wb\bar
b+jets, Wbt, and single top plus jets backgrounds for these final states, and
identify cuts which help to suppress them. In particular, we discuss whether a
cut on the jet invariant mass may be useful in reducing the background in the
\ell\nu+2 jets channel. We also investigate how next-to-leading order QCD
corrections affect high p_T top quark production at the LHC. We find that the

Using K0-K1 III templates, we find vsini=32.9 +/- 0.8 km/s. We show that the
choice of template star and the assumed limb darkening coefficient has little
impact on the derived rotational velocity. This value is a significant revision
downwards compared to previously published values. We derive new system

find M_1=1.44 +/- 0.10 Msun, M_2=0.35 +/- 0.03 Msun, and q=0.24 +/- 0.02 where
the errors have been estimated through a Monte-Carlo simulation. A possible
remaining systematic effect is the fact that we may be over-estimating the
orbital velocity of the mass donor due to irradiation effects. However, any
correction for this effect will only reduce the compact object mass further,
down to a minimum mass of M_1=1.05 +/- 0.08 Msun. There is thus strong evidence
that the compact object in this binary is a neutron star of rather typical mass

of bound states with nuclei. This paper presents a detailed numerical and
analytical analysis of such CHAMP BBN. All reactions important for predicting
light-element yields are calculated within the Born approximation. Three
priorly neglected effects are treated in detail:(a) photodestruction of bound
states due to electromagnetic cascades induced by the CHAMP decay, (b)
late-time efficient destruction/production of H2, Li6, and Li7 due to reactions
on charge Z=1 nuclei bound to CHAMPs, and (c) CHAMP exchange between nuclei.
Each of these effects may induce orders-of-magnitude changes in the final
abundance yields. The study focusses on the impact of CHAMPs on a possible
simultaneous solution of the Li6 and Li7 problems. It is shown that a priorly
suggested simultaneous solution of the Li6 and Li7 problems for a relic
decaying at tau_x = 1000 sec is only very weakly dependent on the relic being
neutral or charged, unless its hadronic branching ratio is Bh << 10^-4 very
small. By use of a Monte-Carlo analysis it is shown that within CHAMP BBN the
existence of further parameter space for a simultaneous solution of the Li6 and

unlikely.

lower limit of fundamental nature on the operating voltage and hence the power
dissipation in standard FET based switches. Here we show that by replacing the
standard insulator with a ferroelectric insulator of the right thickness it
should be possible to implement a step-up voltage transformer that will amplify
the gate voltage thus leading to values of S lower than 60 mV/decade and
enabling low voltage/low power operation. The voltage transformer action can be
understood intuitively as the result of an effective negative capacitance
provided by the ferroelectric capacitor which arises from an internal positive
feedback that in principle could be obtained from other microscopic mechanisms
as well. Unlike other proposals to reduce S this involves no change in the
basic physics of the FET and thus does not affect its current drive or impose

transition being sharp: Below p_c the size of the open cluster of a given
vertex is not only (a.s.) finite, but has a distrubtion with an exponential
tail. The analog of this result has been proved by Higuchi in 1993 for
two-dimensional Ising percolation, with fixed inverse temparature beta <beta_c,
and as parameter the external field h.
  Using sharp-threshold results (approximate zero-one laws) and a modification
of an RSW-like result by Bollobas and Riordan, we show that these results hold
for a large class of percolation models where the vertex values can be `nicely'
represented (in a sense which will be defined precisely) by i.i.d. random
variables. We point out that the ordinary percolation model belongs obviously
to this class, and we show that also the above mentionedIsing model belongs to
it.
  We hope that our results improve insight in the Ising percolation model, and
will help to show that many other (not yet analyzed) weakly dependent
percolation models also belong to the abovementioned class.

luminosities (0.01-0.04 L* or M(UV)~-16 to -17), allowing us to determine the

high accuracy. We find faint-end slopes alpha of -1.73+/-0.05 at z~4,
-1.66+/-0.09 at z~5, and -1.74+/-0.16 at z~6 -- suggesting that the faint-end
slope is very steep and shows little evolution with cosmic time. We find that
M*(UV) brightens considerably in the 0.7 Gyr from z~6 to z~4 (by ~0.7 mag from
M*=-20.24+/-0.19 to M*=-20.98+/-0.10). The observed increase in the
characteristic luminosity over this range is almost identical to that expected
for the halo mass function -- suggesting that the observed evolution is likely
due to the hierarchical coalescence and merging of galaxies. The evolution in
phi* is not significant. The UV luminosity density at z~6 is modestly lower
(0.45+/-0.09 times) than that at z~4 (integrated to -17.5 AB mag) though a
larger change is seen in the dust-corrected star-formation rate density. We
thoroughly examine published LF results and assess the reasons for their wide

available. The extremely steep faint-end slopes alpha found here suggest that
lower luminosity galaxies play a significant role in reionizing the universe.

developed to explain the observed abundance at low metallicity. In this paper,
given this constraint on the Li6, we calculate the non-thermal evolution with
redshift of D, Be, and B in the IGM. In addition to cosmological cosmic ray
interactions in the IGM, we include additional processes driven by SN
explosions: neutrino spallation and a low energy component in the structures
ejected by outflows to the IGM. We take into account CNO CRs impinging on the
intergalactic gas. Although subdominant in the galactic disk, this process is
shown to produce the bulk of Be and B in the IGM, due to the differential metal
enrichment between structures (where CRs originate) and the IGM. We also
consider the resulting extragalactic gamma-ray background which we find to be
well below existing data. The computation is performed in the framework of
hierarchical structure formation considering several star formation histories
including Pop III stars. We find that D production is negligible and that a
potentially detectable Be and B plateau is produced by these processes at the
time of the formation of the Galaxy (z ~ 3).

thin vertical fiber becomes unstable to interfacial perturbations. We present
an experimental study using fluids with different densities, surface tensions
and viscosities to investigate the growth and dynamics of these interfacial
perturbations and to test the assumptions made by previous authors. We find the
initial perturbation growth is exponential followed by a slower phase as the
amplitude and wavelength saturate in size. Measurements of the perturbation
growth for experiments conducted at low and moderate Reynolds numbers are
compared to theoretical predictions developed from linear stability theory.
Excellent agreement is found between predictions from a long-wave Stokes flow
model (Craster & Matar, J. Fluid Mech. 553, 85 (2006)) and data, while fair
agreement is found between predictions from a moderate Reynolds number model
(Sisoev et al., Chem. Eng. Sci. 61, 7279 (2006)) and data. Furthermore, we find
that a known transition in the longer-time perturbation dynamics from unsteady
to steady behavior at a critical flow rate, Qc, is correlated to a transition
in the rate at which perturbations naturally form along the fiber. For Q < Qc
(steady case), the rate of perturbation formation is constant. As a result the
position along the fiber where perturbations form is nearly fixed, and the
spacing between consecutive perturbations remains constant as they travel 2 m
down the fiber. For Q > Qc (unsteady case), the rate of perturbation formation
is modulated. As a result the position along the fiber where perturbations form
oscillates irregularly, and the initial speed and spacing between perturbations
varies resulting in the coalescence of neighboring perturbations further down
the fiber.

1048.-5937 exhibited two large, long-term X-ray pulsed-flux flares as well as
short bursts, and large (>10x) torque changes. Monitoring with RXTE revealed
that the source entered a phase of timing stability in 2004; at the same time,
a series of four simultaneous observations with CXO and HST in 2006 showed that
its X-ray flux and spectrum and near-IR flux, all variable prior to 2005,
stabilized. The near-IR flux, when detected by HST (H~22.7 mag) and VLT
(K_S~21.0 mag), was considerably fainter than previously measured. Recently, in
2007 March, this newfound quiescence was interrupted by a sudden flux
enhancement, X-ray spectral changes and a pulse morphology change, simultaneous
with a large spin-up glitch and near-IR enhancement. Our RXTE observations
revealed a sudden pulsed flux increase by a factor of ~3 in the 2-10 keV band.
In observations with CXO and Swift, we found that the total X-ray flux
increased much more than the pulsed flux, reaching a peak value of >7 times the
quiescent value (2-10 keV). With these recent data, we find a strong
anti-correlation between X-ray flux and pulsed fraction, and a correlation
between X-ray spectral hardness and flux. Simultaneously with the radiative and
timing changes, we observed a significant X-ray pulse morphology change such
that the profile went from nearly sinusoidal to having multiple peaks. We
compare these remarkable events with other AXP outbursts and discuss
implications in the context of the magnetar model and other models of AXP

can remove superluminal recession velocities, and hence the concept of the
expansion of space should be abandoned. This work demonstrates that such
conformal transformations do not eliminate superluminal recession velocities
for open or flat matter-only FRLW cosmologies, and all possess superluminal

of space is perfectly valid in the general relativistic framework, however,

prove that the minimum of coverage probability with respect to a binomial

Graphs of girth g have roughly that many vertices. We also show that

$Soc(A)=0:M$ in a single degree $j$. The Hilbert function $H(A)=(h_0,h_1,...

of level algebra quotients of $R$ having Hilbert function $H$ forms an open
subscheme of the family of graded algebras or, via Macaulay duality, of a
Grassmannian.

$H=H_2=(1,3,6,8,9,3)$ the family $LevAlg (H)$ parametrizing level Artinian
algebras of Hilbert function $H$ has several irreducible components. We show
also that these examples each lift to points. However, in the first example, an
irreducible Betti stratum for Artinian algebras becomes reducible when lifted
to points. These were the first examples we obtained of multiple components for
$\Levalg(H)$ in embedding dimension three.
  We also show that the second example is the first in an infinite sequence of
examples of type three Hilbert functions $H(c)$ in which also the number of
components of LevAlg(H) gets arbitrarily large.
  The first case where the phenomenon of multiple components can occur (i.e.
the lowest embedding dimension and then the lowest type) is that of dimension
three and type two. Examples of this first case have been obtained by the
authors and also by J.-O. Kleppe.

electrodynamics to second order. At this, we take into account the covariant
coordinates that allow the construction of local gauge invariant quantities
(observables). It turns out that this does not remove the well-known severe
infrared problem, as one might have hoped. Instead, things become worse, since
nonlocal divergences appear. We also show that these cancel in a supersymmetric
version of the theory if the covariant coordinates are adjusted accordingly.
  Furthermore, we study the phi^3 and the Wess-Zumino model and show that the
distortion of the dispersion relations is moderate for parameters typical for
the Higgs field. We also disuss the formulation of gauge theories on
noncommutative spaces and study classical electrodynamics on the noncommutative
Minkowski space using covariant coordinates. In particular, we compute the
change of the speed of light due to nonlinear effects in the presence of a
background field. Finally, we examine the so-called twist approach to quantum

gravitation may be described in terms of spatially averaged variables. In
Einstein's theory, restricting attention to scalar variables, this evolution
can be modeled by solutions of a set of Friedmann equations for an effective
volume scale factor, with matter and backreaction source terms. The latter can
be represented by an effective scalar field (`morphon field') modeling Dark
Energy.
  The present work provides an overview over the Dark Energy debate in
connection with the impact of inhomogeneities, and formulates strategies for a
comprehensive quantitative evaluation of backreaction effects both in
theoretical and observational cosmology. We recall the basic steps of a
description of backreaction effects in relativistic cosmology that lead to
refurnishing the standard cosmological equations, but also lay down a number of
challenges and unresolved issues in connection with their observational
interpretation.
  The present status of this subject is intermediate: we have a good
qualitative understanding of backreaction effects pointing to a global
instability of the standard model of cosmology; exact solutions and
perturbative results modeling this instability lie in the right sector to
explain Dark Energy from inhomogeneities. It is fair to say that, even if
backreaction effects turn out to be less important than anticipated by some
researchers, the concordance high-precision cosmology, the architecture of
current N-body simulations, as well as standard perturbative approaches may all
fall short in correctly describing the Late Universe.
