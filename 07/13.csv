coupling the semichiral superfields to the new (2,2) semichiral vector

the complete set of three Killing potentials which are associated with this
gauging. We show that the Killing potentials lead to the generalized moment
maps defined in the context of twisted generalized Kahler geometry. Next we
address the question of the T-duality map, while keeping the (2,2)
supersymmetry manifest. Using the new vector superfield in constructing the
duality functional, under T-duality we swap a pair of left and right semichiral

matter host has been accumulating steadily in the past few years. The effect is
seen over a wide range of scales, from massive clusters of galaxies down to
galaxy-sized systems, yet the underlying physical mechanism has still not been
established. To this end, we have carried out a detailed analysis of the shapes
and orientations of dark matter substructures in high-resolution N-body
cosmological simulations. We find a strong tendency for radial alignment of the
substructure with its host halo: the distribution of halo major axes is very
anisotropic, with the majority pointing towards the center of mass of the host.
The alignment peaks once the sub-halo has passed the virial radius of the host
for the first time, but is not subsequently diluted, even after the halos have
gone through as many as four pericentric passages. This evidence points to the
existence of a very rapid dynamical mechanism acting on these systems and we
argue that tidal torquing throughout their orbits is the most likely candidate.

centimeter-wavelength intraday variability (interstellar scintillation) while
the other 25% do not show intraday variability. We find that interstellar
scattering is measurable for most of these AGN, and the typical broadening
diameter is 2 mas at 1 GHz. We find that the scintillating AGN are typically at
lower Galactic latitudes than the non-scintillating AGN, consistent with the
scenario that intraday variability is a propagation effect from the Galactic
interstellar medium. The magnitude of the inferred interstellar broadening
measured toward the scintillating AGN, when scaled to higher frequencies, is
comparable to the diameters inferred from analyses of the light curves for the
more well-known intraday variable sources. However, we find no difference in
the amount of scattering measured toward the scintillating versus
non-scintillating AGN. A consistent picture is one in which the scintillation
results from localized regions (""clumps"") distributed throughout the Galactic
disk, but which individually make little contribution to the angular
broadening. Of the 58 AGN observed, 37 (64%) have measured redshifts. At best,
a marginal trend is found for scintillating (non-scintillating) AGN to have
smaller (larger) angular diameters at higher redshifts. We also use our
observations to try to constrain the possibility of intergalactic scattering.
While broadly consistent with the scenario of a highly turbulent intergalactic
medium, our observations do not place significant constraints on its
properties.

by the solar wind impinging on their magnetospheres. Extrapolating to the
planet orbiting tau Boo, various authors have predicted that it may be within
the detection limits of the 4-meter wavelength (74 MHz) system on the Very
Large Array. This paper reports three epochs of observations of tau Boo. In no
epoch do we detect the planet; various means of determining the upper limit to
the emission yield single-epoch limits ranging from 135 to 300 mJy. We develop
a likelihood method for multi-epoch observations and use it to constrain
various radiation properties of the planet. Assuming that the planet does
radiate at our observation wavelength, its typical luminosity must be less than
about 10^{16} W, unless its radiation is highly beamed into a solid angle Omega
<< 1 sr. While within the range of luminosities predicted by various authors
for this planet, this value is lower than recent estimates which attempt to
take into account the stellar wind of tau Boo using the known properties of the
star itself. Electron cyclotron maser emission from solar systems planets is
beamed, but with characteristic solid angles of approximately 1 sr illuminated.
Future long-wavelength instruments (e.g., the Long Wavelength Array and the Low
Frequency Array) must be able to make typical flux density measurements on
short time scales (~ 15 min.) of approximately 25 mJy in order to improve these
constraints significantly.

SS433. Our investigation includes several contributions to the opacity of this
system. They result from the ambient fields generated by the primary star,
possibly an A-type supergiant, and a very extended disk around the black hole.
Besides the sharp and dramatic absorption effect that occurs every time the
star crosses the emission zone, we find in the UV photon field from the
extended disk an important source of absorption for very high energy
gamma-rays. This results in periodic gamma-ray observational signatures.

bubble-burst process takes place in three steps: breaking of the film cap,
projection of film drops, and projection of jet drops. The film break and the
jet drop formation are observed with a high-speed video camera. The film drop
aerosol enters a particle counter, which characterizes the drops in size and
number. Results are presented and discussed. The quantification of both types
of projections leads to the conclusion that the film drop projections represent
the major source of dust. The amount of film drops greatly decreases with the
parent bubble size. Bubbles with diameter under 4mm theoretically do not
produce film drops. Decreasing the CO-bubble size enough would therefore
represent an effective solution for reducing drastically the electric arc
furnace dust emission.

the Nomura algebras of $(A,B)$. These algebras become the central tool in this
thesis. We explore their properties in Chapters \ref{Nomura} and \ref{IINom}.
  In Chapter \ref{JP}, we introduce Jones pairs. We prove the equivalence of
four-weight spin models and invertible Jones pairs. We extend some existing
concepts for four-weight spin models to Jones pairs. In Chapter
\ref{SpinModels}, we provide new proofs for some well-known results on the
Bose-Mesner algebras associated with spin models.
  We document the main results of the thesis in Chapter \ref{InvJP}. We prove
that every four-weight spin model comes from a symmetric spin model (up to
odd-gauge equivalence). We present four Bose-Mesner algebras associated to each

more than a factor 10 across the starburst disk, the HCN/HCO+ ratio is constant
throughout the disk, and we derive an average ratio of 1.1+/-0.2. From an
excitation analysis we find that all lines from both molecules are subthermally
excited and that they are optically thick. This subthermal excitation implies
that the observed HCN/HCO+ line ratio is sensitive to the underlying chemistry.
The constant line ratio thus implies that there are no strong abundance
gradients across the starburst disk of NGC253. This finding may also explain
the variations in L'(HCN)/L'(HCO+) between different star forming galaxies both
nearby and at high redshifts.

phase-field formulation of the bulk free energy and incorporates two crucial
effects: (i) anisotropic ionic mobility in the crystal and (ii) surface
reactions governing the flux of ions across the electrode/electrolyte
interface, depending on the local free energy difference. Although the phase
boundary can form a classical diffusive ""shrinking core"" when the dynamics is
bulk-transport-limited, the theory also predicts a new regime of
surface-reaction-limited (SRL) dynamics, where the phase boundary extends from
surface to surface along planes of fast ionic diffusion, consistent with recent
experiments on LiFePO4. In the SRL regime, the theory produces a fundamentally
new equation for phase transformation dynamics, which admits traveling-wave
solutions. Rather than forming a shrinking core of untransformed material, the
phase boundary advances by filling (or emptying) successive channels of fast
diffusion in the crystal. By considering the random nucleation of SRL
phase-transformation waves, the theory predicts a very different picture of
charge/discharge dynamics from the classical diffusion-limited model, which
could affect the interpretation of experimental data for LiFePO4.

star-forming, nearby galaxies. A subset of these, the supercompact UVLGs, are
believed to be local analogs of high redshift Lyman Break Galaxies. Here we
investigate the radio continuum properties of this important population for the
first time. We have observed 42 supercompact UVLGs with the VLA, all of which
have extensive coverage in the UV/optical by GALEX and SDSS. Our analysis
includes comparison samples of multiwavelength data from the Spitzer First Look
Survey and from the SDSS-Galex matched catalogs. In addition we have Spitzer
MIPS data for 24 of our galaxies and find that they fall on the radio-FIR
correlation of normal star-forming galaxies. We find that our galaxies have
lower radio-to-UV ratios and lower Balmer decrements than other local galaxies
with similar (high) star formation rates. Optical spectra show they have lower
Dn(4000) and HdeltaA indices, higher Hbeta emission-line equivalents widths,
and higher [OIII]5007/Hbeta emission-line ratios than normal star forming
galaxies. Comparing these results to galaxy spectral evolution models we
conclude that supercompact UVLGs are distinguished from normal star forming
galaxies firstly by their high specific star formation rates. Moreover,
compared to other types of galaxies with similar star formation rates, they
have significantly less dust attenuation. In both regards they are similar to
Lyman Break Galaxies. This suggests that the process that causes star formation
in the supercompact UVLGs differs from other local star forming galaxies, but
may be similar to Lyman Break Galaxies.

to emission modulation due to an anisotropic emission pattern of the source or
orientation-dependent amount of absorbing medium along the line of sight or
both. We consider, in particular, anisotropy patterns of blackbody-type
emission, thermal Comptonization in slab geometry, jet/outflow beaming, and
absorption in a coronal-type medium above the disc. We then fit these models to
the data from the RXTE/ASM, CGRO/BATSE, and the Ryle and Green Bank radio
telescopes, and find relatively small best-fit angles between the precession
and orbital planes, ~10-20 degrees. The thermal Comptonization model for the
X-ray emission explains well the observed decrease of the variability amplitude
from 1 to 300 keV as a result of a reduced anisotropy of the emission due to
multiple scatterings. Our modeling also yield the jet bulk velocity of
~(0.3-0.5)c, which is in agreement with the previous constraint from the lack
of an observed counterjet and lack of short-term X-ray/radio correlations.

whereas the X-ray and H$\alpha$ emissions decline in ultracool dwarfs with
decreasing effective temperature, the radio luminosity stays (more or less)
constant across M and early-L dwarfs. The radio surface flux or the luminosity
may better trace magnetic activity in ultracool dwarfs than the ratio of the

exciting approaches to constructing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The
proposal relies on the existence of topological states of matter whose
quasiparticle excitations are neither bosons nor fermions, but are particles
known as {\it Non-Abelian anyons}, meaning that they obey {\it non-Abelian
braiding statistics}. Quantum information is stored in states with multiple
quasiparticles, which have a topological degeneracy. The unitary gate
operations which are necessary for quantum computation are carried out by
braiding quasiparticles, and then measuring the multi-quasiparticle states. The
fault-tolerance of a topological quantum computer arises from the non-local
encoding of the states of the quasiparticles, which makes them immune to errors
caused by local perturbations. To date, the only such topological states
thought to have been found in nature are fractional quantum Hall states, most
prominently the \nu=5/2 state, although several other prospective candidates
have been proposed in systems as disparate as ultra-cold atoms in optical
lattices and thin film superconductors. In this review article, we describe
current research in this field, focusing on the general theoretical concepts of
non-Abelian statistics as it relates to topological quantum computation, on
understanding non-Abelian quantum Hall states, on proposed experiments to
detect non-Abelian anyons, and on proposed architectures for a topological
quantum computer. We address both the mathematical underpinnings of topological
quantum computation and the physics of the subject using the \nu=5/2 fractional
quantum Hall state as the archetype of a non-Abelian topological state enabling
fault-tolerant quantum computation.

photometry into Te, [Fe/H], distance, and age for F and G stars and rediscuss
the results of the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (Nordstrom et al. 2004; GCS) in
terms of the evolution of the disk.
  We substantially improve the Te and [Fe/H] calibrations for early F stars,
where spectroscopic temperatures have large systematic errors. Our recomputed
ages are in excellent agreement with the independent determinations by Takeda
et al. (2007), indicating that isochrone ages can now be reliably determined.
  The revised G-dwarf metallicity distribution remains incompatible with
closed-box models, and the age-metallicity relation for the thin disk remains
almost flat, with large and real scatter at all ages (sigma intrinsic = 0.20
dex). Dynamical heating of the thin disk continues throughout its life;
specific in-plane dynamical effects dominate the evolution of the U and V
velocities, while the W velocities remain random at all ages. When assigning

H_0 describes non-interacting qubits, V is a perturbation that involves
arbitrary two-qubit interactions on a graph of bounded degree, and $\epsilon$
is a small parameter. The algorithm works if $|\epsilon|$ is below a certain
threshold value that depends only upon the spectral gap of H_0, the maximal
degree of the graph, and the maximal norm of the two-qubit interactions. The

energy distributions, select candidate young stellar objects (YSOs), and
constrain their mass and evolutionary state. Comparison of the different
protostellar selection methods shows that mid-infrared methods are consistent,

young objects. We reveal more than 400 protostellar candidates, including one
massive young stellar object (YSO) that has not been previously highlighted.
The YSO distribution supports a picture of distributed low-level star
formation, with no strong evidence of triggered star formation in the
``pillars''. We confirm the youth of NGC 6611 by a large fraction of
infrared-excess sources, and reveal a younger cluster of YSOs in the nearby
molecular cloud. Analysis of the YSO clustering properties shows a possible
imprint of the molecular cloud's Jeans length. Multiwavelength mid-IR imaging
thus allows us to analyze the protostellar population, to measure the dust
temperature and column density, and to relate these in a consistent picture of

microwave background CMB, such as the absence of gravitational lensing in the
WMAP data, open the doors to some speculations such as a local origin to the
CMB. We argue here that this assumption agrees with the absence of the GZK
cutoff (at least according to AGASA data) in the energy spectrum of the cosmic
ray due to the cosmic interaction with the CMB at $6\times 10^{19} eV$ or
above. Within 50 Mpc from Earth, the matter and light distributions are close
to an anisotropic distribution, where the local cluster and local
super-clusters of galaxies can be identified. In contrast, the ultra high
energy comic rays data is consistent to an almost isotropic distribution, and
there is no correlation between their arrival direction and astronomical
sources within our local cluster. This means that the events above the GZK
cutoff come from distances above 50 Mpc, without an apparent energy loss. This
scenario is plausible under the assumption of the CMB concentrated only within
3-4 Mpc from Earth. In other words, the CMB has a local origin linked only to
the local super-cluster of galaxies. In addition, the galactic and
extragalactic energy spectra index within the energy equipartition theorem
strongly constrains the dark matter and dark energy hypothesis, essential in
the Big Bang cosmology.

are coincident with radio features that are thought to be the shell of another
supernova remnant, and one that is thought to be a pulsar wind nebula only a
few arcseconds in projection from Sgr A*. However, this leaves 20 features that
have not been reported previously. Based on the weakness of iron emission in
their spectra, we propose that most of them are non-thermal. One long, narrow
feature points toward Sgr A*, and so we propose that this feature is a jet of
synchrotron-emitting particles ejected from the supermassive black hole. For
the others, we show that their sizes (0.1-2 pc in length for D=8 kpc), X-ray
luminosities (between 10^32 and 10^34 erg/s, 2-8 keV), and spectra (power laws
with Gamma=1-3) are consistent with those of pulsar wind nebulae. Based on the
star formation rate at the Galactic center, we expect that ~20 pulsars have
formed in the last 300 kyr, and could be producing pulsar wind nebulae. Only
one of the 19 candidate pulsar wind nebulae is securely detected in an archival
radio image of the Galactic center; the remainder have upper limits
corresponding to L_R<la10^31 erg/s. These radio limits do not strongly

interstitials in spherical crystals. The strain fields of isolated
disclinations forced in by the spherical topology literally rip interstitials

disclinations to create small grain boundary scars. The fractionation is often
into three charge-neutral dislocations, although dislocation pairs can be
created as well. We use a powerful, freely available computer program to
explore interstitial fractionalization in some detail, for a variety of power
law pair potentials. We investigate the dependence on initial conditions and
the final state energies, and compare the position dependence of interstitial
energies with the predictions of continuum elastic theory on the sphere. The
theory predicts that, before fragmentation, interstitials are repelled from

Dispersive shock waves are difficult to study experimentally, and analytical
solutions to the equations that govern them have only been found in one
dimension (1D). By exploiting a well-known, but little appreciated,
correspondence between the behaviour of superfluids and nonlinear optical
materials, we demonstrate an all-optical experimental platform for studying the
dynamics of dispersive shock waves. This enables us to observe the propagation
and nonlinear response of dispersive shock waves, including the interaction of

placing new emphasis on the vital role played by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
stresses in transporting angular momentum. The apparent universality of
accretion-related outflow phenomena is a strong indicator that vertical
transport of angular momentum by large-scale MHD torques is important and may
even dominate radial transport by small-scale MHD turbulence. This leads to an
enhanced overall rate of angular momentum transport and allows accretion of
matter to proceed at an interesting rate. Furthermore, we argue that when
vertical transport is important, the radial structure of the accretion disk is
modified and this affects the disk emission spectrum. We present a simple model
demonstrating that energetic, magnetically-driven outflows give rise to a disk
spectrum that is dimmer and redder than a standard accretion disk accreting at
the same rate. We briefly discuss the implications of this key result for
accreting black holes in different astrophysical systems.

neutrino beams (the Neutrino Factory) and as the basis for a high-energy
lepton-antilepton collider (the Muon Collider). The Neutrino Factory is widely
believed to be the machine of choice for the search for leptonic CP violation
while the Muon Collider may prove to be the most practical route to multi-TeV
lepton-antilepton collisions. The baseline conceptual designs for each of these
facilities requires the phase-space compression (cooling) of the muon beams
prior to acceleration. The short muon lifetime makes it impossible to employ
traditional techniques to cool the beam while maintaining the muon-beam
intensity. Ionization cooling, a process in which the muon beam is passed
through a series of liquid-hydrogen absorbers followed by accelerating RF
cavities, is the technique proposed to cool the muon beam. The international
Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) collaboration will carry out a
systematic study of ionization cooling. The MICE experiment, which is under
construction at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, will begin to take data
late this year. The MICE cooling channel, the instrumentation and the
implementation at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory are described together
with the predicted performance of the channel and the measurements that will be

compared to that of superfluidity in non-dissipative phenomena. Applying the
linear-response theory to the reciprocal of the shear viscosity coefficient, we
relate these two types of superfluidity using the Kramers-Kronig relation. We
obtain a formula describing the influence of Bose statistics on the kinematic
shear viscosity in terms of the susceptibility. Compared to an ordinary liquid,
a liquid helium 4 above the lambda point has a 1/1000 times smaller shear
viscosity coefficient. Hence, although in the normal phase, it is already an
anomalous liquid under the strong influence of Bose statistics. The coherent
many-body wave function grows to an intermediate size between a macroscopic and
a microscopic one, not as a thermal fluctuation but as a thermal equilibrium
state. Beginning with bosons without the condensate, we make a perturbation
calculation of its susceptibility with respect to the repulsive interaction. We

a halo. While the pattern speeds observed are lower than those generally

In two dimensions four fermion interactions of the Gross-Neveu models have
dimensionless coupling constants. The symmetry properties of the four fermion
interaction terms and the relations among them are discussed. For Wilson
fermions chiral symmetry is explicitly broken and additional terms must be
included in the action. Chiral symmetry is restored up to cut-off effects by
tuning the bare mass and one of the couplings. The critical mass and the
symmetry restoring coupling are computed to second order in lattice
perturbation theory. This result is used in the 1-loop computation of the
renormalised couplings and the associated beta-functions. The renormalised
couplings are defined in terms of suitable boundary-to-boundary correlation
functions. In the computation the known first order coefficients of the
beta-functions are reproduced. One of the couplings is found to have a
vanishing beta-function. The calculation is repeated for the recently proposed
Schroedinger functional with exact chiral symmetry, i.e. Ginsparg-Wilson
fermions. The renormalisation pattern is found to be the same as in the Wilson
case. Using the regularisation dependent finite part of the renormalised
couplings, the ratio of the Lambda-parameters is computed.

constitute a further tool to discriminate among several relativistic theories
of gravity on the ground. After a review of the TT gauge, the transverse effect
of GWs arising by standard general relativity (called Einstein's GWs in this
paper) is reanalized with a different choice of coordinates. In the chosen
gauge test masses have an apparent motion in the direction of propagation of
the wave, while in the transverse direction they appear at rest. Of course,
this is only a gauge artefact. In fact, from careful investigation of this
particular gauge, it is shown that the tidal forces associated with GWs act
along the directions orthogonal to the direction of propagation of waves. In
the analysis it is also shown, in a heuristic way, that the transverse effect
of Einstein's GWs arises from the propagation of the waves at the speed of the
light, thus only massless GWs are purely transverse. But, because the physics
of gravitational waves has to be investigated by studing the tidal forces as
appearing in the geodesic deviation equation and directly in a laboratory
environment on Earth, an analysis of these tidal forces and of the transverse
effect in the frame of the local observer is also performed. After this, for a
further better understanding of the transverse effect, an example of a wave,
which arises from scalar tensor gravity, with both transverse and genuinely
longitudinal modes is given and discussed. In the example the connection
between the longitudinal component and the velocity of the wave will be
mathematical shown.
  At the end of this paper the review of the TT gauge is completed, recovering
the gauge invariance between the presented gauge and the TT one.

  We have varied the star formation efficiency, gas expulsion timescale and
strength of the external tidal field, obtaining a three-dimensional grid of
models which can be used to predict the evolution of individual star clusters
or whole star cluster systems by interpolating between our runs. The complete
data of these simulations is made available on the Internet.
  Our simulations show that cluster sizes, bound mass fraction and velocity
profile are strongly influenced by the details of the gas expulsion. Although
star clusters can survive star formation efficiencies as low as 10% if the
tidal field is weak and the gas is removed only slowly, our simulations
indicate that most star clusters are destroyed or suffer dramatic loss of stars
during the gas removal phase. Surviving clusters have typically expanded by a
factor 3 or 4 due to gas removal, implying that star clusters formed more
concentrated than as we see them today. Maximum expansion factors seen in our
runs are around 10. If gas is removed on timescales smaller than the initial
crossing time, star clusters acquire strongly radially anisotropic velocity
dispersions outside their half-mass radii. Observed velocity profiles of star
clusters can therefore be used as a constraint on the physics of cluster
formation.

evolution of the curvaton density after preheating. The primordial isocurvature
perturbation related to the curvaton is once converted into the fluctuation of
the number density of the preheat field through inhomogeneous preheating. Then
the evolution of the curvatons and the preheat field is controlled by the
preheat-field number density. The density of these fields decreases slightly
slower than the standard matter density which suggests that these fields will
grow with time. Finally, the preheat field decays to reheat the Universe
leaving behind the curvature perturbation. In our scenario the task of the
standard curvaton is not executed solely by the curvaton itself but is
partially shared with the preheat field. NO curvatons can be considered as the
hybrid version of the quintessential inflationary model.

Glauber dynamics of two different one-dimensional (1D) Ising models with spin
$\pm 1$. The first model is an Ising chain with antiferromagnetic exchange
interaction limited to nearest neighbors and subject to an oscillating magnetic
field. The system of master equations describing the time evolution of
sublattice magnetizations can easily be solved within a linear field
approximation and a long time limit. Resonant behavior of the magnetization as
a function of temperature (stochastic resonance) is found, at low frequency,
only when spins on opposite sublattices are uncompensated owing to different
gyromagnetic factors (i.e., in the presence of a ferrimagnetic short range
order). The second model is the axial next-nearest neighbor Ising (ANNNI)
chain, where an antiferromagnetic exchange between next-nearest neighbors (nnn)
is assumed to compete with a nearest-neighbor (nn) exchange interaction of
either sign. The long time response of the model to a weak, oscillating
magnetic field is investigated in the framework of a decoupling approximation
for three-spin correlation functions, which is required to close the system of
master equations. The calculation, within such an approximate theoretical
scheme, of the dynamic critical exponent z, defined as ${1/\tau} \approx ({1/
{\xi}})^z$ (where \tau is the longest relaxation time and \xi is the
correlation length of the chain), suggests that the T=0 single spin-flip
Glauber dynamics of the ANNNI chain is in a different universality class than
that of the unfrustrated Ising chain.

gene regulatory networks are characterized by scale-free topology with

dynamical from high-background effects affecting such centrally projected open
clusters. FSR1744, FSR89 and FSR31 are Gyr-class OCs located at Galactocentric
distances 4.0 - 5.6kpc. Compared to nearby OCs, they have small core and
limiting radii. With respect to the small number of OCs observed in the inner
Galaxy, the emerging scenario in the near-infrared favours disruption driven by
dynamical evolution rather than observational limitations associated with
absorption and/or high background levels. Internally, the main processes
associated with the dynamical evolution are, e.g. mass loss by stellar

mechanism of threshold duality. We also show that the introduced concept of
noise-guided evolution via the exploitation of threshold duality is not limited
to predator-prey cyclical interactions, but may apply to models of evolutionary
game theory as well, thus indicating its applicability in several different

crucial to understanding the dynamics and magnetism of the convection zone of
the sun. These measurements can be done by tracking granules.
  Tracking granules from ground-based observations, however, suffers from the
Earth's atmospheric turbulence, which induces image distortion. The focus of
this paper is to evaluate the influence of this noise on the maps of velocity
fields.
  We use the coherent structure tracking algorithm developed recently and apply
it to two independent series of images that contain the same solar signal.
  We first show that a k-\omega filtering of the times series of images is
highly recommended as a pre-processing to decrease the noise, while, in
contrast, using destretching should be avoided. We also demonstrate that the
lifetime of granules has a strong influence on the error bars of velocities and
that a threshold on the lifetime should be imposed to minimize errors. Finally,
although solar flow patterns are easily recognizable and image quality is very
good, it turns out that a time sampling of two images every 21 s is not
frequent enough, since image distortion still pollutes velocity fields at a 30%
level on the 2500 km scale, i.e. the scale on which granules start to behave
like passive scalars.
  The coherent structure tracking algorithm is a useful tool for noise control
on the measurement of surface horizontal solar velocity fields when at least
two independent series are available.

neutrino self-interactions, are known to induce collective flavor transitions
near the supernova core for theta_13 \neq 0. In scenarios with very shallow
electron density profiles, these transformations have been shown to couple with
ordinary matter effects, jointly producing spectral distortions both in normal
and inverted hierarchy. In this work we consider a complementary scenario,
characterized by higher electron density, as indicated by post-bounce
shock-wave simulations. In this case, early collective flavor transitions are
decoupled from later, ordinary matter effects. Moreover, such transitions
become more amenable to both numerical computations and analytical
interpretations in inverted hierarchy, while they basically vanish in normal
hierarchy. We numerically evolve the neutrino density matrix in the region
relevant for self-interaction effects. In the approximation of averaged
intersection angle between neutrino trajectories, our simulations neatly show
the collective phenomena of synchronization, bipolar oscillations, and spectral
split, recently discussed in the literature. In the more realistic (but
computationally demanding) case of non-averaged neutrino trajectories, our
simulations do not show new significant features, apart from the smearing of
``fine structures'' such as bipolar nutations. Our results seem to suggest
that, at least for non-shallow matter density profiles, averaging over neutrino
trajectories plays a minor role in the final outcome. In this case, the swap of
nu_e and nu_{\mu,\tau} spectra above a critical energy may represent an
unmistakable signature of the inverted hierarchy, especially for theta_{13}
small enough to render further matter effects irrelevant.

serial manipulators, the parallel manipulators can admit not only multiple

notion of aspect introduced for serial manipulators in [Borrel 86], and
redefined for parallel manipulators with only one inverse kinematic solution in

Jacobian matrices appear in the kinematic relations between the joint-rate and
the Cartesian-velocity vectors, which are called the ""inverse kinematics"" and
the ""direct kinematics"" matrices. The study of these matrices allow to
respectively define the parallel and the serial singularities. The notion of
working modes is introduced to separate inverse kinematic solutions. Thus, we
can find out domains of the workspace and the joint space exempt of
singularity. Application of this study is the moveability analysis in the
workspace of the manipulator as well as path-planing and control. This study is
illustrated in this paper with a RR-RRR planar parallel manipulator.

The level sets of a function $u:M\to\mathbb{R}$ evolve in such a way whenever u
solves an equation $u_{t}+F(Du, D^{2}u)=0$, for some real function F satisfying
a geometric condition. We show existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions
to this equation under the assumptions that M has nonnegative curvature, F is
continuous off Du=0, (degenerate) elliptic, and locally invariant by parallel
translation. We then prove that this approach is geometrically consistent,
hence it allows to define a generalized evolution of level sets by very
general, singular functions of their curvatures. For instance, these
assumptions on F are satisfied when F is given by the evolutions of level sets
by their mean curvature (even in arbitrary codimension) or by their positive
Gaussian curvature. We also prove that the generalized evolution is consistent
with the classical motion by the corresponding function of the curvature,
whenever the latter exists. When M is not of nonnegative curvature, the same
results hold if one additionally requires that F is uniformly continuous with
respect to D^2 u. Finally we give some counterexamples showing that several
well known properties of the evolutions in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are no longer true

quantitative studies for models of the star/planet magnetic interactions. To
this end, we used ESPaDOnS, the new generation spectropolarimeter at the

signatures in the line profiles of HD 189733 in 2006 June and August. Zeeman
signatures in the line profiles of HD 189733 are clearly detected in all
spectra, demonstrating that a field is indeed present at the surface of the
star. The Zeeman signatures are not modulated with the planet's orbital period
but apparently vary with the stellar rotation cycle. The reconstructed
large-scale magnetic field, whose strength reaches a few tens of G, is
significantly more complex than that of the Sun; it involves in particular a
significant toroidal component and contributions from magnetic multipoles of
order up to 5. The CaII H & K lines clearly feature core emission, whose

that the photosphere and magnetic field of HD 189733 are sheared by a

conduct high-energy particles from the flare. In the case of relatively short
magnetic loops, chromospheric evaporation populates the loop interior with
ionized gas relatively rapidly, expediting the scattering of remaining trapped
high-energy electrons into the magnetic loss cone and their rapid precipitation
into the chromosphere. This increases both the intensity and suddenness of the
chromospheric heating, satisfying the basic conditions for an acoustic emission

wide range of observed spectral states. One of the main states is significantly
harder than the others, peaking at ~ 20 keV, with only a weak low-energy
component. Due to the enigmatic nature of this object, hidden inside the strong
stellar wind of its Wolf-Rayet companion, it has remained unclear whether this
state represents an intrinsic hard state, with truncation of the inner disc, or
whether it is just a result of increased local absorption. We study the X-ray
light curves from RXTE/ASM and CGRO/BATSE in terms of distributions and
correlations of flux and hardness and find several signs of a bimodal behaviour
of the accretion flow that are not likely to be the result of increased
absorption in a surrounding medium. Using INTEGRAL observations, we model the
broad-band spectrum of Cyg X-3 in its apparent hard state. We find that it can
be well described by a model of a hard state with a truncated disc, despite the
low cut-off energy, if the accreted power is supplied to the electrons in the
inner flow in the form of acceleration rather than thermal heating, resulting
in a hybrid electron distribution and a spectrum with a significant
contribution from non-thermal Comptonization, usually observed only in soft
states. The high luminosity of this non-thermal hard state implies that either
the transition takes place at significantly higher L/Ledd than in the usual
advection models, or the mass of the compact object is > 20 Msun, possibly
making it the most massive black hole observed in an X-ray binary in our Galaxy
so far. We find that an absorption model as well as a model of almost pure
Compton reflection also fit the data well, but both have difficulties
explaining other results, in particular the radio/X-ray correlation.

microscopic modeling of the electronic density response. This is accomplished
starting from the insulating state via the underdoped strange metallic to the
more conventional metallic state by consecutive orbital selective
incompressibility-compressibility transitions in terms of strict sum rules for
the charge response. The approach proposed in this work for the $n$-doped
HTSC's modifies the modeling recently applied to the $p$-doped compounds and
expresses an electron-hole asymmetry introduced by doping. A qualitative
physical picture consistent with our modeling of the electronic state in the
cuprates is given in which a sufficiently broad set of orbital degrees of
freedom, i.e. Cu3d/$4s$ and O$2p$ is essential. Within the framework of linear
response theory we calculate full phonon dispersion curves in the different
phases. In particular, the strongly doping dependent anomalous high-frequency
oxygen bond-stretching modes (OBSM) found experimentally in the $p$-doped
HTSC's and also recently for $n$-doped Nd$_{1.85}$Ce$_{0.15}$CuO$_{4}$ are
investigated and compared with experimental results from inelastic neutron
scattering and inelastic x-ray scattering, respectively. We calculate an
anticrossing scenario for the OBSM in $n$-doped NdCuO which is absent in the
case of $p$-doped LaCuO and relate it to the different crystal structure.
Phonon-induced electronic charge redistributions of the anomalous OBSM due to
nonlocal electron-phonon interaction effects of charge-fluctuation type giving
reason to dynamic stripes are also studied.

investigated by means of broad-band dielectric, time-domain terahertz (THz) and
Fourier-transform infrared (IR) spectroscopy in the frequency range 100 Hz - 90
THz at temperatures 100 - 490 K, the THz and IR spectra were studied from 20 to
900K. Diffused and strongly temperature dependent peak in the complex
permittivity is caused by a dielectric relaxation due to the dynamics of polar
clusters. The relaxation appears below Burns temperature T_d in the THz range,
slows down on cooling through the microwave and MHz range and anomalously
broadens. The shortest and longest relaxation times of the distribution of
relaxation times follow Arrhenius and Vogel-Fulcher law, respectively. The
degree of B-site order has only a small influence on the parameters of the
dielectric relaxation and almost no influence on the phonon parameters. Below
T_m ~ 180K, the distribution of relaxation frequencies becomes broader than our
experimental spectral range and frequency independent dielectric losses develop
below 100 GHz in the spectra. Although the macroscopic crystal structure is
cubic, IR spectra give evidence about the lower local symmetry which can be
assigned to the presence of polar clusters below T_d. Infrared spectra above
T_d still reveal more modes than predicted by selection rules in the
paraelectric phase of the Fm-3m space group so that we suggest selection rules
which take into account chemical inhomogeneity in the beta''-perovskite
sublattice.

magnetic moments. We assume that the main part of neutrino masses and mixings
arise through GUT scale operators. We further assume that additional discrete
symmetries make the neutrino mixing bi-maximal. Quantum gravitational (Planck
scale) effects lead to an effective $SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)$ invariant
dimension-5 Lagrangian involving neutrino and Higgs fields, which gives rise to
additional terms in neutrino mass matrix. These additional terms can be
considered to be perturbation of the GUT scale bi-maximal neutrino mass matrix.
We assume that the gravitational interaction is flavour blind and we study the
neutrino mixings and magnetic moments due to the physics above the GUT scale.

single nucleosome arrays reconstituted on tandem repeats of 5S positioning
sequences. Regular arrays are extremely resilient and can reversibly
accommodate a large amount of supercoiling without much change in length. This
behavior is quantitatively described by a molecular model of the chromatin 3-D
architecture. In this model, we assume the existence of a dynamic equilibrium
between three conformations of the nucleosome, which are determined by the
crossing status of the entry/exit DNAs (positive, null or negative). Torsional
strain, in displacing that equilibrium, extensively reorganizes the fiber
architecture. The model explains a number of long-standing topological
questions regarding DNA in chromatin, and may provide the ground to better
understand the dynamic binding of most chromatin-associated proteins.

describe the Inverse Scattering Transform for the Camassa-Holm hierarchy as a
Generalised Fourier transform. The main result of this work is the derivation
of the completeness relation for the squared solutions of the Camassa-Holm
spectral problem. We show that all the fundamental properties of the
Camassa-Holm equation such as the integrals of motion, the description of the
equations of the whole hierarchy and their Hamiltonian structures can be
naturally expressed making use of the completeness relation and the recursion
operator, whose eigenfunctions are the squared solutions.
