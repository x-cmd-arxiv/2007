each other is an important ingredient in galaxy formation models. Accurate
estimates of merging timescales are required for predictions of astrophysical
quantities such as black hole binary merger rates, the build-up of stellar mass
in central galaxies, and the statistical properties of satellite galaxies
within dark matter halos. In this paper, we study the merging timescales of
extended dark matter halos using N-body simulations. We compare these results
to standard estimates based on the Chandrasekhar theory of dynamical friction.
We find that these standard predictions for merging timescales, which are often
used in semi-analytic galaxy formation models, are systematically shorter than
those found in simulations. The discrepancy is approximately a factor of 1.7
for $M_sat/M_host \approx 0.1$ and becomes larger for more disparate
satellite-to-host mass ratios, reaching a factor of $\sim 3.3$ for
$M_sat/M_host\approx 0.01$. Based on our simulations, we propose a new, easily
implementable fitting formula that accurately predicts the timescale for an
extended satellite to sink from the virial radius of a host halo down to the
halo's center for a wide range of $M_sat/M_host$ and orbits. Including a
central bulge in each galaxy changes the merging timescale by $\la 10%$. To
highlight one concrete application of our results, we show that merging
timescales often used in the literature overestimate the growth of stellar mass
by satellite accretion by $\approx 40 %$, with the extra mass gained in low
mass ratio mergers.

representation of bound states with a fixed number of constituents and, in the
heavy quark limit, form factors of currents satisfy covariance and Isgur-Wise
scaling. We compute the Light Cone Distribution Amplitudes of $B$ mesons
$\phi_{\pm}^B(\omega)$ as well as the Shape Function $S(\omega)$, that enters
in the decay $B \to X_s \gamma$, that are also covariant in this class of
models. The LCDA and the SF are related through the quark model wave function.
The former satisfy, in the limit of vanishing constituent light quark mass, the
integral relation given by QCD in the valence sector of Fock space. Using a
gaussian wave function, the obtained $S(\omega)$ is identical to the so-called
Roman Shape Function. From the parameters for the latter that fit the $B \to
X_s\gamma$ spectrum we predict the behaviour of $\phi_{\pm}^B(\omega)$. We
discuss the important role played by the constituent light quark mass. In
particular, although $\phi_-^B(0) \not= 0$ for vanishing light quark mass, a
non-vanishing mass implies the unfamiliar result $\phi_-^B (0) = 0$. Moreover,
we incorporate the short distance behaviour of QCD to $\phi_+^B (\omega)$,
which has sizeable effects at large $\omega$. We obtain the values for the
parameters $\bar{\Lambda} \cong 0.35$ GeV and $\lambda_B^{-1} \cong 1.43$
GeV$^{-1}$. We compare with other theoretical approaches and illustrate the
great variety of models found in the literature for the functions $\phi_{\pm}^B
(\omega)$; hence the necessity of imposing further constraints as in the
present paper. We briefly review also the different phenomena that are
sensitive to the LCDA.

bailout embedding maps of the base flow which is represented by 2-d area
preserving maps. The phase diagram of the embedded map is rich and interesting
both in the aerosol regime, where the density of the particle is larger than
that of the base flow, as well as the bubble regime, where the particle density
is less than that of the base flow. The embedding map shows three types of
dynamic behaviour, periodic orbits, chaotic structures and mixed regions. Thus,
the embedding map can target periodic orbits as well as chaotic structures in
both the aerosol and bubble regimes at certain values of the dissipation
parameter. The bifurcation diagram of the 4-d map is useful for the
identification of regimes where such structures can be found. An attractor
merging and widening crisis is seen for a special region for the aerosols. At
the crisis, two period-10 attractors merge and widen simultaneously into a
single chaotic attractor. Crisis induced intermittency is seen at some points
in the phase diagram. The characteristic times before bursts at the crisis show
power law behaviour as functions of the dissipation parameter. Although the
bifurcation diagram for the bubbles looks similar to that of aerosols, no such
crisis regime is seen for the bubbles. Our results can have implications for
the dynamics of impurities in diverse application contexts.

we compare the evolution of the hot bubble's velocity with the velocity
evolution calculated from the buoyant and drag accelerations. We found
surprisingly small vertical velocities of the hot gas, from which we estimated
the drag coefficient to be ten for the non-magnetic simulation. Although we
found little buoyant motion of the hot gas during the remnant's lifetime, we
found rapid vertical motion of the associated cool dense gas near the end of
the remnants life. This motion deformed the remnant into a mushroom cloud
structure similar to those found in previous simulations. The simulation in
which we have a 4 micro-Gauss magnetic field parallel to the galactic mid-plane
shows a dramatically elongated bubble parallel to the magnetic field. The
magnetic field pins the supernova remnant preventing it from rising. In the
simulation with the 4 micro-Gauss magnetic field perpendicular to the midplane
the hot bubble rises more, indicating that having the magnetic field in the
same direction as the gravitational force enhances the rise of the bubble.

magnetosphere (EHM) which is defined as the the large scale poloidal magnetic
flux that threads the event horizon of a black hole (This is distinct from the
poloidal magnetic flux that threads the equatorial plane of the ergosphere,
which forms the ergospheric disk magnetosphere). Standard MHD theoretical
treatments of Poynting jets in the EHM are predicated on the assumption that
the plasma comprising the boundaries of the EHM plays no role in producing the
Poynting flux. The energy flux is electrodynamic in origin and it is
essentially conserved from the horizon to infinity, this is known as the
Blandford-Znajek (B-Z) mechanism. To the contrary, within the 3-D simulations,
the lateral boundaries are strong pistons for MHD waves and actually inject
prodigious quantities of Poynting flux into the EHM. At high black hole spin
rates, strong sources of Poynting flux adjacent to the EHM from the ergospheric
disk will actually diffuse to higher latitudes and swamp any putative B-Z
effects. This is in contrast to lower spin rates, which are characterized by
much lower output powers and modest amounts of Poynting flux are injected into
the EHM from the accretion disk corona.

Autler-Townes peaks for modest field strengths. Ab initio solutions of the
time-dependent Schroedinger equation show a pronounced shift and broadening of
the left Autler-Townes peak as the field strength is increased. The right peak
remains rather narrow and shifts less. This result is analyzed and explained
with the help of exact AC Stark shifts and ionization rates obtained from
Floquet theory. Finally, it is demonstrated that in the case of finite pulses

attractive interactions whose range is much smaller than the particle size.
When this is the case and the interaction is spherical, systems obey a
generalized law of correspondent states (GLCS), first proposed by Noro and
Frenkel [ J.Chem.Phys. 113, 2941 (2000) ]. The thermodynamic properties become
insensitive to the details of the potential, depending only on the value of the
second virial coefficient B_2 and the density $\rho$. The GLCS does not
generically hold for the case of non-spherical potentials. In this Letter we
suggest that when particles interact via short-ranged small-angular amplitude
patchy interactions (so that the condition of only one bond per patch is
fulfilled) it is still possible to generalize the GLCS close to the liquid-gas
critical point. Keywords: Colloids, Second Virial Coefficient, Proteins
interactions, Short-ranged attractive attractions.

arithmetic mean ideals of B(H) introduced by Dykema, Figiel, Weiss, and
Wodzicki. We prove: the lattices of all principal ideals, of arithmetic mean or
arithmetic mean at infinity stable principal ideals or of principal ideals with
a generator that satisfies the Delta_1/2 condition, are all both upper and
lower dense in the lattice of general ideals. That is, between any ideal and an
ideal (nested above or below respectively) in one of these sublattices, lies
another ideal in that sublattice. Among the applications: a principal ideal I
is am-stable (I = I_a) if and only if any of its first order arithmetic mean
ideals are am-stable if and only if the ideal satisfies the first order
equality cancellation property: J_a = I_a implies J = I. We show that this
cancellation property can fail even for am-stable countably generated ideals.
Similar results hold for arithmetic mean at infinity ideals. Inclusion
cancellations do not hold in general even for principal ideals, but for every
ideal I there is a largest ideal I^ for which J_a contains I_a implies that J
contains I^. When I is principal, I^ too is principal. We show that I=I^ is a
strictly stronger property than am-stability. For example, for I the p < 1
power of the principal ideal J generated by diag {1/n}, I^ is the q power of J
where 1/p-1/q = 1.

alumina (Al2O3) as a dust condensate. The case for including Al2O3 is
strengthened further by the presence of the AlO radical, a potentially

porous alumina manifests itself through a broadening of the 9.7 micron silicate

the dark matter distribution on large scales and is insensitive to monotonic
biasing. Two of its characteristics, namely its length and differential length,
are analyzed for Gaussian random fields. Its differential length per unit
normalized density contrast scales like the PDF of the underlying density
contrast times the total length times a quadratic Edgeworth correction
involving the square of the spectral parameter. The total length scales like
the inverse square smoothing length, with a scaling factor given by 0.21 (5.28+
n) where n is the power index of the underlying field. This dependency implies
that the total length can be used to constrain the shape of the underlying
power spectrum, hence the cosmology. Possible applications of the skeleton to
galaxy formation and cosmology are discussed. As an illustration, the
orientation of the spin of dark halos and the orientation of the flow near the
skeleton is computed for dark matter simulations. The flow is laminar along the
filaments, while spins of dark halos within 500 kpc of the skeleton are
preferentially orthogonal to the direction of the flow at a level of 25%.

We show that a stringy instanton which wraps an unoccupied node of the quiver,

We find evidence for the presence of three distinct globular cluster
subpopulations associated with this galaxy: a centrally concentrated young
population (~ 0.4 Gyr), an intermediate age population (~ 1 Gyr) and an old,
metal-poor population similar to that seen around normal galaxies. The g-I
color distribution of the clusters is bimodal with peaks at 0.85 and 1.35. The
redder peak at g-I=1.35 is consistent with the predicted color for an old
metal-poor population. The clusters associated with the peak at g-I=0.85 are
centrally concentrated and interpreted as a younger and more metal-rich
population. We suggest that these clusters have an age of ~ 0.4 Gyr and solar
metallicity based on a comparison with population synthesis models. The
luminosity function of these ""blue"" clusters is well represented by a power
law. Interestingly, the brightest shell associated with the galaxy harbors some
of the youngest clusters observed. This seems to indicate that the same merger
event was responsible for the formation of both the shells and the young
clusters. The red part of the color distribution contains several very bright
clusters, which are not expected for an old, metal-poor population.
Furthermore, the luminosity function of the ""red"" GCs cannot be fit well by
either a single gaussian or a single power law. A composite (gaussian + power
law) fit to the LF of the red clusters yields both a low rms and very plausible
properties for an old population plus an intermediate-age population of GCs.
Hence, we suggest that the red clusters in AM 0139-655 consist of two distinct
GC subpopulations, one being an old, metal-poor population as seen in normal
galaxies and one having formed during a recent dissipative galaxy merger.

Strong attraction between the atoms leads to the formation of local pairs with
a reduced tunneling rate. The interpretation in terms of pair formation is
supported by a measurement of the number of doubly occupied lattice sites. This
quantity also allows us to determine the temperature of the non-interacting gas

non-LTE radiative transfer calculations with merger-driven models of z~6 quasar
formation that arise naturally in LCDM cosmological simulations. We consider
four model quasars formed in 10^12-10^13 M_sun halos from different merging
histories. Our main results follow. Owing to massive starbursts and funneling
of dense gas into the nuclear regions of merging galaxies, the CO is highly
excited and the flux density peaks between J=5-8. The CO morphology of z~6
quasars often exhibits multiple emission peaks which arise from H2
concentrations which have not yet fully coalesced. Quasars at z~6 display a
large range of sightline dependent line widths such that the lines are
narrowest when the rotating H2 gas associated with the quasar is viewed face-on
(when L_B is largest), and broadest when the gas is seen edge-on (when L_B is
lowest). Thus for all models selection effects exist such that quasars selected
for optical luminosity are preferentially face-on which may result in detected
CO line widths narrower than the median. The sightline averaged line width is
reflective of the circular velocity (V_c) of the host halo, and ranges from
sigma~300-650 km/s. For optically selected QSOs, 10-25% (halo-mass dependant)
of sightlines have narrow line widths compatible with the sole CO detection at
z>6, J1148+5251. When accounting for both the temporal evolution of CO line
widths, as well as the redshift evolution of halo V_c, these models
self-consistently account for the CO line widths of both z~2 sub-mm galaxies
and QSO's. Finally, the dynamical mass derived from the sightline averaged line
widths provides a good estimate of the total mass, and allows for a stellar
bulge and SMBH consistent with the local M_BH-M_bulge relation. [abridged]

thousands of parsecs from the center of the host galaxy. Recent multiwavelength
surveys have shown that radio-loudness is more common in low-luminosity AGN
than in higher luminosity Seyfert galaxies or quasars. These low-luminosity AGN
have small enough accretion rates that they are most likely accreting via a
geometrically thick and radiatively inefficient accretion flow. In contrast,
X-ray spectroscopic observations of three higher luminosity broad-line radio
galaxies (3C 120, 4C+74.26 and PG 1425+267) have found evidence for an
untruncated thin disk extending very close to the black hole. These tentative
detections indicate that, for this class of radio-loud AGN, the accretion
geometry is very similar to their radio-quiet counterparts. These observations
suggest that there are three conditions to jet formation that must be
satisfied: the presence of a rapidly spinning black hole, an accretion flow
with a large H/r ratio, and a favorable magnetic field geometry.

collisional magnetized plasmas. A cascade model is presented, based on the
assumptions of local nonlinear energy transfer in wavenumber space, critical
balance between linear propagation and nonlinear interaction times, and the
applicability of linear dissipation rates for the nonlinearly turbulent plasma.
The model follows the nonlinear cascade of energy from the driving scale in the
MHD regime, through the transition at the ion Larmor radius into the kinetic
Alfven wave regime, in which the turbulence is dissipated by kinetic processes.
The turbulent fluctuations remain at frequencies below the ion cyclotron
frequency due to the strong anisotropy of the turbulent fluctuations,
k_parallel << k_perp (implied by critical balance). In this limit, the
turbulence is optimally described by gyrokinetics; it is shown that the
gyrokinetic approximation is well satisfied for typical slow solar wind
parameters. Wave phase velocity measurements are consistent with a kinetic
Alfven wave cascade and not the onset of ion cyclotron damping. The conditions
under which the gyrokinetic cascade reaches the ion cyclotron frequency are
established. Cascade model solutions imply that collisionless damping provides
a natural explanation for the observed range of spectral indices in the
dissipation range of the solar wind. The dissipation range spectrum is
predicted to be an exponential fall off; the power-law behavior apparent in
observations may be an artifact of limited instrumental sensitivity. The
cascade model is motivated by a programme of gyrokinetic simulations of
turbulence and particle heating in the solar wind.

complete transitions have been seen in this system by Wilms et al. (2001). If

scattering is treated within the Born approximation. In this regime it is
important to include boson exchange for the electron-impurity scattering which
provides a `step down' in energy for the electrons and allows for long
lifetimes. This many-body effect produces qualitatively different results,
namely the presence of peaks in the FT-LDOS which are mirrors of the
quasiparticle interference peaks which occur at bias energies smaller than ~
Omega_0. The experimental observation of these quasiparticle mirages would be
an important step forward in elucidating the role of many-body effects in
FT-LDOS measurements.

transport processes, for example propagation of heat or diffusion of matter
through a medium. However, in many practical cases the medium is highly
irregular due to defects, impurities, fluctuations etc., and it is natural to
model this as random environment. In the random walks context, such models are
referred to as Random Walks in Random Environments (RWRE). This is a relatively
new chapter in applied probability and physics of disordered systems, initiated
in the 1970s. Early interest was motivated by some problems in biology,
crystallography and metal physics, but later applications have spread through
numerous areas. After 30 years of extensive work, RWRE remain a very active
area of research, which has already led to many surprising discoveries. The
goal of this article is to give a brief introduction to the beautiful area of
RWRE. The principal model to be discussed is a random walk with
nearest-neighbor jumps in independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) random
environment in one dimension, although we shall also comment on some extensions
and generalizations. The focus is on rigorous results; however, heuristics is
used freely to motivate the ideas and explain the approaches and proofs. In a
few cases, sketches of the proofs have been included, which should help the
reader to appreciate the flavor of results and methods.

the statistical error and the field-to-field variation. We find that the
apparent Lya LF shows no significant evolution between z=3.1 and 5.7 within
factors of 1.8 and 2.7 in L* and phi*, respectively. On the other hand, the UV
LF of LAEs increases from z=3.1 to 5.7, indicating that galaxies with Lya

activities from our spectra combined with VLA, Spitzer, and XMM-Newton data.
Among the photometrically selected LAEs at z=3.1 and 3.7, only ~1 % show AGN

galaxies, suggesting lower extinction and/or younger stellar populations. Our
stacking analyses provide upper limits to the radio luminosity and the
f(HeII)/f(Lya) line fraction, and constrain the hidden star formation

reconstruct the Higgs potential. We consider 3H-production in the International
Linear Collider (ILC) both in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM)
and in the general Two-Higgs-doublet Model (2HDM). We compute the total
cross-section for the various 3H final states, such as H^+ H^- h^0, H^0 A^0
h^0, etc. and compare with the more traditional double Higgs (2H) boson
production processes. While the cross-sections for the 2H final states lie
within the same order of magnitude in both the MSSM and 2HDM, we find that for
the 3H states the maximum 2HDM cross-sections, being of order 0.1 pb, are much
larger than the MSSM ones which in most cases are of order 10^{-6} pb or less.
Actually, the 3H processes could be the dominant mechanism for Higgs boson
production in the 2HDM. Ultimately the origin of the remarkable enhancement of
the 3H channels in the 2HDM case (for both type I and type II models)
originates in the structure of the trilinear Higgs boson couplings. The
extremely clean environment of the ILC should allow a relatively comfortable
tagging of the three Higgs boson events. In view of the fact that the MSSM
contribution is negligible, these events should manifest themselves mainly in
the form of 6 heavy-quark jet final states. Some of these signatures could be
spectacular, and in case of being detected would constitute strong evidence of
an extended Higgs sector of non-supersymmetric origin.

general notions of sequential computational strategies and wittingly consistent
non-deterministic strategies introduced by the author in the seventies.
Although these notions of strategies are old, the definition of the fully
abstract models is new, in that it is given level-by-level in the finite type
hierarchy. To prove full abstraction and non-dcpo domain theoretic properties
of these models, a theory of computational strategies is developed. This is
also an alternative and, in a sense, an analogue to the later game strategy
semantics approaches of Abramsky, Jagadeesan, and Malacaria; Hyland and Ong;
and Nickau. In both cases of PCF and PCF^+ there are definable universal
(surjective) functionals from numerical functions to any given type,
respectively, which also makes each of these models unique up to isomorphism.
Although such models are non-omega-complete and therefore not continuous in the
traditional terminology, they are also proved to be sequentially complete (a
weakened form of omega-completeness), ""naturally"" continuous (with respect to
existing directed ""pointwise"", or ""natural"" lubs) and also ""naturally""
omega-algebraic and ""naturally"" bounded complete -- appropriate generalisation
of the ordinary notions of domain theory to the case of non-dcpos.

obtained from a single one via translations, imposes a serious constraint on
the solution of the 2-Toda hierarchy. Our theorem leads to the discovery of a

applications that was originally developed at IRCCyN in 2000-2001 to meet the
advantages of both serial 3-axis machines (regular workspace and homogeneous

and stiffness). This machine has three fixed parallel linear joints that are
mounted orthogonally. The geometric parameters of the Orthoglide were defined
as function of the size of a prescribed cubic Cartesian workspace that is free
of singularities and internal collision. The interesting features of the
Orthoglide are a regular Cartesian workspace shape, uniform performances in all
directions and good compactness. In this paper, a new method is proposed to
analyze the stiffness of overconstrained Delta-type manipulators, such as the
Orthoglide. The Orthoglide is then benchmarked according to geometric,

no enlarged or extended symmetry algebra. The generators of fusion are
countably infinite in number but the ensuing fusion rules are quasi-rational in
the sense that the fusion of a finite number of representations decomposes into
a finite direct sum of representations. The fusion rules are commutative,
associative and exhibit an sl(2) structure but require so-called Kac
representations which are reducible yet indecomposable representations of rank
1. In particular, the identity of the fundamental fusion algebra is in general
a reducible yet indecomposable Kac representation of rank 1. We make detailed
comparisons of our fusion rules with the results of Gaberdiel and Kausch for
p=1 and with Eberle and Flohr for (p,p')=(2,5) corresponding to the logarithmic
Yang-Lee model. In the latter case, we confirm the appearance of indecomposable
representations of rank 3. We also find that closure of a fundamental fusion
algebra is achieved without the introduction of indecomposable representations
of rank higher than 3. The conjectured fusion rules are supported, within our
lattice approach, by extensive numerical studies of the associated integrable
lattice models. Details of our lattice findings and numerical results will be
presented elsewhere. The agreement of our fusion rules with the previous fusion
rules lends considerable support for the identification of the logarithmic
minimal models LM(p,p') with the augmented c_{p,p'} (minimal) models defined
algebraically.

jets are thus plausibly produced by a direct coupling between an interior FDHD
and a coronal MDHD, interfaced by magnetic helicity transport through their

interests in the distinct quantum solvation effect, and the characterizations
of adiabatic/nonadiabatic and Markovian/non-Markovian rate processes. We first
present a full account for the quantum solvation effect on the electron
transfer in Debye solvents, addressed previously in J. Theore. & Comput. Chem.
{\bf 5}, 685 (2006). Distinct reaction mechanisms, including the quantum
solvation-induced transitions from barrier-crossing to tunneling, and from
barrierless to quantum barrier-crossing rate processes, are shown in the fast
modulation or low viscosity regime. This regime is also found in favor of
nonadiabatic rate processes. We further propose to use Kubo's motional
narrowing line shape function to describe the Markovian character of the
reaction. It is found that a non-Markovian rate process is most likely to occur
in a symmetric system in the fast modulation regime, where the electron
transfer is dominant by tunneling due to the Fermi resonance.
