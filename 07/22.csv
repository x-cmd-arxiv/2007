  coherent-squeezed interferometer","5 pages, 2 figures",,,,"gr-qc",,"  Gravitational waves reaching a Michelson interferometer are expected to
induce a very small change in the length of its arms causing a phase shift
between them, but it is very difficult to observe the extremely small phase
shift signals produced. In the present letter we show that the gravitational
waves signal could be amplified by orders of magnitude by using very special
conditions for a coherent-squeezed Michelson interferometer in which the
coherent state enters one port of the interferometer and the squeezed vacuum
enters in the other port. We treat the case where without the gravitational
induced phase shift the very strong coherent state goes out of one output port
while the squeezed vacuum goes out the other output port (the ``dark'' port).
While the phase shift produced by the gravitation waves does not give any
significant change in the strong coherent output, the light intensity in the
``dark'' port is amplified with decreased fluctuations as the squeezing
increases.

assume that there is a central galaxy in every sufficiently massive halo, and
that this central galaxy is very different from all the others in the halo. The
halo model decomposition makes the remarkable prediction that the mean
luminosity of the non-central galaxies in a halo should be almost independent
of halo mass: the predicted increase is about 20% while the halo mass increases
by a factor of more than 20. In contrast, the luminosity of the central object
is predicted to increase approximately linearly with halo mass at low to
intermediate masses, and logarithmically at high masses. We show that this
weak, almost non-existent mass-dependence of the satellites is in excellent
agreement with the satellite population in group catalogs constructed by two
different collaborations. This is remarkable, because the halo model prediction
was made without ever identifying groups and clusters. The halo model also
predicts that the number of satellites in a halo is drawn from a Poisson
distribution with mean which depends on halo mass. This, combined with the weak
dependence of satellite luminosity on halo mass, suggests that the Scott
effect, such that the luminosities of very bright galaxies are merely the
statistically extreme values of a general luminosity distribution, may better
apply to the most luminous satellite galaxy in a halo than to BCGs. If galaxies
are identified with halo substructure at the present time, then central
galaxies should be about 4 times more massive than satellite galaxies of the
same luminosity, whereas the differences between the stellar M/L ratios should
be smaller. Therefore, a comparison of the weak lensing signal from central and
satellite galaxies should provide useful constraints. [abridged]

sampling high dimensional distributions defined on graphs. Of special interest
is the behavior of Gibbs sampling on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph
G(n,d/n). While the average degree in G(n,d/n) is d(1-o(1)), it contains many
nodes of degree of order $\log n / \log \log n$.
  The existence of nodes of almost logarithmic degrees implies that for many
natural distributions defined on G(n,p) such as uniform coloring or the Ising
model, the mixing time of Gibbs sampling is at least $n^{1 + \Omega(1 / \log
\log n)}$. High degree nodes pose a technical challenge in proving polynomial
time mixing of the dynamics for many models including coloring.
  In this work consider sampling q-colorings and show that for every $d <
\infty$ there exists $q(d) < \infty$ such that for all $q \geq q(d)$ the mixing
time of Gibbs sampling on G(n,d/n) is polynomial in $n$ with high probability.
Our results are the first polynomial time mixing results proven for the
coloring model on G(n,d/n) for d > 1 where the number of colors does not depend
on n. They extend to much more general families of graphs which are sparse in
some average sense and to much more general interactions. The results also
generalize to the hard-core model at low fugacity and to general models of soft
constraints at high temperatures.

binding lattice Hamiltonian, coupled to two electron reservoirs. First,
Buttiker's model of incorporating inelastic scattering, hence decoherence and
dissipation, has been extended by connecting each site of the open ring to
one-dimensional leads for uniform dephasing in the ring threaded by magnetic
flux. We show with this extension conductance remains symmetric under flux
reversal, and Aharonov-Bohm oscillations with changing magnetic flux reduce to
zero as a function of the decoherence parameter, thus indicating dephasing in
the ring. This extension enables us to find local chemical potential profiles
of the ring sites with changing magnetic flux and the decoherence parameter
analogously to the four probe measurement. The local electrochemical potential
oscillates in the ring sites because of quantum-interference effects. It
predicts that measured four-point resistance also fluctuates and even can be
negative. Then we point out the role of the closed ring's electronic
eigenstates in the persistent current around Fano antiresonances of an
asymmetric open ring for both ideal leads and tunnel barriers. Determining the
real eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian of the ring, we
show that there exist discrete bound states in the continuum of scattering
states for the asymmetric ring even in the absence of magnetic flux. Our
approach involves quantum Langevin equations and non-equilibrium Green's
functions.

observations of filament chirality for the sample of 255 filaments, and
secondly our new simulations of the large-scale surface magnetic field. Based
on a flux-transport model, these will be used as the lower boundary condition
for the future 3D coronal simulations. Our technique differs significantly from
those of other authors, where the coronal field is either assumed to be purely
potential, or has to be reset back to potential every 27 days in order that the
photospheric field remain accurate. In our case we ensure accuracy by the
insertion of newly-emerging bipolar active regions, based on observed
photospheric synoptic magnetograms. The large-scale surface field is shown to
remain accurate over the 6-month period, without any resetting. This new

computing Grid management, monitoring and optimization. The management is
proposed to be based on the notion of utility. Grid optimization is considered
to be application-oriented. A generic Grid simulator is proposed as an
optimization tool for Grid structure and functionality.

show a complex behavior as a function of temperature, applied field and sample
history. In base to a simple model it is shown that this behavior is due to an
interplay between the superconductor magnetization temperature dependence, the
ferromagnet magnetization time dependence, and the stray fields of both
materials. It is also shown that the magnetic state of the Co layers is
modified by the Nb superconducting response, implying that the problem of a
superconductor/ferromagnetic heterogeneous sample has to be solved in a
self-consistent manner.

theory coupled to fundamental Higgs fields with complex masses. We examine the
dynamics of the domain wall loops by using the moduli approximation and find a
phase rotation induces a repulsive force which can be understood as a Noether
charge of Q-solitons. Non-Abelian gauge theory allows different types of loops
which can be deformed to each other by changing a modulus. This admits the
moduli geometry like a sandglass made by gluing the tips of the two
cigar-(cone-)like metrics of a single triangle loop. We conclude that the sizes
of all loops tend to grow for a late time in general models with complex Higgs
masses, while the sizes are stabilized at some values once triplet masses are
introduced for the Higgs fields. We also show that the stationary motion on the
moduli space of the domain wall webs represents 1/4 BPS Q-webs of walls.

evaluated on the tangent bundle of the Hilbert schemes of points on a
non-compact simply-connected surface.
  As a corollary, we deduce a closed formula for the Chern character of the
tangent bundles of these Hilbert schemes.
  We also give a closed formula for the multiplicative characteristic classes
of the tautological bundles associated to a line bundle on the surface.
  We finally remark which implications the results here have for the Hilbert
schemes of points of an arbitrary surface.

  lattices of operator ideals, and an infinite Schur-Horn majorization theorem","33 pages",,,,"math.FA math.OA",,"  The work of Dykema, Figiel, Weiss, and Wodzicki on the structure of
commutators showed that arithmetic means play an important role in the study of
operator ideals, and we explored their role in a multipaper project which we
survey in this article. We start by presenting the notions of arithmetic mean
ideals and arithmetic mean at infinity ideals. Then we explore their
connections with commutator spaces, traces, elementary operators, lattice and
sublattice structure of ideals, arithmetic mean ideal cancellation properties
of first and second order, and softness properties - a term that we introduced
but a notion ubiquitous in the literature on operator ideals. Arithmetic mean
closure of ideals leads us to investigate majorization for infinite sequences
and this in turn leads us to an infinite Schur-Horn majorization theorem which
extends theorems by A. Neumann, by Arveson and Kadison, and by Antezana,
Massey, Ruiz and Stojanoff. We also list ten open questions that we encountered
in the development of this material.

operator-valued frame theory, using operator-algebraic methods. This extends
work of the second author and D. Han which can be viewed as the multiplicity
one case and extends to higher multiplicity (e.g., multiframes) their dilation
approach. We prove several results for operator-valued frames concerning their
parametrization, duality, disjointeness, complementarity, and composition and
the relationship between the two types of similarity (left and right) of such
frames. We then apply these notions to prove that the collection of multiframe
generators for the action of a discrete group on a Hilbert space is norm
pathwise-connected precisely when the von Neumann algebra generated by the
right representation of the group has no minimal projections. The proof is
obtained by parametrizing this collection by a class of partial isometries in a
larger von Neumann algebra. In the multiplicity one case this class reduces to
the unitary class which is path-connected in norm, but in the infinite
multiplicity case this class is path connected only in the strong operator
topology and the proof depends on properties of tensor product slice maps.
