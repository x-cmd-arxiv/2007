first part we deal with the boundary bootstrap in supersymmetric factorized
scattering theory. We give a description of supersymmetry in the case when the
space is a half-line and present rules for the determination of the
representations in which higher level boundary bound states transform, and for
the determination of the supersymmetric one-particle reflection matrix factors
for the higher level boundary bound states. These rules apply under the
condition that the bulk particles transform in the kink or in the boson-fermion
representation. Examples for the application of these rules to specific models
are also given. In the second part we investigate the problem whether the TCSA
spectrum can be approximated by the spectrum of the original Hamiltonian
operator in which the coefficients of the terms are suitably changed. The
investigation is done in the case of the critical Ising model on a strip with
an external magnetic field on one of the boundaries. Another truncation method
that preserves the solvability of the model is also considered. The results of
perturbative and numerical calculations show that the above approximation is
possible and that the qualitative behaviour of the truncated spectrum as a
function of the coupling constant depends on the truncation method. In the
third part we investigate the phase structure of the two- and three-frequency
sine-Gordon models using the TCSA. In the case of the three-frequency model the
tricritical point, several points of the critical line and a few points of the
line of first order transition are found.

reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) that establishes a previously
unrecognized optimality property for several well-known function approximation
techniques, such as minimum-norm interpolation, smoothing splines, and
pseudo-inverses. We consider the problem of approximating a function belonging
to an arbitrary real-valued RKHS on R^d based on approximate observations of
the function. The observations are approximate in the sense that the actual
observations (i.e., the true function values) are known only to belong to a
convex set of admissible observations. We seek a minimax optimal approximation
for the function that minimizes the supremum of the RKHS norm on the error
between the true function and the chosen approximation subject only to the
conditions that the true function belongs to a uniformly bounded uncertainty
set of functions that satisfy the constraints on the observations and that the
approximation is a member of the RKHS. We refer to such a solution as a minimax
robust reconstruction. We characterize the solution to the minimax robust
reconstruction problem and show that it is equivalent to solving a
straightforward convex optimization problem. We demonstrate that a minimax
robust reconstruction will generally be more stable than an approximation based
on interpolation through a nominal set of observations and that, subject to
some mild regularity conditions on the convex set of admissible observations,
the minimax robust reconstruction is unconditionally stable. We motivate our
results by characterizing the minimax robust reconstruction for several
specific convex observational models and discuss relationships with other
approaches to function approximation.

distinguishes normal from disordered voices to 91.8% overall accuracy on a

ultra-deep sequencing of virus samples. We present computational methods for

the sample from the pyrosequencing reads. This inference is based on a
statistical approach to error correction, followed by a combinatorial algorithm
for constructing a minimal set of haplotypes that explain the data. Using this
set of explaining haplotypes, we apply a statistical model to infer the
frequencies of the haplotypes in the population via an EM algorithm. We
demonstrate that pyrosequencing reads allow for effective population
reconstruction by extensive simulations and by comparison to 165 sequences
obtained directly from clonal sequencing of four independent, diverse HIV
populations. Thus, pyrosequencing can be used for cost-effective estimation of
the structure of virus populations, promising new insights into viral

were accumulated, deviations in the 2.5-3.5 sigma range have emerged pointing
to the exciting possibility of new CP-odd phase(s) and flavor violating
parameters in B-decays. Primarily this seems to be the case in the time
dependent CP asymmetries in penguin dominated modes (e.g. B -> phi (eta') Ks).
  We discuss these and other deviations from the SM and, as an illustration of
possible new physics scenarios, we examine the role of the Top Two Higgs
Doublet Model. This is a simple extension of the SM obtained by adding second
Higgs doublet in which the Yukawa interactions of the two Higgs doublets are
assigned in order to naturally account for the large top-quark mass.
  Of course, many other extensions of the Standard Model could also account for
these experimental deviations. Clearly if one takes these deviations seriously
then some new particles in the 300 GeV to few TeV with associated new CP-odd
phase(s) are needed.
