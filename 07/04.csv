transverse confining frequency periodically modulated along the axial

modulation emulates the action of an optical lattice (OL), the model may be
also relevant to toroidal traps, where an ordinary OL cannot be created. For
either sign of the nonlinearity, extended and localized states are found, in
the numerical form (using both the effective NPSE and the full 3D
Gross-Pitaevskii equation) and by means of the variational approximation (VA).
The latter is applied to construct ground-state solitons and predict the
collapse threshold in the case of self-attraction. It is shown that numerical
solutions provided by the one-dimensional NPSE are always very close to full 3D
solutions, and the VA yields quite reasonable results too. The transition from
delocalized states to gap solitons, in the first finite bandgap of the linear
spectrum, is examined in detail, for the repulsive and attractive

for blind CFO estimation and symbol recovery. The received base-band signal is

AFGL 2688, this result is inconsistent with a previous report of two extended
dust shells made on the basis of ISO observations. We derive an upper limit of
$2.1\times10^{-7}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and $1.0\times10^{-7}$ M$_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$ for the dust mass loss rate of AFGL 2688 and OH 231.8, respectively,

16342$-$3814 does show extended emission at both wavelengths, which can be
interpreted as a very large dust shell with a radius of $\sim$ 400 arcseconds
and a thickness of $\sim$ 100 arcseconds, corresponding to 4 pc and 1 pc,
respectively, at a distance of 2 kpc. However, this enhanced emission may also
be galactic cirrus; better azimuthal coverage is necessary for confirmation of
a shell. If the extended emission is a shell, it can be modeled as enhanced
mass outflow at a dust mass outflow rate of $1.5\times10^{-6}$ M$_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$ superimposed on a steady outflow with a dust mass outflow rate of
$1.5\times10^{-7}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. It is likely that this shell has swept
up a substantial mass of interstellar gas during its expansion, so these
estimates are upper limits to the stellar mass loss rate.

widespread presence of a spectrally flat ""synchrotron"" component, largely
uncorrelated with the synchrotron template, suggesting that an additional
foreground is indeed required. We have tested various spectral shapes for such

spectral shapes that may fit the spinning dust emission: a parabola in the logS

reconstructed CMB maps clearly disfavour two of the models. The CMB power
spectra, estimated from CMB maps reconstructed exploiting the three surviving
foreground models, are generally consistent with the WMAP ones, although at
least one of them gives a significantly higher quadrupole moment than found by
the WMAP team. Taking foreground modeling uncertainties into account, we find
that the mean quadrupole amplitude for the three ""good"" models is less than 1

evidence for a rapid change in jet properties on scales of ~1 kpc. A central
topic of current debate is the relative importance of intermittent jet fueling
versus jet-environment interactions in causing a drop-off in powerful radio
sources at this critical evolutionary stage. Recent 3-D hydrodynamical jet
simulations suggest that dense environments and cloud collisions can
temporarily stifle, but not completely halt powerful relativistic jets. Several
VLBA studies of jet-ISM interactions in both blazars and weak Seyfert jets have
indicated that collimated outflows are indeed possible in dense environments.
At present, the bulk of the evidence favors intermittent AGN accretion as the
dominant factor in determining the evolutionary path of large numbers of AGN

networks, termed fractional power control (FPC). Transmission power is chosen
as the current channel quality raised to an exponent -s, where s is a constant
between 0 and 1. The choices s = 1 and s = 0 correspond to the familiar cases
of channel inversion and constant power transmission, respectively. Choosing s
in (0,1) allows all intermediate policies between these two extremes to be
evaluated, and we see that usually neither extreme is ideal. We derive
closed-form approximations for the outage probability relative to a target SINR
in a decentralized (ad hoc or unlicensed) network as well as for the resulting
transmission capacity, which is the number of users/m^2 that can achieve this
SINR on average. Using these approximations, which are quite accurate over
typical system parameter values, we prove that using an exponent of 1/2
minimizes the outage probability, meaning that the inverse square root of the
channel strength is a sensible transmit power scaling for networks with a
relatively low density of interferers. We also show numerically that this
choice of s is robust to a wide range of variations in the network parameters.
Intuitively, s=1/2 balances between helping disadvantaged users while making
sure they do not flood the network with interference.

learning is often possible due to sparsity: the fact that the data are
typically redundant with underlying structures that can be represented by only
a few features. In this paper we present treelets--a novel construction of
multi-scale bases that extends wavelets to nonsmooth signals. The method is
fully adaptive, as it returns a hierarchical tree and an orthonormal basis
which both reflect the internal structure of the data. Treelets are especially
well-suited as a dimensionality reduction and feature selection tool prior to
regression and classification, in situations where sample sizes are small and
the data are sparse with unknown groupings of correlated or collinear
variables. The method is also simple to implement and analyze theoretically.
Here we describe a variety of situations where treelets perform better than
principal component analysis, as well as some common variable selection and
cluster averaging schemes. We illustrate treelets on a blocked covariance model
and on several data sets (hyperspectral image data, DNA microarray data, and
internet advertisements) with highly complex dependencies between variables.

candidates for Dark Matter. Currently, the most promising method to detect
WIMPs is the direct detection of the recoil energy deposited in a
low-background laboratory detector due to elastic WIMP-nucleus scattering. So
far the usual procedure has been to predict the event rate of direct detection
of WIMPs based on some model(s) of the Galactic halo from cosmology and of
WIMPs from elementary particle physics. The aim of this work is to invert this
process. In this thesis I present methods which allow to reconstruct (the
moments of) the WIMP velocity distribution function as well as to determine the
WIMP mass from the recoil energy spectrum as well as from experimental data
directly. The reconstruction of the velocity distribution function has been
further extended to take into account the annual modulation of the event rate.
Moreover, the reconstruction of the amplitude of the annual modulation of the
velocity distribution and an alternative, better way for confirming the annual
modulation of the event rate have been discussed. On the other hand, the
determination of the WIMP mass by combining two (or more) experiments with
different detector materials has been developed. All formulae and expressions
given here are not only independent of the model of Galactic halo but also of
that of WIMPs. This means that we need neither the as yet unknown WIMP density
near the Earth nor the WIMP-nucleus cross section. The only information which
we need is the measured recoil energies and their measuring times.

to constrain the temperatures and masses of discovered disks. High resolution
studies will likely be required to resolve many of the disks. Therefore, these
systems will be the focus of future observational studies using a variety of
observatories to characterize their physical properties. For non-detected
systems, this survey will set constraints (upper limits) on the amount of
circumstellar dust, of typically 200 times the Kuiper Belt mass, but as low as

of baryons in the universe and is an important complement to determinations
from cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. Indeed, the current small
sample of high redshift D/H measurements from quasar absorption line studies
are in excellent agreement with CMB-derived values. Conversely, absorption line
measurements of the Galactic D/H ratio in almost 50 stellar sightlines show a
puzzlingly large scatter outside the Local Bubble which is difficult to explain
simply by astration from the primordial value. Here, we investigate the dust
depletion scenario by studying the correlation between D/H and the abundance of
titanium, one of the most refractory elements readily observed in the ISM. With
a sample 3 times larger than previous work, we confirm a correlation between
Ti/H and D/H at the 97% confidence level. However, the magnitude of this
dependence is difficult to reconcile with a simple model of dust depletion for
two reasons. First, contrary to what is expected from local depletion rates,
the gradient of the highly refractory Ti is much shallower than that observed
for Fe and Si. Second, we do not observe the established tight, steep
correlation between [Ti/H] and the mean volume density of hydrogen. Therefore,
whilst dust remains a plausible explanation for the local D/H variations, the
abundances of at least some of the refractory elements do not provide unanimous
support for this scenario. We also argue that the correlations of [Si/H],
[Fe/H], and [Ti/H] with D/H are inconsistent with a simple infall model of low
metallicity gas with approximately solar abundances as the dominant cause for D
variations.

using the ESO 3.6m telescope, equipped with the EFOSC2 spectrograph. From the
measured radial velocities, distances could be estimated. With this distance
information, it is possible to differentiate between true LSB galaxies and
higher redshift High Surface Brightness (HSB) galaxies which may contaminate
the sample. A correction for the surface brightnesses can then be applied,
accounting for the cosmological dimming effect (``Tolman Dimming''). We show
that ~70% of the LSB candidates, selected based on their location in the
color-color space, are real LSB galaxies. Their position in the color-color
diagrams, therefore, indicate that the LSB galaxies have a different stellar
population mix resulting from a different star formation history compared to
HSBs. Our LSB galaxy sample consists only of large disk galaxies with
scale-length between 2.5kpc and 7.3kpc. We confirm the flat central surface
brightness distribution of previous surveys and extend this distribution down
to central surface brightnesses of 27 B mag arcsec^-2.

reversible Markov chains, which contribute to the slow convergence of the
algorithms. It has been observed that by overcoming the diffusive behavior of
reversible chains, certain nonreversible chains lifted from reversible ones mix
substantially faster than the original chains. In this paper, we investigate
the idea of accelerating distributed consensus via lifting Markov chains, and
propose a class of Location-Aided Distributed Averaging (LADA) algorithms for
wireless networks, where nodes' coarse location information is used to
construct nonreversible chains that facilitate distributed computing and
cooperative processing. First, two general pseudo-algorithms are presented to
illustrate the notion of distributed averaging through chain-lifting. These
pseudo-algorithms are then respectively instantiated through one LADA algorithm
on grid networks, and one on general wireless networks. For a $k\times k$ grid
network, the proposed LADA algorithm achieves an $\epsilon$-averaging time of
$O(k\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$. Based on this algorithm, in a wireless network with
transmission range $r$, an $\epsilon$-averaging time of
$O(r^{-1}\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ can be attained through a centralized algorithm.
Subsequently, we present a fully-distributed LADA algorithm for wireless
networks, which utilizes only the direction information of neighbors to
construct nonreversible chains. It is shown that this distributed LADA
algorithm achieves the same scaling law in averaging time as the centralized
scheme. Finally, we propose a cluster-based LADA (C-LADA) algorithm, which,
requiring no central coordination, provides the additional benefit of reduced
message complexity compared with the distributed LADA algorithm.

iterative methods such as GMRES and BiCGStab have been used to solve multiply
shifted systems for about the cost of solving just one system. Restarted GMRES
can be improved by deflating eigenvalues for matrices that have a few small

applied to multiply shifted systems. In quantum chromodynamics, it is common to
have multiple right-hand sides with multiple shifts for each right-hand side.
We develop a method that efficiently solves the multiple right-hand sides by

supernova remnant W50 is re-examined using new observations of HI in absorption
from the VLA, HI in emission from the GBT, and 12CO emission from the FCRAO.
The new measurements show HI in absorption against SS433 to a velocity of 75
km/s but not to the velocity of the tangent point, which bounds the kinematic
distance at 5.5 < d_k < 6.5 kpc. This is entirely consistent with a 5.5 +/- 0.2
kpc distance determined from light travel-time arguments (Blundell & Bowler
2004). The HI emission map shows evidence of interaction of the lobes of W50
with the interstellar medium near the adopted systemic velocity of V_LSR = 75
km/s. The western lobe sits in a cavity in the HI emission near the Galactic
plane, while the eastern lobe terminates at an expanding HI shell. The
expanding shell has a radius of 40 pc, contains 8 +/- 3 x 10^3 M_sun of HI and
has a measured kinetic energy of 3 +/- 1.5 x 10^{49} ergs. There may also be a
static HI ring or shell around the main part of W50 itself at an LSR velocity
of 75 km/s, with a radius of 70 pc and a mass in HI of 3.5 - 10 x 10^4 M_sun.
We do not find convincing evidence for the interaction of the system with any
molecular cloud or with HI at other velocities. The HI emission data suggest
that SS433 lies in an interstellar environment substantially denser than
average for its distance from the Galactic plane. This Population I system, now
about 200 pc below the Galactic plane, most likely originated as a runaway
O-star binary ejected from a young cluster in the plane. New astrometric data
on SS433 show that the system now has a peculiar velocity of a few tens of km/s
in the direction of the Galactic plane. From this peculiar velocity and the
symmetry of the W50 remnant we derive a time since the SN of < 10^5 yr.

major open questions in modern X-ray astrophysics. One possible explanation for
these objects is an inhomogeneous, radiation dominated accretion disk around a
$\sim 10 M_{\odot}$ black hole -- the so-called ``photon bubble'' model. While
previous studies of this model have focused primarily on its
radiation-hydrodynamics aspects, in this paper, we provide an analysis of its
X-ray spectral (continuum and possible edge and line) characteristics. Compton
reflection between high and low density regions in the disk may provide the key
to distinguishing this model from others, such as accretion onto an
intermediate mass black hole. We couple a Monte Carlo/Fokker-Planck radiation
transport code with the XSTAR code for reflection to simulate the photon
spectra produced in a photon bubble model for ULXs. We find that reflection
components tend to be very weak and in most cases not observable, and make
predictions for the shape of the high-energy Comptonizing spectra. In many
cases the Comptonization dominates the spectra even down to $\sim$ a few keV.
In one simulation, a $\sim 9 \kev$ feature was found, which may be considered a
signature of photon bubbles in ULXs; furthermore, we make predictions of high
energy power-laws which may be observed by future instruments.

using field theoretic methods, we find that the Hamiltonian for the system in
this sector is not diagonalizable. We trace the difficulty to the fact that the
interaction term in the Hamiltonian violating Lorentz invariance leads to
discontinuity conditions (matching conditions) that cannot be satisfied. We
determine the most general quartic interaction Hamiltonian that can be
diagonalized. This includes the bosonic Thirring model as well as the bosonic
chiral Gross-Neveu model which we find share the same S-matrix. We explain this
by showing, through a Fierz transformation, that these two models are in fact
equivalent. In addition, we find a general quartic interaction Hamiltonian,
violating Lorentz invariance, that can be diagonalized with the same two
particle S-matrix element as calculated by Klose and Zarembo for the FR model.
This family of generalized interaction Hamiltonians is not Hermitian, but is
$PT$ symmetric. We show that the wave functions for this system are also $PT$
symmetric. Thus, the theory is in a $PT$ unbroken phase which guarantees the

Isolated Neutron Stars whose X-ray emission is purely thermal, hence dubbed
X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron Stars (XDINSs). While optical observations have
allowed to relate the thermal emission to the neutron star cooling and to build
the neutron star surface thermal map, IR observations are critical to pinpoint
a spectral turnover produced by a so far unseen magnetospheric component, or by
the presence of a fallback disk. The detection of such a turnover can provide
further evidence of a link between this class of isolated neutron stars and the
magnetars, which show a distinctive spectral flattening in the IR.
  Here we present the deepest IR observations ever of five XDINSs, which we use
to constrain a spectral turnover in the IR and the presence of a fallback disk.
The data are obtained using the ISAAC instrument at the VLT.
  For none of our targets it was possible to identify the IR counterpart down
to limiting magnitudes H = 21.5 - 22.9. Although these limits are the deepest
ever obtained for neutron stars of this class, they are not deep enough to rule
out the existence and the nature of a possible spectral flattening in the IR.
We also derive, by using disk models, the upper limits on the mass inflow rate
in a fallback disk. We find the existence of a putative fallback disk
consistent (although not confirmed) with our observations.

sensitivity of the superconducting properties to various defects of the spinel

LiTi2O4 on single crystalline substrates of MgAl2O4, MgO, and SrTiO3 provide
model systems to systematically explore the effects of lattice strain and

limited variations in the superconducting and normal state properties.
Microstructural disorder such as antiphase boundaries that give rise to Ti
network disorder can reduce the critical temperature, but Ti network disorder
combined with Mg interdiffusion can affect the superconducting state much more
dramatically. Thickness dependent transport studies indicate a
superconductor-insulator transition as a function of film thickness regardless
of lattice strain and microstructure. In addition, surface sensitive X-ray
absorption spectroscopy has identified Ti to retain site symmetry and average
valence of the bulk material regardless of film thickness.

This corresponds to a ``dark energy'' fluid and the Friedmann solution is
accelerated in this case due to anti-gravity. This extends the previous
analysis of spherically symmetric self-similar solutions for fluids with
positive pressure ($\gamma>1$). However, in the latter case there is an
additional parameter associated with the weak discontinuity at the sonic point
and the solutions are only asymptotically ``quasi-Friedmann'', in the sense
that they exhibit an angle deficit at large distances. In the $0<\gamma<2/3$

In particular we show that the large discrepancies between electron
temperatures (Te's) derived from CELs and from ORLs appear to be mainly caused
by abnormally low values yielded by recombination lines and/or continua.
Similarly, the large discrepancies between heavy element abundances deduced
from ORLs and from CELs are largely caused by abnormally high values obtained
from ORLs, up to tens of solar in extreme cases. It appears that whatever
mechanisms are causing the ubiquitous dichotomy between CELs and ORLs, their
main effects are to enhance the emission of ORLs, but hardly affect that of
CELs. It seems that heavy element abundances deduced from ORLs may not reflect
the bulk composition of the nebula. Rather, our analysis suggests that ORLs of
heavy element ions mainly originate from a previously unseen component of
plasma of Te's of just a few hundred Kelvin, which is too cool to excite any
optical and UV CELs.

trapped inflationary scenario, we do not make the assumption that an ESP
appears at some unstable point on the inflaton potential. This assumption is
crucial in the original scenario, but it is not important in the multi-field

electron-positron plasmas by performing a two-dimensional particle-in-cell
simulation. At the shock transition region, strong magnetic fields are
generated by a Weibel-like instability. The generated magnetic fields are
strong enough to deflect the incoming particles from upstream of the shock at a
large angle and provide an effective dissipation mechanism for the shock. The
structure of the collisionless shock propagates at an almost constant speed.
There is no linear wave corresponding to the shock wave and therefore this can
be regarded as a kind of ``instability-driven'' shock wave. The generated
magnetic fields rapidly decay in the downstream region. It is also observed
that a fraction of the thermalized particles in the downstream region return
upstream through the shock transition region. These particles interact with the
upstream incoming particles and cause the generation of charge-separated
current filaments in the upstream of the shock as well as the electrostatic
beam instability. As a result, electric and magnetic fields are generated even
upstream of the shock transition region. No efficient acceleration processes of
particles were observed in our simulation.

errors below one radian. Simulations with ARIS reveal that phase referencing
achieves good performance at 8.4GHz, even under poor tropospheric conditions.
At 22 and 43GHz, it is recommended to conduct phase referencing observations
under good or typical tropospheric conditions. The satellite is required to
have an attitude-switching capability with a one-minute or shorter cycle, and
an orbit determination accuracy higher than about 10cm at apogee; the phase
referencing calibrators are required to have a signal-to-noise ratio larger
than four for a single scan. The probability to find a suitable phase
referencing calibrator was estimated by using VLBI surveys. From the viewpoint
of calibrator availability, VSOP-2 phase referencing at 8.4GHz is promising.
However, the change of finding suitable calibrators at 22 and 43GHz is
significantly reduced; it is important to conduct specific investigations for

This leads to a minimum in the density dependence of conductivity when the
electron density $N_{\rm e}$ is equal to a critical value, $N_c$. For $N_{\rm

while it is approximately inversely proportional to $N_{\rm e}$ when $N_{\rm

  Relations with Galaxy Properties","Accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20066691",,"astro-ph",,"  We present the analysis of the radial gradients of stellar absorption lines
in a sample of 32 bulges of edge-on spiral galaxies, spanning nearly the full
Hubble sequence (from S0 to Sc types), and a large range of velocity dispersion
(from about 60 to 300 km/s). Different diagnostics such as index-index,
gradient-gradient diagrams, and simple stellar population models are used to
tackle the origin of the variation of the bulge stellar population. We find
that the vast majority of bulges show older age, lower metallicity and higher
[alpha/Fe] in their outer regions than in their central parts. The radial
gradients in [Fe/H] are 2 to 3 times larger than in Log(age). The relation
between gradient and bulge velocity dispersion is interpreted as a gradual
build up of the gradient mean values and their dispersions from high to low
velocity dispersion, rather than a pure correlation. The bulge effective radii
and the Hubble type of the parent galaxies seem to play a more minor role in
causing the observed spatial distributions. At a given velocity dispersion,
bulges and ellipticals share common properties.

expressive extension of PDL, allowing visibly pushdown automata (VPAs) as a

satisfiability problem complete for deterministic double exponential time.
Lately, the VPA formalism was extended to so called k-phase multi-stack visibly
pushdown automata (k-MVPAs). Similarly to VPAs, it has been shown that the
language of k-MVPAs have desirable effective closure properties and that the
emptiness problem is decidable. On the occasion of introducing k-MVPAs, it has
been asked whether the extension of PDL with k-MVPAs still leads to a decidable

\Sigma_1^1-complete.

these models is their apparent inability to store correlated patterns of

modification in the `learning rule' (associating to each neuron a plasticity

correlations. We study the stability properties of the resulting memories (in
terms of their resistance to the damage of neurons or synapses), finding a
novel property of autoassociative networks: not all memories are equally
robust, and the most informative are also the most sensitive to damage. We
relate these results to category-specific effects in semantic memory patients,
where concepts related to `non-living things' are usually more resistant to
brain damage than those related to `living things', a phenomenon suspected to
be rooted in the correlation between representations of concepts in the cortex.

annotation included Gene Ontology functional classification, InterPro domain

expression profiles were derived from EST counts and used to define transcripts
specific to metamorphic stages of development. Moreover, these ESTs allowed
identification of a set of 225 polymorphic microsatellites that can be used as

game-theoretic formulation, to find out the optimal precoding/multiplexing
matrices for a multipoint-to-multipoint communication system composed of a set
of wideband links sharing the same physical resources, i.e., time and
bandwidth. We assume, as optimality criterion, the achievement of a Nash
equilibrium and consider two alternative optimization problems: 1) the
competitive maximization of mutual information on each link, given constraints
on the transmit power and on the spectral mask imposed by the radio spectrum
regulatory bodies; and 2) the competitive maximization of the transmission
rate, using finite order constellations, under the same constraints as above,
plus a constraint on the average error probability. In Part I of the paper, we
start by showing that the solution set of both noncooperative games is always
nonempty and contains only pure strategies. Then, we prove that the optimal
precoding/multiplexing scheme for both games leads to a channel diagonalizing
structure, so that both matrix-valued problems can be recast in a simpler
unified vector power control game, with no performance penalty. Thus, we study
this simpler game and derive sufficient conditions ensuring the uniqueness of
the Nash equilibrium. Interestingly, although derived under stronger
constraints, incorporating for example spectral mask constraints, our
uniqueness conditions have broader validity than previously known conditions.
Finally, we assess the goodness of the proposed decentralized strategy by
comparing its performance with the performance of a Pareto-optimal centralized
scheme. To reach the Nash equilibria of the game, in Part II, we propose
alternative distributed algorithms, along with their convergence conditions.

reconstruction of the 3-dimensional structure usually relies on deprojecting
2-dimensional X-ray, Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and/or gravitational lensing
observations. As known, a joint analysis of these data sets can provide the
elongation of the cluster along the line of sight together with its length and
width in the plane of the sky. An unbiased measurement of the Hubble constant
can be also inferred. Due to some intrinsic degeneracies, the observational
constraints obtained from such projected data-sets are not enough to allow an
unique inversion. In general, the projected maps can be at the same time
compatible with prolate, oblate and with many triaxial configurations. Even a
prolate cluster might be interpreted as an oblate system and vice versa.
Assuming that the cluster is axially symmetric is likely to overestimate the
intrinsic ellipticity, whereas the system always looks rounder performing the
inversion under the hypothesis of a triaxial cluster aligned with the line of
sight. In general, analysing triaxial clusters under the prolate or oblate
assumption may introduce strong biases even when the clusters are actually near
to axial symmetry whereas the systematics introduced assuming the cluster to be
aligned with the line of sight are more under control.

sample mean still remains a statistical challenge. Although a Principal
Component Analysis (PCA), or equivalently a Empirical Orthogonal Functions
(EOF) decomposition, is often applied on this purpose, it can only provide
meaningful results if the underlying multivariate distribution is Gaussian.
Indeed, PCA is based on optimizing second order moments quantities and the
covariance matrix can only capture the full dependence structure for
multivariate Gaussian vectors. Whenever the application at hand can not satisfy
this normality hypothesis (e.g. precipitation data), alternatives and/or
improvements to PCA have to be developed and studied. To go beyond this second
order statistics constraint that limits the applicability of the PCA, we take
advantage of the cumulant function that can produce higher order moments
information. This cumulant function, well-known in the statistical literature,
allows us to propose a new, simple and fast procedure to identify spatial
patterns for non-Gaussian data. Our algorithm consists in maximizing the
cumulant function. To illustrate our approach, its implementation for which
explicit computations are obtained is performed on three family of of
multivariate random vectors. In addition, we show that our algorithm
corresponds to selecting the directions along which projected data display the
largest spread over the marginal probability density tails.

Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metrics, a nucleation of the Universe with its
further expansion is described as a tunneling transition through an effective
barrier between regions with small and large values of the scale factor $a$ at
non-zero (or zero) energy. The approach for describing this tunneling consists
of constructing a wave function satisfying an appropriate boundary condition.
There are various ways for defining the boundary condition that lead to
different estimates of the barrier penetrability and the tunneling time.
  In order to describe the escape from the tunneling region as accurately as
possible and to construct the total wave function on the basis of its two
partial solutions unambiguously, we use the tunneling boundary condition that
the total wave function must represent only the outgoing wave at the point of
escape from the barrier, where the following definition for the wave is
introduced: the wave is represented by the wave function whose modulus changes
minimally under a variation of the scale factor $a$. We construct a new method
for a direct non-semiclassical calculation of the total stationary wave
function of the Universe, analyze the behavior of this wave function in the
tunneling region, near the escape point and in the asymptotic region, and
estimate the barrier penetrability. We observe oscillations of modulus of wave
function in the external region starting from the turning point which decrease
with increasing of $a$ and which are not shown in semiclassical calculations.
The period of such an oscillation decreases uniformly with increasing $a$ and
can be used as a fully quantum dynamical characteristic of the expansion of the
Universe.

lines and HeII absorptions (including many selective emission lines but
excluding He II 4686A emission) are essentially constant in line strength, but
are variable in velocity, establishing a double-lined binary orbit with P(orb)
= 1542d, e=0.45. We conduct a model-atmosphere analysis of the primary, and
find that the system is consistent with a O8: giant with a B1: main-sequence

rotational modulation of a magnetically constrained plasma is strongly favoured
as the most likely underlying `clock'. An upper limit on the equatorial

star, LS III +52 24, identified as the optical counterpart of the hot post-AGB
candidate IRAS 22023+5249 (I22023).
  Methods: We carried out detailed identifications of the observed absorption
and emission features in the high resolution spectrum (4290 - 9015 A) of I22023
obtained with the Utrecht Echelle Spectrograph on the 4.2m William Herschel
Telescope. Using Kurucz's WIDTH9 program and the spectrum synthesis code,
SYNSPEC, we determined the atmospheric parameters and abundances. The
photospheric abundances were derived under the LTE approximation. The NEBULAR
package under IRAF was used to estimate the electron temperature (T_e) and the
electron density (N_e) from the [N II] and [S II] lines.
  Results: We estimated T_eff=24000 K, log g=3.0, xi_t=7 kms^{-1}. The derived
CNO abundances suggest an evolved star with C/O < 1. P-Cygni profiles of
hydrogen and helium indicate ongoing post-AGB mass loss. The presence of [N II]
and [S II] lines and the non-detection of [O III] indicate that photoionisation
has just started. The derived nebular parameters T_e=7000 K, N_e=1.2X10^{4}
cm^{-3} are comparable to those measured in young, compact planetary nebulae
(PNe). The nebular expansion velocity was estimated to be 17.5 kms^{-1}.
  Conclusions: The observed spectral features, large heliocentric radial
velocity (-148.31 +/- 0.60 kms^{-1}), atmospheric parameters and chemical
composition indicate that I22023, at a distance of 1.95 kpc, is an evolved
post-AGB star belonging to the old disk population. The nebular parameters
suggest that the central star may be evolving into a compact, young PN, similar
to Hen3-1357.

  The approximately Einstein ACH metric $g$ is a generalisation of, and
exhibits similar asymptotic boundary behaviour to, Fefferman's approximately

present work demonstrates that the CR-invariant log term coefficient in the
asymptotic volume expansion of $g_+$ is in fact a contact invariant. We discuss
some implications this may have for CR $Q$-curvature.

of the related symmetry group, recalling the general structure of mappings
covariant under the same group. This is done for damped harmonic oscillator,
two-level system and quantum Brownian motion. Special attention is devoted to
the general structure of translation-covariant master equations. Within this

where the MSSM is the effective field theory between energy scales M_{\rm weak}
and M_{\rm GUT}, but with the GUT scale SU(3) gaugino mass M_3<< M_1 or M_2. As
a result, squark and gluino masses are suppressed relative to slepton, chargino
and neutralino masses, leading to a compressed sparticle mass spectrum, and
where the dark matter relic density in the early universe may be dominantly
governed by neutralino annihilation into ttbar pairs via exchange of a light
top squark. We explore the dark matter and collider signals expected from
compressed SUSY for two distinct model lines with differing assumptions about
GUT scale gaugino mass parameters. For dark matter signals, the compressed
squark spectrum leads to an enhancement in direct detection rates compared to
models with unified gaugino masses. Meanwhile, neutralino halo annihilation
rates to gamma rays and anti-matter are also enhanced relative to related
scenarios with unified gaugino masses but, depending on the halo dark matter
distribution, may yet be below the sensitivity of indirect searches underway.
In the case of collider signals, we compare the rates for the potentially
dominant decay modes of the stop_1 which may be expected to be produced in
cascade decay chains at the LHC: \tst_1\to c\tz_1 and \tst_1\to bW\tz_1. We
examine the extent to which multilepton signal rates are reduced when the
two-body decay mode dominates. For the model lines that we examine here, the
multi-lepton signals, though reduced, still remain observable at the LHC.

also be pertinent for certain three dimensional antiferromagnetic
quasicrystals. We show, using spin wave theory and quantum Monte Carlo
simulation, that the local staggered magnetizations strongly depend on the
local coordination number z and are minimized on some sites of five-fold
symmetry. We present a simple explanation for this behavior in terms of
Heisenberg stars. Finally we show how best to represent this complex
inhomogeneous ground state, using the ""perpendicular space"" representation of
the tiling.

taken in September 2006 failed to detect any radio activity at 8.46 GHz. A
closer inspection of earlier data reveals that the source varied from a null
detection on 3 May 2004, to $\approx$95 $\mu$Jy on 17 May 2004, to 230 $\mu$Jy
on 18 June 2004. The lack of detection in September 2006 suggests at least a
factor of ten flux variability at 8.46 GHz. Three short photometric runs did
not reveal any optical variability. In addition to the observed pulsing nature
of the radio flux from another ultra-cool source, the present observations
suggests that ultra-cool dwarfs may not just be pulsing but can also display
long-term sporadic variability in their levels of quiescent radio emission. The
lack of optical photometric variability suggests an absence of large-scale
spots at the time of the latest VLA observations, although small very high
latitude spots combined with a low inclination could cause very low amplitude
rotational modulation which may not be measurable. We discuss this large
variability in the radio emission within the context of both gyrosynchrotron

operation of the components is the balance between electrical forces and
mechanical spring forces in micromachined silicon structures. In RMS sensors
and RMS-to-DC converters, the quadratic voltage dependence of the force between
plates of a moving-plate capacitor is utilised, and the operation of the MEMS
voltage reference is based on the pull-in phenomenon of a moving-plate
capacitor. Advantages of MEMS devices compared to more conventional solutions
include small size, low power consumption, low price in mass production, and
stability. The drift caused by electrostatic charging effects has turned out to
be a major problem. This problem has not yet been solved in DC applications,
but it can be circumvented by using AC actuation instead of DC and by
compensating the internal DC voltages of the component. In this way, an AC
voltage reference with relative drift rate below 2 ppm during a three-week test
period has been constructed. Even better stability has been demonstrated with a
MEMS-based reference oscillator: no changes in resonance frequency were
observed at relative uncertainty level of about 0.01 ppm in a measurement which
was continued for more than a month. MEMS components have also been developed
for measuring RF and microwave power up to frequencies of about 40 GHz. Unlike
conventional high frequency power sensors, which measure the absorbed power,

Simulation based on the Eddy Damped Quasi Normal Markovian approximation

energy spectrum is usually assumed in order to evaluate the nonlocal transfer,
in our method the energy spectrum of the subgrid scales adapts itself
dynamically to the large-scale resolved spectrum; this first modification
allows in particular for a better treatment of transient phases and
instabilities, as shown on one specific example. Moreover, the model takes into
account the phase relationships of the small-scales, embodied for example in
strong localized structures such as vortex filaments. To that effect, phase
information is implemented in the treatment of the so-called eddy noise in the
closure model. Finally, we also consider the role that helical small scales may
play in the evaluation of the transfer of energy and helicity, the two
invariants of the primitive equations in the inviscid case; this leads as well
to intrinsic variations in the development of helicity spectra. Therefore, our

priori at any given Reynolds number. Comparisons with Direct Numerical

absorption features and gas emission lines.
  We compared the strength of the absorption lines to a variety of population
synthesis models for the star-formation history in the nuclear rings, including
also the contribution of the older bulge and disc stellar components. We find
that the stars in our sample of nuclear rings have most likely formed over a
prolonged period of time characterised by episodic bursts of star-formation
activity. Constant star formation is firmly ruled out by the data, whereas a
one-off formation event is an unlikely explanation for a common galactic
component such as nuclear rings.
  We have used emission-line measurements to constrain the physical conditions
of the ionised gas within the rings. Emission in all nuclear rings originates
from HII-regions with electron densities typical for these kinds of objects,
and that the rings are characterised by values for the gas metallicity ranging
from slightly below to just above solar.

molecular rates of the RNA hairpin alone and to search for the optimal
experimental conditions to do the measurements. We conclude that long handles
and soft laser traps represent the best conditions to extract rate estimates
that are closest to the intrinsic molecular rates. The methodology and
rationale presented here can be applied to other experimental setups and other
molecules.
