determined by combining high resolution cosmological simulations with the
observed, (rest-frame) V-band galaxy LF. The simulations invoke three different
stellar IMFs, a Kroupa (K98), a Salpeter (S) and an Arimoto-Yoshii (AY),
spanning a range of a factor of five in chemical yield and specific SNII energy
feedback.
  Oxygen is found in all T phases (cold: logT<~4, warm: logT~4.5, hot:
logT>~5), in particular for the (top-heavy) AY IMF. For the K98 and S IMFs, the
most important phase is the cold one. Moreover, the cold phase alone contains
1-3 times the mass of oxygen in galactic stars for the three IMFs. The
implications of this in relation to DLA studies are discussed.
  In relation to ``missing metals'' it is found that a significant fraction of
the oxygen is located in a warm/hot phase that may be very difficult to detect.
Moreover, it is found that less than about 20-25% of the cosmic oxygen is
associated with galaxies brighter than M_V~-22, the faintest LBGs probed by
current metallicity determinations.
  From the LBG based, lambda~1500 AA luminosity density history at z>3, the
mean oxygen density at z=3 is inferred. Comparing this to the models, it is
found that the (solar neighbourhood type) K98 IMF is strongly excluded (too
small yield), the S is marginally excluded, and the AY matches the constraint
well. The optimal IMF has a yield between the S and AY. A similar conclusion is
reached on the basis of the C IV abundance of the moderate density IGM.

radiation. Their average size grows continuously until they percolate and
complete reionization. We demonstrate how this typical growth can be calculated
around the largest, biased sources of UV emission, such as quasars, by further
developing an analytical model based on the excursion set formalism. This
approach allows us to calculate the sizes and growth of the HII regions created
by the progenitors of any dark matter halo of given mass and redshift with a
minimum of free parameters. Statistical variations in the size of these
pre-existing HII regions are an additional source of uncertainty in the
determination of very high redshift quasar properties from their observed HII
region sizes. We use this model to demonstrate that the transmission gaps seen
in very high redshift quasars can be understood from the radiation of only
their progenitors and associated clustered small galaxies. The fit sets a lower
limit on the redshift of overlap at z = 5.8 +/- 0.1. This interpretation makes
the transmission gaps independent of the age of the quasars observed. If this
interpretation were correct it would raise the prospects of using radio
interferometers currently under construction to detect the epoch of

galaxy sample sizes with 1% SKA surveys requires very substantial survey
durations, of about 1000 days. Good sampling (log(N)~5) down to below M_HI* can
then be achieved out to z=0.2 over 8000 deg^2 of survey area or even to z=0.5
over 800 deg^2. The same surveys will permit the resolved imaging of order 1000
galaxies in each of several red-shift bins as well as detection of faint
neutral filaments in the vicinity of galaxies with a column density of about
10^18 cm^-2. Once 10% SKA sensitivities are achieved, then ground-breaking
surveys are possible with only 100 day duration. Sample sizes of log(N)~6
extending below M_HI* are possible over 800 deg^2 out to z=0.5 and over 80
deg^2 out to z=1. Such surveys will permit very competitive measurement of
acoustic oscillations in the galaxy power spectrum. One can then envision a
series of 10% SKA surveys probing different depths. With the 100% SKA
sensitivity the capabilities are truly phenomenal. Survey sample sizes in the
range log(N)=7-8 are feasible over the red-shift range of 0.2 to about 5.
Precise tracking of potential time evolution of dark energy (via the baryonic
acoustic oscillation signature) should be possible out to z~3. The local cosmic

isolated systems, and an allowed region within Ellipsoidland, related to the
occurrence of bifurcation points from ellipsoidal to pear-shaped
configurations, is shown to be consistent with observations; (ii) elliptical
galaxies are considered as embedded within dark matter haloes and, under
reasonable assumptions, it is shown that tidal effects from hosting haloes have
little influence on the above mentioned results; (iii) dark matter haloes and
embedded elliptical galaxies, idealized as a single homeoidally striated Jacobi
ellipsoid, are considered in connection with the cosmological transition from
expansion to relaxation, by generalizing an earlier model, and the existence of
a lower limit to the flattening of relaxed (oblate-like) configurations, is
established. On the other hand, no lower limit is found to the elongation of
relaxed (prolate-like) configurations, and the observed lack of elliptical
galaxies more elongated than E7 needs a different physical interpretation, such
as the fully investigated bending instabilities.

incompleteness of binary detection in our sample into account, we estimate that
the frequency of planets in binaries can be no more than a factor of three

of planet frequency on the binary separation, except for a lower value of

the most favorable conditions. Observational signatures of this transport

discovered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The inclusion of metals and
hydrogen in our model atmosphere calculations leads to different atmospheric
parameters than those derived from pure helium models. Calcium abundances are
found in the range from log (Ca/He) = -12 to -8. We also find that fits of the
coolest objects show peculiarities, suggesting that our physical models may not
correctly describe the conditions of high atmospheric pressure encountered in
the coolest DZ stars. We find that the mean mass of the 11 DZ stars with
trigonometric parallaxes, <M> = 0.63 Mo, is significantly lower than that
obtained from pure helium models, <M> = 0.78 Mo, and in much better agreement
with the mean mass of other types of white dwarfs. We determine hydrogen
abundances for 27% of the DZ stars in our sample, while only upper limits are
obtained for objects with low signal-to-noise ratio spectroscopic data. We
confirm with a high level of confidence that the accretion rate of hydrogen is
at least two orders of magnitude smaller than that of metals (and up to five in
some cases) to be compatible with the observations. We find a correlation
between the hydrogen abundance and the effective temperature, suggesting for
the first time empirical evidence of a lower temperature boundary for the

suppression of the amplitude of interference fringes discussed in these lecture

studies demonstrating that suppression of the interference fringe contrast and
its shot to shot variations can be used to study correlation functions within
individual condensates. We also discuss full distribution functions of the

We verified that the model exhibits a second-order phase transition from normal

another second-order phase transition takes place within the SC phase in the

annealing at higher temperatures. Post-deposition annealing temperatures above
650 C are needed to develop high values of coercivity. The duration of the
annealing time is more critical in anisotropic samples deposited onto heated
substrates than in isotropic samples deposited at lower temperatures. For a
given set of annealing conditions (750 C/ 10'), high heating rates (&#8805;
2000 C / h) favour high coercivity in both isotropic and anisotropic films. The
shape and size of Nd2Fe14B grains depend strongly on the heating rate.

equipped with M antennas communicates with N users each equipped with K receive
antennas ($K \leq M$), is considered. It is assumed that the receivers have
perfect Channel State Information (CSI), while the BS only knows the partial
CSI, provided by the receivers via feedback. The minimum amount of feedback
required at the BS, to achieve the maximum sum-rate capacity in the asymptotic
case of $N \to \infty$ and different ranges of SNR is studied. In the fixed and
low SNR regimes, it is demonstrated that to achieve the maximum sum-rate, an
infinite amount of feedback is required. Moreover, in order to reduce the gap
to the optimum sum-rate to zero, in the fixed SNR regime, the minimum amount of
feedback scales as $\theta(\ln \ln \ln N)$, which is achievable by the Random
Beam-Forming scheme proposed in [14]. In the high SNR regime, two cases are
considered; in the case of $K < M$, it is proved that the minimum amount of
feedback bits to reduce the gap between the achievable sum-rate and the maximum
sum-rate to zero grows logaritmically with SNR, which is achievable by the
""Generalized Random Beam-Forming"" scheme, proposed in [18]. In the case of $K =
M$, it is shown that by using the Random Beam-Forming scheme and the total
amount of feedback not growing with SNR, the maximum sum-rate capacity is
achieved.

group theory for studying the algebraic complexity of matrix multiplication, as
developed by H. Cohn, C. Umans et. al. in 2003 and 2005. The measure of
complexity here is the exponent of matrix multiplication, a real parameter
between 2 and 3, which has been conjectured to be 2. More specifically, a
finite group may simultaneously ""realize"" several independent matrix
multiplications via its regular algebra if it has a family of triples of
""index"" subsets which satisfy the so-called simultaneous triple product
property (STPP), in which case the complexity of these several multiplications
does not exceed the rank (complexity) of the algebra. This leads to bounds for
the exponent in terms of the size of the group and the sizes of its STPP
triples, as well as the dimensions of its distinct irreducible representations.
Wreath products of Abelian with symmetric groups appear especially important,
in this regard, and we give an example of such a group which shows that the
exponent is less than 2.84, and could be possibly be as small as 2.02 depending
on the number of simultaneous matrix multiplications it realizes.

${\bf g}^*$. We show the dependence of the inertia principle on the lapse and
the shift. Using the formalism of linearized gravitation, we obtain the
non-relativistic limit of ${\bf g}^*$ in terms of two integrals. We follow then
two approaches. In the first one, these integrals are calculated in the actual
time section $t=t_0$ up to the distance $R_U=ct_0$. In the more exact and
satisfactory second approach, they are calculated over the past light cone
using the formalism of the retarded potentials. The aim is to find whether the
acceleration $\dot{\bf v}$ in the LHS of Newton's second law can be interpreted
as a reactive acceleration, in other words, as minus the acceleration of
gravity ${\bf g}^*$ in the rest frame of the accelerated particle ({\it i. e.}
to know whether or not ${\bf g}^*=-\dot{\bf v}$). The results strongly support
Mach's idea since the reactive acceleration for $\Omega_\Lambda =0.7$ turns out
to be about ${\bf g}^*=-1.1 \dot{\bf v}$, in the first approach, and about
${\bf g}^*= -0.7 \dot{\bf v}$, in the second. These results depend little on
$\Omega_\Lambda$ if $\Omega_\Lambda<0.9$. Even considering the approximations
and idealizations made during the calculations, we deem these results as
interesting and encouraging.

high-entropy branch is expected to be stable and the low-entropy branch to be

perturbations around the solutions. Perturbations are decomposed into scalar,
vector and tensor sectors according to the representation of the 4D de Sitter

Hubble expansion rates on the branes are too large, there appears a tachyonic

unstable. We show analytically that the onset of the thermodynamic instability

Wodzicki residue) is essentially proportional to the zeta function value at

  There is a similar definition of the operator log_theta B, when the spectral

to provide information on what we call C.I.0-ideals (those such that the
corresponding quotient is a complete intersection of dimension zero) and also
on chains of C.I.0-ideals. A correspondence is established between C.I.0-ideals
and a certain kind of matrices which we call $x$-nice, and a chain of
C.I.0-ideals corresponds to a factorization of some $x$-nice matrix. When the
local ring $A$ itself is a complete intersection of dimension zero, a
C.I.0-ideal is necessarily of the form $(0:bA)$ for some $b\in A$. Some
criteria are provided to recognize whether an ideal $(0:bA)$ is C.I.0 or not.
When $y$ is a minimal generator of the maximal ideal of $A$, it is also proved
that the ideals $yA$ and $(0:yA)$ are C.I.0 simultaneously and that this is the
case exactly when the ideal $(0:yA)$ is principal. These C.I.0-ideals of the
form $(0:yA)$, $y$ being a minimal generator of the maximal ideal, are
investigated. They are of interest because the smallest nonnull C.I.0-ideal in
a strict chain of C.I.0-ideals of the maximal length is necessarily of that
form, and their existence has some implications for a realization of the ring,
i.e. for the way the ring can can be viewed as a quotient of a regular local

prove the conjecture under a geometric regularity condition for the imaginary

Galois group is purely of local type. Without this regularity assumption at
$p$, we present a review of the known situations in the critical case and in
the non-critical case for the realizations associated to Hecke characters over

scaling regimes and on the anomalous scaling of the structure functions of a
passive scalar advected by a Gaussian solenoidal velocity field with finite
correlation time is investigated by the field theoretic renormalization group
and operator product expansion within one-loop approximation. Possible scaling
regimes are found and classified in the plane of exponents $\epsilon-\eta$,
where $\epsilon$ characterizes the energy spectrum of the velocity field in the
inertial range $E\propto k^{1-2\epsilon}$, and $\eta$ is related to the
correlation time of the velocity field at the wave number $k$ which is scaled
as $k^{-2+\eta}$. It is shown that the presence of anisotropy does not disturb
the stability of the infrared fixed points of the renormalization group
equations which are directly related to the corresponding scaling regimes. The
influence of anisotropy on the anomalous scaling of the structure functions of
the passive scalar field is studied as a function of the fixed point value of
the parameter $u$ which represents the ratio of turnover time of scalar field
and velocity correlation time. It is shown that the corresponding one-loop
anomalous dimensions, which are the same (universal) for all particular models
with concrete value of $u$ in the isotropic case, are different (nonuniversal)
in the case with the presence of small-scale anisotropy and they are continuous
functions of the anisotropy parameters, as well as the parameter $u$. The
dependence of the anomalous dimensions on the anisotropy parameters of two
special limits of the general model, namely, the rapid-change model and the
frozen velocity field model, are found when $u\to \infty$ and $u\to 0$,

Nucleons bound in a nucleus have a reduced effective mass due to the mean
field. This results in off-energy-shell scatterings modifying the free-space
NN-interaction by a dispersion correction. This is a major contribution to the
density-dependence of the effective in-medium force and to saturation.
Low-momentum effective interactions have been derived by renormalisation
methods whereby correlations may be reduced by effectively cutting off high
momentum components of the interaction. The effect of these cut-offs on
dispersive corrections and on saturation is the main focus of this paper. The
role of the tensor-force, its strength and its effect on correlations is of
particular interest. The importance of the definition of the mean field in
determining saturation as well as compressibility is also pointed out.
  With a cut-off below $\sim 2.6 fm^{-1}$ there is no saturation but at lower
density the binding energy is still well approximated suggesting that such a
force may be useful in nuclear structure calculations of (small) finite nuclei
if saturation is not an issue.
  A separable interaction that fits experimental phase-shifts exactly by
inverse scattering methods is used. Recent experiments measure short ranged
correlations (SRC's) to be 0.23 for $^{56}Fe$. Other experiments have obtained
a depletion of occupation-numbers in $^{208}Pb$ to be $\sim 0.2$. For nuclear
matter with the separable interaction and a continuous spectrum we obtain the
related quantity $\kappa$ to be 0.175 with the Bonn-B deuteron parameters,

this dynamics and the binding to functional sites must be controled with a
certain specificity for living organisms to be able to elicit specific cellular
responses. Specificity stems here from the interplay between binding affinity
and cellular abundancy of transcription factor proteins and the binding of such
proteins to DNA is thus controlled by their chemical potential.
  We combine large-scale protein abundance data in the budding yeast with
binding affinities for all transcription factors with known DNA binding site
sequences to assess the behavior of their chemical potentials. A sizable
fraction of transcription factors is apparently bound non-specifically to DNA
and the observed abundances are marginally sufficient to ensure high
occupations of the functional sites. We argue that a biological cause of this

physiological levels do not yield significant binding of functional targets and
mis-expressions of regulated genes are thus tamed.
