outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion
curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler
tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending
from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the
theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and

extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence

close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the

Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter

with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson
and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to
dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look
for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests
that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by
ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool
gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of
the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of
the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal
significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8
mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer
periods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that
provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features
within the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of
the comprehensive dynamic simulations.

was studied empirically based on extensive simulations for 5 test cases using
many different discretizations. The quality of the extrapolation improves with
refining discretization reaching extraordinary performance especially for
cubically shaped particles. A two order of magnitude decrease of error was
demonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which were
proven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separate
shape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case.

always be traced to a single dominant lensing object and we study the mass and
redshift distribution of these primary lenses. We fit analytic models to the
simulated dark halos in order to study how our optical depth measurements are
affected by the limited resolution of the simulation and of the lensing planes

underestimate total strong-lensing cross sections by about 15 percent. This is
smaller than the effects expected from our neglect of the baryonic components
of galaxies. Finally we investigate whether strong lensing is enhanced by
material in front of or behind the primary lens. Although strong lensing
lines-of-sight are indeed biased towards higher than average mean densities,
this additional matter typically contributes only a few percent of the total
surface density.

own Galaxy or Earth. To consider the signal that may be correlated with Earth,
a correlate-by-eye exercise was attempted by overlaying the CMB map from

Remarkably, several hot spots in the CMB map are found to be well aligned with
either large cities on Earth or regions of high altitude. To further study the
correlations between Earth and CMB, we performed a complicated
cross-correlation analysis in the multipole space. The overall correlations are
detected at more than 5 sigma confidence level. These results can be naively
interpreted to suggest that large angular scale fluctuations in CMB are
generated on Earth by a process that traces the altitude relative to a mean
radius. Simply extending our analysis, we suggest that cross-correlations
between CMB and any other map of a Solar system body, image of a person, or an
image of an animal will be detected at some statistical significance. It is
unclear how Occam's razor can be applied in such a situation to identify which
sources are responsible for CMB fluctuations.

absorption features in the near-infrared JH-band spectrum reveal
characteristics seen in both mid-L, and L-T transition type dwarfs. We suggest
these may be attributable to holes in the condensate cloud layers in the

rule out the role of binarity as the possible cause. We also identify this

that the temperature (and thus spectral type) at which the condensate cloud
later begins to break-up/rain out, may be highly sensitive to small variations
in metallicity. However, the JH-band spectrum of this object does not resemble
that of the known L sub-dwarfs, and therefore extreme metal deficiency may not
in fact be responsible for the discordant features. We estimate a spectral type
of L9+/-1, and measure a large proper-motion of \mu_(tot)=1.65""+/-0.03"" per
year. Also, a spectrophotometric distance of 8.2pc is estimated, possibly
making this object the nearest easily observable single L-T transition object

provide valuable probes of collisionless heating efficiency in high Mach number

broad Ly beta and O VI lines to estimate the degree of electron-proton and
proton-oxygen ion equilibration in DEM L 71, 0509-67.5, and 0519-69.0. Although
our equilibration estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty due to the
faintness of the FUV lines and contributions from bulk Doppler broadening, our
results are consistent with a declining efficiency of electron- proton and
proton-oxygen ion equilibration with increasing shock speed. From our shock
velocity estimates we obtain ages of 295-585 years for 0509-67.5 and 520-900

that applicable to the lens. The line tension defined this way turns out to be
independent of choices of the Gibbs dividing interfaces. In the case of the

approximate signal template. For this second stage only precise information on
the orbit period and approximate information on the orbital semi-major axis are
required apriori. For the final stage we propose a fully coherent Markov chain
monte carlo based follow up search on the frequency subspace defined by the
candidates identified by the second stage. This search is particularly suited
to the low-mass X-ray binaries, for which orbital period and sky position are
typically well known and additional orbital parameters and neutron star spin
frequency are not. We note that for the accreting X-ray millisecond pulsars,
for which spin frequency and orbital parameters are well known, the second
stage can be omitted and the fully coherent search stage can be performed. We
describe the search pipeline with respect to its application to a simplified
phase model and derive the corresponding sensitivity of the search.

fractional D3-branes on the singular (Klebanov-Tseytlin) and resolved (Pando
Zayas-Tseytlin) conifolds. We agree with earlier results that only the singular
solution allows a supersymmetric flux, but point out the importance of using
the correct complex structure to reach this conclusion.

scale-invariant on small scales, but has an interesting scale-dependence on
large and intermediate scales, where scalar-induced gravitational waves do not
redshift and are hence enhanced relative to the background density of the
Universe. This contribution to the tensor spectrum is significantly different
in form from the direct model-dependent primordial tensor spectrum and,
although small in magnitude, it dominates the primordial signal for some

cancellation between a flatter away-side parton spectra due to the requirement

compare the ground-state properties calculated in these two descriptions of
