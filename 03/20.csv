the problem of ""relative"" calibrations, from that of ""absolute"" calibrations;
the absolute calibration is reduced to determining a few numbers for the entire

errors, allowing one to isolate particular error modes in downstream analyses.
Applying this to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging data, we achieve ~1%
relative calibration errors across 8500 sq.deg. in griz; the errors are ~2% for
the u band. These errors are dominated by unmodelled atmospheric variations at
Apache Point Observatory. These calibrations, dubbed ""ubercalibration"", are now

the intra-night linking of detections into `tracks' currently has an accuracy

  Surveys","MSc thesis. 89 pages",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Modern cosmological observations clearly reveal that the universe contains a
hierarchy of clustering. However, recent surveys show a transition to
homogeneity on large scales. The exact scale at which this transition occurs is
still a topic of much debate. There has been much work done in trying to
characterise the galaxy distribution using multifractals. However, for a number
of years the size, depth and accuracy of galaxy surveys was regarded as
insufficient to give a definitive answer. One of the main problems which arises
in a multifractal analysis is how to deal with observational selection effects:
ie `masks' in the survey region and a geometric boundary to the survey itself.
  In this thesis I will introduce a volume boundary correction which is rather
similar to the approach developed by Pan and Coles in 2001, but which improves
on their angular boundary correction in two important respects: firstly, our
volume correction `throws away' fewer galaxies close the boundary of a given
data set and secondly it is computationally more efficient.
  After application of our volume correction, I will then show how the
underlying generalised dimensions of a given point set can be computed. I will
apply this procedure to calculate the generalised fractal dimensions of both
simulated fractal point sets and mock galaxy surveys which mimic the properties
of the recent IRAS PSCz catalogue.

Swift satellite over 160 days of its 2006 outburst with the XRT and UVOT
instruments. At the start of the observations, the XRT spectra show that the
0.6-10 keV emission is dominated by an optically thick, geometrically thin
accretion disk with an inner disk temperature of $\sim0.8$ keV, indicating that
the source was in a high/soft state during the initial outburst phase. We
tracked the source through its decline into the low/hard state with the
accretion disk cooling to $\sim 0.2 \mathrm{keV}$ and the inner disk radius
consistent with the innermost stable circular orbit at all times. Furthermore,
the X-ray luminosity roughly follows $L_X \propto T^4$ during the decline,
consistent with a geometrically stable blackbody. These results are the
strongest evidence yet obtained that accretion disks do not automatically
recede after a state transition, down to accretion rates as low as $0.001
L_{Edd}$. Meanwhile, the near-UV flux does not track the X-ray disk flux, and
is well in excess of what is predicted if the near-UV emission is from viscous
dissipation in the outer disk. The strong correlation between the hard X-ray
flux and the near-UV flux, which scale as $L_X^{0.5}$, indicate that
reprocessed emission is most likely the dominate contribution to the near-UV
flux. We discuss our results within the context of accretion disks and the
overall accretion flow geometry in accreting black holes.

present, the link between the X-rays and the stellar wind is unclear. New
XMM-Newton observations have been performed around periastron and apastron
passages in September 2005, when the stellar wind activity was apparently
higher. April 2005 Chandra observations on LS 5039 are also revisited.
Moreover, a compilation of Halpha EW data obtained since 1992, from which the
stellar mass loss evolution can be approximately inferred, is carried out.
XMM-Newton observations show higher and harder emission around apastron than
around periastron. No signatures of thermal emission or a reflection iron line
indicating the presence of an accretion disk are found in the spectrum, and the
hydrogen column density (NH) is compatible with being the same in both
observations and consistent with the interstellar value. 2005 Chandra
observations show a hard X-ray spectrum, and possibly high fluxes. The Halpha
EW shows yearly variations of a ~ 10%, and does not seem to be correlated with
X-ray fluxes obtained at similar phases, unlike it would be expected in the
wind accretion scenario. 2005 XMM-Newton and Chandra observations are
consistent with 2003 RXTE/PCA results. The constancy of the NH seems to imply
that either the X-ray emitter is located at >~ 1012 cm from the compact object,
or the real N_H is 3-27 times smaller than the one predicted by a spherical
symmetric wind model. We suggest that the multiwavelength non-thermal emission
of LS 5039 is related to the radio jets and unlikely produced inside the binary

spectra for 772 sources, with flux densities above 0.15 mJy in the infrared,
and 0.09 mJy in the radio. The redshifts measured in this survey are mostly in
the range 0 < z < 0.4, with a distribution peaking at z = 0.2. Detailed
spectral analysis of our sources reveals that the majority are emission-line
star-forming galaxies, with star formation rates in the range 0.2-200 Msun/yr.
The rates estimated from the H-alpha line fluxes are found to be on average
consistent with those derived from the 1.4 GHz luminosities. For these
star-forming systems, we find that the 24 micron and 1.4 GHz flux densities
follow an infrared-radio correlation, that can be characterized by a value of
q24 = 0.83, with a 1-sigma scatter of 0.31. Our WIYN/Hydra database of spectra
complements nicely those obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, in the
region at lower redshift, as well as the MMT/Hectospec survey of Papovich et
al. (2006), and brings the redshift completeness to 70% for sources brighter
than 2 mJy at 24 micron. Applying the classical 1/Vmax method, we derive new 24

We find evidence for evolution in both the 1.4 GHz and 24 micron luminosity

identify the system's quiescent counterpart. Using Chandra, we have found a
very likely counterpart. The candidate counterpart is close to the center of
the Uhuru error region and has a thermal spectrum. The 0.3-8 keV spectrum is
well-described by a neutron star atmosphere model with an effective temperature
of 131+/-21 eV. For a neutron star with a 10 km radius, the implied source
distance is 10(+12)(-4) kpc, and the X-ray luminosity is 1.9E33 ergs/s assuming
a distance of 10 kpc. Accretion from a companion star is likely required to
maintain the temperature of this neutron star, which would imply that it is an
X-ray binary and therefore, almost certainly the 4U 1730-22 counterpart. We do
not detect an optical source at the position of the Chandra source down to R >

gas mass and temperature). The scatter in the relation is dominated by cluster
cores, and a tight LY relation (11% intrinsic scatter in Lx) is recovered if
sufficiently large core regions (0.15R500) are excluded. The intrinsic scatter
is well described by a lognormal distribution and the relations are consistent
for relaxed and disturbed/merging clusters. We investigate the LY relation in
low-quality data (e.g. for clusters detected in X-ray survey data) by
estimating Lx from soft band count rates, and find that the scatter increases
somewhat to 21%. We confirm the tight correlation between Yx and mass and the
self-similar evolution of that scaling relation out to z=0.6 for a subset of
clusters in our sample with mass estimates from the literature. This is used to
estimate masses for the entire sample and hence measure the LM relation. We
find that the scatter in the LM relation is much lower than previous estimates,
due to the full removal of cluster cores and more robust mass estimates. For
high-redshift clusters the scatter in the LM relation remains low if cluster
cores are not excluded. These results suggest that cluster masses can be
reliably estimated from simple luminosity measurements in low quality data
where direct mass estimates, or measurements of Yx are not possible. This has
important applications in the estimation of cosmological parameters from X-ray

13.6 eV and for redshifts out to 6 (called here the intergalactic background
light or IBL). From these calculations of the IBL at various redshifts, they
predict the present and past optical depth of the universe to high energy
gamma-rays owing to interactions with photons of the IBL and the 2.7 K CMB. We
discuss here how this proceedure can be reversed by looking for sharp cutoffs
in the spectra of extragalactic gamma-ray sources such as blazars at high
redshifts in the multi-GeV energy range with GLAST. By determining the cutoff
energies of sources with known redshifts, we can refine our determination of
the IBL photon densities in the past, i.e., the ""archeo-IBL"", and therefore get
a better measure of the past history of the total star formation rate.
Conversely, observations of sharp high energy cutoffs in the gamma-ray spectra

this series, we already showed that ~30% (to <60% if extrapolating the LF) of
the metals are observed in all z~2.5 galaxies detected in current surveys.
Here, we extend our analysis to the metals outside galaxies, i.e. in
intergalactic medium (IGM), using observational data and analytical
calculations. Our results for the two are strikingly similar: (1)
Observationally, we find that, besides the small (5%) contribution of DLAs, the
forest and sub-DLAs contribute subtantially to make <30--45% of the metal
budget, but neither of these appear to be sufficient to close the metal budget.
The forest accounts for 15--30% depending on the UV background, and sub-DLAs
for >2% to <17% depending on the ionization fraction. Together, the `missing
metals' problem is substantially eased. (2) We perform analytical calculations
based on the effective yield--mass relation. At z=2, we find that the method
predicts that 2$--50% of the metals have been ejected from galaxies into the
IGM, consistent with the observations. The metal ejection is predominantly by
L<1/3L_B^*(z=2) galaxies, which are responsible for 90% the metal enrichment,
while the 50 percentile is at L~1/10L^*_B(z=2). As a consequence, if indeed 50%
of the metals have been ejected from galaxies, 3--5 bursts of star formation
are required per galaxy prior to z=2. The ratio between the mass of metals
outside galaxies to those in stars has changed from z=2 to z=0: it was 2:1 or
1:1 and is now 1:8 or 1:9. This evolution implies that a significant fraction
of the IGM metals will cool and fall back into galaxies.

clusters, comparison of the Balmer emission lines with model equivalent widths
(EWs) yields ages less than 10 Myr. Two spectra display Balmer absorption lines
typical of star clusters dominated by A-type stars, with estimated ages of
about 170 Myr. These ages are comparable to the dynamical age of the tidal
tails and are consistent with star formation triggered during the first passage
of the pair. The locations of these two clusters in the tidal tails are
generally consistent with predictions of shock-induced star formation models.
One of these older objects appears unresolved on the image and is luminous
enough to qualify as a young globular cluster. Using EWs of the diagnostic

that in the $R_F$ band is about 85% from $16^m.5$ to $19^m.5$. Transformed to
the SuperCOSMOS system and downgraded to the limiting magnitudes of
SuperCOSMOS, the star counts in the northern Galactic cap from SDSS show up to
an $16.9\pm6.3%$ asymmetric ratio (defined as relative fluctuations over the

called ``main correlation'' can be interpreted as indicative of a sequence of
various interstellar radiation fields with a common FIR optical property of
grains. In this paper, we constrain the FIR optical properties of grains by
comparing the calculated FIR colours with the observational main correlation.
We show that neither of the ``standard'' grain species (i.e. astronomical
silicate and graphite grains) reproduces the main correlation. However, if the
emissivity index at ~ 100--200 um is changed to ~ 1--1.5 (not ~ 2 as the above
two species), the main correlation can be successfully explained. Thus, we
propose that the FIR emissivity index is ~ 1--1.5 for the dust in the Galaxy
and the Magellanic Clouds at ~ 100--200 um. We also consider the origin of the
minor correlation called ``sub-correlation'', which can be used to estimate the

the individual distribution of photometric spots on the surface of a rotating

amplitude of LCs we introduce a robust quantity effective amplitude. Applying
the PCA to the set of the effective amplitudes of the LCs in all five colours
we revealed at least three different sources of the light variability showing
different wavelength dependence. The amplitudes of all the LCs harbor a
component monotonously decreasing with increasing wavelengths. The second

have resulted in rather unexpected detections of X-ray emission from late
B-type and early A-type stars. These stars possess neither winds like
early-type stars nor convective envelopes as late-type stars, so that the
origin and production mechanism of this X-emission is unclear. Aims: We
investigate whether the presence of large magnetic fields is related to the
observed X-ray emission. Methods: We carried out Chandra high-angular
resolution observations of a sample of late B-type and A-type stars with
measured magnetic fields in the range from 0.2 - 17 kG. Out of the selected 10
sample stars, 6 objects had been previously detected as X-ray sources, some of
them, however, with high positional uncertainty and a low signal-to-noise
ratio, while 4 of our sample stars do have large magnetic fields but no
previous detections of X-ray emission. Results: Our Chandra data confirm all
previous ROSAT detections with an extremely high significance, and the limits
of the offsets between X-ray and optical positions are greatly improved. In
particular, HD 215441, known as Babcock's star with the strongest magnetic
field by far (17 kG) of our sample stars, a rather faint and somewhat marginal
ROSAT source, can clearly be detected. However, none of the 4 ROSAT
non-detections could be detected with the new Chandra observations.
Conclusions: The pure existence of a magnetic field of kiloGauss strength on a
late B-type or A-type star is therefore not necessarily a prerequisite for
finding X-ray emission among these stars. Understanding the observed X-ray
emission from Babcock's star is a challenge for observational and theoretical
astrophysics.

CINECA, an IBM Cluster with 1024 Intel Xeon Pentium IV 3.0 Ghz. The results
show that it is possible to run a 64 Million particle simulation in less than
15 minutes for each timestep, and the code scalability with the number of

N-Body simulations with more than $10^{9}$ particles with the higher resolution
of a pure tree code. The FLY new version will be available at

K-corrections of SNe Ia and their uncertainties have become especially
important in the determination of cosmological parameters. While K-corrections

diversity in spectral features of SNe Ia can also be important. For an
individual observation, the statistical errors from the inhomogeneity in
spectral features range from 0.01 (where the observed and rest-frame filters
are aligned) to 0.04 (where the observed and rest-frame filters are
misaligned). To minimize the systematic errors caused by an assumed SN Ia
spectral energy distribution (SED), we outline a prescription for deriving a
mean spectral template time series which incorporates a large and heterogeneous
sample of observed spectra. We then remove the effects of broad-band colors and
measure the remaining uncertainties in the K-corrections associated with the

in this way, is surrounded on either side by a bath of liquid with which it can
easily exchange particles. Since height fluctuations of the interface cost
energy, this interface is constrained to remain flat at all length scales.
However, when such a solid is stressed by altering the depth of the potential;
beyond a certain limit, it responds by relieving stress by novel interfacial
fluctuations which involve addition or deletion of entire lattice layers of the
crystal. This ``layering'' transition is a generic feature of the system
regardless of the details of the interaction potential. We show how such
interfacial fluctuations influence mass, momentum and energy transport across
the interface. Tiny momentum impulses produce weak shock waves which travel
through the interface and cause the spallation of crystal layers into the
liquid. Kinetic and energetic constraints prevent spallation of partial layers
from the crystal, a fact which may be of some practical use. We also study heat
transport through the liquid-solid interface and obtain the resistances in
liquid, solid and interfacial regions (Kapitza resistance) as the solid
undergoes such layering transitions. Heat conduction, which shows strong
signatures of the structural transformations, can be understood using a free

an interacting Bose gas, the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ is written as a decoupled
sum of contributions from different momenta of the form $\hat{H} = \sum_{k\neq

diagonalized separately, and the resulting ground state wavefunction of the
total Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ is written as a simple product of the ground state
wavefunctions of each of the single-mode Hamiltonians $\hat{H}_{k}$. We argue
that, from a number-conserving perspective, this diagonalization method may not
be adequate since the true Hilbert spaces where the Hamiltonians
${\hat{H}_{k}}$ should be diagonalized all have the ${k}=0$ state in common,
and hence the ground state wavefunction of the total Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ may
{not} be written as a simple product of the ground state wavefunctions of the
$\hat{H}_{k}$'s. In this paper, we give a thorough review of Bogoliubov's
method, and discuss a variational and number-conserving formulation of this
theory in which the ${k}=0$ state is restored to the Hilbert space of the
interacting gas, and where, instead of diagonalizing the Hamiltonians
$\hat{H}_{k}$ separately, we diagonalize the total Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ as a
whole. When this is done, we find that the ground state energy is lowered below
the Bogoliubov result, and the depletion of bosons is significantly reduced
with respect to the one obtained in the number non-conserving treatment. We
also find that the spectrum of the usual $\alpha_{k}$ excitations of
Bogoliubov's method changes from a gapless one, as predicted by the standard,
number non-conserving formulation of this theory, to one which exhibits a
finite gap in the $k\to 0$ limit.

size r, shows a crossover at a characteristic length r_c, from a rapid increase

\alpha_1\approx 1 is explained by the large height differences in the borders
of the grains when compared to intragrain roughness, and must not be
interpreted as a consequence of a diffusion dominated intragrain dynamics. This
exponent shows a weak dependence on the shape and size distribution of the
grains, and typically ranges from 0.85 for rounded grain surfaces to 1 for the
sharpest ones. The scaling corrections of exactly solvable models suggest the
possibility of slightly smaller values due to other smoothing effects of the

networks is carried by the firing rate code or by the firing temporal code. The
current status of the rivalry between the two codes is briefly reviewed with
the recent studies such as the brain-machine interface (BMI). Then we have
proposed a generalized rate model based on the {\it finite} $N$-unit Langevin
model subjected to additive and/or multiplicative noises, in order to
understand the firing property of a cluster containing $N$ neurons. The
stationary property of the rate model has been studied with the use of the
Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) method. Our rate model is shown to yield various
kinds of stationary distributions such as the interspike-interval distribution
expressed by non-Gaussians including gamma, inverse-Gaussian-like and
log-normal-like distributions.
  The dynamical property of the generalized rate model has been studied with
the use of the augmented moment method (AMM) which was developed by the author
[H. Hasegawa, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 75 (2006) 033001]. From the macroscopic point
of view in the AMM, the property of the $N$-unit neuron cluster is expressed in
terms of {\it three} quantities; $\mu$, the mean of spiking rates of $R=(1/N)
\sum_i r_i$ where $r_i$ denotes the firing rate of a neuron $i$ in the cluster:
$\gamma$, averaged fluctuations in local variables ($r_i$): $\rho$,
fluctuations in global variable ($R$). We get equations of motions of the three
quantities, which show $\rho \sim \gamma/N$ for weak couplings. This implies
that the population rate code is generally more reliable than the single-neuron
rate code. Our rate model is extended and applied to an ensemble containing
multiple neuron clusters.

holes whose density and thermal evolution - notably via their interaction with
defects - are shown to determine the clustering and growth rates of Ag
nanocrystals. We thus establish the influence of redox interactions of defects
and silver (poly)ions. The mechanisms are similar to the latent image formation
in photography: irradiation-induced photoelectrons are trapped within the glass
matrix, notably on dissolved noble metal ions and defects, which are thus
neutralized (reverse oxidation reactions are also shown to exist). Annealing
promotes metal atom diffusion, which in turn leads to cluster nuclei formation.
The cluster density depends not only on the irradiation fluence, but also - and
primarily - on the density of deposited energy and the redox properties of the
glass. Ion irradiation (i.e., large deposited energy density) is far more
effective in cluster formation, despite its lower neutralization efficiency
(from Ag+ to Ag0) as compared to gamma photon irradiation.

properties. However, this modification is not enough and a small additional

the detector set-up and WIMP properties. We consider WIMPs with an interaction
cross-section of \sigma_{\rm p} = 10^{-7} {\rm pb} (just below current
exclusion limits) and assume, initially, that the local WIMP velocity
distribution and density are known and that the experiment has negligible
background. For light WIMPs (mass significantly less than that of the target
nuclei) small variations in the WIMP mass lead to significant changes in the
energy spectrum. Conversely for heavy WIMPs the energy spectrum depends only
weakly on the WIMP mass. Consequently it will be far easier to measure the WIMP
mass if it is light than if it is heavy. With exposures of {\cal E}= 3 \times
10^{3}, 3 \times 10^{4} and 3 \times 10^{5} {\rm kg day} (corresponding,
roughly, to the three proposed phases of SuperCDMS) it will be possible, given
the optimistic assumptions mentioned above, to measure the mass of a light WIMP
with an accuracy of roughly 25%, 15% and 2.5 % respectively. These numbers
increase with increasing WIMP mass, and for heavy WIMPs, m_{\chi} > {\cal
O}(500 {\rm GeV}), even with a large exposure it will only be possible to place
a lower limit on the mass. Finally we discuss the validity of the various
assumptions made, and the consequences if these assumptions are not valid. In
particular if the local WIMP distribution is composed of a number of discrete
streams it will not be possible to determine the WIMP mass.

must define a conserved stress tensor living on the stretched horizon. Then one
is required to show that such a stress tensor satisfies the corresponding

two different channels, shear and sound. We find an expression for the shear

computations in the perturbative Chern-Simons theory are carried out using the

that the connected correlators of the puncture operator in the Penner model,
are related to the connected correlators of the operator that gives the Wilson

  The existence of a positivity predicate on a locale, i.e. the locale being
overt, or open, has proved to be fundamental in constructive locale theory. We
show that the two notions are intimately connected. Bishop defines a metric
space to be compact if it is complete and totally bounded. A subset of a
totally bounded set is again totally bounded iff it is located. So a closed
subset of a Bishop compact set is Bishop compact iff it is located. We
translate this result to formal topology. `Bishop compact' is translated as
compact and overt. We propose a definition of located predicate on subspaces in
formal topology. We call a sublocale located if it can be presented by a formal
topology with a located predicate. We prove that a closed sublocale of a
compact regular locale has a located predicate iff it is overt. Moreover, a
Bishop-closed subset of a complete metric space is Bishop compact -- that is,
totally bounded and complete -- iff its localic completion is compact overt.
Finally, we show by elementary methods that the points of the Vietoris locale
of a compact regular locale are precisely its compact overt sublocales. We work
constructively, predicatively and avoid the use of the axiom of countable
choice. Consequently, all our results are valid in any predicative topos.

number field which we call the periodic direction field. We show that

the geometric information of a compact riemannian spin manifold M is encoded
within its Dirac operator D. Especially via Connes' distance formula one is
able to extract from the spectral properties of D the geodesic distance on M.
In this paper we investigate the distance d encoded within a covariant Dirac
operator on a trivial U(n)-fiber bundle over the circle with arbitrary
connection. It turns out that the connected components of d are tori whose
dimension is given by the holonomy of the connection. For n=2 we explicitly
compute d on all the connected components. For n>2 we restrict to a given fiber
and find that the distance is given by the trace of the module of a matrix. The
latest is defined by the holonomy and the coordinates of the points under
consideration. This paper extends to arbitrary n and arbitrary connection the
results obtained in hep-th/0506147 for U(2)-bundle with constant connection. It
confirms interesting properties of the spectral distance with respect to
another distance naturally associated to connection, namely the horizontal or
Carnot-Caratheodory distance d_H. Especially in case the connection has
irrational components, the connected components for d are the closure of the
connected components of d_H within the euclidean topology on the torus.

integrating two powerful concepts: the {\it ab-initio} NCSM with that of the
$\mathrm{Sp}(3,\mathbb{R})\supset\mathrm{SU}(3)$ group-theoretical approach.
The NCSM uses modern realistic nuclear interactions in model spaces that
consists of many-body configurations up to a given number of $\hbar\Omega$
excitations together with modern high-performance parallel computing
techniques. The symplectic theory extends this picture by recognizing that when
deformed configurations dominate, which they often do, the model space can be
better selected so less relevant low-lying $\hbar\Omega$ configurations yield
to more relevant high-lying $\hbar\Omega$ configurations, ones that respect a
near symplectic symmetry found in the Hamiltonian. Results from an application
of the Sp-NCSM to light nuclei are compared with those for the NCSM and with
experiment.

major discovery which still awaits adequate explanation. It is generally agreed
that this implies a cosmic repulsion as a result of the existence of a
cosmological constant . However, estimates of the cosmological constant, based
on calculations of the zero-point fluctuations of quantum fields are too large
by over a hundred orders of magnitude. This result is obtained by summing the
zero-point energies up to a large cutoff energy, based on the Planck scale.
Since there is no compelling reason for this choice, we argue that since all
known quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects involves interaction with matter, a
preferred choice should be based on causality and other considerations, leading
to a much lower value for the cosmological constant .

(Langmuir kinetics) in both lanes under open boundary conditions. Our model can
describe the directed motion of molecular motors, attachment and detachment of
motors, and free inter-lane transition of motors between filaments. In this
paper, we focus on some finite-size effects of the system because normally the
sizes of most real systems are finite and small (e.g., size $\leq 10,000$). A
special finite-size effect of the two-lane system has been observed, which is
that the density wall moves left first and then move towards the right with the
increase of the lane-changing rate. We called it the jumping effect. We find
that increasing attachment and detachment rates will weaken the jumping effect.
We also confirmed that when the size of the two-lane system is large enough,
the jumping effect disappears, and the two-lane system has a similar density
profile to a single-lane TASEP coupled with Langmuir kinetics. Increasing
lane-changing rates has little effect on density and current after the density
reaches maximum. Also, lane-changing rate has no effect on density profiles of
a two-lane TASEP coupled with Langmuir kinetics at a large
attachment/detachment rate and/or a large system size. Mean-field approximation
is presented and it agrees with our Monte Carlo simulations.
