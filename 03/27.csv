  submitted","Phys.Rev.D77:043525,2008","10.1103/PhysRevD.77.043525",,"astro-ph",,"  The baryonic acoustic signature in the large-scale clustering pattern of
galaxies has been detected in the two-point correlation function. Its precise
spatial scale has been forwarded as a rigid-rod ruler test for the space-time
geometry, and hence as a probe for tracking the evolution of Dark Energy.
Percent-level shifts in the measured position can bias such a test and erode
its power to constrain cosmology. This paper addresses some of the systematic
effects that might induce shifts: namely non-linear corrections from matter
evolution, redshift space distortions and biasing. We tackle these questions
through analytic methods and through a large battery of numerical simulations,
with total volume of the order ~100[Gpc\h]^3. A toy-model calculation shows
that if the non-linear corrections simply smooth the acoustic peak, then this
gives rise to an `apparent' shifting to smaller scales. However if tilts in the
broad band power spectrum are induced then this gives rise to more pernicious
`physical' shifts. Our numerical simulations show evidence of both: in real
space and at z=0, for the dark matter we find percent level shifts; for haloes
the shifts depend on halo mass, with larger shifts being found for the most
biased samples, up to 3%. From our analysis we find that physical shifts are
greater than ~0.4% at z=0. In redshift space these effects are exacerbated, but
at higher redshifts are alleviated. We develop an analytical model to
understand this, based on solutions to the pair conservation equation using
characteristic curves. When combined with modeling of pairwise velocities the
model reproduces the main trends found in the data. The model may also help to
unbias the acoustic peak.

  Collapse","8 pages, 9 figures","Phys.Rev.D76:063002,2007","10.1103/PhysRevD.76.063002",,"astro-ph hep-ph",,"  In concordance cosmology, dark matter density perturbations generated by
inflation lead to nonlinear, virialized minihalos, into which baryons collapse
at redshift $z \sim 20$. We survey here novel baryon evolution produced by a
modification of the power spectrum from white noise density perturbations at
scales below $k \sim 10 h {Mpc}^{-1}$ (the smallest scales currently measured
with the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest). Exotic dark matter dynamics, such as would
arise from scalar dark matter with a late phase transition (similar to an
axion, but with lower mass), create such an amplification of small scale power.
The dark matter produced in such a phase transition collapses into minihalos,
with a size given by the dark matter mass within the horizon at the phase
transition. If the mass of the initial minihalos is larger than $\sim 10^{-3}
M_\odot$, the modified power spectrum is found to cause widespread baryon
collapse earlier than standard $\Lambda$CDM, leading to earlier gas heating. It
also results in higher spin temperature of the baryons in the 21 cm line
relative to $\Lambda$CDM at redshifts $z > 20$ if the mass of the minihalo is
larger than $1 M_\odot$. It is estimated that experiments probing 21 cm
radiation at high redshift will contribute a significant constraint on dark
matter models of this type for initial minihalos larger than $\sim 10 M_\odot$.
Early experiments reaching to $z\approx 15$ will constrain minihalos down to
$\sim 10^3 M_\odot$.

observable part of the inflaton potential, or in other words, by making
absolutely no assumption about extrapolation of the potential from its
observable region to its minimum (i.e., about the branch of the potential
responsible for the last ~50 inflationary e-folds). We only assume that
inflation starts at least a few e-folds before the observable Universe leaves
the Hubble radius, and that the inflaton rolls down a monotonic and regular
potential, with no sharp features or phase transitions. We Taylor-expand the
inflaton potential at order v=2, 3 or 4 in the vicinity of the pivot scale,
compute the primordial spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations numerically
and fit the data. For v>2, a large fraction of the allowed models is found to
produce a large negative running of the scalar tilt, and to fall in a region of
parameter space where the second-order slow-roll formalism is strongly
inaccurate. We release a code for the computation of inflationary perturbations
which is compatible with CosmoMC.

their interest for cosmological studies. Large angular size galaxies, on the
other hand, offer a more detailed view into the properties of galaxies, but

general astronomer from extracting all the information found in a detailed
galaxy image. To this end, a new galaxy photometry system has been developed
(mostly building on tools and techniques that have existed in the community for
decades) that combines ease of usage with a mixture of pre-built scripts. The
audience for this system is a new user (graduate student or non-optical
astronomer) with a fast, built-in learning curve to offer any astronomer, with
imaging data, a suite of tools to quickly extract meaningful parameters from
decent data. The tools are available either by a client/server web site or by
tarball for personal installation. The tools also provide simple scripts to
interface with various on-line datasets (e.g. 2MASS, Sloan, DSS) for data
mining capability of imaged data.
  As a proof of concept, we preform a re-analysis of the 2MASS Large Galaxy
Atlas to demonstrate the differences in an automated pipeline, with its
emphasis on speed, versus this package with an emphasis on accuracy. This
comparison finds the structural parameters extracted from the 2MASS pipeline is
seriously flawed with scale lengths that are too small by 50% and central

within a broad emission line region (BELR) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In
order to reveal the physical condition within the relevant emission region, we
performed photoionized model calculations and compared them to the
observations. It suggests that a rather dense gas with density nH ~ 10^(11.5)
cm-3 is present at an outer portion of the BELR, illuminated by the ionizing
radiation corresponding to an ionization parameter U ~ 10^(-2.5) and is
primarily responsible for the observed OI, CaII, and FeII lines, based on the
resemblance of their profiles. The three OI lines are proven to be formed
through Ly beta fluorescence and collisional excitation. We also show that the
lambda1304 bump typically observed in AGN spectra consists of the comparable
contributions of OI and SiII multiplets, and we discuss the origin of such a
strong SiII emission. The results are interpreted in the context of the locally

confirms that strong line emission does not dominate the mid-IR spectral

heated by the primary blast wave; no excess infrared emission is observed in

of 10 below the cold dust mass inferred from SCUBA observations. Finally, we

profiles inconsistent with observations. In particular, we find that the ICM
entropy in our runs with cooling is enhanced to the observed levels at radii as
large as half of the virial radius. We also find that outside cluster cores
entropy scaling with the mean ICM temperature in both simulations and Chandra
observations is consistent with being self-similar within current error bars.
We find that the pressure profiles of simulated clusters are also close to
self-similar and exhibit little cluster-to-cluster scatter. The X-ray
observable-total mass relations for our simulated sample agree with the Chandra
measurements to \~10%-20% in normalization. We show that this systematic
difference could be caused by the subsonic gas motions, unaccounted for in
X-ray hydrostatic mass estimates. The much improved agreement of simulations

the existence of tight relations of X-ray observables, such as Yx, and total

this pre-explosion transient. It appears similar to the giant outbursts of

galaxies which are high redshift and/or are heavily obscured by dust. Using the

colour-colour diagram. We find that all but one of our USS sources have a
strong tendency to flatten below 352 MHz. We also find that the highest

massive stars, and (iii) low C^0/C^+ ratios (<10^{-4}). Quantitatively, the
observed depletion levels and C^0/C^+ ratios of the gas are not characteristic
of cold, dense HI clouds in the Galactic ISM. We argue that the GRB-DLAs
represent the ISM near the GRB but not gas directly local to the GRB (e.g. its
molecular cloud or circumstellar material). We compare these observations with
DLAs intervening background quasars (QSO-DLAs). The GRB-DLAs exhibit larger
N(HI) values, higher a/Fe and Zn/Fe ratios, and have higher metallicity than
the QSO-DLAs. We argue that the differences primarily result from
galactocentric radius-dependent differences in the ISM: GRB-DLAs preferentially
probe denser, more depleted, higher metallicity gaslocated in the inner few kpc
whereas QSO-DLAs are more likely to intersect the less dense, less enriched,
outer regions of the galaxy. Finally, we investigate whether dust obscuration
may exclude GRB-DLA sightlines from QSO-DLA samples; we find that the majority

the GRB itself has photodissociated its parent molecular cloud, so such models

strong constraints on the star forming regions in these early galaxies.

reionized by z <= 6, as is suggested by Ly-a forest observations, we argue that
at {\em least} 50% of the volume of the IGM was reionized before the highest
redshift quasars turned on. Further, even if the IGM is as much as 50% neutral
at quasar turn-on, the quasars are likely born into large galaxy-generated HII
regions. The HII regions during reionization are themselves clustered, and
using radiative transfer simulations, we find that long skewers through the IGM
towards quasar progenitor halos pass entirely through ionized bubbles, even
when the IGM is half neutral. These effects have been neglected in most
previous analyses of quasar proximity zones, which assumed a spatially {\em
uniform} neutral fraction. We model the subsequent ionization from a quasar,
and construct mock Ly-a forest spectra. Our mock absorption spectra are more
sensitive to the level of small-scale structure in the IGM than to the
volume-averaged neutral fraction, and suggest that existing proximity-zone size
measurements are compatible with a fully ionized IGM. However, we mention

J1655-40. Furthermore, the 60/100 mu IR color is used as a tracer of

observations have revealed the existence of a HI hole of 1.5*1.5 degrees in
diameter and compressed CO material acumulated along the south-eastern internal
border of the HI cavity. In this same area, we found extended infrared emission
with characteristics of shocked-heated dust. Based on the HI, CO and FIR
emissions, we suggest that the cavity in the ISM was produced by a supernova
explosion occured within NGC 6242. The lower limit to the kinematic energy
transferred by the supernova shock to the surrounding interstellar medium is ~
10^{49} erg and the atomic and molecular mass displaced to form the cavity of ~
16.500 solar masses. The lower limit to the time elapsed since the SN explosion

mJy will be buried in noise and foregrounds, the latter being at least a few
orders of magnitude stronger than the signal. We develop a visibility based
formalism that uses a filter to optimally combine the entire signal from a
bubble while minimizing the noise and foreground contributions. This formalism
makes definite predictions on the ability to detect an ionized bubble or
conclusively rule out its presence in a radio- interferometric observation. We
make predictions for the currently functioning GMRT and a forthcoming

8.5). For both instruments, we show that a 3 sigma detection will be possible
for a bubble of comoving radius R_b > 40 Mpc (assuming it to be spherical) in

bubble is at the center of the field of view. In both these cases the filter
effectively removes the expected foreground contribution so that it is below
the signal, and the system noise is the deciding criteria. We find that there
is a fundamental limitation on the smallest bubble that can be detected arising

propagating Alfv\'en waves in the solar atmosphere are investigated using a 1D
test particle approach. 1. An finite amplitude Alfv\'en wave is instantly
introduced into a plasma (or equivalently, new ions are instantly created). 2.
New ions are constantly created. In both scenarios, ions will be picked up by
the Alfv\'en wave. In case 1, the wave scatters ions in the transverse
direction leading to a randomization (or heating) process. This process is
complete when a phase shift of $\pm \pi$ in the ion gyro-speed is produced
between particles with characteristic parallel thermal speed and particles with
zero parallel speed. This corresponds to $t={\pi \over k v_{th}}$ ($k$ is the
wave number and $v_{th}$ is the ion thermal speed). A ring velocity
distribution can be produced for large wave amplitude. The process yields a
mass-proportional heating in the transverse direction, a temperature anisotropy
and a bulk flow along the background magnetic field. In case 2, continuous ion
creation represents a continuing phase shift in the ion gyro-speed leading to
heating. New particles are picked up by the Alfv\'en wave within one ion
gyroperiod. It is speculated that the mechanism may operate in the chromosphere
and active regions where transient events may generate finite amplitude
Alfv\'en waves.

detected by Swift BAT at a position consistent with that of the candidate
Anomalous X-ray Pulsar, CXOU J164710.2-455216, discovered by Chandra in 2005.
Swift follow-up observations began about 13 hours after the event and found the
source at a 1-10keV flux level of about 4.5 x 10^-11 erg/s/cm^2, i.e. ~300
times brighter than measured 5 days earlier by XMM. We report the results
obtained from Swift BAT observations of the burst and subsequent Swift XRT
observations carried out during the first four months after the burst. These
data are complemented with those from two XMM observations (carried out just
before and after the BAT event) and four archival Chandra observations carried
out between 2005 and 2007. We find a phase coherent solution for the source
pulsations after the burst. The evolution of the pulse phase comprises an
exponential component decaying with timescale of 1.4d which we interpret as the
recovery stage following a large glitch (Delta nu / nu about 6 x 10^-5). We
also detect a quadratic component corresponding to a spin-down rate of Pdot ~ 9
x 10^-13, implying a magnetic field strength of 10^14 Gauss.
  During the first Swift XRT observation taken 0.6 days after the burst, the
spectrum showed a kT = 0.65keV blackbody (R_BB = 1.5km) plus a Gamma=2.3
power-law accounting for about 60% of the 1-10 keV observed flux. Analysis of
Chandra archival data, taken during 2005 when the source was in quiescence,
reveal that the modulation in quiescence is 100% pulsed at energies above 4 keV
and consistent with the (unusually small-sized) blackbody component being
occulted by the neutron star as it rotates.

tiny droplets with a smallest detectable volume of approximately 0.02 nl. Upon
varying the gas pressure, a critical value is found where the size-distribution
becomes a pure power-law, a fact that is indicative of a phase transition. Away
from this transition, the resulting size distributions are well described by
Fisher's model at coexistence. It is found that the sign of the surface
correction term changes sign, and the apparent power-law exponent tau has a
steep minimum, at criticality, as previously reported in Nuclear
Multifragmentation studies [1,2]. We argue that the observed transition is not

many interacting nuclear spins in an InAs quantum dot is studied by solving the
coupled quantum dynamics. The nuclear spin bath, because of its bifurcated
evolution predicated on the electron spin up or down state, measures the
which-state information of the electron spin and hence diminishes its
coherence. The many-body dynamics of nuclear spin bath is solved with a
pair-correlation approximation. In the relevant timescale, nuclear pair-wise
flip-flops, as elementary excitations in the mesoscopic bath, can be mapped
into the precession of non-interacting pseudo-spins. Such mapping provides a
geometrical picture for understanding the decoherence and for devising control
schemes. A close examination of nuclear bath dynamics reveals a wealth of
phenomena and new possibilities of controlling the electron spin decoherence.
For example, when the electron spin is flipped by a $\pi$-pulse at $\tau$, its
coherence will partially recover at $\sqrt{2}\tau$ as a consequence of quantum
disentanglement from the mesoscopic bath. In contrast to the re-focusing of
inhomogeneously broadened phases by conventional spin-echoes, the
disentanglement is realized through shepherding quantum evolution of the bath
state via control of the quantum object. A concatenated construction of pulse
sequences can eliminate the decoherence with arbitrary accuracy, with the
nuclear-nuclear spin interaction strength acting as the controlling small

polarization field in a strongly-coupled large polaron (SCLP) and after its

polarization field in such a polaron coincides with the classical polarization
field considered in Landau-Pekar theory up to small quantum fluctuations.
However the state of this field after the polaron photodissociation is in
principle different from that obtained in theories of Pekar and Emin. This
results from the fact that as it is shown below the polarization field in a
SCLP is a spatially inhomogeneous phonon condensate. If the charge carrier is
removed from the SCLP on its photodissociation the phonon condensate decays
into phonons. As any Bose-condensate, the phonon condensate is a superposition
of states with different number of quanta where summands are phased up to small
quantum fluctuations. Therefore decay of the phonon condensate at the SCLP
photodissociation results in an essentially wider band in the absorption
spectrum than that predicted by theories with classical consideration of the
polarization: the position of maximum is 4.2Ep and the half-width 2.5Ep (3 Ep
and Ep in Emin theory, respectively), where Ep is the polaron binding energy.
The calculated band is in good conformity with mid-IR band in the optical
conductivity spectra of complex oxides. The predicted ratio (approximately 4)
of the maximum position of the band caused by the SCLP photoionization to the
frequency of maximum of the band caused by phototransitions into polaron

samples with a large residual resistivity ratio, large specific heat jump at
the superconducting transition and with the highest absolute value of the
specific heat above Tc1. However, we present evidence which casts doubt on the
intrinsic nature of the double superconducting transition. The ratio of the two
specific heat jumps \Delta C(Tc1)/\Delta C(Tc2) shows a wide range of values on
crystals from different batches but also within the same batch. This ratio was
strongly reduced by polishing a sample down to 120um. Remarkably, three samples
exhibit a single sharp transition of ~15mK in width at Tc~1.7K. The normalized
specific heat jump (C-Cnormal)/Cnormal at Tc of two of them is higher than ~32%
so larger than the sum of the two specific heat jumps when a double transition
exists. As an evidence of better quality, the slope in the transition is at
least two time steeper.
  We discuss the origins of the double transition; in particular we consider,
based on X-ray diffraction results, a scenario involving Pr-vacancies. The
superconducting phase diagram under magnetic field of a sample with a single
transition is fitted with a two-band model taking into account the good values
for the gap as deduced from thermal conductivity measurements.

The challenge of this task is the problem of self-consistency. The amount of
charge-carriers injected per unit time strongly depends on the energy barrier
emerging at the contact, while at the same time the electrostatic potential
generated by the injected charge- carriers modifies the height of this
injection barrier itself. In our model, self-consistency is obtained by
assuming continuity of the electric displacement and the electrochemical
potential all over the conductor/insulator system. The conductor and the
insulator are properly taken into account by means of their respective density
of state distributions. The electric field distributions are obtained in a
closed analytical form and the resulting current-voltage characteristics show
that the theory embraces injection-limited as well as bulk-limited
charge-carrier transport. Analytical approximations of these limits are given,
revealing physical mechanisms responsible for the particular current-voltage

for a quantum wave packet of high-energy particles with spin. In this paper we
study a head-on collision of two gyratons and black hole formation in this
process. The goal of this study is to understand the role of the gravitational
spin-spin interaction in the process of mini-black-hole formation in particle
collisions. To simplify the problem we consider several gyraton models with
special profiles of the energy and spin density distribution. For these models
we study the apparent horizon (AH) formation on the future edge of a spacetime
region before interaction. We demonstrate that the AH forms only if the energy
duration and the spin are smaller than some critical values, while the length
of the spin distribution should be at least of the order of the system
gravitational radius. We also study gravitational spin-spin interaction in the
head-on collision of two gyratons under the assumption that the values of
gyraton spins are small. We demonstrate that the metric in the interaction
region for such gyratons depends on the relative helicities of incoming
gyratons, and the collision of gyratons with oppositely directed spins allows
the AH formation in a larger parameter region than in the collision of the
gyratons with the same direction of spins. Some applications of the obtained
results to the mini-black-hole production at the Large Hadron Collider in TeV
gravity scenarios are briefly discussed.

It is then shown that given a K-causal spacetime and chosen an event, the light

K-causality. The idea is that this widening of the light cones can be continued

constructing a monotonous sequence of functions, each of which is a value
function of an optimal stopping problem for a geometric Brownian motion,
converging to the value function uniformly and exponentially fast. This
sequence is constructed by iterating a functional operator that maps a certain
class of convex functions to classical solutions of corresponding free boundary

get an application to the comparison of compound Poisson processes. These
comparisons are then extended by an approximation argument to the ordering of
L\'{e}vy processes with infinite L\'{e}vy measure. The third approach is based
on mixing representations which are known for several relevant distribution
classes. We discuss this approach in detail for the comparison of generalized
hyperbolic distributions and for normal inverse Gaussian processes.

over all stopping times $\tau$ of $B^{\mu}$. Reducing the optimal prediction
problem to a parabolic free-boundary problem we show that the following
stopping time is optimal: \[\tau_*=\inf \{t_*\le t\le T\mid b_1(t)\le

is increasing on $[t_*,T]$ with $b_1(t_*)=b_2(t_*)$ when $t_*\ne 0$. Using
local time-space calculus we derive a coupled system of nonlinear Volterra
integral equations of the second kind and show that the pair of optimal
boundaries $b_1$ and $b_2$ can be characterized as the unique solution to this
system. This also leads to an explicit formula for $V$ in terms of $b_1$ and
$b_2$. If $\mu \le 0$, then $t_*=0$ and $b_2\equiv +\infty$ so that $\tau_*$ is
expressed in terms of $b_1$ only. In this case $b_1$ is decreasing on $[z_*,T]$
and increasing on $[0,z_*)$ for some $z_*\in [0,T)$ with $z_*=0$ if $\mu=0$,
and the system of two Volterra equations reduces to one Volterra equation. If
$\mu=0$, then there is a closed form expression for $b_1$. This problem was
solved in [Theory Probab. Appl. 45 (2001) 125--136] using the method of time
change (i.e., change of variables). The method of time change cannot be
extended to the case when $\mu \ne 0$ and the present paper settles the

agglomerative clustering. However, traditional spectral clustering partitions
items into hard clusters, and the ability to instead generate fuzzy item
assignments would be advantageous for the growing class of domains in which
cluster overlap and uncertainty are important. Korenblum and Shalloway [Phys.
Rev. E 67, 056704 (2003)] extended spectral clustering to fuzzy clustering by
introducing the principle of uncertainty minimization. However, this posed a
challenging non-convex global optimization problem that they solved by a
brute-force technique unlikely to scale to data sets having more than O(10^2)
items. Here we develop a new method for solving the minimization problem, which
can handle data sets at least two orders of magnitude larger. In doing so, we
elucidate the underlying structure of uncertainty minimization using multiple
geometric representations. This enables us to show how fuzzy spectral
clustering using uncertainty minimization is related to and generalizes
clustering motivated by perturbative analysis of almost-block-diagonal
matrices. Uncertainty minimization can be applied to a wide variety of existing
hard spectral clustering approaches, thus transforming them to fuzzy methods.

enhanced coherent creation of triatomic molecules in a repulsive atomic
Bose-Einstein condensate, with further enhancement being possible in the case
of heteronuclear trimers via the constructive interference between two chemical
reaction channels.

A 76, 012118 (2007)","10.1103/PhysRevA.76.012118",,"quant-ph nlin.CD",,"  Casimir pistons are models in which finite Casimir forces can be calculated
without any suspect renormalizations. It has been suggested that such forces
are always attractive, but we present several counterexamples, notably a simple
type of quantum graph in which the sign of the force depends upon the number of
edges. We also show that Casimir forces in quantum graphs can be reliably
computed by summing over the classical orbits, and study the rate of
convergence of the periodic orbit expansion. In generic situations where no
analytic expression is available, the sign and approximate magnitude of Casimir
forces can often be obtained using only the shortest classical orbits.

Rev. A 75, 062317 (2007)",,,"quant-ph",,"  We propose an entanglement measure for two qudits based on the covariances of
a set of generators of the su(N) algebra. In particular, we represent this
measure in terms of the mutually unbiased projectors for N prime. For pure
states this measure quantify entanglement, we obtain an explicit expression
which relates it to the concurrence hierarchy, specifically the I-concurrence
and the 3-concurrence. For mixed states we propose a separability criterion.

for the creation of a signal copy and separation of this copy from the original
pulse without its destruction.
