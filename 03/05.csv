This can assess the power of future experiments to answer model selection
questions and the probability of the outcome, and can be helpful in the context
of experiment design.
  As an illustration, I consider a central quantity for our understanding of
the cosmological concordance model, namely the scalar spectral index of
primordial perturbations, n_S. I show that the Planck satellite has over 90%
probability of gathering strong evidence against n_S = 1, thus conclusively
disproving a scale-invariant spectrum. This result is robust with respect to a
wide range of choices for the prior on n_S.

  Maps of the Reionisation Epoch","12 pages, 8 figures. Submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12048.x",,"astro-ph",,"  Spatial dependence in the statistics of redshifted 21cm fluctuations promises
to provide the most powerful probe of the reionisation epoch. In this paper we
consider the second and third moments of the redshifted 21cm intensity
distribution using a simple model that accounts for galaxy bias during the
reionisation process. We demonstrate that skewness in redshifted 21cm maps
should be substantial throughout the reionisation epoch and on all angular
scales, owing to the effects of galaxy bias which leads to early reionisation
in over-dense regions of the IGM. The variance (or power-spectrum) of 21cm
fluctuations will exhibit a minimum in redshift part way through the
reionisation process, when the global ionisation fraction is around 50%. This
minimum is generic, and is due to the transition from 21cm intensity being
dominated by over-dense too under-dense regions as reionisation progresses. We
show that the details of the reionisation history, including the presence of
radiative feedback are encoded in the evolution of the auto-correlation and
skewness functions with redshift and mean IGM neutral fraction. We discuss the
detection of skewness by first generation instruments, and conclude that the
Mileura Widefield Array - Low Frequency Demonstrator will have sufficient
sensitivity to detect skewness on a range of angular scales at redshifts near
the end of reionisation, while a subsequent instrument of 10 times the
collecting area could map out the evolution of skewness in detail. The
observation of a minimum in variance during the reionisation history, and the
detection of skewness would both provide important confirmation of the
cosmological origin of redshifted 21cm intensity fluctuations.

one of the observed PDRs. The resulting cubes were analysed using Blind Signal
Separation methods (NMF and FastICA). For Ced 201, rho-Ophiuchi West filament
and NGC 7023 East, we find that two signals can be extracted from the original
data cubes, which are 5 to 35 um spectra. The main features of the first
spectrum are a strong continuum emission at long wavelengths, and a broad 7.8
um band. On the contrary, the second spectrum exhibits the classical Aromatic
Infrared Bands (AIBs) and no continuum. The reconstructed spatial distribution
maps show that the latter spectrum is mainly present at the cloud surface,
close to the star whereas the first one is located slightly deeper inside the
PDR. The study of the spectral energy distribution of Ced 201 up to 100 um
suggests that, in cool PDRs, the 5-25 um continuum is carried by Very Small
Grains (VSGs). The AIB spectra in the observed objects can be interpreted as
the contribution of neutral and positively-charged Polycyclic Aromatic
Hydrocarbons (PAHs). We extracted the 5 to 25 um emission spectrum of VSGs in
cool PDRs, these grains being most likely carbonaceous. We show that the
variations of the mid-IR (5-35 um) spectra of PDRs can be explained by the

properties of polymer chains as predicted by the Zimm model. In particular, we
show that the static conformations are best described when the ratio
$\frac{\sigma}{b}=0.6$, where $\sigma$ is the Lennard-Jones length parameter
and $b$ is the monomer bond length. We also find that the decay of the Rouse
modes' autocorrelation function is better described with an analytical
correction suggested by Ahlrichs and D\""unweg. Our FH solver permits us to
treat the fluid equation of state and transport parameters as direct simulation
parameters. The expected independence of the chain dynamics on various choices
of fluid equation of state and bulk viscosity is recovered, while excellent
agreement is found for the temperature and shear viscosity dependence of centre
of mass diffusion between simulation results and predictions of the Zimm model.
We find that Zimm model approximations start to fail when the Schmidt number

Measuring the surface velocity $u$ of the flow as a function of flow thickness

crystals such as 4mm BaTiO3 and PbTiO3. In ""rotator"" ferroelectrics, where d15
is high relative to the longitudinal coefficient d33, polarization rotation is
the dominant mechanism of piezoelectric response; the maximum longitudinal
piezoelectric response is found away from the polar axis. In ""extender""
ferroelectrics, d15 is low and the collinear effect dominates; the maximum
piezoelectric response is found along the polar axis. A variety of 3m, mm2 and

are classified in this way. It is shown that the largest piezoelectric
anisotropies d15/d33 are always found in 3m crystals; this is a result of the

Boltzmann distribution of initial magnetization states (adiabatic limit). We
compare three model spin-valves: a spin-valve with a free layer whose easy axis
is parallel to the pinned layer magnetization (standard geometry), a pinned
layer with magnetization tilted with respect to the free layer easy axis
(pinned layer biasing), and a free layer whose magnetization is pulled away
from easy axis by a hard axis bias (free layer biasing). In the conventional

extended long tail comprising very long switching events. For the two biasing
strategies, the switching durations follow a multiply-stepped distribution,
reflecting the precessional nature of the switching, and the statistical number
of precession cycles needed for reversal. We derive analytical criteria to
avoid switching events lasting much longer than the average switching duration,

is digital television. Basically, coding theory is to study a way of detecting
and/or correcting data that may be true or false. Moreover coding theory is an
area of mathematics, in which there is an interplay between many branches of
mathematics, e.g., abstract algebra, combinatorics, discrete geometry,
information theory, etc. In this paper we propose a novel approach for
analyzing proof nets of Multiplicative Linear Logic (MLL) by coding theory. We
define families of proof structures and introduce a metric space for each
family. In each family, 1. an MLL proof net is a true code element; 2. a proof
structure that is not an MLL proof net is a false (or corrupted) code element.
The definition of our metrics reflects the duality of the multiplicative
connectives elegantly. In this paper we show that in the framework one
error-detecting is possible but one error-correcting not. Our proof of the
impossibility of one error-correcting is interesting in the sense that a proof
theoretical property is proved using a graph theoretical argument. In addition,
we show that affine logic and MLL + MIX are not appropriate for this framework.
That explains why MLL is better than such similar logics.

colored either red or blue, and where the red edges have a given fixed cost
(representing the competitor's prices). The first player chooses an assignment
of prices to the blue edges, and the second player then buys the cheapest
possible minimum spanning tree, using any combination of red and blue edges.
The goal of the first player is to maximize the total price of purchased blue
edges. This game is the minimum spanning tree analog of the well-studied
Stackelberg shortest-path game.
  We analyze the complexity and approximability of the first player's best
strategy in StackMST. In particular, we prove that the problem is APX-hard even
if there are only two different red costs, and give an approximation algorithm
whose approximation ratio is at most $\min \{k,1+\ln b,1+\ln W\}$, where $k$ is
the number of distinct red costs, $b$ is the number of blue edges, and $W$ is
the maximum ratio between red costs. We also give a natural integer linear
programming formulation of the problem, and show that the integrality gap of
the fractional relaxation asymptotically matches the approximation guarantee of
our algorithm.

into buffer sequences, in a manner that is compatible with TCP semantics. We
show that the following hold:
  1. There exists a linear time algorithm that, given a buffer sequence W of
length n, decides whether there exists a permutation A of 1,2,..., n such that
$A\in B^{-1}(W)$ (and constructs such a permutation, when it exists).
  2. The problem of counting the number of permutations in $B^{-1}(W)$ has a
polynomial time algorithm.

relative contribution from heavy particles scales as the square of the lepton
mass over the heavy mass, leading to small differences in the anomaly for e,

Chern-Simons gravity in d=2n+1 is dimensionally reduced to CS gravity in d=2n-1

dimensional reduction in both cases is analyzed. The dimensional reduction of

for the possibility that cells may have probability zero. In this sense we
depart from standard log-linear modeling that implicitly assumes a positivity
constraint. Our approach leads us to consider mixture models for contingency
tables, where the components of the mixture, which we call model-instances,
have distinct support. We rely on ideas from polynomial algebra in order to
identify the various model instances. We also provide a method to assign prior
probabilities to each instance of the model, as well as describing methods for
constructing priors on the parameter space of each instance. We illustrate our
methodology through a $5 \times 2$ table involving two structural zeros, as
well as a zero count. The results we obtain show that our analysis may lead to
conclusions that are substantively different from those that would obtain in a
standard framework, wherein the possibility of zero-probability cells is not

ref [1] and [2] ; it relies on the use of counter-propagating ultrashort laser
pulses. In [2], the scheme is as follows: the pump laser pulse generates a
large amplitude laser wakefield (plasma wave). The counter-propagating
injection pulse interferes with the pump laser pulse to generate a beatwave
pattern. The ponderomotive force of the beatwave is able to inject plasma
electrons into the wakefield. We have studied this injection scheme using 1D
Particle in Cell (PIC) simulations. The simulations reveal phenomena and
important physical processes that were not taken into account in previous
models. In particular, at the collision of the laser pulses, most plasma
electrons are trapped in the beatwave pattern and cannot contribute to the
collective oscillation supporting the plasma wave. At this point, the fluid
approximation fails and the plasma wake is strongly inhibited. Consequently,
the injected charge is reduced by one order of magnitude compared to the
predictions from previous models.

proteomic and high-throughput screening methods, the number of novel,
single-target drugs fell much behind expectations during the past decade.
Multi-target drugs multiply the number of pharmacologically relevant target
molecules by introducing a set of indirect, network-dependent effects. Parallel
with this the low-affinity binding of multi-target drugs eases the constraints
of druggability, and significantly increases the size of the druggable
proteome. These effects tremendously expand the number of potential drug
targets, and will introduce novel classes of multi-target drugs with smaller
side effects and toxicity. Here we review the recent progress in this field,
compare possible network attack strategies, and propose several methods to find
target-sets for multi-target drugs.

state, such as symmetry under permutations of parties, undistillability and
unlockability, can be easily explained from the stabilizer formalism without
tedious calculation. In particular, the four-qubit Smolin state and its recent
generalization to even number of qubits can be viewed as special examples of
our results. Finally, we extend our results to arbitrary multipartite systems

mechanics with particular focus on a paper by Caves, Fuchs, and Schack
containing a critique of the ""objective preparations view"" or OPV. It also aims
to carry the discussion beyond the hardened positions of Bayesians and
proponents of the OPV. Several claims made by Caves et al. are rebutted,
including the claim that different pure states may legitimately be assigned to
the same system at the same time, and the claim that the quantum nature of a
preparation device cannot legitimately be ignored. Both Bayesians and
proponents of the OPV regard the time dependence of a quantum state as the
continuous dependence on time of an evolving state of some kind. This leads to
a false dilemma: quantum states are either objective states of nature or
subjective states of belief. In reality they are neither. The present paper
views the aforesaid dependence as a dependence on the time of the measurement
to whose possible outcomes the quantum state serves to assign probabilities.
This makes it possible to recognize the full implications of the only testable
feature of the theory, viz., the probabilities it assigns to measurement
outcomes...

Measure (POVM)? We address this question using two complementary approaches.
First we study the variance of a real variable associated to the POVM outcomes.
In this context we introduce an uncertainty operator which measures how much
additional noise is introduced by carrying out a POVM rather than a von Neumann
measurement. We illustrate this first approach by studying the variances of
joint estimates of \sigma_x and \sigma_z for spin 1/2 particles. We show that
for unbiased measurements the sum of these variances is lower bounded by 1. In
our second approach we study the entropy of the POVM outcomes. In particular we
try to establish lower bounds on the entropy of the POVM outcomes. We
illustrate this second approach by examples.

The model of computation adopted is the q-deformed spin network model viewed as
a quantum recognizer in the sense of Wiesner and Crutchfield, where each basic
unitary transition function can be efficiently processed by a standard quantum
circuit.
  This achievement is an extension of the algorithm for approximating
polynomial invariants of colored oriented links found in Refs 2,3. Thus all the
significant quantities - partition functions and observables - of quantum CSW
theory can be processed efficiently on a quantum computer, reflecting the
intrinsic, field-theoretic solvability of such theory at finite k.

tools underlying the construction of quantum invariants of links and
3-manifolds and connections with algorithmic questions that arise in geometry
