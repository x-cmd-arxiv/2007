fields in L1641N, selected on the basis of previous shock studies, using the

total exposure time of 4.6 h (72 min Ks) in the overlapping region. The
resulting high-resolution mosaic shows numerous new shocks and resolves many
known shocks into multiple components. Using previous observations taken 9
years earlier we calculate a proper motion map and combine this with Spitzer 24
micron observations of the embedded young stars. The combined H2 mosaic shows
many new shocks and faint structures in the HH flows. From the proper motion
map we find that most HH objects belong to two major bi-polar HH flows, the
large-scale roughly North-South oriented flow from central L1641N and a
previously unseen HH flow in eastern L1641N. Combining the tangential velocity
map with the mid-IR Spitzer images, two very likely outflow sources are found.
The outflow source of the eastern flow, L1641N-172, is found to be the
currently brightest mid-IR source in L1641N and seem to have brightened
considerably during the past 20 years. We make the first detection of this
source in the near-IR (Ks) and also find a near-IR reflection nebula pointing
at the source, probably the illuminated walls of a cone-shaped cavity cleared
out by the eastern lobe of the outflow. Extending a line from the eastern
outflow source along the proper motion vector we find that HH 301 and HH 302
(almost 1 pc away) belong to this new HH flow.

particularly efficiently in GCs. However, there is no statistically significant
correlation between the distance of a GC from the center of its host galaxy and
its LMXB hosting probability. Metal-rich GCs are 3.4 times more likely to host
LMXBs than metal-poor ones. Intriguingly, the LMXBs in NGC 1399 are
preferentially in the reddest GCs of the metal-rich subsystem. This indicates
that the red peak of the color distribution itself encompasses GCs with a range
of enrichment histories. The strength of this effect varies from galaxy to
galaxy, possibly indicating differences in their metal-enrichment histories.
Field LMXBs in our program galaxies are more concentrated towards the center of
their host galaxies than GC-LMXBs. This suggests that a majority of field LMXBs
are formed in situ and have not escaped from current GCs. This is consistent
with previous specific frequency based studies. The brightest LMXBs in GCs
appear to be preferentially associated with luminous, metal-rich clusters. We
show that it is probable that some of these GCs host multiple bright LMXBs,
while the probability is much lower for metal-poor GCs. This implies that LMXBs
in more metal-rich cluster systems should reveal a longer high luminosity X-ray
tail, and show less X-ray variability than metal-poor cluster populations.

most strongly driven for weakly magnetized atmospheres that are strongly

X-ray binaries (LMXBs) have been previously reported for M31 X-ray sources,
observed by XMM-Newton. However, we have recently discovered that these PDS
result from the improper addition/subtraction of non-simultaneous lightcurves.
Aims: To understand the properties and origins of the artefact. Methods: We
re-analysed our XMM-Newton observations of M31 with non-simultaneous and
simultaneous lightcurves, then combined simulated lightcurves at various
intensities with various offsets and found that the artefact is more dependent
on the offset than the intensity. Results: The lightcurves produced by the
XMM-Newton Science Analysis Software (SAS) are non-synchronised by default.
This affects not only the combination of lightcurves from the three EPIC
detectors (MOS1, MOS2 and pn), but also background subtraction in the same CCD.
It is therefore imperative that all SAS-generated lightcurves are synchronised
by time filtering, even if the whole observation is to be used. We also find
that the reported timing behaviour for NGC 4559 ULX-7 was also contaminated by
the artefact; there is no significant variability in the correctly-combined
lightcurves of NGC 4559 ULX-7. Hence, the classification of this source as an
intermediate-mass black hole is no longer justified. Conclusions: While
previous timing results from M31 have been proven wrong, and also the broken
power law PDS in NGC 4559 ULX-7, XMM-Newton was able to detect aperiodic
variability in just 3 ks of observations of NGC 5408 ULX1. Hence XMM-Newton
remains a viable tool for analysing variability in extra-galactic X-ray
sources.

large uncertainties associated with the formation of the main neutron source,

element enhancements in stars can be used as constraints on theoretical models.
For the first time we apply stellar population synthesis to the problem of
s-process nucleosynthesis in AGB stars, in order to derive constraints on free
parameters describing the physics behind the third dredge-up and the properties
of the neutron source. We utilize a rapid evolution and nucleosynthesis code to
synthesize different populations of s-enhanced stars, and compare them to their
observational counterparts to find out for which values of the free parameters
in the code the synthetic populations fit best to the observed populations.
These free parameters are the amount of third dredge-up, the minimum core mass
for third dredge-up, the effectiveness of 13C as a source of neutrons and the
size in mass of the 13C pocket. We find that galactic disk objects are
reproduced by a spread of a factor of two in the effectiveness of the 13C
neutron source. Lower metallicity objects can be reproduced only by lowering by
at least a factor of 3 the average value of the effectiveness of the 13C
neutron source needed for the galactic disk objects. Using observations of
s-process elements in post-AGB stars as constraints we find that dredge-up has
to start at a lower core mass than predicted by current theoretical models,
that it has to be substantial ($\lambda$ >~ 0.2) in stars with mass M <~ 1.5

can be approximated by a two-part power-law function in the stellar regime.
However, there exists a possible hint for a systematic variation with
metallicity. A picture is emerging according to which the binary properties of
very-low-mass stars (VLMSs) and BDs may be fundamentally different from those
of late-type stars implying the probable existence of a discontinuity in the
IMF, but the surveys also appear to suggest the number of BDs per star to be
independent of the physical conditions of current Galactic star formation.
Star-burst clusters and thus globular cluster may, however, have a much larger
abundance of BDs. Very recent advances have allowed the measurement of the
physical upper stellar mass limit, which also appears to be disconcertingly
robust to variations in metallicity. Furthermore, it now appears that star
clusters may be formed such that the most-massive stars just forming terminate
further star-formation within the particular cluster. Populations formed from
many star clusters, composite populations, would then have steeper IMFs (fewer
massive stars per low-mass star) than the simple populations in the constituent
clusters. A near invariant star-cluster mass function implies the maximal
cluster mass to correlate with the galaxy-wide star-formation rate. This then
leads to the result that the composite-stellar IMFs vary in dependence of
galaxy type, with potentially dramatic implications for theories of galaxy
formation and evolution.

i_tilt, is less than 45 deg for 50% of the systems in black hole - neutron star

techniques to the black hole spin and the (ii) predicted overall low

Separations and relative magnitudes measured in discovery images give important

find that two of the four plausible clumps show significant X-ray emissions and
one with a marginal detection, which strongly suggest that they are dynamically
bound systems. Following the discovery of the possible large-scale structure,
we carried out deeper SOFI K_s-band imaging with New Technology Telescope on

'environment-dependent down-sizing' evolution. Massive galaxies in high density

is used to constrain possible geometries of the pulsar and the single-pulse
data is analysed for subpulse modulation correlations between the main pulse
and interpulse. We confirm earlier conclusions that the dipole axis of this
pulsar is almost perpendicular to its rotation axis, and report that both its
main pulse and interpulse are modulated with a periodicity around 10.4 times
the pulsar's rotation. Allowing for the half-period delay between main pulse
and interpulse the modulation is found to be precisely in phase. Despite small
secular variations in the periodicity, the phase-locking continues over all
timescales ranging up to several years. The precision of the phase locking is
difficult for current emission theories to explain if the main pulse and
interpulse originate from opposing magnetic poles. We therefore also explore
the possibility of a bidirectional model, in which all the modulated emission
comes from one pole, but is seen from two sides and slightly displaced by
aberration and time-delay. In this model the unmodulated emission is directed
to us from the opposite pole, requiring the emission of the main pulse to
originate from two different poles. This is difficult to reconcile with the
observed smooth PA-swing. Whichever model turns out to be correct, the answer
will have important implications for emission theories.

optically thin at some stage. The thermal radiation trapped in the originally
opaque fireball then leaks out, producing a transient event. The appearance of
the event is investigated in the framework of a homogeneous, spherically
symmetric, and freely expanding fireball produced instantly by an explosive
process without continuous injection of mass and energy. We find that,
generally, the event has a time-duration shorter than that of the main burst,
which is presumably produced by the internal shock after the fireball becomes
optically thin. The event is separated from the main burst by a quiescent
time-interval, and is weaker than the main burst at least in a high energy
band. Hence, the event corresponds to a GRB precursor. The precursor event
predicted by our model has a smooth and FRED (Fast Rise and Exponential Decay)
shape lightcurve, and a quasi-thermal spectrum. Typically, the characteristic
blackbody photon energy is in the X-ray band. However, if the distortion of the
blackbody spectrum by electron scattering is considered, the characteristic

boundary with an ambient medium we assume that the flow is confined by a rigid
wall of a prescribed shape, which we take to be $z\propto r^a$ (in cylindrical
coordinates, with $a$ ranging from 1 to 3). The outflows are initially cold,
sub-Alfv\'enic and Poynting flux-dominated, with a total--to--rest-mass energy
flux ratio $\mu \sim 15$. We find that in all cases they converge to a steady
state characterized by a spatially extended acceleration region. The
acceleration process is very efficient: on the outermost scale of the
simulation as much as $\sim 77%$ of the Poynting flux has been converted into
kinetic energy flux, and the terminal Lorentz factor approaches its maximum
possible value ($\Gamma_\infty \simeq \mu$). We also find a high collimation
efficiency: all our simulated jets develop a cylindrical core. We argue that
this could be the rule for current-carrying outflows that start with a low
initial Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_0 \sim 1$). Our conclusions on the high
acceleration and collimation efficiencies are not sensitive to the particular
shape of the confining boundary or to the details of the injected current
distribution, and they are qualitatively consistent with the semi-analytic
self-similar solutions derived by Vlahakis & K\""onigl. We apply our results to
the interpretation of relativistic jets in AGNs: we argue that they naturally
account for the spatially extended accelerations inferred in these sources
($\Gamma_\infty \ga 10$ attained on radial scales $R\ga 10^{17} {\rm cm}$) and
are consistent with the transition to the matter-dominated regime occurring

Crystals, liquids and glasses have been experimentally observed in both AMOM
and VM. However, quasi-crystals also exist in AMOM, thus a new phase of vortex
matter is proposed here: the vortex quasi-crystal. It is argued that vortex
quasi-crystals are stabilized due to boundary and surface energy effects for
samples of special shapes and sizes, and that a phase transition between a
vortex crystal and a vortex quasi-crystal occurs as a function of magnetic
field and temperature as the sample size is reduced.

The interaction, $\hbar$/tSE with a spin-bath degrades the oscillation with a
characteristic decoherence time. We showed that the swapping regime is
restricted only to b\tSE>$hbar$. However, beyond a critical interaction with
the environment the swapping freezes and the system enters to a Quantum Zeno
dynamical phase where relaxation decreases as coupling with the environment
increases. Here, we solve the quantum dynamics of a two spin system coupled to
a spin-bath within a Liouville-von Neumann quantum master equation and we
compare the results with our previous work within the Keldysh formalism. Then,
we extend the model to a three interacting spin system where only one is
coupled to the environment. Beyond a critical interaction the two spins not
coupled to the environment oscillate with the bare Rabi frequency and relax
more slowly. This effect is more pronounced when the anisotropy of the
system-environment interaction goes from a purely XY to an Ising interaction

existence and growth in time of dynamic lengthscales. Well-behaved

d-wave Eliashberg analysis shows that the spectrum at 4.2 K can be well fitted
by considering electron couplings to a bosonic magnetic resonance mode and a
broad high-energy continuum. Above $T_c$, the spectra show a clear pseudogap
that persists up to 230 K, and a crossover can be seen indicating two different
pseudogap phases existing above $T_c$. The intrinsic electron tunneling nature
is discussed in the analysis.

homogeneous integrate-and-fire network with unreliable inhibitory synapses.
Numerical and analytical calculations show that the network relaxes into a
stationary state of high attention. The majority of the neurons has a membrane
potential just below the threshold; as a consequence the network can react
immediately - on the time scale of synaptic transmission- on external pulses.
The neurons fire with a low rate and with a broad distribution of interspike
intervals. Firing events of the total network are correlated over short time
periods. The firing rate increases linearly with external stimuli. In the limit
of infinitely large networks, the synaptic noise decreases to zero.
Nevertheless, the distribution of interspike intervals remains broad.

coupling to the leads and does not imply the wide-band limit assumption for the
spectral width of the leads. As an application of the method we study in detail
the transient behavior and the charge dynamics in single and double quantum
dots connected to leads by a step-like potential, but the method allows as well
the consideration of non-periodic potentials or short pulses. We show that when
the higher energy levels of the isolated system are located within the bias
window of the leads the transient current approaches the steady state in a
non-oscillatory smooth fashion. At moderate coupling to the leads and fixed
bias the transient acquires a step-like structure, the length of the steps
increasing with the system size. The number of levels inside a finite bias
window can be tuned by a constant gate potential. We find also that the
transient behavior depends on the specific way of coupling the leads to the
mesoscopic system.

3$) is the boundary of a convex body if and only if every point in the interior
of each $(n-3)$-face has a neighborhood that lies on the boundary of some
convex body; no assumptions about the hypersurface's topology are needed. We
derive this criterion from our generalization of Van Heijenoort's (1952)
theorem on locally convex hypersurfaces in $R^n$ to spherical spaces. We also
give an easy-to-implement convexity testing algorithm, which is based on our
criterion. For $R^3$ the number of arithmetic operations used by the algorithm
is at most linear in the number of vertices, while in general it is at most
linear in the number of incidences between the $(n-2)$-faces and $(n-3)$-faces.
When the dimension $n$ is not fixed and only ring arithmetic is allowed, the
algorithm still remains polynomial. Our method works in more general situations
than the convexity verification algorithms developed by Mehlhorn et al. (1996)
and Devillers et al. (1998) -- for example, our method does not require the
input surface to be orientable, nor it requires the input data to include
normal vectors to the facets that are oriented ""in a coherent way"". For $R^3$
the complexity of our algorithm is the same as that of previous algorithms; for
higher dimensions there seems to be no clear winner, but our approach is the
only one that easily handles inputs in which the facet normals are not known to
be coherently oriented or are not given at all. Furthermore, our method can be
extended to piecewise-polynomial surfaces of small degree.

planar graph which moves between orientations by reversing the edges of
directed faces. Using path coupling and the comparison method we obtain a
polynomial upper bound on the mixing time of this chain for any solid subgraph

that there exist subgraphs with holes for which the chain will always take an
exponential amount of time to converge. Finally, as an additional justification
for studying a Markov chain on the set of Eulerian orientations of planar

investigate the reversed question: Which are the representations for the

quantum constraints have been imposed upon it? Stated otherwise: Which
representation do we have to use if we wish the constraints of the theory to
eliminate the non-physical degrees of freedom from the states? We use the
framework of geometric quantization to attack this question. In particular, it
is found that in the linear spin-two theory as well as in General Relativity,
gauge invariance cannot be achieved by a pure coordinate (i.e., field)
representation, but that one has to use mixed momentum/coordinate
representations instead. Our results are illustrated by the example of the free

mass splitting and the deviation from the maximal atmospheric mixing angle are
driven by the same symmetry breaking parameter lambda~0.1, and the reactor

inflation of a very small and highly curved space-time patch is a possibility,
not a necessity: quite different initial conditions are possible, and not
necessarily unlikely. In particular, the duality symmetries of string theory
suggest scenarios in which the Universe starts inflating from an initial state
characterized by very small curvature and interactions. Such a state, being
gravitationally unstable, will evolve towards higher curvature and coupling,
until string-size effects and loop corrections make the Universe ""bounce"" into
a standard, decreasing-curvature regime. In such a context, the hot big bang of
conventional cosmology is replaced by a ""hot big bounce"" in which the bouncing
and heating mechanisms originate from the quantum production of particles in
the high-curvature, large-coupling pre-bounce phase. Here we briefly summarize
the main features of this inflationary scenario, proposed a quarter century
ago. In its simplest version (where it represents an alternative and not a
complement to standard slow-roll inflation) it can produce a viable spectrum of
density perturbations, together with a tensor component characterized by a
""blue"" spectral index with a peak in the GHz frequency range. That means,
phenomenologically, a very small contribution to a primordial B-mode in the CMB
polarization, and the possibility of a large enough stochastic background of
gravitational waves to be measurable by present or future gravitational wave
detectors.

the case of a rigid cavity supported by a stiff mount, the weight of the
Casimir energy $E_C$ stored in the cavity corresponds to a gravitational mass

derived from crossing symmetry and the charge conjugation. Moreover, we fix the
value of $R=G_E/G_M$ as determined from the data of the polarization transfer
experiment. We find that, at high $Q^2 \geq 2 GeV^2$ values, the contribution
of the TPE effect to the slope of $\sigma_R$ vs. $\epsilon$ is large and
comparable with that arising from $G_{E}$. It also behaves quasi-linearly in
the region of current data, namely, in the range of $0.2 < \epsilon < 0.95$.
Hence the fact that the current elastic $ep$ cross section data shows little
nonlinearity with respect to $\epsilon$ can not be used to exclude the presence
of the TPE effect. More precise data at extreme angles will be crucial for a
model-independent extraction of the TPE effect.

Global Circulation Model (fvGCM) with 72 grid points zonally, 46 grid points
meridionally and 55 vertical levels. With only forty ensemble members, LETKF
obtains an analysis and forecasts with lower RMS errors than those from PSAS.
The performance of LETKF is further improved, especially over the oceans, by
assimilating simulated temperature observations from rawinsondes and
conventional surface pressure observations instead of geopotential heights. An
initial decrease of the forecast errors in the NH observed in PSAS but not in
LETKF suggests that the PSAS analysis is less balanced. The observed advantage
of LETKF over PSAS is due to the ability of the forty-member ensemble from
LETKF to capture flow-dependent errors and thus create a good estimate of the
true background uncertainty. Furthermore, localization makes LETKF highly
parallel and efficient, requiring only 5 minutes per analysis in a cluster of
20 PCs with forty ensemble members.

electronic state and focused on the evolution at long times (t>200 fs), which
has received little attention up to now. We showed that the initial fast
spreading of the wave packets is followed at all energies by slow periodic
intramolecular vibronic energy redistribution (IVER) with periods in the range
0.3 to several tens of ps. These energy transfers lead to oscillations with the
same periods in the population of each electronic state. Propagation of wave
packets indicates that IVER frequencies also dominate the fluctuations of the
squared modulus of the autocorrelation function, |A(t)|^2, at energies not too
high above the bottom of the conical intersection, but that this is no longer
the case at higher energies. For example, for initial wave packets prepared by
almost vertical excitation of the vibrational ground state of the ground
electronic surface, the oscillations of |A(t)|^2 essentially reflect the
detuning from 1:2 resonance between the frequency of the bend and that of the
symmetric stretch in the excited electronic state. These theoretical results

enhancement of temperature fluctuations when the dissipation coefficient in
Langevin equations is assumed to be larger than a few tens of ps-1, and pointed
out the possible role of the solvent in real experiments. We sought for a
possible correlation between the growth of large bubbles and the enhancement of
temperature fluctuations but found no direct evidence thereof. Finally, we
showed that neither the enhancement of fluctuations nor the 1/f dependence are
observed at the scale of a single base pair, while these properties show up
when summing the contributions of a large number of base pairs. We therefore
conclude that both effects result from collective motions that are facilitated
by the divergence of the correlation length at denaturation.

Emulsion Cloud Chamber. In order to achieve the large dynamical range required
for the charge measurement, the recently developed techniques of the emulsion

studied in bottom-up hierarchical organizations. Using a very simple model with
bottom-up majority rule voting, the dynamics of power distribution at the
various hierarchical levels is calculated within a probabilistic framework.
Given a leadership at the top, the opposition weight from the hierarchy bottom
is shown to fall off quickly while climbing up the hierarchy. It reaches zero
after only a few hierarchical levels. Indeed the voting process is found to
obey a threshold dynamics with a deterministic top outcome. Accordingly the
leadership may stay stable against very large amplitude increases in the
opposition at the bottom level. An opposition can thus grow steadily from few
percent up to seventy seven percent with not one a single change at the elected
top level. However and in contrast, from one election to another, in the
vicinity of the threshold, less than a one percent additional shift at the
bottom level can drive a drastic and brutal change at the top. The opposition
topples the current leadership at once. In addition to analytical formulas,
results from a large scale simulation are presented. The results may shed a new
light on management architectures as well as on alert systems. They could also
provide some different insight on last century's Eastern European communist

3D structure of the active part of a fault network using the spatial location
of earthquakes. The method is a generalization of the so-called dynamic
clustering method, that originally partitions a set of datapoints into
clusters, using a global minimization criterion over the spatial inertia of
those clusters. The new method improves on it by taking into account the full
spatial inertia tensor of each cluster, in order to partition the dataset into
fault-like, anisotropic clusters. Given a catalog of seismic events, the output
is the optimal set of plane segments that fits the spatial structure of the
data. Each plane segment is fully characterized by its location, size and
orientation. The main tunable parameter is the accuracy of the earthquake
localizations, which fixes the resolution, i.e. the residual variance of the
fit. The resolution determines the number of fault segments needed to describe
the earthquake catalog, the better the resolution, the finer the structure of
the reconstructed fault segments. The algorithm reconstructs successfully the
fault segments of synthetic earthquake catalogs. Applied to the real catalog
constituted of a subset of the aftershocks sequence of the 28th June 1992
Landers earthquake in Southern California, the reconstructed plane segments
fully agree with faults already known on geological maps, or with blind faults
that appear quite obvious on longer-term catalogs. Future improvements of the
method are discussed, as well as its potential use in the multi-scale study of
the inner structure of fault zones.

swarms. The model incorporates social interactions, gravity, wind, and the
effect of the impenetrable boundary formed by the ground. We study the model
using numerical simulations and tools from statistical mechanics, namely the
notion of H-stability. For a free-space swarm (no wind and gravity), as the
number of locusts increases, it approaches a crystalline lattice of fixed
density if it is H-stable, and in contrast becomes ever more dense if it is
catastrophic. Numerical simulations suggest that whether or not a swarm rolls
depends on the statistical mechanical properties of the corresponding
free-space swarm. For a swarm that is H-stable in free space, gravity causes
the group to land and form a crystalline lattice. Wind, in turn, smears the
swarm out along the ground until all individuals are stationary. In contrast,
for a swarm that is catastrophic in free space, gravity causes the group to
land and form a bubble-like shape. In the presence of wind, the swarm migrates
with a rolling motion similar to natural locust swarms. The rolling structure
is similar to that observed by biologists, and includes a takeoff zone, a
landing zone, and a stationary zone where grounded locusts can rest and feed.

system under various environmental conditions. We make a comparison of the
quantum statistical properties between QND and dissipative types of evolution
using a system of two-level atom and a harmonic oscillator.

A 75, 062106 (2007)","10.1103/PhysRevA.75.062106",,"quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  We quantitatively analyze the dynamics of the quantum phase distribution
associated with the reduced density matrix of a system, as the system evolves
under the influence of its environment with an energy-preserving quantum
nondemolition (QND) type of coupling. We take the system to be either an
oscillator (harmonic or anharmonic) or a two-level atom (or equivalently, a
spin-1/2 system), and model the environment as a bath of harmonic oscillators,
initially in a general squeezed thermal state. The impact of the different
environmental parameters is explicitly brought out as the system starts out in
various initial states. The results are applicable to a variety of physical
systems now studied experimentally with QND measurements.

  University, Jerusalem","quant-ph",,"  The concept of a superposition is a revolutionary novelty introduced by
Quantum Mechanics. If a system may be in any one of two pure states x and y, we
must consider that it may also be in any one of many superpositions of x and y.
An in-depth analysis of superpositions is proposed, in which states are
represented by one-dimensional subspaces, not by unit vectors as in Dirac's
notation. Superpositions must be considered when one cannot distinguish between
possible paths, i.e., histories, leading to the current state of the system. In
such a case the resulting state is some compound of the states that result from
each of the possible paths. States can be compounded, i.e., superposed in such
a way only if they are not orthogonal. Since different classical states are
orthogonal, the claim implies no non-trivial superpositions can be observed in
classical systems. The parameter that defines such compounds is a proportion
defining the mix of the different states entering the compound. Two quantities,
p and theta, both geometrical in nature, relate one-dimensional subspaces in
complex Hilbert spaces: the first one is a measure of proximity relating two
rays, the second one is an angle relating three rays. The properties of the
operation of superposition are very different from those that govern linear
combination of vectors.

operator as a function of the number of times it is iterated. We consider
unitaries belonging to the circular ensembles of random matrices (CUE or COE)
applied to random (real or complex) non-entangled states. We verify numerically
that the average entangling power is a monotonic decreasing function of time.
The same behavior is observed for the ""operator entanglement"" --an alternative
measure of the entangling strength of a unitary. On the analytical side we
calculate the CUE operator entanglement and asymptotic values for the
entangling power. We also provide a theoretical explanation of the time
dependence in the CUE cases.
