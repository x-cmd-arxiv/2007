crystallization to see how this complex composition forms new neutron star
crust. We find chemical separation, with the liquid ocean phase greatly
enriched in low atomic number elements compared to the solid crust. This phase
separation should change many crust properties such as the thermal conductivity
and shear modulus. The concentration of carbon, if present, is enriched in the
ocean. This may allow unstable thermonuclear burning of the carbon and help
explain the ignition of the very energetic explosions known as superbursts.

deform in bending, while they are much stiffer with respect to tensile forces

derived from the stretching mode, our theory properly accounts for the soft

calculate the macroscopic elastic moduli starting from a microscopic
characterization of the deformation field in terms of ``floppy modes'' --
low-energy bending excitations that retain a high degree of non-affinity. The
length-scale characterizing the emergent non-affinity is given by the ``fiber
length'' $l_f$, defined as the scale over which the polymers remain straight.
The calculated scaling properties for the shear modulus are in excellent

the electron is not an elementary excitation of the system, nevertheless an

in the momentum distribution curve (MDC). The MDC is defined by considering the
single hole spectral function $A^<(\vec{k},\omega)$ as a function of $\vec{k}$
at a fixed frequency $\omega$. We show the existence of a \emph{kink} in this
dispersion for the spin-rotationally invariant Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid at
finite temperature. In the repulsive regime where the charge velocity $v_{c}$
is greater than the spin velocity $v_{s}$, the low frequency effective
electronic dispersion is linear in $\vec{k}$ and follows a velocity $v_l$
between the spin and charge velocities, $v_s < v_l < v_c$. The high frequency
part (which is also linear in $\vec{k}$) disperses with the charge velocity
$v_c$. The energy scale of the crossover between the two velocities defines a
kink, $E_{\rm kink}$. In addition, the high energy dispersion extrapolates to
the Fermi energy at a wavevector $k_{ex} \ne k_F$ which is shifted from the
Fermi wavevector. The presence of such a kink is measurable with, {\em e.g.},
angle-resolved photoemission experiments, and may be used to test for the
presence of Luttinger liquid behavior in systems in which the separate
contributions from spin and charge to the MDC are not discernible due to strong
interactions or low experimental resolution.

shear-rate; power law fluids are an important example, but the analysis here is
for general nonlinear dependence. The modelling allows for large changes in
film thickness provided the changes occur over a large enough lateral length
scale. Modifying the surface boundary condition for tangential stress forms an
accessible base for the analysis where flow with constant shear is a neutral
critical mode, in addition to a mode representing conservation of fluid.
Perturbatively removing the modification then constructs a model for the
coupled dynamics of the fluid depth and the lateral momentum. For example, the

of these criteria to several radio source catalogues showed their ability to
perform a preliminary assessment of the quality of radio source catalogues, and
2D Allan deviation estimate seems to be a most sensitive measure. However, in
common case, the sensitivity of tested criteria is yet not sufficient to
distinguish between radio source catalogues of the highest quality. Proposed

KaiB, and KaiC are sufficient in vitro to generate circadian phosphorylation of
KaiC. Here, we present a mathematical model of the Kai system. At its heart is
the assumption that KaiC can exist in two conformational states, one favoring
phosphorylation and the other dephosphorylation. Each individual KaiC hexamer
then has a propensity to be phosphorylated in a cyclic manner. To generate
macroscopic oscillations, however, the phosphorylation cycles of the different
hexamers must be synchronized. We propose a novel synchronisation mechanism
based on differential affinity: KaiA stimulates KaiC phosphorylation, but the
limited supply of KaiA dimers binds preferentially to those KaiC hexamers that
are falling behind in the oscillation. KaiB sequesters KaiA and stabilizes the
dephosphorylating KaiC state. We show that our model can reproduce a wide range
of published data, including the observed insensitivity of the oscillation
period to variations in temperature, and that it makes nontrivial predictions
about the effects of varying the concentrations of the Kai proteins.

spin chains in the RSP, being dependent only on the magnitude S of the spin.
Remarkably, the logarithmic scaling holds for the disordered chain even if the
pure chain with no disorder does not exhibit conformal invariance, as is the
case for Heisenberg integer spin chains. Our conclusions are supported by
explicit evaluations of the entanglement entropy for random spin-1 and spin-3/2
