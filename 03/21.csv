determine its mass would be to detect its annihilation into monochromatic
gamma-rays in upcoming telescopes. One of the most minimal models for dark
matter is the inert doublet model, obtained by adding another Higgs doublet
with no direct coupling to fermions. For a mass between 40 and 80 GeV, the
lightest of the new inert Higgs particles can give the correct cosmic abundance

this scalar dark matter candidate, the annihilation signal of monochromatic

related to variations of the total spot area and is coupled with the
differential rotation, while the 5.3 yr cycle is caused by the symmetric
redistribution of the spotted area between the opposite stellar hemispheres
(flip-flop cycle). We recover long-lived active regions comprising two active
longitudes that migrate in the orbital reference frame with a variable rate
because of the differential rotation along with changes in the mean spot
latitudes. The migration pattern is periodic with the 16 yr cycle. Combining
the longitudinal migration of the active regions with a previously measured
differential rotation law, we recover the first stellar butterfly diagram
without an assumption about spot shapes. We find that mean latitudes of active
regions at opposite longitudes change antisymmetrically in the course of the 16
yr cycle: while one active region migrates to the pole, the other approaches
the equator. This suggests a precession of the global magnetic field with
respect to the stellar rotational axis.

a new parameter LambdaR which involves luminosity weighted averages over the
full 2D kinematic field, as a proxy to quantify the observed projected stellar
angular momentum per unit mass. We use it as a basis for a new kinematic
classification: early-type galaxies are separated into slow and fast rotators
(SRs, FRs), depending on whether they have LambdaR values within their
effective radius Re below or above 0.1, respectively. SRs and FRs are shown to
be physically distinct classes of galaxies, a result which cannot simply be the
consequence of a biased viewing angle. FRs tend to be relatively low luminosity
galaxies. SRs tend to be brighter and more massive galaxies, but are still
spread over a wide range of absolute magnitude. 3 slow rotators of our sample,
among the most massive ones, are consistent with zero rotation. Remarkably, all
other SRs contain a large kpc-scale KDC. All FRs show well aligned photometric
and kinemetric axes, and small velocity twists, in contrast with most SRs which
exhibit significant misalignments and velocity twists. In a companion paper
(Paper X), we also show that FRs and SRs are distinct classes in terms of their
orbital distribution. We suggest that gas is a key ingredient in the formation
and evolution of FRs, and that the slowest rotators are the extreme
evolutionary end point reached deep in gravitational potential wells where
dissipationless mergers had a major role in the evolution, and for which most
of the baryonic angular momentum was expelled outwards. (abridged)

a hyperplane (i.e., a plane in a four dimensional configuration space) which we
dubbed the {\it Sersic Virial Hyperplane} (SVH). The tilt of the SVH can be
fully explained in terms of a power-law scaling of the stellar (rather than the

Second, an N-body realisation of this model is adapted to the full disc

avoiding local-Maxwellian approximations. We performed test simulations and

vigorous transverse displacements. Unique identification of the mottles
throughout their lifetime is much harder than for their active region
counterpart, dynamic fibrils. This is because many seem to lack a sharply
defined edge at their top, and significant fading often occurs throughout their
lifetime. For those mottles that can be reliably tracked, we find that the
mottle tops often undergo parabolic paths. We find a linear correlation between
the deceleration these mottles undergo and the maximum velocity they reach,
similar to what was found earlier for dynamic fibrils. Combined with an

information about galaxy and quasar formation. Estimating the luminosity
function from magnitude limited samples is relatively straightforward, provided
that the distances to the objects in the sample are known accurately;
techniques for doing this have been available for about thirty years. However,
distances are usually known accurately for only a small subset of the sample.
This is true of the objects in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and will be
increasingly true of the next generation of deep multi-color photometric
surveys. Estimating the luminosity function when distances are only known
approximately (e.g., photometric redshifts are available, but spectroscopic
redshifts are not) is more difficult. I describe two algorithms which can
handle this complication: one is a generalization of the V_max algorithm, and
the other is a maximum likelihood approach. Because these methods account for
uncertainties in the distance estimate, they impact a broader range of studies.
For example, they are useful for studying the abundances of galaxies which are
sufficiently nearby that the contribution of peculiar velocity to the
spectroscopic redshift is not negligible, so only a noisy estimate of the true
distance is available. In this respect, peculiar velocities and photometric
redshift errors have similar effects. The methods developed here are also
useful for estimating the stellar luminosity function in samples where accurate
parallax distances are not available.

detectable prompt contribution in our first exposure, which was coincident with
a large prompt-emission gamma-ray pulse. The optical--infrared photometric
spectral energy distribution is an excellent fit to a power law, but it
exhibits a moderate red-to-blue evolution in the spectral index at about 500 s
after the burst. This color change is contemporaneous with a switch from a
relatively fast decay to slower decay. The rapidly decaying early afterglow is
broadly consistent with synchrotron emission from a reverse shock, but a bright
forward-shock component predicted by the intermediate- to late-time X-ray

the contribution of possible secondary stellar components. As a consequence
I-band fluctuations magnitudes are ideal for distance studies. On the other

both by taking into account hot (Post--AGB) stars in SSP models and/or by

adiabatic invariance ($\mu=p_\perp/B$), as magnetic field is amplified by the
MRI. Larmor radius scale instabilities--mirror, ion-cyclotron, and
firehose--are excited at large pressure anisotropy. Pressure isotropization due

strong non-axisymmetric features which significantly affect orbits of stars and
dark matter particles. One of the main effects is the dynamical resonances
between galactic material and the bar. We detect and characterize these
resonances in N-body models of barred galaxies by measuring angular and radial
frequencies of individual orbits. We found narrow peaks in the distribution of
orbital frequencies with each peak corresponding to a specific resonance. We
found five different resonances in the stellar disk and two in the dark matter.
The corotation resonance and the inner and outer Lindblad resonances are the
most populated. The spatial distributions of particles near resonances are
wide. For example, the inner Lindblad resonance is not localized at a given
radius. Particles near this resonance are mainly distributed along the bar and
span a wide range of radii. On the other hand, particles near the corotation
resonance are distributed in two broad areas around the two stable Lagrange
points. The distribution resembles a wide ring at the corotation radius.
Resonances capture disk and halo material in near-resonant orbits. Our analysis
of orbits in both N-body simulations and in simple analytical models indicates
that resonances tend to prevent the dynamical evolution of this trapped
material. Only if the bar evolves as a whole, resonances drift through the
phase space. In this case particles anchored near resonant orbits track the
resonance shift and evolve. The criteria to ensure a correct resonant behavior
discussed in Weinberg & Katz (2007a) can be achieved with few millions

galaxies from the 36 isolated early-type galaxies of Reda et al. Using new
long-slit spectra, central values and radial gradients for the stellar age,
metallicity [Z/H] and alpha-element abundance [E/Fe] are measured. Similarly,
the central stellar population parameters are derived for a further 5 isolated
early-type galaxies using their Lick indices from the literature. On average,
the seventeen isolated galaxies have mean central [Z/H]o and [E/Fe]o of
0.29+/-0.03 and 0.17+/-0.03 respectively and span a wide range of ages from 1.7
to 15 Gyrs. We find that isolated galaxies follow similar scaling relations
between central stellar population parameters and galaxy velocity dispersion to
their counterparts in high density environments. However, we note a tendency
for isolated galaxies to have slightly younger ages, higher [Z/H] and lower
[E/Fe]. Such properties are qualitatively consistent with the expectation of an
extended star formation history for galaxies in lower density environments.
Generally we measure constant age and [E/Fe] radial gradients. We find that the
age gradients anti-correlate with the central galaxy age. Metallicity gradients
range from near zero to strongly negative. For our high mass galaxies
metallicity gradients are shallower with increasing mass. Such behaviour is not
predicted in dissipational collapse models but might be expected in multiple
mergers. The metallicity gradients correlate with the central age and
metallicity, as well as to the age gradients. In conclusion, our stellar
population data for isolated galaxies are more compatible with an extended
merger/accretion history than early dissipative collapse.

HCN detections and upper limits, show that the FIR/HCN ratios in these high

for nearby galaxies by about a factor of 2. Even considering the scatter in the

ratios for the early Universe molecular emission line galaxies (EMGs) deviate
from the correlation that fits Galactic giant molecular cloud cores, normal

solar mass of dense molecular gas is higher in the high-$z$ objects than in
local galaxies including normal spirals LIRGs and ULIRGs. The limited HCN
detections at high-redshift show that the HCN/CO ratios for the high-$z$

reveals a tight linear correlation between HCN and IR (SF rate) luminosities,
whereas the correlation between IR and CO (measure of the total molecular gas)
luminosities is nonlinear. This suggests that the global SF rate depends more
intimately upon the amount of dense molecular gas than the total molecular gas
content. This linear relationship extends to both the dense cores in the Galaxy
and the hyperluminous extreme starbursts at high-redshift. Therefore, the
global SF law in dense gas appears to be linear all the way from dense cores to
extreme starbursts, spanning over nine orders of magnitude in IR luminosity.

To improve on this situation we have started an XMM-Newton Large Programme for
the in-depth study of a representative sample of 33 galaxy clusters, selected
in the redshift range z=0.055 to 0.183 from the REFLEX Cluster Survey, having
X-ray luminosities above 0.4 X 10^44 h_70^-2 erg s^-1 in the 0.1 - 2.4 keV
band. This paper introduces the sample, compiles properties of the clusters,
and provides detailed information on the sample selection function. We describe
the selection of a nearby galaxy cluster sample that makes optimal use of the
XMM-Newton field-of-view, and provides nearly homogeneous X-ray luminosity
coverage for the full range from poor clusters to the most massive objects in
the Universe. For the clusters in the sample, X-ray fluxes are derived and
compared to the previously obtained fluxes from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. We
find that the fluxes and the flux errors have been reliably determined in the
ROSAT All-Sky Survey analysis used for the REFLEX Survey. We use the sample
selection function documented in detail in this paper to determine the X-ray
luminosity function, and compare it with the luminosity function of the entire
REFLEX sample. We also discuss morphological peculiarities of some of the
sample members. The sample and some of the background data given in this
introductory paper will be important for the application of these data in the
detailed studies of cluster structure, to appear in forthcoming publications.

velocity field, rather than being thought of as peculiar velocities with
respect to a uniformly expanding space. The aim of this paper is to use the
observed motions of galaxies to map out variations in the Universe's expansion,
and more importantly, to investigate whether real variations in the Hubble
expansion are detectable given the observational uncertainties. All-sky maps of
the observed variation in the expansion are produced using measurements
obtained along specific lines-of-sight and smearing them across the sky using a
Gaussian profile. A map is produced for the final results of the HST
Extragalactic Distance Scale Key Project for the Hubble constant, a comparison
map is produced from a set of essentially independent data, and Monte Carlo
techniques are used to analyse the statistical significance of the variation in
the maps. A statistically significant difference in expansion rate of 9
km/s/Mpc is found to occur across the sky. Comparing maps of the sky at
different distances appears to indicate two distinct sets of extrema with even
stronger statistically significant variations. Within our supercluster,
variations tend to occur near the supergalactic plane, and beyond our
supercluster, variations tend to occur away from the supergalactic plane.
Comparison with bulk flow studies shows some concordance, yet also suggests the
bulk flow studies may suffer confusion, failing to discern the influence of
multiple perturbations.

lower than previous studies of early-types but can probably be attributed to
different sample selection criteria. As expected, earlier type, more luminous
and massive galaxies have a relatively lower molecular gas content. We find
that CO-rich galaxies tend to have higher H\beta but lower Fe5015 and Mgb
absorption indices than CO-poor galaxies. Those trends appear primarily driven
by the age of the stars, an hypothesis supported by the fact that the galaxies
with the strongest evidence of star formation are also the most CO-rich. In
fact, the early-type galaxies from the current sample appear to extend the
well-known correlations between FIR luminosity, dust mass and molecular mass of
other galaxy types. The star formation interpretation is also consistent with
the SAURON galaxies' radio continuum and FIR flux ratios, and their inferred
star formation efficiencies are similar to those in spiral galaxies. It thus
appears that we have identified the material fueling (residual) star formation
in early-type galaxies, and have demonstrated that it is actively being
transformed. Nevertheless, the lack of strong correlations between the CO
content and most stellar parameters is compatible with the idea that, in a
significant number of sample galaxies, the molecular gas has been accreted from
the outside and has properties rather independent from the old, pre-existing
stellar component.

Born-von-Karman type expansion with random coefficients is used to model
effects of frozen heterogeneities. The key quantity appearing in the
theoretical description is a full distribution of effective single-site
potentials which needs to be determined self-consistently. If microscopic
interactions are harmonic, the effective single-site potentials turn out to be
harmonic as well, and the distribution of these single-site potentials is
equivalent to a distribution of localization lengths used earlier in the
description of chemical gels. For structural glasses characterized by
frustration and anharmonicities in the microscopic interactions, the
distribution of single-site potentials involves anharmonicities of all orders,
and both single-well and double well potentials are observed, the latter with a
broad spectrum of barrier heights. The appearance of glassy phases at low
temperatures is marked by the appearance of asymmetries in the distribution of
single-site potentials, as previously observed for fully connected systems.
Double-well potentials with a broad spectrum of barrier heights and asymmetries
would give rise to the well known universal glassy low temperature anomalies

that at high densities when the average inter particle distance r_0 becomes
small compared to the magnetic length r_m, a ferromagnetic state with
spheroidal occupation function, involving quadrupolar deformation, gives a
lower energy compared to the variational energy for the uniform paramagnetic

infinite density collapse, but we show here explicitly that a suitable short

this collapse.The existence of a stable high density ferromagnetic state with

move in a polymeric fluid with a single relaxation time. We show that, compared
to self-propulsion in a Newtonian fluid occurring at a velocity U_N, the sheet

are valid for both waves of tangential and normal motion. The generalization to

corrections to the Einstein equations applied in the Cosmological setting. The
question of whether or not the resulting corrections to the Einstein equations

ambiguities in the averaging schemes available. In particular, it has been
argued in the literature that the effects of averaging could be gauge
artifacts. We apply the formalism of Zalaletdinov's Macroscopic Gravity (MG)
which is a fully covariant and nonperturbative averaging scheme, in an attempt
to construct gauge independent corrections to the standard
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) equations. We find that whereas one
cannot escape the problem of dependence on \emph{one} gauge choice -- which is
inherent in the assumption of large scale homogeneity and isotropy -- it is
however possible to construct \emph{spacetime scalar} corrections to the
standard FLRW equations. This partially addresses the criticism concerning the
corrections being gauge artifacts. For a particular initial choice of gauge
which simplifies the formalism, we explicitly construct these scalars in terms
of the underlying inhomogeneous geometry, and incidentally demonstrate that the
formal structure of the corrections with this gauge choice is identical to that
of analogous corrections derived by Buchert in the context of spatial averaging
of scalars.

factorization theorem for the top invariant mass spectrum. Our analysis
accounts for: alpha_s corrections from the production and mass scales,
corrections due to constraints in defining invariant masses, non-perturbative
corrections from the cross-talk between the jets, and alpha_s corrections to
the Breit-Wigner line-shape. This paper mainly focuses on deriving the
factorization theorem for hemisphere invariant mass distributions and other
event shapes in e+e- collisions applicable at a future Linear Collider. We show
that the invariant mass distribution is not a simple Breit-Wigner involving the
top width. Even at leading order it is shifted and broadened by
non-perturbative soft QCD effects. We predict that the invariant mass peak
position increases linearly with Q/m due to these non-perturbative effects.
They are encoded in terms of a universal soft function that also describes soft
effects for massless dijet events. In a future paper we compute alpha_s
corrections to the jet invariant mass spectrum, including a summation of large
logarithms between the scales Q, m and Gamma.

The string theoretic approach to understanding this observation is based on the
expectation that the effective potential has an enormous number of local minima
with different particle masses and perhaps totally different fundamental
couplings and space time topology. The vast majority of these alternative
universes are totally inhospitable to life, having, for example, vacuum
energies near the natural (Planck) scale. The statistics, however, are assumed
to be such that a few of these local minima (and not more) have a low enough
vacuum energy and suitable other properties to support life. In the
inflationary era, the ""multiverse"" made successive transitions between the
available minima until arriving at our current state of low vacuum energy.
String theory, however, also suggests that the absolute minimum of the

the inflationary era did not end by a transition to one of these, when will the
universe make the phase transition to the exactly supersymmetric ground state,

there exist many groups, which do not have dead ends of arbitrary depth with

obtained by \v{S}uni\'c and by Warshall. We improve these results by showing
that abelian groups only have finitely many dead ends and that groups with more
than one end (in the sense of Hopf and Freudenthal) have only dead ends of
bounded depth. Only few examples of groups with unbounded dead end depth are
known. We show that the Houghton group \Hou with respect to a standard

Lagrangian-averaged Navier-Stokes-alpha (LANS-alpha) turbulence model in a
primitive equation ocean model. The ocean model in which we work is the Los
Alamos Parallel Ocean Program (POP); we refer to POP and our implementation of
LANS-alpha as POP-alpha. Two versions of POP-alpha are presented: the full
POP-alpha algorithm is derived from the LANS-alpha primitive equations, but
requires a nested iteration that makes it too slow for practical simulations; a
reduced POP-alpha algorithm is proposed, which lacks the nested iteration and
is two to three times faster than the full algorithm. The reduced algorithm
does not follow from a formal derivation of the LANS-alpha model equations.
Despite this, simulations of the reduced algorithm are nearly identical to the
full algorithm, as judged by globally averaged temperature and kinetic energy,
and snapshots of temperature and velocity fields. Both POP-alpha algorithms can
run stably with longer timesteps than standard POP.
  Comparison of implementations of full and reduced POP-alpha algorithms are
made within an idealized test problem that captures some aspects of the
Antarctic Circumpolar Current, a problem in which baroclinic instability is
prominent. Both POP-alpha algorithms produce statistics that resemble
higher-resolution simulations of standard POP.
  A linear stability analysis shows that both the full and reduced POP-alpha
algorithms benefit from the way the LANS-alpha equations take into account the
effects of the small scales on the large. Both algorithms (1) are stable; (2)
make the Rossby Radius effectively larger; and (3) slow down Rossby and gravity
waves.

turbulence parameterization that has been shown to capture some of the most
important features of high resolution ocean modeling at lower resolution.
Simulations using LANS-alpha in the POP primitive-equation ocean model resemble
doubled-resolution simulations of standard POP in statistics like kinetic
energy, eddy kinetic energy, and potential temperature fields. The
computational cost of adding LANS-alpha is only 27% for our most efficient
implementation, as compared to a factor of 8-10 for a doubling of resolution.
  The LANS-alpha model improves turbulence statistics with an additional
nonlinear term and a smoothed advecting velocity. In this work we investigate
different kinds of smoothing techniques and their effect on the LANS-alpha
model's results and efficiency. We show that we can substitute convolution
filters for full Hemlholtz inversions and produce similar results at a
significantly lower expense.
  When constructing filters for LANS-alpha in a primitive-equation ocean model
the filter weights must be chosen carefully, otherwise a pressure-velocity
instability will be excited. We show analytically that certain ranges of filter
weights are unstable, and confirm this with numerical experiments. Our
stability criterion also guarantees that the kinetic energy is well defined,
and that the filtered velocity is smoother that the original velocity.
