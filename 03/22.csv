  A remarkable feature of the RG flow is the emergence of an intrinsic UV

of the equations at small scales. As a consequence, the method is able to
follow the non-linear evolution of the power-spectrum down to zero redshift and

which further supports a 0.090+/-0.005 Msun mass for the system. Once armed
with an accurate spectrum and Ks flux we find L=0.0021+/-0.0005 Lsun and
Teff=2925{+170}{-145}K for AB Dor C. These values are consistent with a ~75 Myr
0.090+/-0.005 Msun object like AB Dor C according to the DUSTY evolutionary
tracks (Chabrier et al. 2000). Hence masses can be estimated from the HR
diagram with the DUSTY tracks for young low-mass objects like AB Dor C.
However, we cautiously note that underestimates of the mass from the tracks can
occur if one lacks a proper (continuum preserved) spectra or is relying on NIR
fluxes alone.

binary, with separations ranging from 0.04"" to 0.6"" and flux ratios from 1.4 to
3.7. In all cases, the companions are likely to be physically associated with
the primaries (probability > 4-sigma). Using the theoretical models of Baraffe
et al. (1998), we find that all five new companions, as well as one of the
primaries, are likely brown dwarfs. The discovery of these systems therefore
increases the total number of known, young VLM binaries by ~50%. These new
systems, along with other young VLM binaries from the literature, have
properties that differ significantly from older field VLM binaries in that the
young systems have wider separations and lower mass ratios, supporting the idea
that VLM binaries undergo significant dynamical evolution ~5 - 10 Myr after
their formation. The range of separations of these binaries, four of which are
over 30 AU, argues against the ejection scenario of brown dwarf formation.
While several of the young, VLM binaries discovered in this study have lower
binding energies than the previously suggested minimum for VLM binaries, the
apparent minimum is still significantly higher than that found among higher
mass binaries. We suggest that this discrepancy may be due to the small mass of
a VLM binary relative to the average perturbing star, leading to more
substantial changes in their binding energy over time.

magnetorotational instability in a collisionless plasma show that angular
momentum transport by pressure anisotropy ($p_\perp \ne p_\parallel$, where the
directions are defined with respect to the local magnetic field) is comparable
to that due to the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses. Pressure anisotropy, which is
effectively a large-scale viscosity, arises because of adiabatic invariants
related to $p_\perp$ and $p_\parallel$ in a fluctuating magnetic field. In a
collisionless plasma, the magnitude of the pressure anisotropy, and thus the
viscosity, is determined by kinetic instabilities at the cyclotron frequency.
Our simulations show that $\sim 50$ % of the gravitational potential energy is
directly converted into heat at large scales by the viscous stress (the
remaining energy is lost to grid-scale numerical dissipation of kinetic and
magnetic energy). We show that electrons receive a significant fraction ($\sim
[T_e/T_i]^{1/2}$) of this dissipated energy. Employing this heating by an
anisotropic viscous stress in one dimensional models of radiatively inefficient
accretion flows, we find that the radiative efficiency of the flow is greater
than 0.5% for $\dot{M} \gtrsim 10^{-4} \dot{M}_{Edd}$. Thus a low accretion
rate, rather than just a low radiative efficiency, is necessary to explain the
low luminosity of many accreting black holes. For Sgr A* in the Galactic
Center, our predicted radiative efficiencies imply an accretion rate of
$\approx 3 \times 10^{-8} M_\odot {\rm yr^{-1}}$ and an electron temperature of

consistent with the brightness temperature inferred from VLBI observations.

Type Ia supernovae. In this mechanism, ignition occurs at one or several
off-center points, resulting in a burning bubble of hot ash that rises rapidly,
breaks through the surface of the star, and collides at a point opposite
breakout on the stellar surface. We find that detonation conditions are
robustly reached in our 3-D simulations for a range of initial conditions and
resolutions. Detonation conditions are achieved as the result of an
inwardly-directed jet that is produced by the compression of unburnt surface
material when the surface flow collides with itself. A high-velocity
outwardly-directed jet is also produced. The initial conditions explored in
this paper lead to conditions at detonation that can be expected to produce
large amounts of $^{56}$Ni and small amounts of intermediate mass elements.
These particular simulations are therefore relevant only to high luminosity
Type Ia supernovae. Recent observations of Type Ia supernovae imply a
compositional structure that is qualitatively consistent with that expected
from these simulations.

the magnetic field plays the governing role -- one might speak of a ``magnetic

instabilities occuring in two--dimensional magnetized accretion disks. We model
axisymmetric MHD disk tori, and solve the equations governing a
two--dimensional magnetized accretion disk equilibrium and linear wave modes
about this equilibrium. We show the existence of novel MHD instabilities in
these two--dimensional equilibria which do not occur in an accretion disk in
the cylindrical limit. The disk equilibria are numerically computed by the
FINESSE code. The stability of accretion disks is investigated analytically as
well as numerically. We use the PHOENIX code to compute all the waves and
instabilities accessible to the computed disk equilibrium. We concentrate on
strongly magnetized disks and sub--Keplerian rotation in a large part of the
disk. These disk equilibria show that the thermal pressure of the disk can only
decrease outwards if there is a strong gravitational potential. Our theoretical
stability analysis shows that convective continuum instabilities can only
appear if the density contours coincide with the poloidal magnetic flux
contours. Our numerical results confirm and complement this theoretical
analysis. Furthermore, these results show that the influence of gravity can
either be stabilizing or destabilizing on this new kind of MHD instability. In
the likely case of a non--constant density, the height of the disk should
exceed a threshold before this type of instability can play a role. This
localised MHD instability provides an ideal, linear route to MHD turbulence in
strongly magnetized accretion disk tori.

present a statistical method for composition studies based on several
measurable features of the longitudinal development of the CR shower such as
$N_{max}$, $X_{max}$, asymmetry, skewness and kurtosis. Principal component
analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate the relevance of each parameter in the
representation of the overall shower features and a linear discriminant
analysis (LDA) was used to combine the different parameters to maximize the
discrimination between different particle showers. The new parameter from LDA
provides a separation between primary gammas, proton and iron nuclei better

successfully tested in the energy range from $10^{17}$ to $10^{20}$ eV even
when limitations of shower track length were included in order to simulate the

METHOD: V-I colours of shells and underlying galaxies are derived, using HST
Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) data. A galaxy model is made locally in
wedges and subtracted to determine shell profiles and colours. We applied
Voronoi binning to our data to get smoothed colour maps of the galaxies.
Comparison with N-body simulations from the literature gives more insight to
the origin of the shell features. Shell positions and dust characteristics are
inferred from model galaxy subtracted images. RESULT: The ACS images reveal
shells well within the effective radius in some galaxies (at 1.7 kpc in the
case of NGC 5982). In some cases, strong nuclear dust patches prevent detection
of inner shells. Most shells have colours which are similar to the underlying
galaxy. Some inner shells are redder than the galaxy. All six shell galaxies
show out of dynamical equilibrium dust features, like lanes or patches, in
their central regions. Our detection rate for dust in the shell ellipticals is
greater than that found from HST archive data for a sample of normal early-type
galaxies, at the 95% confidence level. CONCLUSIONS: The merger model describes
better the shell distributions and morphologies than the interaction model. Red
shell colours are most likely due to the presence of dust and/or older stellar
populations. The high prevalence and out of dynamical equilibrium morphologies
of the central dust features point towards external influences being
responsible for visible dust features in early type shell galaxies. Inner
shells are able to manifest themselves in relatively old shell systems.

biological processes. They transform the chemical energy into the mechanical
work and move unidirectionally along rigid cytoskeleton filaments.
Single-molecule experiments suggest that motor proteins, consisting of two
motor domains, move in a hand-over-hand mechanism when each subunit changes
between trailing and leading positions in alternating steps, and these subunits
do not interact with each other. However, recent experiments on heterodimeric
kinesins suggest that the motion of motor domains is not independent, but
rather strongly coupled and coordinated, although the mechanism of these
interactions are not known. We propose a simple discrete stochastic model to
describe the dynamics of homodimeric and heterodimeric two-headed motor
proteins. It is argued that interactions between motor domains modify free
energy landscapes of each motor subunit, and motor proteins still move via the
hand-over-hand mechanism but with different transitions rates. Our calculations
of biophysical properties agree with experimental observations. Several ways to
test the theoretical model are proposed.

content distribution. It is therefore important to gain a complete
understanding of how these protocols behave in practice and how their operating
parameters affect overall system performance. This paper presents the first
detailed experimental investigation of the peer selection strategy in the
popular BitTorrent protocol. By observing more than 40 nodes in instrumented
private torrents, we validate three protocol properties that, though believed
to hold, have not been previously demonstrated experimentally: the clustering
of similar-bandwidth peers, the effectiveness of BitTorrent's sharing
incentives, and the peers' high uplink utilization. In addition, we observe
that BitTorrent's modified choking algorithm in seed state provides uniform
service to all peers, and that an underprovisioned initial seed leads to
absence of peer clustering and less effective sharing incentives. Based on our
results, we provide guidelines for seed provisioning by content providers, and
discuss a tracker protocol extension that addresses an identified limitation of
the protocol.

  of the American Mathematical Society",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Kronecker coefficient g_{\lambda \mu \nu} is the multiplicity of the
GL(V)\times GL(W)-irreducible V_\lambda \otimes W_\mu in the restriction of the
GL(X)-irreducible X_\nu via the natural map GL(V)\times GL(W) \to GL(V \otimes
W), where V, W are \mathbb{C}-vector spaces and X = V \otimes W. A fundamental
open problem in algebraic combinatorics is to find a positive combinatorial
formula for these coefficients.
  We construct two quantum objects for this problem, which we call the
nonstandard quantum group and nonstandard Hecke algebra. We show that the
nonstandard quantum group has a compact real form and its representations are
completely reducible, that the nonstandard Hecke algebra is semisimple, and
that they satisfy an analog of quantum Schur-Weyl duality.
  Using these nonstandard objects as a guide, we follow the approach of Adsul,
Sohoni, and Subrahmanyam to construct, in the case dim(V) = dim(W) =2, a
representation \check{X}_\nu of the nonstandard quantum group that specializes
to Res_{GL(V) \times GL(W)} X_\nu at q=1. We then define a global crystal basis
+HNSTC(\nu) of \check{X}_\nu that solves the two-row Kronecker problem: the
number of highest weight elements of +HNSTC(\nu) of weight (\lambda,\mu) is the
Kronecker coefficient g_{\lambda \mu \nu}. We go on to develop the beginnings
of a graphical calculus for this basis, along the lines of the U_q(\sl_2)
graphical calculus, and use this to organize the crystal components of
+HNSTC(\nu) into eight families. This yields a fairly simple, explicit and
positive formula for two-row Kronecker coefficients, generalizing a formula of
Brown, van Willigenburg, and Zabrocki. As a byproduct of the approach, we also
obtain a rule for the decomposition of Res_{GL_2 \times GL_2 \rtimes \S_2}
X_\nu into irreducibles.

assume the typical length of these loops is determined by the gravitational
radiation scale and use the results of \cite{Polchinski:2007rg} which pointed
out their highly relativistic nature. A study of the gravitational wave
emission from such a population is carried out. The large Lorentz boost
involved causes the lowest harmonics of the loops to fall within the frequency
band of the LIGO detector. Due to this feature the gravitational waves emitted
by such loops can be detected in a periodic search rather than in burst or
stochastic analysis.
  It is shown that, for interesting values of the string tension
($10^{-10}\lsim G\mu\lsim 10^{-8}$) the detector can observe loops at
reasonably high redshifts and that detection is, in principle, possible. We
compute the number of expected observations produced by such a process. For a
10 hour search we find that this number is of order $O(10^{-4})$. This is a
consequence of the low effective number density of the loops traveling along
the line of sight. However, small probabilities of reconnection and longer
observation times can improve the result.

ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, the transport rate of gluon drift and
the transport collision rates of elastic ($gg \leftrightarrow gg$) as well as
inelastic ($gg \leftrightarrow ggg$) perturbative quantum chromodynamics-
(pQCD) scattering processes are introduced and calculated within the kinetic
parton cascade Boltzmann approach of multiparton scatterings (BAMPS), which
simulates the space-time evolution of partons. We define isotropization as the
development of an anisotropic system as it reaches isotropy. The inverse of the
introduced total transport rate gives the correct time scale of the momentum
isotropization. The contributions of the various scattering processes to the
momentum isotropization can be separated into the transport collision rates. In
contrast to the transport cross section, the transport collision rate has an
indirect but correctly implemented relationship with the collision-angle
distribution. Based on the calculated transport collision rates from BAMPS for
central Au+Au collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider energies, we show
that pQCD $gg \leftrightarrow ggg$ bremsstrahlung processes isotropize the
momentum five times more efficiently than elastic scatterings. The large
efficiency of the bremsstrahlung stems mainly from its large momentum
deflection. Due to kinematics, $2\to N$ $(N>2)$ production processes allow more
particles to become isotropic in momentum space and thus kinetically
equilibrate more quickly than their back reactions or elastic scatterings. We
also show that the relaxation time in the relaxation time approximation, which
is often used, is strongly momentum dependent and thus cannot serve as a global
quantity that describes kinetic equilibration.

electromagnetism with a gauge field (photon) and a pseudo-vector gauge field
(pseudo-photon) to 2+1-dimensions. In the absence of boundary effects, the
quantum structure is maintained, while when boundary effects are considered, as
have been previously studied, a cross Chern-Simons term between both gauge
fields is present, which accounts for topological effects and changes the
quantum structure of the theory. Our construction maintains the dimensional
reduced action invariant under parity (P) and time-inversion (T). We show that
the theory has two massive degrees of freedom, corresponding to the
longitudinal modes of the photon and of the pseudo-photon and briefly discuss
the quantization procedures of the theory in the topological limit (wave
functional quantization) and perturbative limit (an effective dynamical current
theory), pointing out directions to solve the constraints and deal with the
negative energy contributions from pseudo-photons. We recall that the physical
interpretation of the fields in the planar system is new and is only meaningful
in the context of Ue(1)xUg(1) electromagnetism. In this work it is shown that
all the six electromagnetic vectorial fields components are present in the
dimensional reduced theory and that, independently of the embedding of the
planar system, can be described in terms of the two gauge fields only. As far
as the author is aware it is the first time that such a construction is fully
justified, thus allowing a full vectorial treatment at variational level of
electromagnetism in planar systems.

vortexes due to the internal pseudo-photons (interpreted as quasi-holes) that
account for the anyon quantized magnetic flux and fractional electric charges,
respectively. The effective magnetic flux is the only effective effect
attributed to the standard internal photon which ensures compatibility between
the pseudo nature of Laughlin's wave functions and macroscopical parity 'P' and
time-inversion 'T' symmetries. In this way the model preserves these symmetries
both at variational level and at the level of the electromagnetic equations. In
particular holds the usual fractional Hall conductances with the Hall
conductance '\hat{\sigma}_H' being a pseudo-scalar consistently with the
electric Hall current equation. The negative energy contribution of quasi-holes
to the Laughlin's wave function (...) is justified and the quantization of
magnetic flux is directly equivalent to the Dirac's quantization condition
applied to the coupling constants, or fundamental unit charges 'e' and 'g'. If
our framework proves to be correct, quantization of magnetic flux may be the
most direct evidence for Dirac's quantization condition. Our results also
indicate that pseudo-photons electric vortex may give a theoretical
justification for the electric potential between layers of bi-layer Hall

spacetimes containing gravity coupled to a real scalar and an abelian gauge

order to explore the AdS/CFT correspondence when the boundary gauge theory is
on R x S^3. A fake supergravity action, invariant under local supersymmetry
through linear order in fermion fields, is obtained. The gauge field makes
things more restrictive than in previous applications of fake supergravity
which allowed quite general scalar potentials. Here the superpotential must
take the form W(\phi) ~ exp(-k\phi) + c exp(2\phi/(3k)), and the only freedom
is the choice of the constant k. The fermion transformation rules of fake
supergravity lead to fake Killing spinor equations. From their integrability
conditions, we obtain first order differential equations which we solve
analytically to find singular electrically charged solutions of the Lagrangian
field equations. A Schwarzschild mass term can be added to produce a horizon
which shields the singularity. The solutions, which include ""superstars"", turn
out to be known in the literature. We compute their holographic parameters.

  Our proof is a combination of a relative version of Kontsevich's formality of
the little d-disks operad and of Sinha's cosimplicial model for the space of
long knots arising from Goodwillie-Weiss embedding calculus. As another
ingredient in our proof, we introduce a generalization of a construction that
associates a cosimplicial object to a multiplicative operad. Along the way we
also establish some results about the Bousfield-Kan spectral sequences of a

Multiplicity-Polar Theorem relates the multiplicity of the pair of modules at a
special point of the parameter to the multiplicity of the pair at a generic
point. This theorem is proved in this paper (Corollary 1.4).
  The applications of the Multiplicity-Polar theorem are of two types. In the
first we construct a deformation so that we can understand the significance of
the multiplicity of the pair, or show we can use the multiplicity of the pair
to describe some geometric behavior. Applications of this type are the
geometric significance of the BR-multiplicity (Theorem 2.1), the geometric
significance of multiplicity of the pair (J(f), I) where f defines a
hypersurface with non-isolated singularities, J(f) is the jacobian ideal of f
and I is the ideal of the singular locus of the hypersurface. We do the cases
where I defines a complete intersection (Theorem 2.3), or the hypersurface is
the image of a finitely determined map-germ F: C^2,0\to C^3,0 (Theorem 2.6). We
then show how the multiplicity of the pair can be used to calculate the index
of a differential 1-form with an isolated singularity on a germ of an isolated
singularity (Theorem 2.8). In the second kind of application, we use the
generalization of the Principle of Specialization of Integral Dependence to
prove results in equisingularity. The particular condition we study in this
paper is the W_f condition (Theorems 2.10 and 2.11).

  In this paper, we suggest to use decision problems from combinatorial group

a cryptosystem with the following features: (1) Bob transmits to Alice an
encrypted binary sequence which Alice decrypts correctly with probability ""very
close"" to 1; (2) the adversary, Eve, who is granted arbitrarily high (but
fixed) computational speed, cannot positively identify (at least, in theory),
by using a ""brute force attack"", the ""1"" or ""0"" bits in Bob's binary sequence.
In other words: no matter what computational speed we grant Eve at the outset,
there is no guarantee that her ""brute force attack"" program will give a
conclusive answer (or an answer which is correct with overwhelming probability)
about any bit in Bob's sequence.

of these soliton hierarchies utilizes a moving parallel frame and connection
1-form along the curve flows, related to the Klein geometry of the Lie group
$G\supset H$ where $H$ is the local frame structure group. The soliton
equations arise in explicit form from the induced flow on the frame components

display invariance under the equivalence subgroup in $H$ that preserves the
unit tangent vector $T=\mapder{x}$ in the framing at any point $x$ on a curve.
Their bi-Hamiltonian integrability structure is shown to be geometrically
encoded in the Cartan structure equations for torsion and curvature of the
parallel frame and its connection 1-form in the tangent space $T_\map M$ of the
curve flow. The hierarchies include group-invariant versions of sine-Gordon

the baryon sector (BChPT). Our analysis is performed at leading-one-loop order
in BChPT, predicting both the momentum and the quark-mass dependence for the

We also study the limit of vanishing four-momentum transfer where the
GPD-moments reduce to the well known moments of Parton Distribution Functions

mechanism for chiral curvature, connecting the high values for this moment
typically found in lattice QCD studies for large quark masses with the smaller
value known from phenomenology. Likewise, we analyze the quark-mass dependence
of the isoscalar moments in the forward limit and extract the contribution of
quarks to the total spin of the nucleon. We close with a first glance at the

considered. Differentials were selected to represent measurement inaccuracies

applied on the process equation and the total differential error dp for any
unknown load (Device Under Test DUT) was expressed in terms of dEs and dm,
without any simplification. Consequently, the differential error of input

reduced to a quantum state identification problem so that the resulting quantum
query complexity does not depend on p. For univariate polynomials we construct
a von Neumann measurement for distinguishing the states. We relate the success
probability and the implementation of this measurement to certain classical
problems involving polynomial equations. We present an efficient algorithm for
