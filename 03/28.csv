generalize the field line mapping technique to arbitrary geometry of the
boundaries and systems of coordinates. Indeed, the global description of the
connectivity in the corona requires the use of the photospheric and solar wind
boundaries. Both are closed surfaces and therefore do not admit a global
regular system of coordinates. At least two overlapping regular systems of
coordinates for each of the boundaries are necessary in this case to avoid
spherical-pole-like singularities in the coordinates of the footpoints. This
implies that the basic characteristic of magnetic connectivity - the squashing
degree or factor $Q$ of elemental flux tubes (Titov et al., 2002) - must be
rewritten in covariant form. Such a covariant expression of $Q$ is derived in
this work. The derived expression is very flexible and highly efficient for
describing the global magnetic connectivity in the solar corona.
  In addition, a general expression for a new characteristic $Q_\perp$ which
defines a squashing of the flux tubes in the directions perpendicular to the
field lines is determined. This new quantity makes it possible to filter out
the quasi-separatrix layers whose large values of $Q$ are caused by a
projection effect at the field lines nearly touching the photosphere. Thus, the
value $Q_\perp$ provides a much more precise description of the volumetric
properties of the magnetic field structure. The difference between $Q$ and
$Q_\perp$ is illustrated by comparing their distributions for two
configurations, one of which is the Titov-Demoulin (1999) model of a twisted
magnetic field.

results in colours and magnitudes for both bright and faint counterparts
consistent with a small range of spectral types, and for the bright
counterpart, consistent with the spectroscopic identification. Photometry of
the faint candidate indicates it is a K7/M0 V star at a distance of 3.75 +- 1
kpc. This star would require a very low inclination angle (i < 9deg) to satisfy
the mass function constraints; however it cannot be excluded as the counterpart
without follow-up spectroscopy to detect emission signatures of accretion.
Photometry and spectroscopy of the bright candidate indicate it is most likely
a G/K III star. The spectrum does not show Br-gamma emission, a known indicator
of accretion. The bright star's magnitudes are in agreement with the
constraints placed on a probable counterpart by the calculations of Rappaport &
Joss (1997) for an evolved star that has had its envelope stripped. The mass
function indicates the counterpart should have M < 0.3 Msol for an inclination
of i >= 15deg; a stripped giant, or a main sequence M3+ V star are consistent
with this mass-function constraint. In both cases mass-transfer, if present,
will be by wind-accretion as the counterpart will not fill its Roche lobe given
the observed orbital period. The derived magnetic field of 2.4 x 10^{11} G will
inhibit accretion by the propeller effect, hence its quiescent state.

the form of a gaussian velocity distribution. We allowed emission from both the
primary and secondary shocks but introduced infinite opacity at the contact
surface, implying that only the side of the contact cone visible to the
observer contributed to the line profile. Using the orbital parameters of the
binary system derived from the 7 mm light curve during the last spectroscopic
event (Paper II) we were able to reproduce the line profiles obtained with the
HST at different epochs, as well as the line mean velocities obtained with
ground based telescopes. A very important feature of our model is that the line
profile depends on the inclination of the orbital plane; we found that to
explain the latitude dependent mean velocity of the line, scattered into the
line of sight by the Homunculus, the orbit inclination should be close to 90
degrees, meaning that it does not lie in the Homunculus equatorial plane, as
usually assumed. This inclination, together with the relative position of the
stars during the spectroscopic events, allowed us to explain most of the
observational features, like the variation of the Purple Haze with the orbital
phase, and to conciliate the X-ray absorption with the postulated shell effect
used to explain the optical and UV light curves.

evolution models were computed for rotation velocities on the zero-age
main-sequence of 0 and 300 km/s and with the latest revision of stellar
mass-loss rates. Since the mass coverage is incomplete, in particular at
non-solar chemical composition, our parameter study is still preliminary and
must be viewed as exploratory. Stellar population properties computed with
Starburst99 and the new evolution models show some marked differences in
comparison with models obtained using earlier tracks. Since individual stars
now tend to be more luminous and bluer when on the blue side of the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the populations mirror this trend. For instance,
increases by factors of two or more are found for the light-to-mass ratios at
ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths, as well as for the output of hydrogen
ionizing photons. If these results are confirmed once the evolution models have
matured, recalibrations of certain star-formation and initial mass function
indicators will be required.

totaloptical depth, (2,3) Wsi and Wciv, the rest equivalent widths of the

QSO-DLAs are similar, each has median dv~80km/s and a significant tail to
several hundred km/s. This suggests comparable galaxy masses for the parent
populations of GRB-DLAs and QSO-DLAs and we infer the average dark matter halo
mass of GRB galaxies is <~10^{12} Msol. The unique configuration of GRB-DLA
sightlines and the presence (and absence) of fine-structure absorption together
give special insight into the nature of high z, protogalactic velocity fields.
The data support a scenario where the dv statistic reflects dynamics in the
interstellar medium (ISM) and Wsi traces motions outside the ISM (e.g. halo
gas, galactic-scale winds). The Wsi statistic and gas metallicity [M/H] are
tightly correlated, especially for the QSO-DLAs: [M/H]=a + b log(Wsi/1A) with
a=-0.92+/-0.05 and b=-1.41+/-0.10. We argue that the Wsi statistic primarily
tracks dynamical motions in the halos of high z galaxies and interpret this
correlation as a mass-metallicity relation with very similar slope to the trend
observed in local, low-metallicity galaxies. Finally, the GRB-DLAs exhibit
systematically larger Wsi values (>0.5A) than the QSO-DLAs (<Wsi>~ 0.5A) which
may suggest galactic-scale outflows contribute to the largest observed velocity

The kinematical analysis gives a value for the elongation of the potential to
be $\sim 10 % $. The mean amplitude of spatial lopsidedness is found to be
$\sim 0.14$ in the inner disc, similar to the field galaxies, and is smaller by
a factor of $\sim 2$ compared to the Eridanus group galaxies. It is also shown
that the the average value of A$_1$ does not increase with the Hubble type,
contrary to what is seen in field galaxies. We argue that the physical origin
of lopsidedness in the Ursa Major group of galaxies is tidal interactions,
albeit weaker and less frequent than in Eridanus. Thus systematic studies of
lopsidedness in groups of galaxies can provide dynamical clues regarding the

their redshift space distortion parameter, and correct accordingly the

length is $r^{\rm re}_{0}=1.8 \pm 0.2 h^{-1}$Mpc and $r^{\rm re}_{0}=3.9 \pm

For both the fireball and the AC model, we investigate the dynamical importance
of neutrons on the outflow. We study particle creation in inelastic neutron -

is too weak to be detectable. The inelastic collisions also produce gamma-rays,
which create pairs in interactions with soft photons carried with the flow. In
magnetically driven outflows, the energy of these pairs is radiated away as
synchrotron emission. The bulk of the emission takes place at a few hundred
keV, which makes it difficult to disentangle this signal from the prompt
emission. In fireballs, however, pair cascading leads to the emission of
gamma-rays with observer energy in the range of 2 - 20 GeV and a fluence well
above the GLAST threshold. Therefore this emission can be a useful diagnostic
of the nature of the outflow.

Such speeds would enable the merger product to escape its host galaxy. Here we
examine the circumstances resulting from a gas-rich galaxy merger under which
the ejected BH would carry an accretion disk with it and be observable. As the
initial BH binary emits gravitational radiation and its orbit tightens, a hole
is opened around it in the disk which delays the consumption of gas prior to
the eventual BH ejection. The punctured disk remains bound to the ejected BH
within the region where the gas orbital velocity is larger than the ejection
speed. For a ~10^7 solar mass BH the ejected disk has a characteristic size of
tens of thousands of Schwarzschild radii and an accretion lifetime of ~10^7
years. During that time, the ejected BH could traverse a considerable distance

behind. A small fraction of all quasars could be associated with an escaping

J051324-691049. This is identified as a likely compact HII region based on

adjacent to the compact HII region and just within the borders of the NE edge
of B0513-692. We suggest this is a separate new SNR candidate based on its

stars leads to brighter and bluer star-light, but also to more interstellar
dust and thus to more absorption, causing a kind of ""IMF degeneracy"". The most

the molecular shape anisotropy, represented by the alignment tensor, is a
random variable of an annealed type. A prototype of such behavior can be found
in lyotropic systems - a mixture of potassium laurate, 1-decanol, and $D_2O$,
where distribution of the micellar shape adjusts to actual equilibrium
conditions. Further examples of materials with the biaxial nematic phase, where
molecular shape is subject to fluctuations, are thermotropic materials composed
of flexible trimeric- or tetrapod-like molecular units. Our calculations show
that the Gaussian equilibrium distribution of the variables describing
molecular shape (dispersion force) anisotropy gives rise to new classes of the
phase diagrams, absent in the original model. Depending on properties of the
shape fluctuations, the stability of the biaxial nematic phase can be either
enhanced or depressed, relative to the uniaxial nematic phases. In the former
case the splitting of the Landau point into two triple points with a direct
phase transition line from isotropic to biaxial phase is observed.

games. Our approach is based on the data structure called the {\em best
response policy}, which was proposed by Kearns et al. \cite{kls} as a way to
represent all Nash equilibria of a graphical game. In \cite{egg}, it was shown
that the best response policy has polynomial size as long as the underlying
graph is a path. In this paper, we show that if the underlying graph is a
bounded-degree tree and the best response policy has polynomial size then there
is an efficient algorithm which constructs a Nash equilibrium that guarantees
certain payoffs to all participants. Another attractive solution concept is a
Nash equilibrium that maximizes the social welfare. We show that, while exactly
computing the latter is infeasible (we prove that solving this problem may
involve algebraic numbers of an arbitrarily high degree), there exists an FPTAS
for finding such an equilibrium as long as the best response policy has
polynomial size. These two algorithms can be combined to produce Nash
equilibria that satisfy various fairness criteria.

  Applications in a Parallel Environment","15 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables Submitted to International Conference
  on Parallel Processing (ICPP'07)",,,,"cs.DC",,"  Applications in science and engineering often require huge computational
resources for solving problems within a reasonable time frame. Parallel
supercomputers provide the computational infrastructure for solving such
problems. A traditional application scheduler running on a parallel cluster
only supports static scheduling where the number of processors allocated to an
application remains fixed throughout the lifetime of execution of the job. Due
to the unpredictability in job arrival times and varying resource requirements,
static scheduling can result in idle system resources thereby decreasing the
overall system throughput. In this paper we present a prototype framework
called ReSHAPE, which supports dynamic resizing of parallel MPI applications
executed on distributed memory platforms. The framework includes a scheduler
that supports resizing of applications, an API to enable applications to
interact with the scheduler, and a library that makes resizing viable.
Applications executed using the ReSHAPE scheduler framework can expand to take
advantage of additional free processors or can shrink to accommodate a high
priority application, without getting suspended. In our research, we have
mainly focused on structured applications that have two-dimensional data arrays
distributed across a two-dimensional processor grid. The resize library
includes algorithms for processor selection and processor mapping. Experimental
results show that the ReSHAPE framework can improve individual job turn-around
time and overall system throughput.

interaction between TCP and the QoS services has been intensively studied. This
paper proposes to look forward to the results obtained in terms of TCP
throughput guarantee in the DiffServ Assured Forwarding (DiffServ/AF) service
and to present an overview of the different proposals to solve the problem. It
has been demonstrated that the standardized IETF DiffServ conditioners such as
the token bucket color marker and the time sliding window color maker were not
good TCP traffic descriptors. Starting with this point, several propositions
have been made and most of them presents new marking schemes in order to
replace or improve the traditional token bucket color marker. The main problem
is that TCP congestion control is not designed to work with the AF service.
Indeed, both mechanisms are antagonists. TCP has the property to share in a
fair manner the bottleneck bandwidth between flows while DiffServ network
provides a level of service controllable and predictable. In this paper, we
build a classification of all the propositions made during these last years and
compare them. As a result, we will see that these conditioning schemes can be
separated in three sets of action level and that the conditioning at the
network edge level is the most accepted one. We conclude that the problem is
still unsolved and that TCP, conditioned or not conditioned, remains
inappropriate to the DiffServ/AF service.

field in general relativity can be identified on an initial hypersurface
consisting of two intersecting null hypersurfaces. Here the phase space of
vacuum general relativity associated with such an initial data hypersurface is
defined; a Poisson bracket is defined, via Peierls' prescription, on
sufficiently regular functions on this phase space, called ``observables''; and
a bracket on initial data is defined so that it reproduces the Peierls bracket
between observables when these are expressed in terms of the initial data. The
brackets between all elements of a free initial data set are calculated
explicitly. The bracket on initial data presented here has all the
characteristics of a Poisson bracket except that it does not satisfy the Jacobi
relations (even though the brackets between the observables do).
  The initial data set used is closely related to that of Sachs. However, one
significant difference is that it includes a ``new'' pair of degrees of freedom
on the intersection of the two null hypersurfaces which are present but quite
hidden in Sachs' formalism. As a step in the calculation an explicit expression
for the symplectic 2-form in terms of these free initial data is obtained.

this and related contexts. To expound these issues we critique on two
representative theories: One claims that decoherence in quantum gravity scale
leads to the violation of CPT symmetry at sub-Planckian energy which is used to
explain today's particle phenomenology. The other uses this process in place
with the Brownian motion model to prove that spacetime foam behaves like a

scalar masses lie in the TeV or beyond regime. For example, the focus point
(FP) region of the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) model is especially compelling
in that heavy scalar masses can co-exist with low fine-tuning while yielding
the required relic abundance of cold dark matter (via a mixed higgsino-bino
neutralino). We examine many of the characteristics of collider events expected
to arise at the CERN LHC in models with multi-TeV scalars, taking the mSUGRA FP
region as a case study. The collider events are characterized by a hard
component arising from gluino pair production, plus a soft component arising
from direct chargino and neutralino production. Gluino decays in the FP region
are characterized by lengthy cascades yielding very large jet and lepton
multiplicities, and a large b-jet multiplicity. Thus, as one steps to higher
jet, b-jet or lepton multiplicity, signal-over-background rates should steadily
improve. The lengthy cascade decays make mass reconstruction via kinematic
edges difficult; however, since the hard component is nearly pure gluino pair
production, the gluino mass can be extracted to +- 8% via total rate for \eslt
+\ge 7-jet +\ge 2 b-jet events, assuming 100 fb^{-1} of integrated luminosity.
The distribution of invariant mass of opposite-sign/same-flavor dileptons in
the hard component exhibits two dilepton mass edges: m_{\tz_2}-m_{\tz_1} and
m_{\tz_3}-m_{\tz_1}. As a consistency check, the same mass edges should be seen
in isolated opposite-sign dileptons occurring in the soft component trilepton
signal which originates mainly from chargino-neutralino production.

conformal symmetry using Heisenberg operators, and a related possibility to
extend conformal supersymmetry using parabose operators. The symmetry proposed
is of a simple mathematical form, as is the form of necessary symmetry breaking
that reduces it to the conformal (super)symmetry. It turns out that this
extension of conformal superalgebra can be obtained from standard non-extended
conformal superalgebra by allowing anticommutators $\{Q_\eta, Q_\xi\}$ and
$\{\bar Q_{\dot \eta}, \bar Q_{\dot \xi}\}$ to be nonzero operators and then by
closing the algebra. In regard of the famous Coleman and Mandula theorem (and
related Haag-Lopuszanski-Sohnius theorem), the higher symmetries that we
consider do not satisfy the requirement for finite number of particles with
masses below any given constant. However, we argue that in the context of
theories with broken symmetries, this constraint may be unnecessarily strong.

together with their resolvent, of the symmetric operator $S$ obtained by
restricting the self-adjoint operator $A:\D(A)\subseteq\H\to\H$ to the dense,
closed with respect to the graph norm, subspace $\N\subset \D(A)$. Neither the
knowledge of $S^*$ nor of the deficiency spaces of $S$ is required. Typically
$A$ is a differential operator and $\N$ is the kernel of some trace
(restriction) operator along a null subset. We parametrise the extensions by
the bundle $\pi:\E(\fh)\to\P(\fh)$, where $\P(\fh)$ denotes the set of
orthogonal projections in the Hilbert space $\fh\simeq \D(A)/\N$ and
$\pi^{-1}(\Pi)$ is the set of self-adjoint operators in the range of $\Pi$. The
set of self-adjoint operators in $\fh$, i.e. $\pi^{-1}(1)$, parametrises the
relatively prime extensions. Any $(\Pi,\Theta)\in \E(\fh)$ determines a
boundary condition in the domain of the corresponding extension
$A_{\Pi,\Theta}$ and explicitly appears in the formula for the resolvent

Poisson process whose intensity and/or jump size distribution changes at an
unobservable time with a known distribution. It is in the insurance company's
interest to detect the change time as soon as possible in order to re-evaluate
a new fair value for premiums to keep its profit level the same. This is
equivalent to a problem in which the intensity and the jump size change at the
same time but the intensity changes to a random variable with a know
distribution. This problem becomes an optimal stopping problem for a Markovian
sufficient statistic. Here, a special case of this problem is solved, in which
the rate of the arrivals moves up to one of two possible values, and the
Markovian sufficient statistic is two-dimensional.

models. The first assumes that the spike train is modeled as a counting or
point process on the real line where the conditional intensity function is a
product of a free firing rate function s, which depends only on the stimulus,
and a recovery function r, which depends only on the time since the last spike.
If s and r belong to a q-smooth class of functions, it is proved that sieve
maximum likelihood estimators for s and r achieve essentially the optimal
convergence rate (except for a logarithmic factor) under L_1 loss.
  The second part of this article considers template matching of multiple spike
trains. P-values for the occurrences of a given template or pattern in a set of
spike trains are computed using a general scoring system. By identifying the
pattern with an experimental stimulus, multiple spike trains can be deciphered
to provide useful information.

to model characteristics of investor behaviour and the complex interactions

physical sciences. We discuss recent developments in market microstructure
models. They are capable, often through numerical simulations, to explain many
stylized facts like the emergence of herding behavior, volatility clustering
and fat tailed returns distributions. They are typically queueing-type models,
that is, models of order flows, in contrast to classical economic equilibrium
theories of utility-maximizing, rational, ``representative'' investors.
Mathematically, they are analyzed using tools of functional central limit
theorems, strong approximations and weak convergence. Our main examples focus
on investor inertia, a trait that is well-documented, among other behavioral
qualities, and modelled using semi-Markov switching processes. In particular,
we show how inertia may lead to the phenomenon of long-range dependence in

asymptotically Gaussian and the variance of the estimate that is obtained from
a data segment of $N$ points is of order $\frac{1}{N}$. Wavelet analysis is
tailor made for the high frequency data set, since it has low computational
complexity due to the pyramidal algorithm for computing the detail

the latter is not a real restriction because in the unconstrained case, the
individual does not sell the risky asset short. Second, we allow the individual
to borrow money but only at a rate that is higher than the rate earned on the
riskless asset.
  We consider two forms of the consumption function: (1) The individual
consumes at a constant (real) dollar rate, and (2) the individual consumes a

the second is closely connected with Merton's model of optimal consumption and

population of faults obeying a rate-state friction law. Depending on the model
parameters and on the initial state, the fault exhibits aftershocks, slow
earthquakes, or decaying afterslip. We found several regimes with slip rate
decaying as a power-law of time, with different characteristic times and
exponents. The complexity of the model makes it unrealistic to invert for the
friction law parameters from afterslip data. We modeled afterslip measurements
for the Southern California Superstition Hills earthquake using the complete
rate-and-state law, and found a huge variety of model parameters that can fit
the observed data. In particular, it is impossible to distinguish the stable
velocity strengthening regime (A>B) from the (potentially) unstable velocity
weakening regime (B>A and stiffness k<kc). Therefore, it is not necessary to
involve small scale spatial or temporal fluctuations of friction parameters A
or B in order to explain the transition between stable sliding and seismic
slip. In addition to B/A and stiffness k/kc, the fault behavior is strongly
controlled by stress levels following an event. Stress heterogeneity can thus
explain most of the variety of postseismic behavior observed in nature.
Afterslip will induce a progressive reloading of faults that are not slipping,
which can trigger aftershocks. Using the relation between stress and seismicity
derived from the rate-and-state friction law, we estimate the aftershock rate
triggered by afterslip. Aftershock rate does not simply scale with stress rate,
but exhibits a different characteristic time and power-law exponent.

networks of cells is an important goal in systems biology. We study the system
level dynamical properties of the genetic network of Escherichia coli that
regulates its metabolism, and show how its design leads to biologically useful
cellular properties. Our study uses the database (Covert et al., Nature 2004)
containing 583 genes and 96 external metabolites which describes not only the
network connections but also the boolean rule at each gene node that controls
the switching on or off of the gene as a function of its inputs. We have
studied how the attractors of the boolean dynamical system constructed from
this database depend on the initial condition of the genes and on various
environmental conditions corresponding to buffered minimal media. We find that
the system exhibits homeostasis in that its attractors, that turn out to be
fixed points or low period cycles, are highly insensitive to initial conditions
or perturbations of gene configurations for any given fixed environment. At the
same time the attractors show a wide variation when external media are varied
implying that the system mounts a highly flexible response to changed
environmental conditions. The regulatory dynamics acts to enhance the cellular
growth rate under changed media. Our study shows that the reconstructed genetic
network regulating metabolism in {\it E. coli} is hierarchical, modular, and
largely acyclic, with environmental variables controlling the root of the
hierarchy. This architecture makes the cell highly robust to perturbations of
gene configurations as well as highly responsive to environmental changes. The
twin properties of homeostasis and response flexibility are achieved by this
dynamical system even though it is not close to the edge of chaos.

our conceptual understanding of how living systems function. Systems-level
study of specificity in protein-protein interactions is complicated by the fact
that the cellular environment is crowded and heterogeneous; interaction pairs
may exist at low relative concentrations and thus be presented with many more
opportunities for promiscuous interactions compared to specific interaction
possibilities. Here we address these questions using a simple computational
model that includes specifically designed interacting model proteins immersed
in a mixture containing hundreds of different unrelated ones; all of them
undergo simulated diffusion and interaction. We find that specific complexes
are quite robust to interference from promiscuous interaction partners, only in
the range of temperatures Tdesign>T>Trand. At T>Tdesign specific complexes
become unstable, while at T<Trand formation of specific complexes is suppressed
by promiscuous interactions. Specific interactions can form only if
Tdesign>Trand. This condition requires an energy gap between binding energy in
a specific complex and set of binding energies between randomly associating
proteins, providing a general physical constraint on evolutionary selection or
design of specific interacting protein interfaces. This work has implications
for our understanding of how the protein repertoire functions and evolves

Entropy (MaxREnt) as a tool for statistical inference in ecology. In contrast,
here we propose MaxREnt as a tool for applying statistical mechanics to
ecology. We use MaxREnt to explain and predict species abundance patterns in
ecological communities in terms of the most probable behaviour under given
environmental constraints, in the same way that statistical mechanics explains
and predicts the behaviour of thermodynamic systems. We show that MaxREnt
unifies a number of different ecological patterns: (i) at relatively local
scales a unimodal biodiversity-productivity relationship is predicted in good
agreement with published data on grassland communities, (ii) the predicted
relative frequency of rare vs. abundant species is very similar to the
empirical lognormal distribution, (iii) both neutral and non-neutral species
abundance patterns are explained, (iv) on larger scales a monotonic
biodiversity-productivity relationship is predicted in agreement with the
species-energy law, (v) energetic equivalence and power-law self-thinning
behaviour are predicted in resource-rich communities. We identify mathematical
similarities between these ecological patterns and the behaviour of
thermodynamic systems, and conclude that the explanation of ecological patterns
is not unique to ecology but rather reflects the generic statistical behaviour
of complex systems with many degrees of freedom under very general types of
environmental constraints.

particles' angular momenta along axes with different orientations. It is shown
that for certain observables, the correlation function violates Bell's
inequality. The key to the violation resides in choosing observables impeding
the realization of the counterfactual event that plays a prominent role in the
derivation of the inequalities. This situation can have statistical (detection
related) or dynamical (interaction related) underpinnings, but non-locality
does not play any role.

rate over transmission distance is simulated, which shows that we can obtain a
higher key rate than that of the existing methods, including our own earlier

we demonstrate that such phenomena can also be obtained for non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians for which PT-symmetry is completely broken, i.e. dissipative
systems. We observe that the effect of a tunable passage time can be achieved
by projecting between orthogonal eigenstates by means of a time-evolution
operator associated to a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. It is not essential that
this Hamiltonian is PT-symmetric.

  The Modified BCHSH Inequalities","34 pages, revision of footnote 8, minor changes in the terminology,
  standard Latex",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most physicists uphold that the tests of the Bell inequalities (BI) performed
up to now confirm the predictions of standard quantum mechanics (SQM) and
refute local realism. But some scholars criticize this conviction, defending
local realism in various ways. We present here a new viewpoint based on an
improved version of the extended semantic realism (ESR) model that has been
recently worked out by one of the authors. The ESR model embodies the
mathematical formalism of SQM into a more general framework in which not only
local realism but also objectivity of physical properties holds, and the
probabilities of SQM are reinterpreted as conditional instead of absolute.
Hence the ESR model provides some predictions that are formally identical to
those of SQM but have a different physical interpretation, and further
predictions that differ also formally from those of SQM. In particular, we show
here that the BI introduced by Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (BCHSH
inequalities) must be replaced by modified BCHSH inequalities. These depend on
detection probabilities which may be such that the new inequalities are never
violated by the conditional expectation values predicted by the model. The
condition that no violation occurs implies the existence of upper bounds on
detection probabilities, which makes the ESR model falsifiable. These results
admit an intuitive explanation in terms of unfair sampling but basically differ
from the seemingly similar results obtained by other approaches in which the
efficiency problem is discussed in order to vindicate some kind of local
realism.

relation $dE = T dS + (E/\Delta) d\Delta$ and the energy balance equation $dE =

second law of thermodynamics and, contrary to a recent suggestion based on the
analysis of an Otto-like thermodynamic cycle between two values of $\Delta$ of
a spin-1/2 system, we show that a quantum thermodynamic Carnot cycle, with the
celebrated optimal efficiency $1 - (T_{low}/T_{high})$, is possible in
principle with no need of an infinite number of infinitesimal processes,
provided we cycle smoothly over at least three (in general four) values of
$\Delta$, and we change $\Delta$ not only along the isoentropics, but also
along the isotherms, e.g., by use of the recently suggested maser-laser tandem
technique. We derive general bounds to the net-work to high-temperature-heat
ratio for a Carnot cycle and for the 'inscribed' Otto-like cycle, and represent
these cycles on useful thermodynamic diagrams.
