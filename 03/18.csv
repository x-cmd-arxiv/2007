al 2004 of an extended SZ signal centred on 606 Abell (ACO) clusters with
richness class, R>1. Our results also show SZ decrements around APM and 2MASS
groups at increased significance than previously detected. We then follow the
approach of Lieu et al 2006 and compare the stacked WMAP results for the
decrement in 31 clusters with ROSAT X-ray profiles where Lieu et al found on
average less SZ decrement in the WMAP 1 year data than predicted. We confirm
that in the 3 year data these same clusters again show less SZ decrement than
the X-ray data predicts. We then analysed the WMAP results for the 38 X-ray
clusters with OVRO/BIMA measured SZ decrements as presented by Bonamente et al
2006. We again find that the average decrement is measured to be significantly
less (5.5 sigma) than predicted by the Chandra X-ray data. Thus while we
confirm the original detection of an extended SZ effect by Myers et al 2004,
these X-ray comparisons may now suggest that the central SZ amplitudes detected
by WMAP may actually be lower than expected. One possible explanation is that
there is contamination of the WMAP SZ signal by radio sources in the clusters
but we argue that this appears implausible. We then consider the possibility
that the SZ decrement has been lensed away by foreground galaxy groups. Such a
model predicts that the SZ decrement should depend on cluster redshift. A
reduction in the SZ decrement with redshift is suggested from the ACO cluster
sample and also from comparing the samples of Lieu et al 2006 and Bonamente et
al 06. However, the mass power-spectrum would require a far higher amplitude
than currently expected if lensing was to explain the SZ deficit in high
redshift clusters.

William High, Jason Rhodes, Richard Massey, and Richard Ellis","Pixelation Effects in Weak Lensing","17 pages, 12 figures, submitted for publication to PASP",,"10.1086/523112",,"astro-ph",,"  Weak gravitational lensing is a promising probe of dark matter and dark
energy requiring accurate measurement of the shapes of faint, distant galaxies.
Such measures are hindered by the finite resolution and pixel scale of typical
cameras. On the other hand, as imaging telescopes are practically limited to a
fixed number of pixels and operational life-span, so the survey area increases
with pixel size. We investigate the optimum choice of pixel scale in this
trade-off for a space-based mission, using the full engineering model and
survey strategy of the proposed SuperNova/Acceleration Probe as an example. Our
methodology is to simulate realistic astronomical images of known shear and to
evaluate the surface density of sources where the shear is accurately recovered
using the Rhodes, Refregier, & Groth algorithm in the context of the derived
dark matter power spectrum. In addition to considering single exposures, we
also examine the benefits of sub-pixel dithering. Although some of our results
depend upon the adopted shape measurement method, the relative trends,
particularly those involving the surface density of resolved galaxies, are
robust. Our approach provides a practical counterpart to studies which consider
the effects of pixelation from analytic principles, which necessarily assume an
idealized shape measurement method. We find that the statistical error on the
mass power spectrum is minimized with a pixel scale equal to 75-80% of the FWHM
of the point-spread function, and that dithering is marginally beneficial at
larger pixel scales.

report, for the first time, evidence for the existence of two
chemically-distinct subpopulations of metal-rich (MR) GCs. We find some MR GCs
exhibit significantly larger [Mg/Fe] and [C/Fe] ratios. Different star
formation time-scales are proposed to explain the correlation between Mg and C
abundances. We also find striking CN overabundances over the entire GC
metallicity range. Interestingly, the behavior of C and N in metal-poor (MP)
GCs clearly deviates from the one in MR GCs. In particular, for MR GCs, N
increases dramatically while C essentially saturates. This may be interpreted
as a consequence of the increasing importance of the CNO cycle with increasing
metallicity.

undergoing stochastic driven dynamics on a lattice. The variance of the
displacement of the tagged particle, averaged with respect to an initial
stationary ensemble and stochastic evolution, grows linearly with time at both
small and very large times. We find that at intermediate times, it shows
oscillations with a well defined size-dependent period. These oscillations
arise from sliding density fluctuations (SDF) in the stationary state with
respect to the drift of the tagged particle, the density fluctuations being
transported through the system by kinematic waves. In the general context of
driven diffusive systems, both the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) and the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) fixed points are unstable with respect to the SDF
fixed point, a flow towards which is generated on adding a gradient term to the
EW and the KPZ time-evolution equation. We also study tagged particle
correlations for a fixed initial configuration, drawn from the stationary
ensemble, following earlier work by van Beijeren. We find that the time
dependence of this correlation is determined by the dissipation of the density
fluctuations. We show that an exactly solvable linearized model captures the
essential qualitative features seen in the finite size effects of the tagged
particle correlations in the ASEP. Moreover, this linearized model also
provides an exact coarse-grained description of two other microscopic models.

both $qq$ and $\bar q q$ pairs and the first hadron containing color sextet and
color octet pairs. Theoretical models are not very useful because there is no
accepted model for multiquark systems with color-space correlations. The
constituent quark model is the only phenomenological model with predictive
power that has given experimentally tested universal predictions for both
mesons and baryons. This paper reviews its explanation for why there are no
bound exotics and its guidance to the search for heavy-flavored exotic
tetraquarks and pentaquarks. A possible supersymmetry between mesons and
baryons leading to meson-baryon mass relations not easily obtained otherwise is
discussed.

$S_{n}=(2^n+1)^2 + 2^{n+2}$ instances a class of quadratic fields for which the
class number is large and, therefore, the continued fraction period is
relatively short. Indeed, that period length increases linearly with $n$, that
is: in arithmetic progression. The fields have regulator $O(n^2)$. In the late
nineties, these matters intrigued Irving Kaplansky, and led him to compute
period length of the square root of sequences $a^2x^{2n}+bx^{n}+c$ for integers
$a$, $b$, $c$, and $x$. In brief, Kap found unsurprisingly that, generically,
triples $(a,b,c)$ are `leapers': they yield sequences with period length
increasing at exponential rate. But there are triples yielding sequences with
constant period length, Kap's `sleepers'. Finally, there are triples, as
exemplified by the Shanks's sequence, for which the period lengths increase in
arithmetic progression. Felicitously, Kaplansky called these `creepers'. It
seems that the sleepers and creepers are precisely those for which one is able
to detail the explicit continued fraction expansion for all $n$. Inter alia,
this thesis noticeably extends the known classes of creepers and finds that not
all are `kreepers' (of the shape identified by Kaplansky) and therefore not of
the shape of examples studied by earlier authors looking for families of
quadratic number fields with explicitly computable unit and of relatively large
regulator. The work of this thesis includes the discovery of old and new
families of hyperelliptic curves of increasing genus $g$ and torsion divisor of
order $O(g^2)$. It follows that the apparent trichotomy leaper/sleeper/creeper
coincides with the folk belief that the just-mentioned torsion is maximum

calculated in the Hartree-Fock approximation. The periodicity of Mendeleev's
table is regained for the first time through the evaluation of a QSM.
Evaluation of the information theory based QSI demonstrates, however, that the
patterns of periodicity are lost due to the renormalization of the QSM,
yielding chemically less appealing results for the QSI. A comparison of the
information content of a given atom on top of a group with the information
content of the elements in the subsequent rows reveals another periodicity
pattern. Relativistic effects on the electronic density functions of atoms are
investigated. Their importance is quantified in a QSI study by comparing for

approximations. The smooth decreasing of the relevant QSI along the periodic

``surfing'' mechanism [Edmonds C.A., Lillie A.S. & Cavalli-Sforza L.L. (2004)

(i) the spatial distribution of lineages that reach fixation and, closely
related, (ii) the continual loss of genetic diversity (heterozygosity) at the
wave front, characterizing the approach to fixation. Our simulations show that
an effective population size can be assigned to the wave that controls the
(observable) gradient in heterozygosity left behind the colonization process.
This effective population size is markedly higher in pushed waves than in
pulled waves, and increases only sub-linearly with deme size. To explain these

physics of reaction-diffusion systems, that yields simple predictions for any
