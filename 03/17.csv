  models using neural networks","8 pages, submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13279.x",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a further development of a method for accelerating the calculation
of CMB power spectra, matter power spectra and likelihood functions for use in
cosmological Bayesian inference. The algorithm, called {\sc CosmoNet}, is based
on training a multilayer perceptron neural network. We compute CMB power
spectra (up to $\ell=2000$) and matter transfer functions over a hypercube in
parameter space encompassing the $4\sigma$ confidence region of a selection of
CMB (WMAP + high resolution experiments) and large scale structure surveys (2dF
and SDSS). We work in the framework of a generic 7 parameter non-flat
cosmology. Additionally we use {\sc CosmoNet} to compute the WMAP 3-year, 2dF
and SDSS likelihoods over the same region. We find that the average error in
the power spectra is typically well below cosmic variance for spectra, and
experimental likelihoods calculated to within a fraction of a log unit. We
demonstrate that marginalised posteriors generated with {\sc CosmoNet} spectra
agree to within a few percent of those generated by {\sc CAMB} parallelised
over 4 CPUs, but are obtained 2-3 times faster on just a \emph{single}
processor. Furthermore posteriors generated directly via {\sc CosmoNet}
likelihoods can be obtained in less than 30 minutes on a single processor,
corresponding to a speed up of a factor of $\sim 32$. We also demonstrate the
capabilities of {\sc CosmoNet} by extending the CMB power spectra and matter
transfer function training to a more generic 10 parameter cosmological model,
including tensor modes, a varying equation of state of dark energy and massive
neutrinos. {\sc CosmoNet} and interfaces to both {\sc CosmoMC} and {\sc
Bayesys} are publically available at {\tt

the X-ray source counts in four energy bands soft (0.5-2 keV), hard (2-10 keV),
XID (0.5-4.5 keV) and ultra-hard (4.5-7.5 keV). We have combined this survey
with shallower and deeper surveys. Our source counts results are compatible
with most previous samples in the soft, XID, ultra-hard and hard bands. The
fractions of the XRB resolved in the surveys used in this work are 87%, 85%,
60% and 25% in the soft, hard, XID and ultra-hard bands, respectively.
Extrapolation of our source counts to zero flux are not enough to saturate the
XRB intensity. Only galaxies and/or absorbed AGN may be able contribute the
remaining unresolved XRB intensity. Our results are compatible, within the
errors, with recent revisions of the XRB intensity in the soft and hard bands.
The maximum fractional contribution to the XRB comes from fluxes within about a
decade of the break in the source counts (~1e-14 cgs), reaching ~50% of the
total in the soft and hard bands. Using only AXIS sources, we have studied the
angular correlation in those bands using a novel robust technique. Angular
clustering (widely distributed over the sky and not confined to a few deep
fields) is detected at 99-99.9% significance in the soft and XID bands, with no
detection in the hard and ultra-hard band (probably due to the smaller number
of sources). We cannot confirm the detection of significantly stronger
clustering in the hard-spectrum hard sources. Medium depth surveys such as AXIS
are essential to determine the evolution of the X-ray emission in the Universe

less than unity, values that are orders of magnitude lower than measured in

HdC and RCB we have measured that is cool enough to have detectable CO bands.
The three HdC stars measured have 16O/18O < 1, lower values than any of the RCB
stars. These discoveries are important clues in determining the evolutionary
pathways of HdC and RCB stars, for which two models have been proposed: the
double degenerate (white dwarf (WD) merger), and the final helium-shell flash
(FF). No overproduction of 18O is expected in the FF scenario. We have
quantitatively explored the idea that HdC and RCB stars originate in the
mergers of CO- and He-WDs. The merger process is estimated to take only a few
days, with accretion rates of 150 Msun/ yr producing temperatures at the base
of the accreted envelope of 1.2 - 1.9 x 10^8 K. Analysis of a simplified
one-zone calculation shows that nucleosynthesis in the dynamically accreting
material may provide a suitable environment for a significant production of
18O, leading to very low values of 16O/18O, similar to those observed. We also
find qualitative agreement with observed values of 12C/13C and with the CNO
elemental ratios. H-admixture during the accretion process from the small
H-rich C/O WD envelope may play an important role in producing the observed
abundances. Overall our analysis shows that WD mergers may very well be the
progenitors of O18-rich RCB and HdC stars, and that more detailed simulations

larger halo masses, and the fraction of satellite galaxies decreasing at higher
luminosity. Central L* galaxies reside in halos a few times more massive at z~1
than at z~0. We find little evolution in the relation between mass scales of
host halos for central galaxies and satellite galaxies above the same
luminosity threshold. Combining these HOD results with theoretical predictions
of the typical growth of halos, we establish an evolutionary connection between
the galaxy populations at the two redshifts by linking z~0 central galaxies to
z~1 central galaxies that reside in their progenitor halos, which enables us to
study the evolution of galaxies as a function of halo mass. We find that the
stellar mass growth of galaxies depends on halo mass. On average, the majority
of the stellar mass in central galaxies residing in z~0 low mass halos
(~5x10^11 Msun/h) and only a small fraction of the stellar mass in central
galaxies of high mass halos (~10^13 Msun/h) result from star formation between
z~1 and z~0. In addition, the mass scale of halos where the star formation
efficiency reaches a maximum is found to shift toward lower mass with time.
Future work can combine HOD modeling of the clustering of galaxies at different
redshifts with the assembly history and dynamical evolution of dark matter
halos. This can lead to an understanding of the stellar mass growth due to both
mergers and star formation as a function of host halo mass and provide powerful
tests of galaxy formation theories. (Abridged).

clues to the precise nature of the progenitors. The main current problem is to
understand to what degree GRBs are biased tracers of star formation. If GRBs
are only formed by low-metallicity stars, then their host galaxies will not
give a representative view of where stars are formed in the Universe (at least
not a low redshifts). On the other hand, if there is no dependency on
metallicity then the nature of the host galaxies leads to the perhaps
surprising conclusion that most stars are formed in dwarf galaxies. In order to
resolve this issue and to fully exploit the potential of GRBs as probes of
star-forming galaxies throughout the observable universe it is mandatory that a
complete sample of bursts with redshifts and host galaxy detections is built.

role in a variety of phenomena in the galaxy, from the formation of bright rims
and 'elephant trunks' in nebulae to triggered star formation in molecular
clouds. Numerical treatments of these instabilities have historically been
limited in both dimensionality and input physics, leaving important questions
about their true evolution unanswered. We present the first three-dimensional
radiation hydrodynamical calculations of both R-type and D-type ionization
front instabilities in galactic environments (i.e., solar metallicity gas).
Consistent with linear stability analyses of planar D-type fronts, our models
exhibit many short-wavelength perturbations growing at early times that later
evolve into fewer large-wavelength structures. The simulations demonstrate that
both self-consistent radiative transfer and three-dimensional flow introduce
significant morphological differences to unstable modes when compared to
earlier two-dimensional approximate models. We find that the amplitude of the
instabilities in the nonlinear regime is primarily determined by the efficiency
of cooling within the shocked neutral shell. Strong radiative cooling leads to
long, extended structures with pronounced clumping while weaker cooling leads
to saturated modes that devolve into turbulent flows. These results suggest
that expanding H II regions may either promote or provide turbulent support
against the formation of later generations of stars, with potential
consequences for star formation rates in the galaxy today.

is kept constantly around 3 L_E. On the other hand, the mass-outflow rate
increases in proportion to the accretion rate and it amounts to about a few
percent of theinput mass-flow rate.

supernovae by the detection of high velocity (HV) absorption features in Halpha
and He I 10830 A lines during the photospheric stage. To demonstrate the
method, we compute the ionization and excitation of H and He in supernova
ejecta taking into account time-dependent effects and X-ray irradiation. We
find that the interaction with a typical red supergiant wind should result in
the enhanced excitation of the outer layers of unshocked ejecta and the
emergence of corresponding HV absorption, i.e. a depression in the blue
absorption wing of Halpha and a pronounced absorption of He I 10830 A at a
radial velocity of about -10,000 km/s. We identify HV absorption in Halpha and
He I 10830 A lines of SN 1999em and in Halpha of SN 2004dj as being due to this
effect. The derived mass loss rate is close to 10^{-6} Msun/yr for both
supernovae, assuming a wind velocity 10 km/s. We argue that, in addition to the
HV absorption formed in the unshocked ejecta, spectra of SN 2004dj and SN
1999em show a HV notch feature that is formed in the cool dense shell (CDS)
modified by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The CDS results from both shock
breakout and radiative cooling of gas that has passed through the reverse shock
wave. The notch becomes dominant in the HV absorption during the late
photospheric phase, ~60 d. The wind density deduced from the velocity of the
CDS is consistent with the wind density found from the HV absorption produced
by unshocked ejecta.

theory backgrounds involving D0-branes, as a result of the recoil velocity
field, expressing the interaction of neutrino string matter with point-like
branes. However, the similarity with TeVeS models is restricted only to the
bi-metric properties of space time, namely the difference of the background
metric from the one felt by (some) matter fields interacting, in a
topologically non-trivial manner, with the D0-brane defects. In our approach,
neutrinos appear as dark matter candidates that could be ``captured'' by the D0
branes, as a result of stringy properties, and thus couple with the
recoil-vector fields. Moreover, we argue in support of a possibly preferential
role of neutrinos in inducing novel non-perturbative contributions to
``vacuum'' (dark) energy, in addition to their ordinary dark matter
contribution. In fact, the role of neutrinos as providing substantial
contributions to dark matter and dark energy components of the Universe,
suggested by our approach, appears also to be necessitated by the need to
reproduce the peaks in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation spectrum, as
claimed recently in the literature. Thus, our framework may be viewed as
providing a microscopic explanation of such phenomenological conclusions
concerning TeVeS-like, Lorentz-violating models.

an overshoot included in a narrow band and with minimum rise and settling
times. In the proposed method the rise and settling times are both replaced
with the integral of the squared error and the constraint, which requires a
controller output less than a preset value, is added. The transient behaviour
is strictly evaluated by means of the analytical solutions of the relative
differential difference equations, obtained by the method of steps for the
first time. Moreover the proposed tuning method is compared with other three
methods, selected among the most used, which are the Ziegler-Nichols
time-domain and frequency-domain and the Zhuang and Atherton ISTE ones. Finally
tuning charts, having as coordinates the two PI controller parameters and

principles for continuous and discrete dynamical systems where elements of a
vector space are used to control dynamics on the cotangent bundle of a Lie
group \emph{via} a velocity map. This paper proves a reduction theorem which
states that the canonical variables on the Lie group can be eliminated, if and
only if the velocity map is a Lie algebra action, thereby producing the
Euler-Poincar\'e (EP) equation for the vector space variables. In this case,
the map from the canonical variables on the Lie group to the vector space is
the standard momentum map defined using the diamond operator. We apply the
Clebsch method in examples of the rotating rigid body and the incompressible
Euler equations. Along the way, we explain how singular solutions of the EP
equation for the diffeomorphism group (EPDiff) arise as momentum maps in the
Clebsch approach. In the case of finite dimensional Lie groups, the Clebsch
variational principle is discretised to produce a variational integrator for
the dynamical system. We obtain a discrete map from which the variables on the
cotangent bundle of a Lie group may be eliminated to produce a discrete EP
equation for elements of the vector space. We give an integrator for the
rotating rigid body as an example. We also briefly discuss how to discretise
infinite-dimensional Clebsch systems, so as to produce conservative numerical
methods for fluid dynamics.

5-manifold corresponds uniquely to a toric 3-Sasaki 7-manifold. This produces
examples of quasi-regular Sasaki-Einstein structures on every #k(S^2 xS^3), for
k odd. Toric geometry is used to construct examples of positive Ricci curvature
toric Sasaki structures on non-spin 5-manifolds. Then the join construction is
used to construct infinitely many quasi-regular toric Sasaki-Einstein manifolds
with arbitrarily high second Betti number in every odd dimesion >3.

distributions. They were discovered explicitly by Paul L\'{e}vy in 1925
\cite{lk}. They possess many interesting properties, most importantly they are
by definiton invariant under addition, up to a scale. Noteworthly they have
power-law type of decay and therefore they are an excellent model for modelling
many natural phenomena, such as earthquakes, financial returns, and a multitude
of social phenomena such as size distributions of cities and firms
\cite{scaling}. The major problem concerning them is that they have an infinite
variance \cite{GK} and therefore their practical applicability is somewhat
limited. Also they generally do not possess a density expressible in an
analytic form. This study proposes a dispersion measure for them, drawing ideas
from Fisher information, differential geometry and most importantly, the
uncertainty principle for Fourier transform pairs \cite{Weyl}. The study begins
with a brief discussion on characteristic functions and their relation to
Fourier transforms and their properties, proceeds to a brief presentation of
stable distributions and accumulates in defining a concept of
\textit{characteristic curvature}, which is proposed as a suitable measure of
dispersion for class of stable distributions. Characteristic curvature
satisfies the familiar scaling property for stable processes, reduces to that
of standard deviation in the Gaussian case and is explicitly related to the
Euler Gamma function, the Hurst exponent H and the fractal dimension 2-H.

coarser level. These projections, which we call Markov projections, then
constitute the hierarchical dynamics of the system. The algorithm operates on

method that is specifically designed to detect genetic association involving
multiple disease-susceptibility loci, possibly on different chromosomes. Our

detecting multi-locus genetic association when compared to a standard single
