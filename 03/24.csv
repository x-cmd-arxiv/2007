the six optically thick dust disks observed as part of the FEPS Spitzer Legacy
program. In addition, we detect a H I(7-6) emission line at 12.37 micron from
the source RXJ1852.3-3700. Detections of [Ne II] lines are favored by low
mid-infrared excess emission. Both stellar X-rays and extreme UV (EUV) photons
can sufficiently ionize the disk surface to reproduce the observed line fluxes,
suggesting that emission from Ne+ originates in the hot disk atmosphere. On the
other hand, the H I(7-6) line is not associated with the gas in the disk
surface and magnetospheric accretion flows can account only for at most ~30% of
the observed flux. We conclude that accretion shock regions and/or the stellar
corona could contribute to most of the H I(7-6)emission. Finally, we discuss
the observations necessary to identify whether stellar X-rays or EUV photons
are the dominant ionization mechanism for Ne atoms. Because the observed [Ne
II] emission probes very small amounts of gas in the disk surface (~10^{-6}
Jupiter masses) we suggest using this gas line to determine the presence or
absence of gas in more evolved circumstellar disks.

  Clump Destruction in Adiabatic Colliding Winds","4 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJL",,"10.1086/518365",,"astro-ph",,"  Clumping in hot star winds can significantly affect estimates of mass-loss
rates, the inferred evolution of the star and the environmental impact of the
wind. A hydrodynamical simulation of a colliding winds binary (CWB) with clumpy
winds reveals that the clumps are rapidly destroyed after passing through the
confining shocks of the wind-wind collision region (WCR) for reasonable
parameters of the clumps if the flow in the WCR is adiabatic. Despite large
density and temperature fluctuations in the post-shock gas, the overall effect
of the interaction is to smooth the existing structure in the winds. Averaged
over the entire interaction region, the resulting X-ray emission is very
similar to that from the collision of smooth winds. The insensitivity of the
X-ray emission to clumping suggests it is an excellent diagnostic of the
stellar mass-loss rates in wide CWBs, and may prove to be a useful addition to
existing techniques for deriving mass-loss rates, many of which are extremely
sensitive to clumping. Clumpy winds also have implications for a variety of
phenomena at the WCR: particle acceleration may occur throughout the WCR due to
supersonic MHD turbulence, re-acceleration at multiple shocks, and
re-connection; a statistical description of the properties of the WCR may be
required for studies of non-equilibrium ionization and the rate of electron
heating; and the physical mixing of the two winds will be enhanced, as seems
necessary to trigger dust formation.

H$\alpha$ emission lines indicates that E+A galaxies do not have any on-going
star formation. Therefore, E+A galaxies are interpreted as a post-starburst
galaxy.
  Morphologically, E+A galaxies appear as early-type galaxies, implying E+A
galaxies may be one of the progenitors of present-day elliptical galaxies.
  However, there remained other possibilities such as the dusty starburst
scenario, where E+A galaxies have on-going star formation, but optical emission
lines are invisible due to the heavy obscuration by dust. Therefore, an
additional evidence of the post-starburst phenomena has been eagerly awaited.
  Using one of the largest samples of 451 E+A galaxies carefully selected from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4, here we show the abundance
diagnosis of E+A galaxies using Mg and Fe lines. Our findings are as follows
:(i) E+A galaxies has enhanced $\alpha$-element abundance ratio compared to the
star-forming galaxies with similar Balmer absorption strength. Since the
truncation of strong starburst is required to enhance the alpha element ratio,
this is an additional evidence that E+A galaxies are in the post-starburst
phase; (ii) the metallicity and $\alpha$-element abundance of E+A galaxies are
consistent with those of elliptical galaxies, suggesting that E+A galaxies
could be one of the progenitors of present-day elliptical galaxies in terms of

have important implications for current UVES constraints on cosmological
variations in the fine-structure constant. The induced systematic errors are
most severe for Mg/FeII quasar absorbers in the redshift range 1.2 < z < 2.3,
with individual absorbers studied by recent authors containing systematic
errors up to 4 times larger than quoted statistical errors.

investigated. In the mean-field approximation without Coulomb interaction, the
system displays a phase transition of first order. In the presence of the
Coulomb repulsion the global phase separation becomes unfavorable and the
system shows a mesoscopic phase separation, where the size of the charged
regions is determined by the competition between the ordering energy and the
Coulomb energy.
  The phase diagram of the system as a function of particle density and
temperature is obtained by systematic Monte Carlo simulations. With decreasing
temperature a crossover from a disordered state to a state composed from
mesoscopic charged clusters is observed. In the phase separated state charged
clusters with even number of particles are more stable than those with odd
number of particles in a large range of particle densities. With increasing
particle density at low temperatures a series of crossovers between states with
different cluster sizes is observed. Above half filling in addition to the low
temperature clustering another higher temperature scale, which corresponds to
orbital ordering of particles, appears.
  We suggest that the diverse functional behaviour - including
superconductivity - observed in transition metal oxides can be thought to arise

implementation of a qubit for quantum information processing. We study the
central spin problem of the effect of the hyperfine interaction between such an
electron and a large number of nuclear moments. Using a spin coherent path
integral, we show that in this limit the electron spin evolution is well
described by classical dynamics of both the nuclear and electron spins. We then
introduce approximate yet systematic methods to analyze aspects of the
classical dynamics, and discuss the importance of the exact integrability of
the central spin Hamiltonian. This is compared with numerical simulation.
Finally, we obtain the asymptotic long time decay of the electron spin
polarization. We show that this is insensitive to integrability, and determined
instead by the transfer of angular momentum to very weakly coupled spins far
from the center of the quantum dot. The specific form of the decay is shown to
depend sensitively on the form of the electronic wavefunction.

tree-code is used to sequentially bin strings and a Stack Algorithm with a

for lossless source coding with side information. The scheme is shown to give
exponentially decaying probability of error with delay, with exponent equal to
Gallager's random coding exponent for sources with side information. The mean
of the random variable of computation for the stack decoder is bounded, and
conditions on the bias are given to guarantee a finite $\rho^{th}$ moment for
$0 \leq \rho \leq 1$.
  Further, the problem is also studied in the case where there is a discrete
memoryless channel between encoder and decoder. The same scheme is slightly
modified to give a joint-source channel encoder and Stack Algorithm-based
sequential decoder using side information. Again, by a suitable choice of bias,
the probability of error decays exponentially with delay and the random

described in terms of particles. I argue that it is important to take seriously
the possibility that the unparticle stuff described by such a theory might
actually exist in our world. I suggest a scenario in which some details of the
production of unparticle stuff can be calculated. I find that in the
appropriate low energy limit, unparticle stuff with scale dimension
$d_{\mathcal{U}}$ looks like a non-integral number $d_{\mathcal{U}}$ of
invisible particles. Thus dramatic evidence for a nontrivial scale invariant
sector could show up experimentally in missing energy distributions.

With a fast detector simulation we show that backgrounds involving two
like-sign charged leptons are not negligible and, moreover, they cannot be
eliminated with simple sequential kinematical cuts. Using a likelihood analysis
it is shown that, for heavy neutrinos coupling only to the muon, LHC has 5
sigma sensitivity for masses up to 200 GeV in the final state mu+- mu+- jj.
This reduction in sensitivity, compared to previous parton-level estimates, is
driven by the ~ 10^2-10^3 times larger background. Limits are also provided for
e+- e+- jj and e+- mu+- jj final states, as well as for Tevatron. For heavy
Dirac neutrinos the prospects are worse because backgrounds involving two
opposite charge leptons are much larger. For this case, we study the
observability of the lepton flavour violating signal e+- mu-+ jj. As a
by-product of our analysis, heavy neutrino production has been implemented
within the ALPGEN framework.

reduced to the double $\Delta$ exchange amplitude with the

  Therefore we have a screening of the internal double $\Delta$ exchange

Modular structure is ubiquitous in real-world complex networks, and its
detection is important because it gives insights in the structure-functionality
relationship. The standard approach is based on the optimization of a quality
function, modularity, which is a relative quality measure for a partition of a
network into modules. Recently some authors [1,2] have pointed out that the
optimization of modularity has a fundamental drawback: the existence of a
resolution limit beyond which no modular structure can be detected even though
these modules might have own entity. The reason is that several topological
descriptions of the network coexist at different scales, which is, in general,
a fingerprint of complex systems. Here we propose a method that allows for
multiple resolution screening of the modular structure. The method has been
validated using synthetic networks, discovering the predefined structures at
all scales. Its application to two real social networks allows to find the
exact splits reported in the literature, as well as the substructure beyond the
actual split.

electron-electron potentials: a soft-core Coulombic potential and a Yukawa
potential. We also implement the strong-field approximation (SFA), which is
commonly made in quantum-mechanical $S$-matrix calculations, in our classical
simulations and study its consequences. We find that, regardless of the form of
the e-e potential, the SFA modifies the momentum distributions and recollision
dynamics significantly, but more so for the long-range than for the short-range
e-e interaction. Surprisingly, our classical results, especially those obtained
with the Yukawa potential under the SFA, agree well with the results from the
$S$-matrix calculations with a contact e-e interaction. This implies that the
recollision dynamics initiated by a quantum tunneling process and a purely
classical process do not deviate much from each other. Furthermore, our
classical predictions of travel times are consistent with the results from the
simple-man model, and the most probable thermalization time is found to be
within 0.15 and 0.25 laser periods.

demonstrate a small world structure, and a scale-free property for both street
length and connectivity degree. More specifically, for any street network,
about 80% of its streets have length or degrees less than its average value,
while 20% of streets have length or degrees greater than the average. Out of
the 20%, there are less than 1% of streets which can form a backbone of the

divergence would be much older than the last glacial cycles. In cercopithecine
Primates, speciation would have been predominantly allopatric and driven by
Miocene and Pliocene vicariance events. Altogether, results give support to the
refuge hypothesis, without excluding the riverine barrier nor the

equation using the quantum regression theorem. Initially the atom is in its
upper state and the cavity mode empty of photons. Following Glauber, the
spectrum is defined via the response of a detector atom. Spectra are calculated
for the detector located inside the cavity (case A), outside the cavity end
mirror (Case B-end emission), or placed for emission out the side of the cavity
(Case C). The spectra for case A and case B are found to be essentially the
same. In all the cases the predicted lineshapes are free of instrumental
effects and only due to cavity decay. Spectra are presented for intermediate
and strong coupling regime situations (where both atomic transitions are
resonant with the cavity frequency), for cases of non-zero cavity detuning, and
for cases where the two atomic transition frequencies differ. The spectral
features for Cases B(A) and C are qualitatively similar, with six spectral
peaks for resonance cases and eight for detuned cases. These general features
of the spectra can be understood via the dressed atom model. However, Case B
and C spectra differ in detail, with the latter exhibiting a deep spectral hole
at the cavity frequency due to quantum interference effects.
