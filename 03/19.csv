the K4V spectrum of the donor star with the flux increasing with wavelength
above 12.5 microns. Superposed on the energy distribution are several hydrogen
emission lines, identified as Pf alpha and Hu alpha, beta, gamma. The infrared
spectrum above 12.5 microns can be interpreted as synchrotron emission from
electrons accelerated to a power-law distribution dN=E^{-2.4}dE in expanding
clouds with an initial evolution timescale in seconds. However, too many
components must then be superposed to explain satisfactorily both the
mid-infrared continuum and the observed radio variability. Thermal emission
from cold circumbinary material can contribute, but it requires a disk
temperature profile intermediate between that produced by local viscous
dissipation in the disk and that characteristic of a passively irradiated disk.
Future high-time resolution observations spanning the optical to radio regime

solutions with simple extensions in the extra 2 dimensions. The disks are
interpreted in terms of two counter-rotating streams of particles on free
circular orbits. Two extra parameters -- the constants of motion resulting from
projections of the particle-velocities' extra components -- are constrained by
the requirement that the orbits within the disk be stable. The requirement is
met just in cases when the radial profile of the disk orbital speed fits the
rotation curves of many spiral galaxies. It thus turns out that the effective
modification of the gravity law by extra dimensions could explain the observed
flatness of these curves equally well as the usually given dark-matter

extra dimensions also leads to better fits of the gravitational-lensing data

solve the corresponding equations numerically for different dark energy models.
We find that models whose equation of state is initially stiffer than
radiation, as for instance some tracking models, are unstable against velocity
perturbations, thus spoiling the late-time predictions for the energy
densities. In the case of scaling models, the contributions to the quadrupole
can be non-negligible for a wide range of initial conditions. We also consider

the shape of the primordial power spectra of the cosmological perturbations. In
the context of inflationary cosmology, this implies that the CMB data are now
sensitive to the form of the inflaton potential. Most of the current approaches
devoted to the derivation of the inflationary primordial power spectra, or to
the inflaton potential reconstruction problem, rely on approximate analytical
treatments that may break down for exotic models. In this article, we
numerically solve the inflationary evolution of both the background and all the
perturbed quantities to extract the primordial power spectra exactly. Such a
method solely relies on General Relativity and linear perturbation theory. More
than providing a tool to test analytical approximations, one may consider,
without complications, the treatment of non-standard inflationary models as
those involving several fields, eventually non-minimally coupled to gravity.
  The usefulness of the exact numerical approach to deal with CMB data is
illustrated by analysing the WMAP third year data in the context of single
field models. For this purpose, we introduce a new inflationary related
parameter encoding the basic properties of the reheating era. This reheating
parameter has significant observable effects and provides a self-consistency
test of inflationary models. As a working example, the marginalised probability
distributions of the reheating and potential parameters associated with the

cluster population (90% confidence level), and no significant statistical
excess in the sample as a whole beyond 2 optical radii, even though one galaxy
(M 83) individually shows such an excess. Although the excess is typically most
pronounced for blue (FUV -NUV < 1, NUV < 25) sources, there is also an excess
of sources with redder colors. Although from galaxy to galaxy the number of

path that leads to its formation is fairly well understood, it remains unclear
which objects, SN II and/or SN Ia, that contribute the majority of Mn to the
interstellar medium. It also remains unclear to which extent the supernovae Mn
yields depend on the metallicity of the progenitor star or not. AIMS: By using
a well studied and well defined sample of 95 dwarf stars we aim at further
constraining the formation site(s) of Mn. METHODS: We derive Mn abundances
through spectral synthesis of four Mn I lines at 539.4, 549.2, 601.3, and 601.6
nm. Stellar parameters and data for oxygen are taken from Bensby et al. (2003,
2004, 2005). RESULTS: When comparing our Mn abundances with O abundances for
the same stars we find that the abundance trends in the stars with kinematics
of the thick disk can be explained by metallicity dependent yields from SN II.
We go on and combine our data for dwarf stars in the disks with data for dwarf
and giant stars in the metal-poor thick disk and halo from the literature. We
find that dwarf and giant stars show the same trends, which indicates that
neither non-LTE nor evolutionary effects are a major concern for Mn.
Furthermore, the [Mn/O] vs [O/H] trend in the halo is flat. CONCLUSIONS: We
conclude that the simplest interpretation of our data is that Mn is most likely
produced in SN II and that the Mn yields for such SNae must be metallicity
dependent. Contribution from SN Ia in the metal-rich thin disk can not,
however, be excluded.

a luminosity well in excess of $10^{47}$ erg/s, ROXA J081009.9+384757.0 is
therefore one of the most luminous blazars known. We consider various
possibilities for the nature of the electromagnetic emission from this source.
In particular, we show that the SED is consistent with that of a blazar with
synchrotron power peaking in the hard X-ray band. If this is indeed the case,
the combination of high-luminosity and synchrotron peak in the hard-X-ray band
contradicts the claimed anti-correlation between luminosity and position of the
synchrotron peak usually referred to as the ""blazar sequence"". An alternative
possibility is that the X-rays are not due to synchrotron emission, in this
case the very peculiar SED of ROXA J081009.9+384757.0 would make it the first
example of a new class of radio loud AGN.

star-forming, relatively early-type, nearby spiral galaxies. Such galaxies are
likely to host nuclear super-massive black holes. METHODS: For 9 sources from
the Ho et al. optical sample, we isolated 10 individual Chandra X-ray sources
closest to the optical position and calculated X-ray luminosities, Lx, X-ray
colours, and, using Halpha luminosities, star formation rates. For 4 sources
with sufficient counts, we extracted X-ray spectra and fitted standard spectral
models. We assessed the significance of adding an Fe K alpha emission Gaussian
component to a fit by means of a calibration of the standard F-test. For the
rest of the sources, we estimated values for the intrinsic hydrogen column
density, NHint, and the power-law photon index, Gamma, which can reproduce the
observed X-ray colours. RESULTS: For the nuclear sources in NGC 2782 and NGC
3310, a Fe K alpha emission-line component is included with high significance,
whilst the power-law is flat (Gamma~0 and 1.3). Both sources have high
star-formation rates, with the rate for NGC 2782 being the highest in our
sample. CONCLUSIONS: Our detection of Fe K alpha emission coming from a
central, isolated source points towards a hidden AGN in 2 out of 9 relatively
early-type, star-forming spirals. The presence of an AGN is thus likely in
massive, disturbed starbursts, although the X-ray contribution is small: For
the central source, the bolometric luminosity is a fraction of a few x 10^-5 of
the Eddington luminosity. The X-ray flux of the central source is between 10
and 20% of the total galactic flux in the 0.2-10 keV band.

current density in the range of 10^9 - 10^10 A/m^2 is sufficient for
domain-wall displacement when the depinning field varies between 50 to 500 Oe.
These results indicate relatively high efficiency of the current in displacing
domain walls which we believe is related to the narrow width ~3 nm of domain
walls in this compound.

spherical star is described by a unique line element, which is the
Schwarzschild metric. As a consequence, the ""gravitational"" mass and the
""inertial"" mass of a star are equal to each other. However, theories that
envision our world as embedded in a larger universe, with more than four
dimensions, permit a number of possible non-Schwarzschild 4D exteriors, which
typically lead to {\it different} masses, violating the weak equivalence
principle of ordinary general relativity. Therefore, the question arises of
whether the violation of this principle, i.e., the equality of gravitational
and inertial mass, is a necessary consequence of the existence of extra
dimensions. In this paper, in the context of Kaluza-Klein gravity in 5D, we
show that the answer to this question is negative. We find a one-parameter
family of asymptotically flat non-Schwarzschild static exteriors for which the
inertial and gravitational masses are equal to each other, and equal to the
Deser-Soldate mass. This family is consistent with the Newtonian weak-field
limit as well as with the general-relativistic Schwarzschild limit. Thus, we
conclude that the existence of an extra dimension, and the corresponding
non-Schwarzschild exterior, does not necessarily require different masses.
However, to an observer in 4D, it does affect the motion of test particles in
4D, which is a consequence of the departure from the usual $(4D)$ law of
geodesic motion.

method, based in the fact that any braneworld stellar solution must have the

degrees of freedom on the brane. Hence the non locality and non closure of the

interpreted as a necessary condition to regain general relativity, and a
particular solution for it is used to find an exact and physically acceptable
analytical internal solution to no-uniform stellar distributions on the brane.
It is shown that such an exact solution is possible due to the fact that bulk

of the separation of multi-Regge and quasi-multi-Regge kinematics. The
connection with the energy scale of the evolution is investigated in detail.
The result is discussed for two situations: scattering of highly virtual
photons, which requires a symmetric energy scale to separate the impact factors
from the gluon Green's function, and hadron-hadron collisions, where a
non-symmetric scale choice is needed. For the second case we are able to define

(MFV) to the MSSM. We explicitly show how, by this definition, the new sources
of flavour and CP violation present in the MSSM become functions of the SM
Yukawa couplings, and cannot be simply set to zero, as is common wisdom in
phenomenological MSSM studies that assume MFV.
  We apply our approach to the MSSM Delta B = 2 Hamiltonian at low tan(beta).
The limit of MFV amounts to a striking increase in the predictivity of the
model. In particular, SUSY corrections to meson-antimeson mass differences
Delta M(d,s) are always found to be positive with respect to the SM prediction.
This feature is due to an interesting interplay between chargino and gluino box
diagrams (the dominant contributions) in the different mass regimes one can
consider.
  Finally, we point out that, due to the presence of gluinos, the MFV MSSM does
not belong -- even at low tan(beta) -- to the class of models with the
so-called `constrained' MFV (CMFV), in which only the SM operator (V-A)x(V-A)
contributes to Delta M(d,s). Consequently, for the MSSM and in the general case
of MFV, one should not use the Universal Unitarity Triangle (UUT), relevant for
CMFV models, but a MFV-UT constructed from beta(psi KS) and |V(ub)| or gamma
from tree level decays. In particular, with the measured value of beta(psi KS),
MFV implies a testable correlation between |V(ub)| and gamma. With the present
high value of |V(ub)|, MFV favours gamma > 80 degrees.

dark energy, we examine the content of the contracting universe (cu) and its
entropy $S_{cu}$. We find that beyond dark energy the universe contains on
average zero or at most a single photon which if present immediately after
turnaround has infinitesimally energy which subsequently blue shifts to produce
$e^+e^-$ pairs. These statements are independent of the equation of state
$\omega = p/\rho$ of dark energy provided $\omega < -1$. Thus $S_{cu} = 0$ and
if observations confirm $\omega < -1$ the entropy problem is solved. We discuss
the absence of a theoretical lower bound on $\phi = |\omega + 1|$, then
describe an anthropic fine tuning argument that renders unlikely extremely
small $\phi$. The present bound $\phi \lesssim 0.1$ already implies a time

some estimates of Alexopoulos and of Varopoulos for convolution powers of

in case G is amenable, we discover that the properties of analyticity or

randomness enters the system at physical boundary of small scale obstacles as
well as at the interior of the physical medium. This system is modeled by a
stochastic partial differential equation defined on a domain perforated with
small holes (obstacles or heterogeneities), together with random dynamical
boundary conditions on the boundaries of these small holes.
  A homogenized macroscopic model for this microscopic heterogeneous stochastic
system is derived. This homogenized effective model is a new stochastic partial
differential equation defined on a unified domain without small holes, with
static boundary condition only. In fact, the random dynamical boundary
conditions are homogenized out, but the impact of random forces on the small
holes' boundaries is quantified as an extra stochastic term in the homogenized
stochastic partial differential equation. Moreover, the validity of the
homogenized model is justified by showing that the solutions of the microscopic
model converge to those of the effective macroscopic model in probability
distribution, as the size of small holes diminishes to zero.

  Sampled Diffusions: the Exponent Expansion","28 pages, 7 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph cond-mat.other math.ST physics.comp-ph q-fin.ST stat.TH",,"  In this paper we discuss a closed-form approximation of the likelihood
functions of an arbitrary diffusion process. The approximation is based on an
exponential ansatz of the transition probability for a finite time step $\Delta
t$, and a series expansion of the deviation of its logarithm from that of a
Gaussian distribution. Through this procedure, dubbed {\em exponent expansion},
the transition probability is obtained as a power series in $\Delta t$. This
becomes asymptotically exact if an increasing number of terms is included, and
provides remarkably accurate results even when truncated to the first few (say
3) terms. The coefficients of such expansion can be determined
straightforwardly through a recursion, and involve simple one-dimensional
integrals.
  We present several examples of financial interest, and we compare our results
with the state-of-the-art approximation of discretely sampled diffusions
[A\""it-Sahalia, {\it Journal of Finance} {\bf 54}, 1361 (1999)]. We find that
the exponent expansion provides a similar accuracy in most of the cases, but a
better behavior in the low-volatility regime. Furthermore the implementation of
the present approach turns out to be simpler.
  Within the functional integration framework the exponent expansion allows one
to obtain remarkably good approximations of the pricing kernels of financial
derivatives. This is illustrated with the application to simple path-dependent
interest rate derivatives. Finally we discuss how these results can also be
used to increase the efficiency of numerical (both deterministic and
stochastic) approaches to derivative pricing.

is dependent on the local community. We determine species suitability to the
biotic conditions of their local environment through a time and space varying
fitness measure. Dispersal of individuals to nearby communities occurs whenever
their fitness falls below a predefined tolerance threshold. The spatiotemporal
dynamics of the model is described in terms of this threshold. We compare this
dynamics with the one obtained through density-independent dispersal and find
marked differences. In the community-driven scenario, the spatial correlations
in the population density do not vary in a linear fashion as we increase the
tolerance threshold. Instead we find the system to cross different dynamical
regimes as the threshold is raised. Spatial patterns evolve from disordered, to
scale-free complex patterns, to finally becoming well-organized domains. This
model therefore predicts that natural populations, the dispersal strategies of
which are likely to be influenced by their local environment, might be subject
to complex spatiotemporal dynamics.

Zeno paradox claims that a continuously observed system, prepared in a state
which is not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian operator, never decays. To
recover the classical behavior of unstable systems we consider a two-level
system interacting with a Bose field, respectively prepared in the excited
state and in the Poincare invariant vacuum state. Using time-dependent
perturbation theory, we evaluate for a finite time interval the probability of
spontaneous decay of the two-level system. Using the standard argument to
obtain the quantum Zeno paradox, we consider N measurements where N goes to
infinity and we obtain that the non-decay probability law is a pure
exponential, therefore recovering the classical behavior.

consisting of a periodic potential and a time-periodic driving field. The
system dynamics is governed by a Floquet evolution matrix bearing the symmetry
of the corresponding Hamiltonian. The dc-current appears due to the
desymmetrization of Floquet eigenstates, which become transporting when all the
relevant symmetries are violated. Those eigenstates which mostly contribute to
a directed transport reside in phase space regions corresponding to classical
resonances. Quantum dynamics leads to the dependence of the average velocity on
the initial phase of the ac-field. A resonant enhancement (or suppression) of
the dc-current, due to avoided crossings between different Floquet states takes
place upon tuning some control parameters. Our studies are predominantly aimed
at experimental realizations of ac-driven quantum ratchets with cold atoms.

delayed by a tunable time of up to 40 ns with little broadening or distortion.
During the propagation, a probe pulse is amplified and generates a conjugate
pulse which is faster and separates from the probe pulse before getting locked
to it at a fixed delay. The precise timing of this process allows us to
determine the key coefficients of the susceptibility tensor. The presence of
gain in this system makes this system very interesting in the context of
all-optical information processing.
