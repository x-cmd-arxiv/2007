that in certain alignments the emission of gravitational radiation can produce
a kick of several thousand kilometers per second. This exceeds galactic escape
speeds, hence unless there a mechanism to prevent this, one would expect many
galaxies that had merged to be without a central black hole. Here we show that
in most galactic mergers, torques from accreting gas suffice to align the orbit
and spins of both black holes with the large-scale gas flow. Such a
configuration has a maximum kick speed <200 km/s, safely below galactic escape
speeds. We predict, however, that in mergers of galaxies without much gas, the
remnant will be kicked out several percent of the time. We also discuss other
predictions of our scenario, including implications for jet alignment angles
and X-type radio sources.

on fully compressible ideal hydrodynamical modelling in a Cartesian grid. The
initial model is characterised by solar density and pressure stratifications
taken from the standard Model S and is adjusted in order to suppress convective
instability. Acoustic waves are excited by a non-harmonic source located below
the depth corresponding to the visible surface of the Sun. Numerical
experiments with coherent horizontal flows of linear and Gaussian dependences
of flow speed on depth are carried out. These flow fields may mimic horizontal
motions of plasma surrounding a sunspot, differential rotation or meridional
circulation. An inversion of the velocity profiles from the simulated travel
time differences is carried out. The inversion is based on the ray
approximation. The results of inversion are then compared with the original
velocity profiles. The influence of steady flow on the propagation of sound
waves through the solar interior is analysed. Further, we propose a method of
obtaining the travel-time differences for the waves propagating in
sub-photospheric solar regions with horizontal flows. The method employs
directly the difference between travel-time diagrams of waves propagating with
and against the background flow. The analysis shows that the flow speed
profiles obtained from inversion based on the ray approximation differ from the
original ones. The difference between them is caused by the fact that the wave
packets propagate along the ray bundle, which has a finite extent, and thus
reach deeper regions of the sub-photosphere in comparison with ray theory.

in mergers with nearby massive galaxies, and the hot gas in the systems is
extended along lines joining the interacting galaxies. Both sources show strong
evidence for interactions between the radio lobes and the asymmetrical hot gas.
We argue that the structure in the hot gas is independent of the existence of
the radio lobes in these systems, and argue that hot gas shaped by an ongoing
massive galaxy merger may play an important role in the dynamics of radio lobes
in other objects. For 3C442A, our observations show that gas is being driven
out of both members of the host interacting galaxy pair, and the implied
constraints on galaxy velocities are consistent with mildly supersonic motions
with respect to the group-scale hot gas. The previously known filamentary radio
structure in the center of 3C442A may be a result of the interaction between
hot gas expelled from these galaxies and pre-existing radio-emitting plasma. In
3C285, where there is no ongoing galaxy merger, the powerful radio source is
probably having a significant effect on the energetics of the host group.

high eccentricities of the planetary orbits calls into question the utility of
the traditional Laplace-Lagrange (LL) secular theory in analyses of the motion.
We analytically generalize this theory to fourth-order in the eccentricities,
compare the result with the second-order theory and octupole-level theory, and
apply these theories to the likely secularly-dominated HD 12661, HD 168443, HD
38529 and Ups And multi-planet systems. The fourth-order scheme yields a
multiply-branched criterion for maintaining apsidal libration, and implies that
the apsidal rate of a small body is a function of its initial eccentricity,
dependencies which are absent from the traditional theory. Numerical results
indicate that the primary difference the second and fourth-order theories
reveal is an alteration in secular periodicities, and to a smaller extent
amplitudes of the planetary eccentricity variation. Comparison with numerical
integrations indicates that the improvement afforded by the fourth-order theory
over the second-order theory sometimes dwarfs the improvement needed to
reproduce the actual dynamical evolution. We conclude that LL secular theory,
to any order, generally represents a poor barometer for predicting secular

extracting an accurate long-term dynamical description of systems with small

aberrations in the MCC. To alleviate this problem, we suggest the introduction
of a holographic diffuser at the focal plane of the MCC to convert the PSF

better correlated images. We report laboratory measurements with a dual channel

near-infrared spectra, obtained with the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope and
the 3.58m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo at the ""Roque de los Muchachos""

the visible and dominated by very deep water ice absorption bands in the near
infrared (D= 70.3 +/- 2.1 % and 82.8 +/- 4.9 % at 1.5 \mu and 2.0 \mu
respectively). It is very similar to the spectrum of the group of TNOs already
mentioned. All of them present much deeper water ice absorption bands (D>40 %)
than any other TNO except Charon. Scattering models show that its surface is
covered by water ice, a significant fraction in crytalline state with no trace
(5 % upper limit) of complex organics. Possible scenarios to explain the
existence of this population of TNOs are discussed: a giant collision, an
originally carbon depleted composition, or a common process of continuous
resurfacing. We conclude that TNO 2005 RR43 is member of a group, may be a
population, of TNOs clustered in the space of orbital parameters that show
abundant water ice and no signs of complex organics. The lack of complex
organics in their surfaces suggests a significant smaller fraction of
carbonaceous volatiles like CH4 in this population than in ""normal"" TNOs. A
carbon depleted population of TNOs could be the origin of the population of
carbon depleted Jupiter family comets already noticed by A'Hearn et al. (1995).

observed, with the central radio component coincident with the quasar core and
a second radio component associated with a companion galaxy at a projected

continuum correlation, implying the radio emission is energetically dominated
by star formation activity. However, there is undoubtedly some contribution to
the overall radio emission from a low-luminosity AGN core and a pair of radio
lobes. Long baseline radio interferometric observations of the quasar core
place a 3sigma upper limit of 0.6mJy at 1400MHz on the AGN contribution to the

provides the first direct evidence for the quasar's host galaxy. A re-anlaysis
of the VLT spectroscopic data shows extended emission line regions aligned with
the radio axis and extended on scales of ~20kpc. This is interpreted as
evidence for jet-cloud interactions, similar to those observed in radio
galaxies and Seyferts. The emission lines in the companion galaxy are
consistent with radiative shocks and its spatial association with the eastern

imaging an unresolved source with a telescope, subject to the effects of

understand the errors in shape measurements of astronomical objects, such as
those used to study weak gravitational lensing of field galaxies. The PSF
modeling involves either a Fourier transform of the phase information in the
pupil plane or a ray-tracing approach, which has the advantage of requiring
fewer computations than the Fourier transform. Using a standard method,
involving the Gaussian weighted second moments of intensity, we then calculate
the ellipticity of the PSF patterns. We find significant ellipticity for the
instantaneous patterns (up to more than 10%). Longer exposures, which we
approximate by combining multiple (N) images from uncorrelated atmospheric
realizations, yield progressively lower ellipticity (as 1 / sqrt(N)). We also
verify that the measured ellipticity does not depend on the sampling interval
in the pupil plane using the Fourier method. However, we find that the results
using the ray-tracing technique do depend on the pupil sampling interval,
representing a gradual breakdown of the geometric approximation at high spatial
frequencies. Therefore, ray tracing is generally not an accurate method of
modeling PSF ellipticity induced by atmospheric turbulence unless some
additional procedure is implemented to correctly account for the effects of
high spatial frequency aberrations. The Fourier method, however, can be used
directly to accurately model PSF ellipticity, which can give insights into
errors in the statistics of field galaxy shapes used in studies of weak
gravitational lensing.

the critical rate, $\dot{M}_{\rm input}>3\times 10^2 L_{\rm E}/c^2$. Then, the
disk luminosity as well as the kinetic energy output rate by the outflow
exceeds the Eddington luminosity. The moderately supercritical disk,
$\dot{M}_{\rm input}\sim 10-10^2 L_{\rm E}/c^2$, exhibits limit-cycle
oscillations. The disk luminosity goes up and down across the Eddington
luminosity, and the radiatively driven outflows intermittently appear. The time
averaged mass, momentum, and kinetic energy output rates by the outflow as well
as the disk luminosity increase with increase of the mass input rate, $\propto

formation in NGC 6231 started more than 10 Myr ago and culminated in a
starburst-like event about 1 to 4 Myr ago when the bulk of the low-mass PMS
stars as well as the massive cluster members formed. We find no evidence for a
spatial age gradient that could point towards a sequential star formation
process. Only a few X-ray sources have counterparts with a reddening exceeding
the average value of the cluster or with infrared colours indicating the
presence of a moderate near-IR excess. The X-ray spectra of the brightest PMS
sources are best fitted by rather hard thermal plasma models and a significant
fraction of these sources display flares in their light curve. The X-ray
brightest flaring sources have decay times between 2 and 16 ks. The X-ray
selected PMS stars in NGC 6231 have $\log{L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol}}$ values that
increase strongly with decreasing bolometric luminosity and can reach a
saturation level ($\log{L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol}} \sim -2.4$) for non-flaring

Accepted for A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20066745",,"astro-ph",,"  Context: The principal mechanism by which brown dwarfs form, and its relation
to the formation of higher-mass (i.e. hydrogen-burning) stars, is poorly
understood. Aims: We advocate a new model for the formation of brown dwarfs.
Methods: In this model, brown dwarfs are initially binary companions, formed by
gravitational fragmentation of the outer parts (R > 100 AU) of protostellar
discs around low-mass hydrogen-burning stars. Most of these binaries are then
gently disrupted by passing stars to create a largely single population of
brown dwarfs and low-mass hydrogen-burning stars. Results: This idea is
consistent with the excess of binaries found in low-density pre-main sequence
populations, like that in Taurus, where they should survive longer than in
denser clusters. Conclusions: If brown dwarfs form in this way, as companions
to more massive stars, the difficulty of forming very low-mass prestellar cores
is avoided. Since the disrupted binaries will tend to be those involving
low-mass components and wide orbits, and since disruption will be due to the
gentle tides of passing stars (rather than violent N-body interactions in
small-N sub-clusters), the liberated brown dwarfs will have velocity
dispersions and spatial distributions very similar to higher-mass stars, and
they will be able to retain discs, and thereby to sustain accretion and
outflows. Thus the problems associated with the ejection and turbulence
mechanisms can be avoided. This model implies that most, possibly all, stars
and brown dwarfs form in binary or multiple systems.

galaxy sample (GG) and the luminous red galaxies subsample (LRG). The method
consists of a two steps approach. In the first step, objects are classified in
nearby (z<0.25) and distant (0.25<z<0.50). In the second step two different
networks are separately trained on objects belonging to the two redshift
ranges. Using a standard MLP operated in a Bayesian framework, the optimal
architectures were found to require 1 hidden layer of 24 (24) and 24 (25)
neurons for the GG (LRG) sample. The presence of systematic deviations was then
corrected by interpolating the resulting redshifts. The final results on the GG
dataset give a robust sigma_z = 0.0208 over the redshift range [0.01, 0.48] and
sigma_z = 0.0197 and sigma_z = 0.0238 for the nearby and distant samples

show strong emission lines of [OI] and MgI], as expected from a Type Ic
supernova, but weak CaII lines. The [FeII] lines that were strong in the
spectra of SN 1998bw are much weaker in SN 2006aj, consistent with the lower
luminosity of this SN. The outer velocity of the line-emitting ejecta is ~ 8000

width, and the profiles are symmetric, indicating that no major asymmetries are
present in the ejecta at the velocities sampled by the nebular lines (v < 8000
km/s), except perhaps in the innermost part. The spectra were modelled with a
non-LTE code. The mass of 56Ni required to power the emission spectrum is ~
0.20 Msun, in excellent agreement with the results of early light curve
modelling. The oxygen mass is ~ 1.5 Msun, again much less than in SN 1998bw but
larger by ~ 0.7 Msun than the value derived from the early-time modelling. The

Msun of mostly oxygen and carbon. The presence of such a core is inferred for

months. We analysed the BI time-series of the oscillating stars and used
simulations to derive statistical uncertainties of the resulting frequencies,
amplitudes and phases. A preliminary mode-identification was performed using
frequency ratios for the oscillating BS stars, and amplitude ratios and phase
differences for a population of newly detected gamma Doradus stars. We
quadrupled the number of known variables in NGC2506 by discovering 3 new
oscillating BS stars, 15 gamma Doradus stars and four new eclipsing binaries.
The orbital periods of 2 known, detached eclipsing binaries were derived. We
discovered a BS star with both p-mode and g-mode variability and we confronted
our gamma Doradus observations with state-of-the-art seismic models, but found
significant discrepancy between theory and observations.

to show clear signs of classical T Tauri-like accretion. Through analysis of
its oxygen forbidden emission we have discovered that it is driving a bipolar
outflow. Blue and red-shifted components to the [OI] 6300 forbidden emission
line are seen at velocities of - 8 km/s and +4 km/s. Spectro-astrometry
recovers the position of both components relative to the BD, at ~ 0.08
arcseconds(in opposing directions). A position velocity diagram of the line
region supports the spectro-astrometric results. The H-alpha and HeI 6678 lines
were also analysed. These line regions are not offset with respect to the
continuum ruling out the presence of spectro-astrometric artifacts and
underlining the validity of the [OI] 6300 results. The low radial velocity of
the outflow, and relatively large offsets, are consistent with 2MASS1207-3932
having a near edge-on disk, as proposed by Scholz et al. 2MASS1207-3932 is now
the smallest mass galactic object known to drive an outflow. The age of the TW
Hydrae Association (~ 8 Myr) also makes this one of the oldest objects with a
resolved jet. This discovery not only highlights the robustness of the outflow
mechanism over an enormous range of masses but also suggests that it may even
be feasible for young giant planets with accretion disks to drive outflows.

  match published version","JCAP 0706:024,2007","10.1088/1475-7516/2007/06/024",,"astro-ph",,"  Cluster abundance measurements are among the most sensitive probes of the
amplitude of matter fluctuations in the universe, which in turn can help
constrain other cosmological parameters, like the dark energy equation of state
or neutrino mass. However, difficulties in calibrating the relation between the
cluster observable and halo mass, and the lack of completeness information,
make this technique particularly susceptible to systematic errors. Here we
argue that a cluster abundance analysis using statistical weak lensing on the
stacked clusters leads to a robust lower limit on the amplitude of
fluctuations. The method compares the average weak lensing signal measured
around the whole cluster sample to a theoretical prediction, assuming that the
clusters occupy the centers of all of the most massive halos above some minimum
mass threshold. If the amplitude of fluctuations is below a certain limiting
value, there are too few massive clusters in this model and the theoretical
prediction falls below the observations. Since any effects that modify the
model assumptions can only decrease the theoretical prediction, the limiting
amplitude becomes a robust lower limit. Here, we apply it to a volume limited
sample of 16,000 group/cluster candidates identified from isolated luminous red
galaxies (LRGs) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find $\sigma_8
(\Omega_m/0.25)^{0.5}>0.62$ at the 95% c.l. after taking into account
observational errors in the lensing analysis. While this is a relatively weak
constraint, both the scatter in the LRG luminosity-halo mass relation and the
lensing errors are large; the constraints could improve considerably in the
future with more sophisticated cluster identification algorithms and smaller
errors in the lensing analysis. [Abridged]

EVPA. In addition, the 43 GHz EVPAs agree well with the optical values when we
correct the former for Faraday rotation. Fluctuations in the polarization at

nontrivial structure of the Hall photoresponse. At ultrahigh power, all effects
related to the Landau quantization decay due to a combination of the feedback

processes of point defects induced by UV laser irradiation on amorphous silicon
dioxide (silica). The investigation relies on several spectroscopic techniques
used to probe the microscopic damage induced by UV laser on the material. The
most innovative approach, however, is the measurement in situ of the absorption
signals related to laser-induced point defects. This technique yields new
information on the kinetics of defect processes, inaccessible to previous works
based only on stationary measurements of laser-induced damage. The main result
is to show that a major damage mechanism of silica under 4.7eV laser radiation
is the generation of E' centers (silicon dangling bond defects) by photolysis
of pre-existing Si-H bonds. This process occurs by two-photon absorption of
laser light, and the produced E' centers are unstable in a wide temperature
range: in fact, rupture of Si-H produces hydrogen atoms H together with E';
hence, H atoms dimerize in H_2, which diffuses in the glass and reacts back
with the E' centers causing their decay. The generation and decay kinetics of
laser-induced E' centers are quantitatively modelled by considering the
competition between the laser-induced breakage of Si-H and the concurrent
reaction between E' and H_2. The latter reaction is studied in detail at
several temperatures: some of its features are found to be affected by the
disorder of the glass matrix; moreover, its kinetics is found to be
activation-limited rather than diffusion-limited, contrary to what is usually
found for the reactions of diffusing species with point defects.

between neighboring methanol molecules. We find a rms coupling strength of

the line shape of the absorption band caused by simultaneous absorption with

correction of algorithms for finite field arithmetics but they require
extensive training from potential users. The delayed solution of a triangular
system over a finite field mixes operations on integers and operations on
floating point numbers. We focus in this report on verifying proof obligations
that state that no round off error occurred on any of the floating point
operations. We use a tool named Gappa that can be learned in a matter of
minutes to generate proofs related to floating point arithmetic and hide
technicalities of formal proof checkers. We found that three facilities are
missing from existing tools. The first one is the ability to use in Gappa new
lemmas that cannot be easily expressed as rewriting rules. We coined the second
one ``variable interchange'' as it would be required to validate loop
interchanges. The third facility handles massive loop unrolling and argument
instantiation by generating traces of execution for a large number of cases. We
hope that these facilities may sometime in the future be integrated into
mainstream code validation.

  The geometric structure used, in the present application, is an absolute
parallelism (AP)-space with spherical symmetry (type FIGI). The solution
obtained represents a generalized field outside a charged massive central body.
Two schemes have been used to get the physical meaning of the solution: The
first is related to the metric of the Riemannian space associated with the
AP-structure. The second is connected to a covariant scheme known as {\it{Type
Analysis}}. It is shown that the dependence on both schemes for interpreting
the results obtained, is more better than the dependence on the metric of the
Riemannian space associated with the AP-structure.
  In General, if we consider the solution obtained as representing a geometric
model for an elementary charged particle, then the results of the present work
can be summarized in the following points. (i) It is shown that the mass of the
particle is made of two contributions: The first is the gravitational
contribution, and the second is the contribution due to the existence of
charge. (ii) The model allows for the existence of a charged particle whose
mass is completely electromagnetic in origin. (iii) The model prevents the
existence of a charged massless particle. (iv) The electromagnetic
contribution, to the mass, is independent of the sign of the electric charge.
(v) It is shown that the mass of the electron (or a positron) is purely made of
its charge.

of the Einstein equations, some of which are new), and their stability is
investigated. We find that there are vacuum plane-wave solutions that act as
future attractors. In the parameter space, a `loophole' is shown to exist in
which there are no stable equilibrium points. We then show that a
Hopf-bifurcation can occur resulting in a stable closed orbit (which we refer
to as the Mussel attractor) corresponding to points both inside the loophole
and points just outside the loophole; in the former case the closed curves act
as late-time attractors while in the latter case these attracting curves will
co-exist with attracting equilibrium points. In the special Bianchi type III
case, centre manifold theory is required to determine the future attractors.
Comprehensive numerical experiments are carried out to complement and confirm
the analytical results presented. We note that the Bianchi type VI_h case is of
particular interest in that it contains many different subcases which exhibit
many of the different possible future asymptotic behaviours of Bianchi
cosmological models.

relativity using elasticity theory and in the slow-rotation approximation. We
find that the Newtonian picture does not change considerably. The inclusion of
relativistic effects leads only to quantitative corrections. The degeneracy of
modes for different values of $m$ is removed, and modes with $\ell=m$ are
shifted towards zero frequencies and become secularly unstable at stellar

extreme mass ratio allows accurate waveforms to be computed from black hole
perturbation theory, but this is computationally expensive and has not yet been
fully developed. Ongoing research to scope out LISA data analysis algorithms
requires waveforms that can be generated quickly in large numbers. To fulfil
this purpose, families of approximate, ""kludge"", EMRI waveforms have been
developed that capture the main features of true EMRI waveforms, but that can
also be generated for a comparatively small computational cost. In this

""numerical kludge""), its accuracy and some possible ways in which it might be
improved in the future. Although accurate parameter extraction will require use
of perturbative waveforms, these approximate waveforms are sufficiently

CP-violating angle delta and the neutrino mass hierarchy sgn(delta m^2_31) by
long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments is presented. We note the
difficulty to distinguish a pair of oscillation probability spectra that are
peaked at the same energy and have the same probability at that energy. We
thereby set forth the peak-matching condition as a criterion of the presence of
degeneracy, and visualize it by intersections of the trajectories drawn by a
peak of an oscillation spectrum while the value of delta is varied from 0 to
2pi. We numerically calculate the pairs of the trajectories for both
hierarchies and show that the pair becomes disjoint as the baseline gets longer
than a critical length, indicating the matter effect resolving the degeneracy
on the hierarchy. We formulate the trajectories into analytic expressions and
evaluate the critical length. We provide prospects of the following four
approaches of resolving the hierarchy: making the baseline longer than the
critical length, using both neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, combining experiments
with different baseline lengths, and observing two or more oscillation peaks.

anticollinear pole. This is in agreement with result obtained without
expanding, but by direct averaging of the Triple Pomeron Vertex over angles.
Resulting theta functions show that the anticollinear configuration is optimal
for the vertex. In the finite Nc case the collinear term also contributes.
Using the Triple Pomeron Vertex we construct a pomeron loop and we also
consider four gluon propagation between two Triple Pomeron Vertices. We apply
the Triple Pomeron Vertex to construct the Hamiltonian from which we derive the

the analysis of the model in the presence of Dirac monopoles, so that the

$A_{1}+A_{2}+\hdots+A_{k}$ in $[N]$, where the $A_{i}$ are arithmetic

problem is concerned with diploid branching particle models and its behavior
when rapid stirring is added to the interaction. The particle models involve
two types of particles, male and female, and branching can only occur when both
types of particles are present. We show that if the branching rate is
sufficiently large, this particle model has a nontrivial stationary
distribution, i.e. one that does not concentrate all weight on the all-0 state,
using a comparison argument due to R. Durrett. We also show extinction for
small branching rates, thereby establishing the existence of a phase
transition. We then add two different rapid stirring mechanisms to the
interactions and show that for the particle models with rapid stirring, there
also exist nontrivial stationary distribution(s); for this, we analyze the
limiting PDE and establish a condition on the PDE that guarantees existence of
nontrivial stationary distributions for sufficient fast stirring.
  The second problem deals with a model of sympatric speciation, i.e.
speciation in the absence of geographical separation, originally proposed by U.
Dieckmann and M. Doebeli in 1999. We modify their original model to obtain
several constant-population particle models. We concentrate on a
continuous-time model that converges to a deterministic dynamical system as the
number of particles becomes large. We establish various results regarding
whether speciation occurs by studying the existence of bimodal stationary
distributions for the limiting dynamical system.

defect chaos of the type described by the two-dimensional complex

bifurcation becomes subcritical and localized bursting of the whirling

into account neutrino propagation from the Sun to the Earth and the results of
neutrino source experiments with Ga, and obtain 67.3 ^{+3.9}_{-3.5} SNU. Using
the data from all solar neutrino experiments we calculate an electron neutrino
pp flux at the earth of (3.41 ^{+0.76}_{-0.77}) x 10^{10}/(cm^2-s), which

signal reflects the dynamics in the underlying multi-substate on-off kinetic

accompanying this process. For displacement of individual fragments of large

be born inside protein. What kind of interaction generates this force?
  Models based on Huxley 1957 theory ascertain relations between chemical
reactions rate constants and energies of crossbridge conformations.
Nevertheless, understand in the framework of thermodynamics how myosin motor
works in principle is impossible: it is smoothly heated device cyclically
producing mechanical work (second law). Furthermore, in every working cycle
myosin head captures and splits a single molecule. Hence, ordinary dynamic laws
rather than stochastic laws govern this process.
  The simple mechanism of chemomechanical transduction is proposed. The two
products of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis, adenosine diphosphate and
inorganic phosphate, have charges of the same sense and Coulomb interaction of
these charges produces the force pushing backdoor and rotating converter
domain. The velocity of filaments sliding becomes the principal parameter in
the model and new mechanism of indirect interaction between the cross-bridges
radically different from one suggested by Huxley and Simmons in 1971 appears.
The working stroke duration is inversely proportional to the velocity now.
Therefore Hill equation appears and the parameter values obtained are in

However, after the vessels reach the tumor surface, we assumed that the growth
rate of that particular cancer region is accelerated compared to the tumor
surface section that lacks neo-vascularization. Therefore, the resulting
asymmetric tumor growth pattern is biased towards the site of the nourishing
vessels. The simulation results show over time an increase in vessel density, a
decrease in vessel branching length, and an increase in fracticality of the
vascular branching architecture. Interestingly, over time the fractal dimension
displayed a sigmoidal pattern with a reduced rate increase at earlier and later
tumor growth stages due to distinct characteristics in vessel length and

resulted in a marked increase of tumor slice volume provides further in silico
evidence for a functional impact of vascular patterns on cancer growth.

treated as infinitely precise, perfect, immutable mathematical relationships
that transcend the physical universe and remain totally unchanged by physical
processes, however extreme. If instead the laws of physics are regarded as akin
to computer software, with the physical universe as the corresponding hardware,
then the finite computational capacity of the universe imposes a fundamental
limit on the precision of the laws and the specifiability of physical states.

  potential in the D-dimensional Schrodinger equation by the Nikiforov-Uvarov
  method","15 pages","Chinese J. Phys. 46, 291(2008)",,,"quant-ph",,"  We present analytically the exact energy bound-states solutions of the
Schrodinger equation in D-dimensions for an alternative (often used)
pseudo-Coulomb potential-plus- ring-shaped potential of the form $V(r)=-%
\frac{a}{r}+\frac{b}{r^{2}}+\frac{\beta \cos ^{2}\theta}{r^{2}\sin ^{2}\theta
}+c$ by means of the conventional Nikiforov-Uvarov method. We give a clear
recipe of how to obtain an explicit solution to the radial and angular parts of
the wave functions in terms of orthogonal polynomials. The total energy of the
system is different from the pseudo-Coulomb potential because of the
contribution of the angular part. The general results obtained in this work can
be reduced to the standard forms given in literature.
