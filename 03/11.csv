this analysis is insensitive to very short nulls. Seven of the pulsars had null

two perturbations, the ratio of pattern speeds of which is explored, rather

presented as heliocentric velocity distributions at different locations. These
model velocity distributions are compared to the observed distribution in terms
of a goodness-of-fit parameter that has been formulated here. We monitor the
spatial distribution of the maximal value of this parameter, in order to
constrain the solar position from a model. Efficiency of a model is based on a
study of this distribution as well as on other independent dynamical
considerations. We reject the bar only and spiral only models and arrive at the
following bar parameters from the bar+spiral simulations: bar pattern speed of
57.4^{+2.8}_{-3.3} km/s/kpc and a bar angle in [0^\circ$, 30^\circ$]. However,
extracting information in this way is no longer viable when the dynamical
influence of the spiral pattern does not succumb to that of the bar. Orbital
analysis indicates that even though the basic bimodality in the local velocity
distribution can be attributed to scattering off the Outer Lindblad Resonance
of the bar, it is the interaction of irregular orbits and orbits of other
resonant families, that is responsible for the other moving groups; it is
realised that such interaction increases with the warmth of the background
disk.

Wannier-Mott exciton (WE) in a $Cu_2O$ quantum well with the Frenkel (FE)

excitons is due to interaction between the gradient of electric field induced

cuprous oxide. The specific choice of the organic allows us to use the
mechanism of 'solid state solvation' to dynamically tune the WE and FE into
resonance during time $\approx 3.3 \: ns$ (comparable with the big life time of

confining Bethe-Salpeter equation simplifies in the case of very excited
quark-antiquark mesons, including angular or radial excitations, to a Salpeter
equation with an ultrarelativistic kinetic energy with the spin-independent
part of the potential. The resulting meson spectrum is solved, and the excited
chiral restoration is recovered, for all mesons with J > 0. Applying the
ultrarelativistic simplification to a linear equal-time potential, linear Regge
trajectories are obtained, for both angular and radial xcitations. The spectrum
is also compared with the semi-classical Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization relation.
However the excited angular and radial spectra do not coincide exactly. We then
search, with the classical Bertrand theorem, for central potentials producing
always classical closed orbits with the ultrarelativistic kinetic energy. We
find that no such potential exists, and this implies that no exact larger
degeneracy can be obtained in our equal-time framework, with a single principal
quantum number comparable to the non-relativistic Coulomb or harmonic
oscillator potentials. Nevertheless we find plausible that the large
experimental approximate degeneracy will be modelled in the future by quark
models beyond the present state of the art.

  calculus of functors II","34 pages",,,,"math.AT math.GT",,"  For a finite dimensional real vector space V with inner product, let F(V) be
the block structure space, in the sense of surgery theory, of the projective
space of V. Continuing a program launched in part I, we investigate F as a
functor on vector spaces with inner product, relying on functor calculus ideas.
It was shown in part I that F agrees with its first Taylor approximation T_1 F
(which is a polynomial functor of degree 1) on vector spaces V with dim(V) > 5.
To convert this theorem into a functorial homotopy-theoretic description of
F(V), one needs to know in addition what T_1 F(V) is when V=0. Here we show
that T_1 F(0) is the standard L-theory space associated with the group Z/2,
except for a deviation in \pi_0. The main corollary is a functorial two-stage
decomposition of F(V) for dim(V) > 5 which has the L-theory of the group Z/2 as
one layer, and a form of unreduced homology of RP (V) with coefficients in the
L-theory of the trivial group as the other layer. (Except for dimension shifts,
these are also the layers in the traditional Sullivan-Wall-Quinn-Ranicki
decomposition of F(V). But the dimension shifts are serious and the SWQR
decomposition of F(V) is not functorial in V.) Because of the functoriality,
our analysis of F(V) remains meaningful and valid when V=R^\infty.

the complexity of time-varying potentials, associated with the neck collapse,

and the fission-neck-collapse time are assumed to be ~1.2 MeV and ~10^-22 s,
respectively, then calculated relative probabilities of ternary-fission
light-charged-particle emission follow the trends seen in the experimental
data. The ability of this model to reproduce ternary fission probabilities
spanning seven orders of magnitude for a wide range of light-particle charges
and masses implies that ternary fission is caused by the coupling of an
evaporation-like process with the rapid re-arrangement of the nuclear fluid
following scission.

Measurements inside a ferrite shield with a spin-exchange relaxation-free

than what would be expected in a comparable mu-metal shield. The authors
identify a 1/f component of the magnetic noise due to magnetization

electromagnetic properties into this geometrical framework by putting the
coframe theta to be proportional to four extended electromagnetic potentials A;
these are assumed to encompass the conventional Maxwellian potential in a
suitable limit. The viable Einstein-Cartan(-Sciama-Kibble) theory of gravity
was adopted by Evans to describe the gravitational sector of his theory.
