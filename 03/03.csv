the expansion history of the universe, h(z), using two latest datasets, Gold
and SNLS. The reconstruction process does not employ any parameterization and
is independent of any dark energy model. The reconstructed h(z) is used to
derive the distance factor ""A"" up to redshift 0.35 and the results are compared
with the given value of ""A"" from detection of baryon acoustic oscillation peak
(BAO). We find very good agreement between supernovae observations and the
results from BAO for \Omega_{0m} \approx 0.276 \pm 0.023. The estimated values
of \Omega_{0m} are completely model-independent and are only based on
observational data. The derived values of \Omega_{0m} are then used to
reconstruct the equation of state of dark energy, w(z). Using our smoothing
method we can demonstrate that while SNLS data are in very good agreement with
LCDM, the Gold sample slightly prefers evolving dark energy. We also show that
proper estimation of the equation of state of dark energy at the high redshifts
would be impossible at the current status of observations.

distribution of different types of sources in the Milky Way using various
projections of the Galactic plane, in order to highlight signatures of stellar
evolution and to speculate on the origin of the group of sources whose
classifications are still uncertain. ISGRI has detected similar numbers of
X-ray Binaries and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The former group contains new
members of the class of HMXBs with supergiant stellar companions. Thanks to
these additional systems, we are able to show that HMXBs are generally
segregated in plots of intrinsic nH versus the orbital period of the system and
versus the spin period of the pulsar, based on whether the companion is a Be or
an OB supergiant star. We also find a tentative but expected anti-correlation
between nH and the orbital period, and a possible and unexpected correlation
between the nH and the spin period. While only a handful of new Low-Mass X-ray
Binaries (LMXBs) have been discovered, there are many sources that remain
unclassified and they appear to follow a spatial distribution typical of
Galactic sources (especially LMXBs) rather than extragalactic sources.

The data indicate that the high specific SF rates (SFR) of many less massive
galaxies do not represent late, irregular or recurrent, starbursts in evolved
galaxies. They rather seem to reflect the onset (initial burst) of the dominant
SF episode of galaxies, after which SF gradually declines on Gyr timescales to
z=0 and forms the bulk of a galaxy's M_*. With decreasing mass, this onset of
major SF shifts to decreasing z for an increasing fraction of galaxies (staged
galaxy formation). This process may be an important component of the
``downsizing'' phenomenon. We find that the predominantly gradual decline of
SFR (Noeske et al. 2007, this volume) can be reproduced by exponential SF
histories (tau models), if less massive galaxies have systematically longer
e-folding times tau, and a later onset of SF (z_f). Our model can provide a
first parametrization of SFR as a function of M_* and z, and quantify
mass-dependences of tau and z_f, from direct observations of M_* and SFR up to
z>1. The observed evolution of SF in galaxies can plausibly reflect the
dominance of gradual gas exhaustion. The data are also consistent with the
history of cosmological accretion onto Dark Matter halos.

isolated elliptical galaxy with the aid of a high-resolution hydrodynamical
code, where the cooling and heating functions include photoionization plus
Compton heating. We find that radiative heating is a key factor in the
self-regulated coevolution of massive black holes and their host galaxies and
that 1) the mass accumulated by the central black hole is limited by feedback
to the range observed today, and 2) relaxation instabilities occur so that duty
cycles are small enough (~0.03) to account for the very small fraction of
massive ellipticals observed to be in the ""on"" -QSO- phase, when the accretion
luminosity approaches the Eddington luminosity. The duty cycle of the hot
bubbles inflated at the galaxy center during major accretion episodes is of the
order of 0.1-0.4. Major accretion episodes caused by cooling flows in the
recycled gas produced by normal stellar evolution trigger nuclear starbursts
coincident with AGN flaring. During such episodes the central sources are often
obscured; but overall, in the bursting phase (1<z<3), the duty cycle of the
black hole in its ""on"" phase is of the order of percents and it is unobscured

linear in speed; constant, proportional to the initial impact speed; and
proportional to depth. This is reminiscent of high-speed ballistics impact in

exponent of quasi-1d systems of rectangular cross-section of L times l atoms in
the limit of infinite L and l < L, for x=l/L ranging from 1/30 to 1/4. The
second parameter is x, and there are two singularities: apart from the
two-parameter scaling describing AT for x>0, corrections to scaling due to the
irrelevant scaling field diverge when x->0, and the corresponding crossover
length scale is also estimated. Furthermore, results suggest that the
signatures of the AT in 3d should be present also in 2d strongly localized
regime.

curves or surfaces is the Fr\'echet distance. Whereas efficient algorithms are
known for computing the Fr\'echet distance of polygonal curves, the same
problem for triangulated surfaces is NP-hard. Furthermore, it remained open
whether it is computable at all. Here, using a discrete approximation we show
that it is {\em upper semi-computable}, i.e., there is a non-halting Turing
machine which produces a monotone decreasing sequence of rationals converging
to the result. It follows that the decision problem, whether the Fr\'echet
distance of two given surfaces lies below some specified value, is recursively
enumerable.
  Furthermore, we show that a relaxed version of the problem, the computation
of the {\em weak Fr\'echet distance} can be solved in polynomial time. For
this, we give a computable characterization of the weak Fr\'echet distance in a
geometric data structure called the {\em free space diagram}.

relations between requirements and their sources, in particular user needs.
Requirements are formal technical specifications in the solution space; needs
are natural language expressions codifying user expectations in the problem
space. Current traceability techniques are challenged by the complexity gap
that results from the disparity between the spaces, and thereby, often neglect
traceability to and from requirements. We identify the existence of an
intermediary region -- the transition space -- which structures the progression
from needs to requirements. More specifically, our approach to developing
change-tolerant systems, termed Capabilities Engineering, identifies highly
cohesive, minimally coupled, optimized functional abstractions called
Capabilities in the transition space. These Capabilities link the problem and
solution spaces through directives (entities derived from user needs).
Directives connect the problem and transition spaces; Capabilities link the
transition and solution spaces. Furthermore, the process of Capabilities
Engineering addresses specific traceability challenges. It supports the
evolution of traces, provides semantic and structural information about
dependencies, incorporates human factors, generates traceability relations with
negligible overhead, and thereby, fosters pre-Requirement Specification
traceability.

CSIR and (b) CSI estimated at the receiver using training symbols. With perfect
CSIR, under a short-term power constraint, we determine: (a) the outage
probability for beamforming with imperfect CSIT (BF-IC) analytically, and (b)
the optimal spatial power allocation (OSPA) scheme that minimizes outage
numerically. Results show that, for delayed CSIT, BF-IC is close to optimal for
low SNR and uniform spatial power allocation (USPA) is close to optimal at high
SNR. Similarly, under a long-term power constraint, we show that BF-IC is close
to optimal for low SNR and USPA is close to optimal at high SNR. With imperfect
CSIR, we obtain an upper bound on the outage probability with USPA and BF-IC.
Results show that the loss in performance due to imperfection in CSIR is not
significant, if the training power is chosen appropriately.

assisted inflation with quadratic, separable potentials and masses given by the
Marcenko-Pastur distribution. After estimating parameters characterizing the
bi- and trispectrum in the horizon crossing approximation, we focus on the
non-linearity parameter $f_{NL}$, a measure of the bispectrum; we compute its
magnitude for narrow and broad spreads of masses, including the evolution of
modes after horizon crossing. We identify additional contributions due to said
evolution and show that they are suppressed as long as the fields are evolving
slowly. This renders $\mathcal{N}$-flation indistinguishable from simple
single-field models in this regime. Larger non-Gaussianities are expected to
arise for fields that start to evolve faster, and we suggest an analytic
technique to estimate their contribution. However, such fast roll during
inflation is not expected in N-flation, leaving (p)re-heating as the main
additional candidate for generating non-Gaussianities.

phase diagrams reveal interesting phenomena such as disentangled realizations
of chiral and center symmetry, confinement without chiral symmetry breaking,
zero temperature chiral transitions, and in some cases, exotic phases which
spontaneously break the discrete symmetries such as C, P, T as well as CPT. In
a regime where the theories are perturbative, the deconfinement temperature in
SYM, and QCD(AS/S/BF) coincide. The thermal phase diagrams of thermal orbifold
QCD(BF), orientifold QCD(AS/S), and $\N=1$ SYM coincide, provided charge
conjugation symmetry for QCD(AS/S) and $\Z_2$ interchange symmetry of the
QCD(BF) are not broken in the phase continously connected to $\R^4$ limit. When
the $S^1$ circle is endowed with periodic boundary conditions, the (nonthermal)
phase diagrams of orbifold and orientifold QCD are still the same, however,
both theories possess chirally symmetric phases which are absent in $\None$
SYM. The match and mismatch of the phase diagrams depending on the spin
structure of fermions along the $S^1$ circle is naturally explained in terms of
the necessary and sufficient symmetry realization conditions which determine

that the standard deviation of annual sales growth rates decreases with
increasing firm sales as a power law, and that the sales growth distribution is
non-Gaussian with slowly decaying tails. To explain these empirical facts, a
theory is developed that incorporates both the fluctuations of a single firm's
sales and the statistical differences among many firms. The theory reproduces
both the scaling in the standard deviation and the non-Gaussian distribution of
growth rates. Earlier models reproduce the same empirical features by splitting
firms into somewhat ambiguous subunits; by decomposing total sales into
individual transactions, this ambiguity is removed. The theory yields
verifiable predictions and accommodates any form of business organization
within a firm. Furthermore, because transactions are fundamental to economic
activity at all scales, the theory can be extended to all levels of the

incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code is applied to simulate this

composed of ammonium, phosphonium, pyrrolidinium, and imidazolium cations and
bis(triflyl)amide, dicyanamide, and bis(oxalato)borate anions, have been
studied using low-temperature Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR). Several
classes of radicals have been identified and related to reactions of the
primary radiolytically generated electrons and holes. Large yields of terminal
and penultimate C-centered radicals are observed in the aliphatic chains of the
phosphonium, ammonium and pyrrolidinium cations, but not for imidazolium
cation. This pattern can be accounted for by efficient deprotonation of a hole
trapped on the cation (the radical dication) that competes with rapid charge
transfer to a nearby anion. The latter leads to the formation of stable N- or
O-centered radicals. The electrons either react with the protic impurity (for
nonaromatic cations) yielding H atoms or the aromatic moiety (for imidazolium
cations). Excitation of bis(triflyl)amide anion is shown to yield
trifluoromethyl radical; the yield of this radical in radiolysis, though, is
low (< 10% of the alkyl radical yield). In terms of their radiation chemistry,
neat ILs appear to be intermediate between organic liquids and ionic solids.
Addition of 10-40 wt% of trialkylphoshate (a common extraction agent for
nuclear cycle separations) has relatively little effect on the fragmentation of
the ILs. Radiation induced dealkylation of the phosphate is prominent, but the
yield of the alkyl radical fragments derived from the phosphates is < 4% of the
yield of the radical fragments drived from the solvent. We discuss the
implication of these results for the radiation stability of nuclear cycle
extraction systems based upon the IL diluents.

dyed shear-thinning polymer solution displacing a transparent one have been
studied as a function of the fluid rheology and flow rate. The front width
increases linearly with distance indicating a convection of the fluids with a
low transverse mixing between the flow paths. The width also increases with the
flow-rate as the fluid rheology shifts from Newtonian at low shear rates $\dot
\gamma$ towards a shear thinning behaviour at higher $\dot \gamma$ values. The
width also increases with the polymer concentration at high flow-rates. These
results demonstrate the enhancement of the flow velocity contrasts between
different flow channels for shear thinning fluids. The relative widths at low

predicted by an analytical model considering the fracture as a set of parallel
