scheme was developed for the thermal evolution of a spherical nucleus composed
of a mixture of ice and dust. The model was tested against analytical
solutions, simplified numerical solutions, and 1-D thermal evolution codes. The

maps and the internal thermal structure was obtained as function of depth,
longitude and hour angle. The effect of the spin axis tilt on the surface
temperature distribution was studied in detail. It was found that for small

saddle points and centre-type points. For the specific choice of the Newtonian

saddle point while the inner one is a centre-type point. A restrictive upper
bound is imposed on the admissible range of values of the angular momentum of
sub-Keplerian flows through a saddle point. These flows are very unstable to
any deviation from a necessarily precise boundary condition. The difficulties
against the physical realisability of a solution passing through the saddle

a non-perturbative mechanism for selecting a transonic solution passing through
the saddle point. An equation of motion for a real-time perturbation about the

as a function of X-ray luminosity shows a reddening of the IR SEDs, consistent
with a decreasing contribution from the host galaxy at higher luminosities. The
AGNs in the SF classes are likely obscured in the mid-infrared, as suggested by
their low L(3-20micron)/Lcorr(0.5-10 keV) ratios. We confirm the previously
found correlation for AGNs between the radio luminosity and the X-ray and the

heavily absorbed AGNs. However, the estimated radio fluxes for the missing AGN

that subsequent to the formation of the Milky Way and its satellites, those

leaving behind a population that now has a relatively larger value of its
average perigalacticon to apogalacticon ratio and consequently a larger value
of its r.m.s. transverse to radial velocities ratio compared to their values at
the time of formation of the dSphs. We analyze the implications of this
hypothesis for the phase space distribution of the dSphs and that of the dark
matter (DM) halo of the Galaxy within the context of a self-consistent model in
which the functional form of the phase space distribution of DM particles
follows the King model i.e. the `lowered isothermal' distribution and the
potential of the Galaxy is determined self-consistently by including the
gravitational cross-coupling between visible matter and DM particles. This
analysis, coupled with virial arguments, yields an estimate of $\gsim$ 270 km/s
for the circular velocity of any test object at galactocentric distances of
$\sim$ 100 kpc, the typical distances of the dSphs. The corresponding
self-consistent values of the relevant DM halo model parameters, namely, the

dissipation stage that lasts 10-50 kyr. The interplay of the Hall drift with
the temporal variation and spatial gradient of conductivity tends to favor the
displacement of toroidal fields toward the inner crust, where stable

AGN class: the naked AGNs. Based on optical spectroscopic studies, these
sources appear as classical type 2 (obscured) AGNs, with only narrow emission
lines. However, long-term optical monitoring campaigns, carried out over more
than two decades, show that the same sources are strongly variable, like type 1
(un-obscured) AGNs. Based on short Chandra observations, the sources appear to
be fairly bright in the X-rays, with typical Seyfert 1s values for the photon
index (Gamma~1.8) and without significant intrinsic absorption, supporting the
conclusion that some bright AGNs may genuinely lack a broad line region.
Future, broad-band studies as well as deeper X-ray observations, probing both
the spectral and the temporal properties of the naked AGNs, are crucial to shed
light on the central engine of these sources, which may be representative of a
large class of AGNs.

  Figure 6 will appear with a better quality in the A&A paper",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20077363",,"astro-ph",,"  Context. NGC 300 X-1 is the second extragalactic candidate, after IC 10 X-1,
in the rare class of Wolf-Rayet/compact object X-ray binary systems exemplified
in the Galaxy by Cyg X-3. From a theoretical point of view, accretion onto a
black hole in a detached system is possible for large orbital periods only if
the mass of the relativistic object is high or the velocity of the accreted
wind is low. Aims. We analysed a 2 week SWIFT XRT light curve of NGC 300 X-1
and searched for periodicities. Methods. Period searches were made using
Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis. We evaluated the confidence level using
Monte Carlo simulations. Results. A period of 32.8+-0.4h (3 sigma error) was
found for NGC 300 X-1 with a confidence level >99%. Furthermore, we confirm the
high irregular variability during the high flux level, as already observed in
the XMM-Newton observations of the source. A folded XMM-Newton light curve is
shown, with a profile that is in agreement with SWIFT. The mean absorbed X-ray
luminosity in the SWIFT observations was 1.5x10^38 erg/s, close to the value
derived from the XMM-Newton data. Conclusions. While Cyg X-3 has a short period
of 4.8 h, the period of NGC 300 X-1 is very close to that of IC 10 X-1
(34.8+-0.9 h). These are likely orbital periods. Possibility of formation of
accretion disk for such high orbital periods strongly depends on the terminal
velocity of the Wolf-Rayet star wind and black-hole mass. While low masses are
possible for wind velocities < 1000 km/s, these increase to several tens of
solar masses for velocities > 1600 km/s and no accretion disk may form for
terminal velocities larger than 1900 km/s.

to an unbounded growth in the stress maximum in the cylinder wake. Finite

This paper presents an information-theoretic framework for characterizing the
minimum routing overheads of geographic routing in a network with mobile nodes.
specifically, the minimum overhead problem is formulated as a rate-distortion
problem. The formulation may be applied to networks with arbitrary traffic
arrival and location service schemes. Lower bounds are derived for the minimum
overheads incurred for maintaining the location of destination nodes and
consistent neighborhood information in terms of node mobility and packet

quantities in particle physics. Recent high precision measurements (0.54ppm) at
Brookhaven reveal a ``discrepancy'' by 3 standard deviations from the
electroweak Standard Model which could be a hint for an unknown contribution
from physics beyond the Standard Model. This triggered numerous speculations
about the possible origin of the ``missing piece''. The remarkable 14-fold
improvement of the previous CERN experiment, actually animated a multitude of
new theoretical efforts which lead to a substantial improvement of the
prediction of a_mu. The dominating uncertainty of the prediction, caused by
strong interaction effects, could be reduced substantially, due to new hadronic
cross section measurements in electron-positron annihilation at low energies.
After an introduction and a brief description of the principle of the
experiment, I present a major update and review the status of the theoretical
prediction and discuss the role of the hadronic vacuum polarization effects and
the hadronic light--by--light scattering contribution. Prospects for the future
will be briefly discussed. As, in electroweak precision physics, the muon g-2
shows the largest established deviation between theory and experiment at
present, it will remain one of the hot topics for further investigations.

limit of the system. This representation is characterized by a density the
value of which should everywhere be between zero and one. This density itself
is determined through a saddle-point analysis. For some values of the parameter
space, this density exceeds one in some places. So one should modify it to
obtain an acceptable density. This leads to the well-known Douglas-Kazakov
phase transition. In generalized Yang-Mills theories, there are also regions in
the parameter space where somewhere this density becomes negative. Here too,
one should modify the density so that it remains nonnegative. This leads to
another phase transition, different from the Douglas-Kazakov one. Here the
general structure of this phase transition is studied, and it is shown that the
order of this transition is typically three. Using carefully-chosen parameters,
however, it is possible to construct models with phase-transition orders not
equal to three. A class of these non-typical models are also studied.

that of asymptotically Euclidean manifolds, where $\partial M = S^{n-1}$ and
the induced metric at infinity is equal to the standard metric. We study the

\Delta_g + V$, where $\Delta_g$ is the positive Laplacian associated to $g$ and
$V$ is a real potential function $V$ that is smooth on $M$ and vanishes to some
finite order at the boundary.
  In the first paper in this series we made the assumption that $n \geq 3$ and
that $P$ has neither zero modes nor a zero-resonance and showed (i) that the
resolvent kernel is conormal to the lifted diagonal and polyhomogeneous at the
boundary on a blown up version of $M^2 \times [0, k_0]$, and (ii) the Riesz
transform of $P$ is bounded on $L^p(M^\circ)$ for $1 < p < n$, and that this
range is optimal unless $V \equiv 0$ and $M^\circ$ has only one end. In the

allowing zero modes and zero-resonances. We find the precise range of $p$ for
which the Riesz transform (suitably defined) of $P$ is bounded on $L^p(M)$ when
zero modes (but not resonances, which make the Riesz transform undefined) are
present. Generically the Riesz transform is bounded for $p$ precisely in the
range $(n/(n-2), n/3)$, with a bigger range possible if the zero modes have

into the configuration interaction (CI) calculations. These correlations take
place in the core area where the potential of external electrons is

wave functions and Green's functions. Therefore, all operators describing
interaction of $M$ valence electrons and $N-M$ core electrons (the core part of
the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian
  $V^{N-M}$, the correlation potential $\hat\Sigma_1({\bf r},{\bf r'},E)$ and
the screening of interaction between valence electrons by the core electrons
$\hat\Sigma_2$) may be calculated with all
  $M$ valence electrons removed. This allows one to avoid subtraction diagrams
which make accurate inclusion of the core-valence correlations for $M>2$
prohibitively complicated. Then the CI Hamiltonian for $M$ valence electrons is
calculated using orbitals in complete $V^{N}$ potential (the mean field
produced by all electrons); $\hat\Sigma_1$ + $\hat\Sigma_2$ are added to the CI
Hamiltonian to account for the core-valence correlations. We calculate
$\hat\Sigma_1$ and $\hat\Sigma_2$ using many-body perturbation theory in which
dominating classes of diagrams are included in all orders.
  We use neutral Xe I and all positive ions up to Xe VIII as a testing ground.
We found that the core electron density for all these systems is practically
the same. Therefore, we use the same $\hat\Sigma_1$ and $\hat\Sigma_2$ to build
the CI Hamiltonian in all these systems ($M=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$). Good agreement
with experiment for energy levels and Land\'{e} factors is demonstrated for all

The inertial system of the earth travels not only in the solar system at the

contraction of 700 km/s is maximally estimated as 54 m. However, such a large

a free harmonic oscillator. Since the exact one harmonic oscillator master
equation is available [Hu, Paz and Zhang, Phys. Rev. D \textbf{45}, 2843

mechanical damping. We study specific classes of entangled and separable probe
states consisting of superpositions of coherent states. Based on the assumption
of limited quantum resources we show that entanglement improves the estimation
of an unknown damping constant.

positive-definite metric operator. It enables physical interpretation of the
considered systems. In the article, we study the pseudo-hermitian systems with
constant number of particles in equilibrium. We show that the explicit
knowledge of the metric operator is not essential for study of thermodynamic
properties of the system. We introduce a simple example where the physically
relevant quantities are derived without explicit calculation of either metric
operator or spectrum of the Hamiltonian.
