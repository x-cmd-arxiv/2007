with an accretion-disk line model, however, the best-fitting model parameters

to constrain the model parameters better and to confirm the relativistic
interpretation of the double peaked Fe Kalpha line. Another possible
interpretation of the Fe emission is fluorescent Fe emission from the back-side
of the wind. The spectra of images C and D show significant high-energy broad
absorption features that extend up to rest-frame energies of 9 keV and 15 keV

significant variability of the outflow on time-scales that are shorter than the

footpoints, at the top, is it random, or is the average profile uniform?
  Aims: We try to address this question in model loops with MHD turbulence and
a profile of density and/or magnetic field along the loop.
  Methods: We use the ShellAtm MHD turbulent heating model described in Buchlin
& Velli (2006), with a static mass density stratification obtained by the
HydRad model (Bradshaw & Mason 2003). This assumes the absence of any flow or
heat conduction subsequent to the dynamic heating.
  Results: The average profile of heating is quasi-uniform, unless there is an
expansion of the flux tube (non-uniform axial magnetic field) or the variation
of the kinetic and magnetic diffusion coefficients with temperature is taken
into account: in the first case the heating is enhanced at footpoints, whereas
in the second case it is enhanced where the dominant diffusion coefficient is
enhanced.

such a method has the advantage that stellar luminosities and masses can in
principle be determined without relying on theoretical relations between both
quantities. By alternatively combining the results of our spectroscopic
investigation with evolutionary tracks, we obtain so-called spectroscopic
distances, which can be compared with the known (average) distance of the
Bulge-CSPN. This offers the possibility to test the validity of model
atmospheres and present date post-AGB evolution. We analyze optical H/He
profiles of five Galactic Bulge CSPN (plus one comparison object) by means of
profile fitting based on state of the art non-LTE modeling tools, to constrain
their basic atmospheric parameters (Teff, log g, helium abundance and wind
strength). Masses and other stellar radius dependent quantities are obtained
from both the known distances and from evolutionary tracks, and the results

the applied reddening law. An ""average extinction law"" leads to a distance of
10.7 +- 1.2 kpc, which is considerably larger than the Galactic Center distance

HII regions in spirals, i.e. the [8.0]/[NUV] and [Halpha]/[NUV] SFR ratios are
on average low although there are some large variations from one region to
another, which cannot be explained by variations of the metallicity or the dust

optically faint luminous infrared galaxies (R-[24]> 14) using Keck NIRSPEC and
Gemini NIRI. The sample is selected from a 24 micron Spitzer MIPS imaging
survey of the NDWFS Bootes field. We measure accurate redshifts in the range
1.3<z<3.4. Based on either emission line widths or line diagnostics, we find
that all ten galaxies harbor luminous AGN. Seven sources are type I AGN,
exhibiting broad (>1900 km/s) Halpha or Hbeta emission lines; the remaining
three are type II AGN. Given their large mid-IR luminosities and faint optical
magnitudes, we might expect these sources to be heavily extincted quasars, and
therefore only visible as type II AGN. The visibility of broad lines in 70% of
the sources suggests that it is unlikely that these AGN are being viewed
through the mid-plane of a dusty torus. For four of the sources we constrain
the Halpha/Hbeta Balmer decrement and estimate the extinction to the emission
line region to be large for both type I and type II AGN, with A_Halpha > 2.4-5
mag. Since the narrow-line region is also extincted and the UV continuum
emission from the host galaxies is extremely faint, this suggests that much of
the obscuration is contributed by dust on large (~kpc) scales within the host
galaxies. These sources may be examples of ""host-obscured"" AGN which could have
space densities comparable or greater to that of optically luminous type I AGN
with similar bolometric luminosities.

use an extensively-tested analytic model for subhalo infall and evolution and
empirical constraints from galaxy survey data to set the stellar mass in each
accreted subhalo to model diffuse light. We add stellar mass to the diffuse
light as subhalos become disrupted due to interactions within their host halos.
We predict that the stellar mass fraction in diffuse, intrahalo light should
rise on average from ~0.5% to approximately 20% from small galaxy halos to poor
groups. The trend with mass flattens considerably beyond the group scale,
increasing weakly from a fraction of ~20% in poor galaxy clusters (~10^14
M_sun) to roughly ~30% in massive clusters (~10^15 M_sun). The mass-dependent
diffuse light fraction is governed primarily by the empirical fact that the
mass-to-light ratio in galaxy halos must vary as a function of halo mass.
Galaxy halos have little diffuse light because they accrete most of their mass
in small subhalos that themselves have high mass-to-light ratios; stellar halos
around galaxies are built primarily from disrupted dwarf-irregular-type
galaxies with M*~10^8.5 M_sun. The diffuse light in group and cluster halos is
built from satellite galaxies that form stars efficiently and have
correspondingly low mass-to-light ratios; intracluster light is dominated by
material liberated from massive galaxies with M*~10^11 M_sun. Our results are
consistent with existing observations spanning the galaxy, group, and cluster
scale; however, they can be tested more rigorously in future deep surveys for
faint diffuse light.

densities rho(TIR) and rho(FUV) are known to evolve from z=0 to z~1 but with a

increase of the ratio of TIR to FUV luminosity densities rho(TIR)/rho(FUV)
which can be interpreted as a global increase of the dust attenuation from z=0

infrared galaxies with L(TIR>10^{11} Lsun at z~0.7 observed by SPITZER/MIPS and
we measure their UV emission at 2310 A from GALEX. These Luminous InfraRed
Galaxies (LIRGs) represent the bulk of the TIR luminosity density at
intermediate redshift. Some evolution of L(TIR)/L(FUV) and therefore of dust
attenuation is found for these galaxies: LIRGs at z=0.7 span a larger range of
L(TIR)/L(FUV) ratios than at z=0 and their mean dust attenuation at FUV is
found ~0.5 mag lower than for their local counterparts. The decrease of dust
attenuation is found lower than that reported in other studies for bright
galaxies selected in UV rest-frame at z=1 and 2. From a semi-quantitative
analysis we find that the slight decrease of dust attenuation for LIRGs at

absorbed soft spectrum, e.g. a neutron star atmosphere or black body model. No

source, down to a magnitude limit of I> 23.5 and K_s> 19.5. The positional
evidence, the soft X-ray spectrum together with the optical and near-infrared
non-detections provide strong evidence that this source is the quiescent

be explained by stellar coronal X-ray emission. Together with the interstellar
extinction measured in outburst and estimates for the source distance, the

such cases, an important prerequisite is the understanding of wave propagation

developed to analyze the wave propagation process in shape memory alloy rods.
The first order martensite transformations and associated thermo-mechanical
coupling effects are accounted for by employing the modified
Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire theory. The Landau-type free energy function is
employed to characterize different phases, while a Ginzburg term is introduced
to account for energy contributions from phase boundaries. The effect of
internal friction is represented by a Rayleigh dissipation term. The resulted
nonlinear system of PDEs is reduced to a differential-algebraic system, and
Chebyshev's collocation method is employed together with the backward
differentiation method. A series of numerical experiments are performed. Wave
propagations caused by impact loadings are analyzed for different initial
temperatures. It is demonstrated that coupled waves will be induced in the
material. Such waves will be dissipated and dispersed during the propagation
process, and phase transformations in the material will complicate their
propagation patterns. Finally, the influence of internal friction and capillary
effects on the process of wave propagation is analyzed numerically.

system for shock physics projectiles was investigated in detail using one- and
two-dimensional continuum dynamics simulations. The simulations were
insensitive to uncertainties in the material properties, and reproduced
measurements of the projectile. The most commonly-used variant, with an Al
alloy case, was predicted to produce a slightly curved projectile, subjected to
some shock heating, and likely exhibiting some porosity from tensile damage.
The flatness can be improved by using a case of lower shock impedance, such as
polymethyl methacrylate. High-impedance cases, including Al alloys but with
denser materials improving the launching efficiency, can be used if designed
according to the physics of oblique shock reflection. The tensile stress
induced in the projectile depends on the relative thickness of the explosive,
expansion gap, and projectile. The thinner the projectile with respect to the
explosive, the smaller the tensile stress. If the explosive is initiated with a
plane wave lens, the tensile stress is lower than for initiation with multiple
detonators over a plane. The previous plane wave lens designs did however
induce a tensile stress close to the spall strength of the projectile. The
tensile stress can be reduced by changes in the component thicknesses.
Experiments to verify the operation of explosively-launched projectiles should
attempt to measure porosity induced in the projectile: arrival time
measurements may be insensitive to porous regions caused by damaged or
recollected material.

significant improvement of $T_2$ times in Cooper pair box qubits [D. Vion et

to operate in a regime of significantly increased ratio of Josephson energy and
charging energy $E_J/E_C$. The transmon benefits from the fact that its charge
dispersion decreases exponentially with $E_J/E_C$, while its loss in
anharmonicity is described by a weak power law. As a result, we predict a
drastic reduction in sensitivity to charge noise relative to the Cooper pair
box and an increase in the qubit-photon coupling, while maintaining sufficient
anharmonicity for selective qubit control. Our detailed analysis of the full

perturbations of an ultrathin metal film on an amorphous substrate (SiO_{2}).
The formulation combines the approach of Mullins [J. Appl. Phys. v30, 77, 1959]
for bulk substrates, in which curvature-driven mass transport and surface
deformation can occur by surface/volume diffusion and evaporation-condensation
processes, with that of Spencer et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. v67, 26, 1991] to
describe solid state transport in thin films under epitaxial strain. The model
is applied to study the relative rate of solid state mass transport as compared
to that of liquid phase dewetting in a thin film subjected to fast a thermal
pulse. Specifically, we have recently shown that multiple cycles of nanosecond
(ns) pulsed laser melting and resolidification of ultrathin metal films on
amorphous substrates can lead to the formation of various types of spatially
ordered nanostructures [Phys. Rev. B, v75, 235439 (2007)]. The pattern
formation has been attributed to the dewetting of the thin film by a
hydrodynamic instability. In such experiments the film is in the solid state
during a substantial fraction of each thermal cycle. Results of a linear
stability analysis based on the aforementioned model suggest that solid state
mass transport has negligible effect on morphology changes of the surface.
Hence, surface deformation caused by liquid phase instabilities is rapidly
quenched-in during the cooling phase. This deformed state is further evolved by
subsequent laser pulses. These results have implications to developing accurate
computer simulations of thin film dewetting by energetic beams aimed at the
manufacturing of optically active nanoscale materials for applications
including information processing, optical devices and solar energy harvesting.

transition between a high temperature phase where the entropy is extensive and
a low-temperature phase of finite entropy. In this paper, we study the weight
statistics at criticality via the entropy $S=-\sum w_i \ln w_i$ and the
generalized moments $Y_k=\sum w_i^k$, where the $w_i$ are the Boltzmann weights
of the $2^N$ configurations. In the REM, we find that the critical weight
statistics is governed by the finite-size exponent $\nu=2$ : the entropy scales
as $\bar{S}_N(T_c) \sim N^{1/2}$, the typical values $e^{\bar{\ln Y_k}}$ decay
as $N^{-k/2}$, and the disorder-averaged values $\bar{Y_k}$ are governed by
rare events and decay as $N^{-1/2}$ for any $k>1$. For the DPCT, we find that
the entropy scales similarly as $\bar{S}_N(T_c) \sim N^{1/2}$, whereas another
exponent $\nu'=1$ governs the $Y_k$ statistics : the typical values
$e^{\bar{\ln Y_k}}$ decay as $N^{-k}$, the disorder-averaged values $\bar{Y_k}$
decay as $N^{-1}$ for any $k>1$. As a consequence, the asymptotic probability
distribution $\bar{\pi}_{N=\infty}(q)$ of the overlap $q$, beside the delta
function $\delta(q)$ which bears the whole normalization, contains an isolated
point at $q=1$, as a memory of the delta peak $(1-T/T_c) \delta(q-1)$ of the
low-temperature phase $T<T_c$. The associated value $\bar{\pi}_{N=\infty}(q=1)$
is finite for the DPCT, and diverges as $\bar{\pi}_{N=\infty}(q=1) \sim

angular velocity becomes monotonic even if the system has not reached the
statistical equilibrium state (Boltzmann distribution). In that case, the
system remains blocked in a sort of metastable state with a non standard
distribution. We also study the relaxation of a test vortex in a steady bath of
field vortices. The relaxation of the test vortex is described by a
Fokker-Planck equation involving a diffusion term and a drift term. The
diffusion coefficient, which is proportional to the density of field vortices
and inversely proportional to the shear, usually decreases rapidly with the
distance. The drift is proportional to the gradient of the density profile of
the field vortices and is connected to the diffusion coefficient by a
generalized Einstein relation. We study the evolution of the tail of the
distribution function of the test vortex and show that it has a front
structure. We also study how the temporal auto-correlation function of the

exhibits an algebraic behavior with an exponent that we compute analytically.

define the scale of coherence in spintronic devices and circuits. Since these
parameters are many orders of magnitude larger in semiconductors than in
metals, semiconductors could be the most suitable for spintronics. Thus far,
spin transport has only been measured in direct-bandgap semiconductors or in
combination with magnetic semiconductors, excluding a wide range of
non-magnetic semiconductors with indirect bandgaps. Most notable in this group
is silicon (Si), which (in addition to its market entrenchment in electronics)
has long been predicted a superior semiconductor for spintronics with enhanced
lifetime and diffusion length due to low spin-orbit scattering and lattice
inversion symmetry. Despite its exciting promise, a demonstration of coherent
spin transport in Si has remained elusive, because most experiments focused on
magnetoresistive devices; these methods fail because of universal impedance
mismatch obstacles, and are obscured by Lorentz magnetoresistance and Hall
effects. Here we demonstrate conduction band spin transport across 10 microns
undoped Si, by using spin-dependent ballistic hot-electron filtering through
ferromagnetic thin films for both spin-injection and detection. Not based on
magnetoresistance, the hot electron spin-injection and detection avoids
impedance mismatch issues and prevents interference from parasitic effects. The
clean collector current thus shows independent magnetic and electrical control
of spin precession and confirms spin coherent drift in the conduction band of
silicon.

progressive accumulation of knowledge. At the level of technology, this leads
to ephemeralization, i.e. ever increasing productivity, or decreasing of the
friction that normally dissipates resources. As a result, flows of matter,
energy and information circulate ever more easily across the planet. This
global connectivity increases the interactions between agents, and thus the
possibilities for conflict. However, evolutionary progress also reduces social
friction, via the creation of institutions. The emergence of such ""mediators""
is facilitated by stigmergy: the unintended collaboration between agents
resulting from their actions on a shared environment. The Internet is a near
ideal medium for stigmergic interaction. Quantitative stigmergy allows the web
to learn from the activities of its users, thus becoming ever better at helping
them to answer their queries. Qualitative stigmergy stimulates agents to
collectively develop novel knowledge. Both mechanisms have direct analogues in
the functioning of the human brain. This leads us to envision the future,
super-intelligent web as a ""global brain"" for humanity. The feedback between
social and technological advances leads to an extreme acceleration of
innovation. An extrapolation of the corresponding hyperbolic growth model would
forecast a singularity around 2040. This can be interpreted as the evolutionary

framework for modelling solid regions in neutron stars. Here we turn our
attention to axial perturbations of spherically symmetric spacetimes using a
gauge invariant approach due to one of us. Using the formalism developed in the
first paper in the series it turns out that the matter perturbations are neatly
expressible in terms of a ``metric'' tensor field depending only on the speeds
of shear wave propagation along the principal directions in the solid. The
results are applicable to a wide class of elastic materials and does not assume
material isotropy nor quasi-Hookean behaviour. The perturbation equations are
then specialised to a static background and are given by two coupled wave
equations. Our formalism is thus slightly simpler than the previously existing
results of Shumaker & Thorne, where an additional initial value equation needs
to be solved. The simplification is mainly due to the gauge invariance of our
approach and shows up also in somewhat simpler boundary conditions. We also
give a first order formulation suitable for numerical integration of the
quasi-normal mode problem of a neutron star. The relations between the gauge
independent variables and the, in general, gauge dependent perturbed metric and
strain tensor are explicitly given.

fully accounted for, is calculated for three different cases: (1) a
generalization of the incoherent Bertsch-Gunion solution for asymptotic
on-shell jets, (2) initial-state energy loss of incoming jets that undergo hard
scattering and (3) final-state energy loss of jets that emerge out of a hard

represents a cluster expansion of the sequential multiple scattering. These new
solutions allow, for the first time, direct comparison between initial- and
final-state energy loss in cold nuclei. We demonstrate that, contrary to the
naive assumption, energy loss in cold nuclear matter can be large. Numerical
results to first order in opacity show that, in the limit of large jet
energies, initial- and final-state energy losses exhibit different path length
dependences, linear versus quadratic, in contrast to earlier findings. In
addition, in this asymptotic limit, initial-state energy loss is considerably

achievable. We get a novel prediction for \theta_13 in the CP-conserving case:
\sin\theta_13 = \tan\theta_12 |(1- \tan\theta_23)/ (1+ \tan\theta_{23})|. Our

theoretical framework of 2T physics field theory and its gauge symmetries. The
fields are arranged into 4+2 dimensional chiral and vector supermultiplets, and
their interactions are uniquely fixed by SUSY and 2T-physics gauge symmetries.
Many 3+1 spacetimes emerge from 4+2 by gauge fixing. Gauge degrees of freedom
are eliminated as one comes down from 4+2 to 3+1 dimensions without any
remnants of Kaluza-Klein modes. In a special gauge, the remaining physical
degrees of freedom, and their interactions, coincide with ordinary N=1
supersymmetric field theory in 3+1 dimensions. In this gauge, SUSY in 4+2 is
interpreted as superconformal symmetry SU(2,2|1) in 3+1 dimensions.
Furthermore, the underlying 4+2 structure imposes some interesting restrictions
on the emergent 3+1 SUSY field theory, which could be considered as part of the
predictions of 2T-physics. One of these is the absence of the troublesome
renormalizable CP violating F*F terms. This is good for curing the strong CP
violation problem of QCD. An additional feature is that the superpotential is
required to have no dimensionful parameters. To induce phase transitions, such
as SUSY or electro-weak symmetry breaking, a coupling to the dilaton is needed.
This suggests a common origin of phase transitions that is driven by the vacuum
value of the dilaton, and need to be understood in a cosmological scenario as
part of a unified theory that includes the coupling of supergravity to matter.
Another interesting aspect is the possibility to utilize the inherent 2T gauge
symmetry to explore dual versions of the N=1 theory in 3+1 dimensions. This is
expected to reveal non-perturbative aspects of ordinary 1T field theory.

particles. The second component consist of ""unusual"" charged particles (namely,
either with ultra-high charge or with ultra-high mass) that provide the
important mechanism of expansion due to their interaction with the ""normal""
component of the gas. This interaction is described by the
Reissner--Nordstr\""om metric purely geometrically -- the ``unusual'' particles
are modeled as zero-dimensional naked singularities inside spheres of
gravitational repulsion. The radius of a repulsive sphere is inversely
proportional to the energy of an incoming particle or the temperature. The
expansion mechanism is based on the inflating of the ""unusual"" particles (of
charge $Q$) with the drop of the temperature -- this drives apart all neutral
particles and particles of specific charge $q/m$ such that ${sign}(Q) q/m \ge -
1$. The Reissner--Nordstr\""om expansion naturally ends at recombination. We
discuss the range of model parameters within which the proposed expansion
mechanism is consistent with the restrictions regarding quantum effects.

which is that the matrix potential and boundary conditions are altered under
the transformation.
  We present a solution of the inverse problem in the case of general boundary
conditions using a Marchenko equation and discusss the specialisation to the
case of graph with trivial compact part, ie. diagonal matrix potential.

problem of electron transport in quantum networks. For quantum networks
constructed on the interface of narrow-gap semiconductors the relevant
scattering problem for the multi-dimensional Schoedinger equation may be
substituted by the corresponding problem on a one-dimensional linear graph with
proper selfadjoint boundary conditions at the nodes. However, realistic
boundary conditions for splittings have not yet been derived.
  Here we consider some compact domain attached to a few semi-infinite lines as
a model for a quantum network. An asymptotic formula for the scattering matrix
for this object is derived in terms of the properties of the compact domain.
This allows us to propose designs for devices for manipulating quantum current
through a splitting.

  One of the purposes of this paper is to sharpen some of the known results on

support of the covariogram, with arbitrarily small Lebesgue measure, such that
the covariogram, restricted to those subsets, identifies certain geometric
properties of the body. These results are more precise in the planar case, but
some of them, both positive and negative ones, are proved for bodies of any

Our motivations stem from applications in reliability and dependability,

the rate of fluctuation of the Markov chain goes to infinity, if the limit
distributions of suitably centered and scaled sequences of occupation measures
exist, what can be said about the convergence rate? By combining singular
perturbation techniques and probabilistic methods, this paper addresses the
issue by concentrating on sequences of centered and scaled functional

An optimal reading policy is one that yields a sequence $m_n$ that maximizes

the Galois action on its \'etale cohomology. We develop a theory of motivic
integration for formal schemes of pseudo-finite type over a complete discrete
valuation ring $R$, and we introduce the Weil generating series of a regular
formal $R$-scheme $\mathfrak{X}$ of pseudo-finite type, via the construction of
a Gelfand-Leray form on its generic fiber. Our trace formula yields a
cohomological interpretation of this Weil generating series.
  When $\mathfrak{X}$ is the formal completion of a morphism $f$ from a smooth
irreducible variety to the affine line, then its Weil generating series
coincides (modulo normalization) with the motivic zeta function of $f$. When
$\mathfrak{X}$ is the formal completion of $f$ at a closed point $x$ of the
special fiber $f^{-1}(0)$, we obtain the local motivic zeta function of $f$ at
$x$. In the latter case, the generic fiber of $\mathfrak{X}$ is the so-called
analytic Milnor fiber of $f$ at $x$; we show that it completely determines the
formal germ of $f$ at $x$.

part segmented in the horizontal direction and an hadronic part segmented into
four units in depth. In addition CMS will have access to data from a segmented
shower maximum detector being built for luminosity measurements. We will
present detailed results from tests beam measurements taken at the CERN SPS.
These data will be used to extrapolate the utility of the ZDCs to measure
photons, and possibly pi0s in p+p and ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions.
Data from the hadronic section can be used to estimate the number of
participants in heavy ion-collisions. In addition we will discuss plans to use
the detector to measure the reaction plane, thereby extending the sensitivity
of the central detectors in CMS.

describe a refined and extended version of the model that includes some of the
complex interactions between cells and their surrounding environment. The
present version takes into consideration several additional energy-consuming
biochemical pathways such as protein and DNA synthesis, the tuning of
extracellular pH and of the cell membrane potential. The control of the cell
cycle - that was previously modeled by means of ad hoc thresholds - has been
directly addressed here by considering checkpoints from proteins that act as
targets for phosphorylation on multiple sites. As simulated cells grow, they
can now modify the chemical composition of the surrounding environment which in
turn acts as a feedback mechanism to tune cell metabolism and hence cell
proliferation: in this way we obtain growth curves that match quite well those
observed in vitro with human leukemia cell lines. The model is strongly
constrained and returns results that can be directly compared with actual
experiments, because it uses parameter values in narrow ranges estimated from
experimental data, and in perspective we hope to utilize it to develop in
silico studies of the growth of very large tumor cell populations (10^6 cells
or more) and to support experimental research. In particular, the program is
used here to make predictions on the behaviour of cells grown in a glucose-poor

that using the set of maximum magnitudes (the set of T-maxima) in windows of
duration T days provides a significant improvement over existing methods, in
particular (i) by minimizing the negative impact of time-clustering of
foreshock / main shock /aftershock sequences in the estimation of the tail of
the magnitude distribution, and (ii) by providing via a simulation method
reliable estimates of the biases in the Moment estimation procedure (which
turns out to be more efficient than the Maximum Likelihood estimation). Using a
simulation method, we have determined the optimal window size of the T-maxima
to be T=500 days. We have estimated the following quantiles of the distribution
of T-maxima of earthquake magnitudes for the whole period 1977-2006:
Q_{0.16}(Mmax)=9.3, Q_{0.5}(Mmax)=9.7 and Q_{0.84}(Mmax)=10.3. Finally, we
suggest two more stable statistical characterristics of the tail of the
distribution of earthquake magnitudes: the quantile QT(q) of a high probability
level q for the T-maxima, and the probability of exceedence for a high
threshold magnitude. We obtained the following sample estimates for the global
Harvard catalog: QT(q=0.98)=8.6 +- 0.2 and a probability for the T-maxima to
exceed magnitude 8 equal to 0.13-0.20. The comparison between our estimates for

activities. External sensory stimuli influence this autonomous activity but
they do not drive the brain directly. Most standard artificial neural network
models are however input driven and do not show spontaneous activities.
  It constitutes a challenge to develop organizational principles for
controlled, self-sustained activity in artificial neural networks. Here we
propose and examine the dHAN concept for autonomous associative thought
processes in dense and homogeneous associative networks. An associative
thought-process is characterized, within this approach, by a time-series of
transient attractors. Each transient state corresponds to a stored information,
a memory. The subsequent transient states are characterized by large
associative overlaps, which are identical to acquired patterns. Memory states,
the acquired patterns, have such a dual functionality.
  In this approach the self-sustained neural activity has a central functional
role. The network acquires a discrimination capability, as external stimuli
need to compete with the autonomous activity. Noise in the input is readily
filtered-out.
  Hebbian learning of external patterns occurs coinstantaneous with the ongoing
associative thought process. The autonomous dynamics needs a long-term
working-point optimization which acquires within the dHAN concept a dual
functionality: It stabilizes the time development of the associative thought
process and limits runaway synaptic growth, which generically occurs otherwise
in neural networks with self-induced activities and Hebbian-type learning
rules.

space of general pure states and projective toric variety defines the space of
separable set of multi-qubits states. We also discuss in details the
construction of single-, two-, three-, and multi- qubits states. This
construction gives a very simple and elegant visual representation of the
geometrical structure of multipartite quantum systems.

mechanics with game theory by introducing non-classical resources such as
entanglement, quantum operations and quantum measurement. By transferring
two-player-two strategy (2x2) dilemma containing classical games into quantum
realm, dilemmas can be resolved in quantum pure strategies if entanglement is
distributed between the players who use quantum operations. Moreover, players
receive the highest sum of payoffs available in the game, which are otherwise
impossible in classical pure strategies. Encouraged by the observation of rich
dynamics of physical systems with many interacting parties and the power of
entanglement in quantum versions of 2x2 games, it became generally accepted
that quantum versions can be easily extended to N-player situations by simply
allowing N-partite entangled states. In this article, however, we show that
this is not generally true because the reproducibility of classical tasks in
quantum domain imposes limitations on the type of entanglement and quantum
operators. We propose a benchmark for the evaluation of quantum and classical
versions of games, and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a
physical realization. We give examples of entangled states that can and cannot
be used, and the characteristics of quantum operators used as strategies.

find mappings between Hamilton operators analogous to duality transformations
as well as exact characterizations of ground states employing non-Hermitean
eigenvalue equations and use this to motivate a generalization of the
stabilizer formalism to non-Hermitean operators. The resulting class of states
is larger than that of standard stabilizer states and allows for example for
continuous variation of local entropies rather than the discrete values taken
on stabilizer states and the exact description of certain ground states of
Hamilton operators.

devices on a smaller and faster scale than ever before. With increasing
miniaturization, quantum effects come to dominate the transport properties of
these devices, between collisions, carriers undergo ballistic motion under the
influence of local electric and magnetic fields. The often surprising
propertiesof quantum ballistic transport are currently elucidated in clean
atomic physics experiments. From a theoretical viewpoint, theelectron dynamics
is governed by ballistic propagators and Green functions, intriguing quantities
at the crossroads of classical and quantum mechanics. Here, we briefly describe
the propagator method, some ballistic Green functions, and their application in
a diverse range of problems in atomic and solid state physics, such as
photodetachment, atom lasers, scanning tunneling microscopy, and the quantum
Hall effect.
