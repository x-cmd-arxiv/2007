circumstellar envelope around AGB stars in a wide binary system to explore the
parameter dependence of the geometrical characteristics of column density
patterns. An AGB star in a wide binary system is considered as a 3-D piston
model that can induce a 3-D quasi-spherical density structure in the
circumstellar envelope by orbital motion of the AGB star. The column density
pattern only depends on two parameters: eccentricity of the orbit e and the
terminal outflow velocity to mean orbital velocity ratio gamma. When viewed
perpendicular to the orbital plane, spiral, broken spiral, and incomplete
concentric shell patterns can be seen, while when viewed along the orbital
plane, alternative concentric half-shell, egg-shell, and half-shell half-gap
patterns will develop. Non-zero eccentricity causes asymmetry, while larger
gamma makes a weaker pattern and helps bring out asymmetry. A spiral pattern
may becomes broken when e > 0.4. The spiral center is always less than 12% of
spiral pitch away from the orbit center. One should have more chances (~ 80%)
seeing spiral-like patterns than seeing concentric shells (~ 20%) in the
circumstellar envelope of wide binary AGB stars.

(extragalactic and pulsars) for periods of weeks to months have been denoted
Extreme Scattering Events (ESE's) by Fiedler et al. (1987). Presently, there is
no astrophysical mechanism that satisfactorily produces this phenomenon. In
this paper, we conjecture that inhomogeneities of the electronic density in the
turbulent interstellar medium might be the origin of this phenomenon. We have
tested this conjecture by a simulation of the scintillation of the pulsar
B1937+21 at 1.4 GHz and 1.7 GHz for a period of six months. To this end, we
have constructed a large square Kolmogorov phase screen made of 131k x 131k
pixels with electron inhomogeneity scales ranging from 6 x $10^6$ m to
$10^{12}$ m and used the Kirchhoff-Fresnel integral to simulate dynamic spectra
of a pulsar within the framework of Physical Optics.
  The simulated light curves exhibit a 10 day long variation simultaneously at
1.41 and 1.7 GHz that is alike the ``ESE'' observed with the Nancay
radiotelescope toward the pulsar B1937+21 in October 1989. Consequently, we
conclude that ``ESE'' toward pulsars can be caused naturally by the turbulence
in the ionized interstellar medium instead of invoking the crossing of discrete
over pressured ionized clouds on the line of sight as in the model of Fiedler
et al. (1987). We suggest that longer events could occur in a simulation of
scintillation, if larger electron inhomogeneities > $10^{12}$ m were included
in the construction of the Kolmogorov phase screen. This next step requires a
supercomputer.

interacts with MRI-driven turbulence and galactic shear to produce a network of
cold, dense, filamentary clouds embedded in a warm diffuse ambient medium. This
structure strongly resembles the morphology of HI gas observed in the 21 cm
line. There is significant thermally-unstable gas, but the density and
temperature distributions retain the twin peaks of the classical two-phase ISM.
We analyze the vertical distributions of density and various pressure terms,

gas increase as the cold mass fraction decreases, but are generally low ~1-3
km/s near the midplane; they increase to > 5 km/s at high z. Finally, we argue
that in the outer parts of galactic disks, MRI is likely able to prevent the
development of self-gravitating instabilities and hence suppress star

assumption of LTE, the low atmospheric temperatures of very metal-poor 3D model
atmospheres cause the lines from neutral species and molecules to appear
stronger than in 1D. Therefore, elemental abundances derived from these lines
using 3D models are significantly lower than according to 1D analyses.
Differences between 3D and 1D abundances of C, N, and O derived from CH, NH,

dex for the the red giant stars at [Fe/H]=-3 considered here. At this

of polycrystalline solidification and associated crystal pattern formation at
relatively long timescales. This late stage growth regime, which is not
accessible by molecular dynamics, involves nucleation at the growth front to
create new crystal grains in addition to the effects of primary nucleation.
Finally, we consider the limit of extreme polycrystalline growth, where the
disordering effect due to prolific grain formation leads to isotropic growth
patterns at long times, i.e., spherulite formation. Our model of spherulite
growth exhibits branching at fixed grain misorientations, induced by the
inclusion of a metastable minimum in the orientational free energy. It is
demonstrated that a broad variety of spherulitic patterns can be recovered by

Here we compare two potentials with short-range soft-core repulsion and narrow
attraction. One of them is a squared potential that is known to have
liquid-liquid phase transition, ending in a critical point, and no anomaly in
density. The normal, monotonic, behavior of density for isobaric cooling is
surprising if compared with molecular liquids, such as water, where a
hypothetical critical point is proposed as rationale for the anomalous behavior
of density. The second potential is a continuous version of the first. We show
that the phase diagram associated to this new potential has, not only the
liquid-liquid phase transition, but also the density anomaly. Our result,
therefore, shows that the behavior in density is strongly dependent on the
derivative of the potential.

$s$ is a parameter which determines the class of cyclic codes in question, $q$

$k$ is the dimension of the code. We also provide an overview of cyclotomic

the cosmological parameters. While the ""preponderance of evidence"" certainly
suggests an accelerating universe, we would argue that (based on the supernova

part of the analysis we develop two particularly transparent graphical
representations of the redshift-distance relation -- representations in which
acceleration versus deceleration reduces to the question of whether the graph
slopes up or down.
  Turning to the details of the cosmographic fits, three issues in particular
concern us: First, the fitted value for the deceleration parameter changes
significantly depending on whether one performs a chi^2 fit to the luminosity
distance, proper motion distance, angular diameter distance, or other suitable
distance surrogate. Second, the fitted value for the deceleration parameter
changes significantly depending on whether one uses the traditional redshift
variable z, or what we shall argue is on theoretical grounds an improved
parameterization y=z/(1+z). Third, the published estimates for systematic
uncertainties are sufficiently large that they certainly impact on, and to a
large extent undermine, the usual purely statistical tests of significance. We
conclude that the case for an accelerating universe is considerably less
watertight than commonly believed.

Thus Hubble damping will be ineffective in bringing the Affleck-Dine field into
the lepton conserving region near the origin, leaving the possibility that the
lepton number could be washed out. Previously, we suggested that preheating
could damp the amplitude of the Affleck-Dine field allowing conservation of the
lepton number. In this paper, we demonstrate numerically that preheating does
efficiently damp the amplitude of the Affleck-Dine field and that the lepton
number is conserved as the result. In addition to demonstrating a crucial

that the loops that do not touch the boundary have fugacity n in [-2,2], while
the loops touching at least once the boundary are given different fugacity y.

Neumann (y=n) and Dirichlet (y=1) boundary conditions as particular cases. Here
we consider the dense phase of the loop gas, where we compute the two-point

the bulk curvature ($\om$). They also depend on whether the 4D momentum is
space-like or time-like. Their behaviours are graphically presented and the
Z$_2$ symmetry, the ""brane"" formation and the singularities are examined. It is
shown that the use of absolute functions is important for properly treating the
singular behaviour. The extra coordinate appears as a {\it directed} one like
the temperature. The $\delta(0)$ problem, which is an important consistency
check of the bulk-boundary system, is solved {\it without} the use of
KK-expansion. The relation between P/M propagator (a closed expression which
takes into account {\it all} KK-modes) and the KK-expansion-series propagator
is clarified. In this process of comparison, two views on the extra space
naturally come up: orbifold picture and interval (boundary) picture.
Sturm-Liouville expansion (a generalized Fourier expansion) is essential there.
Both 5D flat and warped quantum systems are formulated by the Dirac's bra and
ket vector formalism, which shows the warped model can be regarded as a {\it

string theory side. We argue that a necessary condition for planar equivalence
to hold is the absence of a closed string tachyonic mode in the dual
non-supersymmetric string. We analyze several gauge theories on R3xS1. In the
specific case of U(N) theories with symmetric/anti-symmetric fermions
('orientifold field theories') the relevant closed string theory is
tachyon-free at large compactification radius (due to winding modes), but it
develops a tachyonic mode below a critical radius. Our finding is with
agreement with field theory expectations of a phase transition from a C-parity
violating phase to a C-parity preserving phase as the compactification radius
increases. In the case of U(N)xU(N) theories with bi-fundamental matter
('orbifold field theories') a tachyon is always present in the string spectrum,
at any compactification radius. We conclude that on R4 planar equivalence holds
for 'orientfiold field theories', but fails for 'orbifold field theories'
daughters of N=4 SYM and suggest the same for daughters of N=1 SYM. We also
discuss examples of SO/Sp gauge theories with symmetric/anti-symmetric
fermions. In this case planar equivalence holds at any compactification radius

scalar field, first with a hard cutoff and then with high frequency dispersion,
both imposed in a frame that falls freely across the horizon. Using WKB
methods, we find that S_E is finite for a hard cutoff or super-luminal
dispersion, because the mode oscillations do not diverge at the horizon and the
contribution of high transverse momenta is cut off by the angular momentum
barrier. For sub-luminal dispersion the entropy depends on the behavior at
arbitrarily high transverse momenta. In all cases it scales with the horizon
area. For the hard cutoff it is linear in the cutoff, rather than quadratic.
This discrepancy from the familiar result arises from the difference between
the free-fall frame and the static frame in which a cutoff is usually imposed.
In the super-luminal case the entropy scales with a fractional power of the
cutoff that depends on the index of the dispersion relation. Implications for
the possible relation between regularized entanglement entropy and the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy are discussed.

the spectrum, a statistical indicator widely used both in experiments and in

injection mechanism, the advecting velocity here being statistically
homogeneous and isotropic. Our main results can be summarized as follows. 1)
For a very large velocity integral scale, a pure scaling behaviour in the
distance between the two points emerges only if their separation is much
smaller than their distance from the point source. 2) The value we have found
for the scaling exponent suggests the existence of a direct cascade, in spite
of the fact that here the forcing integral scale is formally set to zero. 3)
The combined effect of a finite inertial-range extension and of inhomogeneities
causes the emergence of subleading anisotropic corrections to the leading
isotropic term, that we have quantified and discussed.

experimental studies have been carried out to determine the effects of
inhomogeneities in cardiac tissue on such arrhythmias. We give a brief overview

particles in \textit{thermal equilibrium} are studied from both statistical and
wave resonance perspectives. It is shown that, even in a strongly nonlinear
regime, the chain in thermal equilibrium can be effectively described by a
system of weakly interacting \textit{renormalized} nonlinear waves that possess
(i) the Rayleigh-Jeans distribution and (ii) zero correlations between waves,
just as noninteracting free waves would. This renormalization is achieved
through a set of canonical transformations. The renormalized linear dispersion
of these renormalized waves is obtained and shown to be in excellent agreement
with numerical experiments. Moreover, a dynamical interpretation of the
renormalization of the dispersion relation is provided via a self-consistency,
mean-field argument. It turns out that this renormalization arises mainly from
the trivial resonant wave interactions, i.e., interactions with no momentum
exchange. Furthermore, using a multiple time-scale, statistical averaging
method, we show that the interactions of near-resonant waves give rise to the
broadening of the resonance peaks in the frequency spectrum of renormalized
modes. The theoretical prediction for the resonance width for the thermalized
$\beta$-FPU chain is found to be in very good agreement with its numerically
measured value.

(REFERENCE) to obtain the coefficients of the analytical formula using the
experimental Qalpha values (the DSR-E formula), as well as the finite range
droplet model (FRDM) derived Qalpha values (the FRDMFRDM formula). The
predictive accuracy of these formulae were checked against the experimental
alpha half-lives of an independent set of nuclei (TEST) that span approximately
the same Z,A region as the standards and possess reliable alpha spectroscopic
data, and were found to yield good results for the DSR-E formula but not for
the FRDM-FRDM formula. The two formulae were used to obtain the alpha
half-lives of super-heavy (SHE) and heavy nuclides where the relative accuracy
was found to markedly improve for the FRDM-FRDM, which corroborates the
appropriateness of the FRDM masses and the GLDM prescription for high Z,A
nuclides. Further improvement resulted, especially for the FRDM-FRDM formula,
after a simple linear optimization over the calculated and experimental
half-lives of TEST was used to re-calculate the half-lives of the SHE and heavy
nuclides. The advantage of this optimization was that it required no
recalculation of the coefficients of the basic DSR-E or FRDM-FRDM formulae. The
halflives for 324 medium-mass to super-heavy alpha decaying nuclides,
calculated using these formulae and the comparison with experimental
half-lives, are presented.

  in PRE",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.76.016704",,"physics.comp-ph cond-mat.stat-mech physics.data-an",,"  The efficiency of Monte Carlo samplers is dictated not only by energetic
effects, such as large barriers, but also by entropic effects that are due to
the sheer volume that is sampled. The latter effects appear in the form of an
entropic mismatch or divergence between the direct and reverse trial moves. We
provide lower and upper bounds for the average acceptance probability in terms
of the Renyi divergence of order 1/2. We show that the asymptotic finitude of
the entropic divergence is the necessary and sufficient condition for
non-vanishing acceptance probabilities in the limit of large dimensions.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the upper bound is reasonably tight by showing
that the exponent is asymptotically exact for systems made up of a large number
of independent and identically distributed subsystems. For the last statement,
we provide an alternative proof that relies on the reformulation of the
acceptance probability as a large deviation problem. The reformulation also
leads to a class of low-variance estimators for strongly asymmetric
distributions. We show that the entropy divergence causes a decay in the
average displacements with the number of dimensions n that are simultaneously
updated. For systems that have a well-defined thermodynamic limit, the decay is
demonstrated to be n^{-1/2} for random-walk Monte Carlo and n^{-1/6} for Smart
Monte Carlo (SMC). Numerical simulations of the LJ_38 cluster show that SMC is
virtually as efficient as the Markov chain implementation of the Gibbs sampler,
which is normally utilized for Lennard-Jones clusters. An application of the
entropic inequalities to the parallel tempering method demonstrates that the
number of replicas increases as the square root of the heat capacity of the
system.

isotopes obtained via projectile fragmentation and in-flight separation into
low-energy beams. These beams allow ISOL-type experiments, such as mass
measurements with traps or laser spectroscopy, to be performed with projectile
fragmentation products. Current gas stopper systems for high-energy beams are
based on linear gas cells filled with 0.1-1 bar of helium. While already used
successfully for experiments, it was found that space charge effects induced by
the ionization of the helium atoms during the stopping process pose a limit on
the maximum beam rate that can be used. Furthermore, the extraction time of
stopped ions from these devices can exceed 100 ms causing substantial decay
losses for very short-lived isotopes. To avoid these limitations, a new type of
gas stopper is being developed at the NSCL/MSU. The new system is based on a
cyclotron-type magnet with a stopping chamber filled with Helium buffer gas at
low pressure. RF-guiding techniques are used to extract the ions. The space
charge effects are considerably reduced by the large volume and due to a
separation between the stopping region and the region of highest ionization.
Cyclotron gas stopper systems of different sizes and with different magnetic
field strengths and field shapes are presently investigated.

Starting from the Smith-Waterman similarity score, we define for each edge a
weight w to measure the similarity distance between two nodes. Keeping only
edges with a weigth greater than a minimal w_min, and by varying w_min we build
a family of networks with different degree of similarity. We investigate the
distribution of connected components (clusters) of the networks at different
w_min and in particular we find a behaviour similar to a phase transition
guided by the formation of a giant component. Moreover we study selected
sequence features and protein domains of protein pairs that connect different
clusters in the networks at different level of similarity. We observed
specific, non-random distributions of the protein features and domains for

techniques have been proposed, including multi-port detection and time-division

when using non-number resolving detectors. In this paper we focus on 2-port
detection, the simplest such scheme. We show that by making the 2-port device
