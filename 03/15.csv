characterisation of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars among the members of Galactic
young clusters. The observations of 10 southern clusters, nine of them located
in the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm of the Milky Way are presented. We aim at
listing candidate PMS member stars in young clusters. The catalogued stars will
serve as a basis for future spectroscopic studies of individual objects to
determine the properties of stellar formation in the last phases before the
main sequence stage. Properties such as the presence of residual envelopes or
disks, age spread among PMS members, and the possible presence of several
episodes of star formation in the clusters, are to be addressed.
  Multicolour photometry in the UBVRcIc system has been obtained for 10
southern young clusters in the fourth Galactic quadrant, located between
Galactic longitudes l=238 and l=310. For six clusters in the sample, the
observations presented here provide the first published study based on CCD
photometry. A quantitative comparison is performed with post-MS isochrones, and
PMS isochrones from three different evolutionary models are used in the
photometric membership analysis for possible PMS stars. The observations
produce photometric indices in the Johnson-Cousins photometric systems for a
total of 26962 stars. Matching with the 2MASS data base provides astrometric
calibration for all stars, and JHK 2MASS indices for 60 per cent of them.
Post-MS cluster ages range from 4 to 60 Myr, whereas the photometric membership
analysis assigns PMS membership to a total of 842 stars, covering an age range
between 1 and 10 Myr. A catalogue, named DAY-I, with the information on the PMS
candidate members has been ellaborated.

shows that the HON-M_{500} relation does not evolve significantly between z = 0

significant tidal-stripping in high-density regions as seen in numerical

removed during the process. The total K-band cluster light (L_{200,K}) and
K-band selected richness (parameterized by B_{gc,K}) are also correlated with
both the cluster T_{x} and M_{200}. The total (intrinsic) scatter in the

richness (B_{gc}). Examination of the mass-to-light ratios of the clusters
shows that similar to local clusters, the K-band mass-to-light ratio is an
increasing function of halo mass. Using the K-band mass-to-light ratios of the

lines in X-ray binaries, including the NeII, NeIII, NeIX, OVII, and OVIII

observations, as expected if these lines originate in the hot interstellar
medium. No evidence was found that the lines were blueshifted, again supporting
the interstellar medium origin, though this may be due to poor statistics.
There is apparent variability in the OVIII Ly-alpha line equivalent width
providing some evidence that at least some of the OVIII absorption arises
within the system. However, the significance is marginal (2.4-sigma), and the
lack of variation in the other lines casts some doubt on the reality of the
variability. From calculating the equivalent hydrogen column densities for a
range of Doppler parameters, we find they are consistent with the interstellar
origin of the lines. Additionally we fit the spectra with photoionization
models for locally absorbing material, and find that they can reproduce the

conclude that both the ISM and local absorption remain possible for the origin

content is then followed using halo merger trees extracted from N-body
simulations. Our models are differentiated only in the fate assigned to
satellite galaxies once subhalos, within which satellites are embedded,
disrupt. These models are confronted with the observed evolution in the massive
end of the GSMF, the z~0 brightest cluster galaxy (BCG)-cluster mass relation,
and the combined BCG and intracluster light (ICL) luminosity distribution --
all observables expected to evolve approximately dissipationlessly since z=1.
The combined observational constraints favor a model in which the vast majority
(>80%) of satellite stars from disrupted subhalos go into the ICL. Conversely,
models that leave behind a significant population of satellite galaxies once
the subhalo has disrupted are strongly disfavored, as are models that put a
significant fraction of satellite stars into the BCG. Our results show that
observations of the ICL provide useful and unique constraints on models of

The new parameter, \varpi, is the cosmological analog of \gamma, the

curvature per unit mass. In the cosmological context, \varpi measures the
difference between the Newtonian and longitudinal potentials in response to the
same matter sources, as occurs in certain scalar-tensor theories of gravity.
Equivalently, \varpi measures the scalar shear fluctuation in a dark energy

\varpi signals a departure from GR or a fluctuating cosmological constant.
Using a phenomenological model for the time evolution \varpi=\varpi_0

HIRES/Keck and UVES/VLT quasar spectra. We found a 3.1 sigma correlation
between galaxy morphological asymmetries normalized by the quasar-galaxy
projected separations, A/D, and the MgII rest-frame equivalent widths.
Saturation effects cause increased scatter in the relationship with increasing
W_r(2796). We defined a subsample for which the fraction of saturated pixels in
the absorption profiles is f_sat<0.5. The correlation strengthened to 3.3
sigma. We also find a paucity of small morphological asymmetries for galaxies

the two samples are drawn from the same galaxy population is ruled out at a

between the processes that perturb galaxies and the quantity of gas in their
halos, normalized by the impact parameter. Since the perturbations are minor,
it is clear that dramatic processes or events are not required for a galaxy to
have an extended halo; the galaxies appear ""normal"". We suggest that common,
more mild processes that populate halos with gas, such as satellite galaxy
merging, accretion of the local cosmic web, and longer-range galaxy-galaxy
interactions, consequently also induce the observed minor perturbations in the

Methods: Treating the propagation of both the deflagration and the detonation

crossing ash regions. Results: Our criterion triggers the detonation wave at
the outer edge of the deflagration flame and consequently it has to sweep
around the complex structure and to compete with expansion. Despite the impeded
detonation propagation, the obtained explosions show reasonable agreement with
global quantities of observed type Ia supernovae. By igniting the flame in
different numbers of kernels around the center of the exploding white dwarf, we
set up three different models shifting the emphasis from the deflagration phase

angular momentum in hot halo gas and the hierarchical build-up of dark matter,
leading to theoretically generated systems where the evolution of surface

spikes that are produced as a result of individual collisional events. The lack
of solid state features indicate that, generally, the dust in these disks have
sizes larger than approximately 10 microns, but exceptionally, strong silicate
features in some disks suggest the presence of large quantities of small
grains, thought to be the result of recent collisions. Spatially resolved
observations of debris disks show a diversity of structural features, such as
inner cavities, warps, offsets, brightness asymmetries, spirals, rings and
clumps. There is growing evidence that, in some cases, these structures are the
result of the dynamical perturbations of a massive planet. Our Solar System
also harbors a debris disk and some of its properties resemble those of
extra-solar debris disks. From the cratering record, we can infer that its dust
mass has decayed with time, and that there was at least one major ``spike'' in
the past during the Late Heavy Bombardment. This offers a unique opportunity to
use extra-solar debris disks to shed some light in how the Solar System might
have looked in the past. Similarly, our knowledge of the Solar System is
influencing our understanding of the types of processes which might be at play
in the extra-solar debris disks.

have found a nearly linear relation between the peak flux during the low/hard

flux peak of the latest LH state identified in the previous outburst. Assuming
that the rate at which mass accumulates in the accretion disk between these
peaks is constant and that any mass that remains in the disk after an outburst
has a negligible effect on the next outburst, this nearly linear relation
suggests that the peak flux during the LH state that occurs at the beginning of
an outburst is related to the mass in the disk, and thus that the entire disk
is probably involved in powering these LH states. We have also found a positive
correlation between the peak luminosities of the LH state in the three recent
outbursts of {GX 339$-$4} and the peak luminosities of the following HS state.
This correlation is similar to the correlations reported previously for {Aql
X$-$1}, {4U 1705$-$44}, and {XTE J1550$-$564}, providing further support that
the accretion flow that powers the LH state is related to the accretion flow
that powers the following HS state. Although the luminosity of the LH-to-HS
transition varies by up to an order of magnitude, the neutron stars and the
black holes are distinguishable in the state transition luminosity. We discuss
the implications for the mass determination of the compact stars in the

fits are often found at high-z, their resulting bright absolute magnitudes, the

similar to our EROs, is more likely a dusty starburst at z~2.3-2.6. This
interpretation also naturally explains the observed 24 micron emission. Both
empirically and from our SED fits we find that the IRAC selectec EROs from Yan

excess (UV-upturn) is probably caused by an old population of helium-burning

subdwarfs (helium burning stars) and the model can reproduce the observations

population synthesis, we have obtained an {\it a priori} model for the
UV-upturn of elliptical galaxies. The model shows that the UV-upturn is most
likely resulted from binary interactions and it is universal (not very much
metallicity-dependant) in ellipticals. This has major implications for
understanding the evolution of the UV-upturn and elliptical galaxies in
general; contrary to previous postulates, it implies that the UV-upturn is not
a sign of age, but could be a potentially powerful indicator for a recent minor
burst of star-forming activity.

range of near-infrared adaptive optics and the deep V-band images of the
circumstellar envelope of IRC+10216 using high angular resolution, collected
with the VLT/NACO and FORS1 instruments. Results: .From the near-infrared
observations, we present maps of the sub-arcsecond structures, or clumps, in
the innermost regions. The morphology of these clumps is found to strongly vary
from J- to L-band. Their relative motion appears to be more complex than
proposed in earlier works: they can be weakly accelerated, have a constant
velocity, or even be motionless with respect to one another. From V-band
imaging, we present a high spatial resolution map of the shell distribution in
the outer layers of IRC+10216. Shells are resolved well up to a distance of
about 90'' to the core of the nebula and most of them appear to be composed of
thinner elongated shells. Finally, by combining the NACO and FORS1 images, a
global view is present to show both the extended layers and the bipolar core of
the nebula together with the real size of the inner clumps. Conclusions: .This
study confirms the rather complex nature of the IRC+10216 circumstellar

structures with very different morphologies (clumps, bipolarity, and almost
spherical external layers) is very puzzling. This confirms that the formation
of AGB winds is far more complex than usually assumed in current models.

dependence of clustering in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. First, we find that
the relation between clustering strength and density is not monotonic: galaxies
in the densest regions are more strongly clustered than are galaxies in regions
of moderate overdensity; galaxies in moderate overdensities are more strongly
clustered than are those in moderate underdensities; but galaxies in moderate
underdensities are less clustered than galaxies in the least dense regions. We
argue that this is natural if clustering evolved gravitationally from a
Gaussian field, since the highest peaks and lowest troughs in Gaussian fields
are similarly clustered. The precise non-monotonic dependence of galaxy
clustering on density is very well reproduced in a mock catalog which is based
on a halo-model decomposition of galaxy clustering.
  Second, the distribution of galaxy counts in our sample is rather well
described by a Poisson cluster model. We show that, despite their Poisson
nature, correlations with environment are expected in such models. More
remarkably, the expected trends are very like those in standard models of halo
bias, despite the fact that correlations with environment in these models arise
purely from the fact that dense regions are dense because they happen to host
more massive halos. This is in contrast to the usual analysis which assumes
that it is the large scale environment which determines the halo mass function.

interstellar gas (Av<1) but it is traditionally assumed to deplete on dust
grains at higher densities and larger Av. Photodissociation regions (PDRs) are
an interesting intermediate medium between translucent and dark clouds where
the chemistry and energetics are dominated by the illuminating FUV radiation
field. Thus they can provide new insights about the sulfur depletion problem.
However, physical and chemical gradients in PDRs take place at small angular
scales (~1 to 10''). Aperture synthesis observations are therefore required to
resolve such gradients. Besides, a complete understanding of molecular
excitation is needed to correctly determine molecular abundances but also the
preavailing physical conditions. Hence, multi-J observations at increasing
frequencies are also required. Such high angular resolution and broad frequency
coverage observations will be provided by ALMA in the near future. In this work

  Methods: The eleven clusters in our sample are all X-ray luminous and span a
narrow redshift range at z=0.21 +/- 0.04. The weak lensing analysis of the
sample is based on ground-based wide-field imaging obtained with the CFH12k
camera on CFHT. We use the methodology developed and applied previously on the
massive cluster Abell 1689. A Bayesian method, implemented in the Im2shape
software, is used to fit the shape parameters of the faint background galaxies
and to correct for PSF smearing. With the present data, shear profiles are
measured in all clusters out to at least 2 Mpc (more than 15arcmin from the
center) with high confidence. The radial shear profiles are fitted with
different parametric mass profiles and the virial mass M_200 is estimated for
each cluster and then compared to other physical properties.
  Results: Scaling relations between mass and optical luminosity indicate an
increase of the M/L ratio with luminosity and a L_X-M_200 relation scaling as
L_X \propto M_200^(0.83 +/- 0.11) while the normalization of the M_200 \propto
T_X^{3/2} relation is close to the one expected from hydrodynamical simulations
of cluster formation as well as previous X-ray analyses. We suggest that the
dispersion in the M_200-T_X and M_200-L_X relations reflects the different
merging and dynamical histories for clusters of similar X-ray luminosities and
intrinsic variations in their measured masses. Improved statistics of clusters
over a wider mass range are required for a better control of the intrinsic
scatter in scaling relations.

Besides being a simple model for a molecular network forming liquid, the PMW is
representative of patchy proteins and novel colloidal particles interacting
with localized directional short-range attractions. We show that the gas-liquid
phase separation is metastable, i.e. it takes place in the region of the phase
diagram where the crystal phase is thermodynamically favored, as in the case of
articles interacting via short-range attractive spherical potentials.
Differently from spherical potentials, we do not observe crystallization close
to the critical point. The region of gas-liquid instability of this patchy
model is significantly reduced as compared to equivalent models of spherically
interacting particles, confirming the possibility of observing kinetic arrest
in an homogeneous sample driven by bonding as opposed to packing.

spin-degeneracy is a generic feature of all studied QPC structures (both very
short and very long ones; with the lengths in the range 40<l<500 nm). The
calculated conductance also shows a hysteresis for forward- and backward sweeps
of the gate voltage. These features in the conductance can be traced to the
formation of weakly coupled quasi-bound states (magnetic impurities) inside the
QPC (also predicted in previous DFT-based studies). A comparison of obtained
results with the experimental data shows however, that while the spin-DFT based
""first-principle"" calculations exhibits the spin polarization in the QPC, the
calculated conductance clearly does not reproduce the 0.7 anomaly observed in
almost all QPCs of various geometries. We critically examine major features of
the standard DFT-based approach to the conductance calculations and argue that
its inability to reproduce the 0.7 anomaly might be related to the infamous
derivative discontinuity problem of the DFT leading to spurious
self-interaction errors not corrected in the standard LDA. Our results indicate
that the formation of the magnetic impurities in the QPC might be an artefact
of the LDA when localization of charge is expected to occur. We thus argue that

x $\le$ 0.2) based on small angle neutron scattering experiments as well as the
occurrence of staircase-like hysteresis cycles during very low temperature (100
mK) magnetization measurements. An unusual feature is the observation of
long-range ferromagnetic order below the cluster-glass transition without any
indication of a sharp transition at a Curie temperature. These observations
strongly support a phenomenological model where a percolative process connects
the cluster-glass state observed at high temperatures with the long-range
ferromagnetic order observed by neutron diffraction experiments at very low
temperatures. The model can account for all the puzzling macroscopic and
microscopic data previously obtained in this system, providing a new
perspective with regard to the magnetic ground state of other alloyed compounds
with small magnetic moments or weak ferromagnetism with intrinsic disorder
effects.

thermodynamic functions, e.g., of the canonical free energy. Given a certain
physical system, it is of interest to understand which properties of the system
account for the presence of a phase transition, and an understanding of these
properties may lead to a deeper understanding of the physical phenomenon. One
possible approach of this issue, reviewed and discussed in the present paper,
is the study of topology changes in configuration space which, remarkably, are
found to be related to equilibrium phase transitions in classical statistical
mechanical systems. For the study of configuration space topology, one
considers the subsets M_v, consisting of all points from configuration space
with a potential energy per particle equal to or less than a given v. For
finite systems, topology changes of M_v are intimately related to nonanalytic
points of the microcanonical entropy (which, as a surprise to many, do exist).
In the thermodynamic limit, a more complex relation between nonanalytic points
of thermodynamic functions (i.e., phase transitions) and topology changes is
observed. For some class of short-range systems, a topology change of the M_v
at v=v_t was proved to be necessary for a phase transition to take place at a
potential energy v_t. In contrast, phase transitions in systems with long-range
interactions or in systems with non-confining potentials need not be
accompanied by such a topology change. Instead, for such systems the
nonanalytic point in a thermodynamic function is found to have some
maximization procedure at its origin. These results may foster insight into the
mechanisms which lead to the occurrence of a phase transition, and thus may
help to explore the origin of this physical phenomenon.

and use stock numerical abstract domains to find an overapproximation of all
possible memory states--with the ability to discover relationships between
variables. A main novelty of our approach is the dynamic mapping scheme we use
to associate a flat collection of abstract cells of scalar type to the set of
accessed memory locations, while taking care of byte-level aliases - i.e., C
variables with incompatible types allocated in overlapping memory locations. We
do not rely on static type information which can be misleading in C programs as
it does not account for all the uses a memory zone may be put to. Our work was
incorporated within the Astr\'{e}e static analyzer that checks for the absence
of run-time-errors in embedded, safety-critical, numerical-intensive software.
It replaces the former memory domain limited to well-typed, union-free,
pointer-cast free data-structures. Early results demonstrate that this
abstraction allows analyzing a larger class of C programs, without much cost
overhead.

closure has the same power as deterministic automata walking on their input
with k heads, additionally using a finite set of nested pebbles. This result is
valid for strings, ordered trees, and in general for families of graphs having
a fixed automaton that can be used to traverse the nodes of each of the graphs

and continuum extrapolation, we find that our quenched results for the
scattering phase shifts in this channel are consistent with the experimental
data when the three-momentum of the pion is below 300MeV. Agreement is also
found when compared with previous theoretical results from lattice and other

matrix of this process is a linear function the law of the process, and not a
quadratic one, as in the McKean-Vlasov model. The main goal of the paper is to
construct an easily simulable diffusive interacting particle system, converging
towards this nonlinear process and to obtain an explicit pathwise rate.
  This requires to find a significant coupling between finitely many Brownian
motions and the infinite dimensional white noise process. The key idea will be
to construct the right Brownian motions by pushing forward the white noise
processes, through the Brenier map realizing the optimal transport between the
law of the nonlinear process, and the empirical measure of independent copies
of it. A striking problem then is to establish the joint measurability of this
optimal transport map with respect to the space variable and the parameters
(time and randomness) making the marginals vary. We shall prove a general
measurability result for the mass transportation problem in terms of the
support of the transfert plans, in the sense of set-valued mappings. This will
allow us to construct the coupling and to obtain explicit convergence rates.

The free law of the field is specified by the density

$\mathbb{R}^N$, where $\Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian and we allow for a
very large class of potentials $V(\cdot)$. The interaction with the defect line

touches the x-axis. We call this model the pinning model. We consider a second
model, the wetting model, in which, in addition to the pinning reward, the
field is also constrained to stay nonnegative. We show that both models undergo
a phase transition as the intensity $\varepsilon$ of the pinning reward varies:
both in the pinning ($a=\mathrm{p}$) and in the wetting ($a=\mathrm{w}$) case,
there exists a critical value $\varepsilon_c^a$ such that when
$\varepsilon>\varepsilon_c^a$ the field touches the defect line a positive
fraction of times (localization), while this does not happen for
$\varepsilon<\varepsilon_c^a$ (delocalization). The two critical values are
nontrivial and distinct: $0<\varepsilon_c^{\mat
hrm{p}}<\varepsilon_c^{\mathrm{w}}<\infty$, and they are the only
nonanalyticity points of the respective free energies. For the pinning model
the transition is of second order, hence the field at
$\varepsilon=\varepsilon_c^{\mathrm{p}}$ is delocalized. On the other hand, the
transition in the wetting model is of first order and for
$\varepsilon=\varepsilon_c^{\mathrm{w}}$ the field is localized. The core of
our approach is a Markov renewal theory description of the field.

They consist of upwards of hundreds of thousands of two-dimensional CCD frames

target information, superposed on background and instrumental effects, is
contained only in a subset of pixels (Fabry Images, defocussed images,

resolving linear correlations of target and background pixel intensities. This
stepwise multiple linear regression removes only those target variations which
are also detected in the background. The advantage of regression analysis
versus background subtraction is the appropriate scaling, taking into account
that the amount of contamination may differ from pixel to pixel. The
multivariate solution for all pairs of target/background pixels is minimally
invasive of the raw photometry while being very effective in reducing
contamination due to, e.g., stray light. The technique is tested and
demonstrated with both simulated oscillation signals and real MOST photometry.

the False-Alarm Probability introduced by Lomb and Scargle is an approximation
which becomes less reliable in time series with longer data gaps. A rigorous
statistical treatment of how to determine the significance of a peak in a DFT,
called SigSpec, is presented here. SigSpec is based on an analytical solution
of the probability that a DFT peak of a given amplitude does not arise from
white noise in a non-equally spaced data set. The underlying Probability
Density Function (PDF) of the amplitude spectrum generated by white noise can
be derived explicitly if both frequency and phase are incorporated into the
solution. In this paper, I define and evaluate an unbiased statistical
estimator, the ""spectral significance"", which depends on frequency, amplitude,
and phase in the DFT, and which takes into account the time-domain sampling. I
also compare this estimator to results from other well established techniques
and demonstrate the effectiveness of SigSpec with a few examples of ground- and
space-based photometric data, illustratring how SigSpec deals with the effects

However, the intrinsic stochasticity and the dynamically-built in correlations

system that consists of three components. To date, no study has assessed all of
these components for the same animal model and within a given situation.
Previous studies have determined that the acquired immunity of common eiders
(Somateria mollissima) is suppressed during incubation. The present paper aims
to assess the innate immune response in fasting eiders in relation to their
initial body condition. Innate immunity was assessed by measuring plasma nitric
oxide (NO) levels, prior to and after injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a
method which is easily applicable to many wild animals. Body condition index
and corticosterone levels were subsequently determined as indicators of body
condition and stress level prior to LPS injection. The innate immune response
in eiders did not vary significantly throughout the incubation period. The
innate immune response of eiders did not vary significantly in relation to
their initial body condition but decreased significantly when corticosterone
levels increased. However, NO levels after LPS injection were significantly and
positively related to initial body condition, while there was a significant
negative relationship with plasma corticosterone levels. Our study suggests
that female eiders preserve an effective innate immune response during
incubation and this response might be partially determined by the initial body
condition.

single photon source or an entangled photon source in quantum key distribution

the other hand, a model and a post-processing protocol for the entanglement PDC
QKD are still missing. In this paper, we fill in this important gap by
proposing such a model and a post-processing protocol for the entanglement PDC
QKD. Although the PDC model is proposed to study the entanglement-based QKD, we
emphasize that our generic model may also be useful for other non-QKD
experiments involving a PDC source. Since an entangled PDC source is a basis
independent source, we apply Koashi-Preskill's security analysis to the
entanglement PDC QKD. We also investigate the entanglement PDC QKD with two-way
classical communications. We find that the recurrence scheme increases the key
rate and Gottesman-Lo protocol helps tolerate higher channel losses. By
simulating a recent 144km open-air PDC experiment, we compare three
implementations -- entanglement PDC QKD, triggering PDC QKD and coherent state
QKD. The simulation result suggests that the entanglement PDC QKD can tolerate
higher channel losses than the coherent state QKD. The coherent state QKD with
decoy states is able to achieve highest key rate in the low and medium-loss
regions. By applying Gottesman-Lo two-way post-processing protocol, the
entanglement PDC QKD can tolerate up to 70dB combined channel losses (35dB for
each channel) provided that the PDC source is placed in between Alice and Bob.
After considering statistical fluctuations, the PDC setup can tolerate up to
53dB channel losses.

between spin-observables we present two tight quantitative trade-off relations
in the case of two qubits: First, for entangled states, between the degree of
commutativity of local observables and the maximal amount of violation of the
Bell inequality: if both local angles increase from zero to \pi/2 (i.e., the
degree of local commutativity decreases), the maximum violation of the Bell
inequality increases. Secondly, a converse trade-off relation holds for
separable states: if both local angles approach \pi/2 the maximal value
obtainable for the correlations in the Bell inequality decreases and thus the
non-violation increases. As expected, the extremes of these relations are found
in the case of anti-commuting local observables where respectively the bounds
of 2\sqrt{2} and \sqrt{2} hold for the expectation of the Bell operator. The
trade-off relations show that non-commmutativity gives ``a more than classical
result"" for entangled states, whereas ""a less than classical result"" is
obtained for separable states. The experimental relevance of the trade-off
relation for separable states is that it provides an experimental test for two
qubit entanglement. Its advantages are twofold: in comparison to violations of
Bell inequalities it is a stronger criterion and in comparison to entanglement
witnesses it needs to make less strong assumptions about the observables
implemented in the experiment.
