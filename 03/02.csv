cosmic ray protons would also generate neutrinos through interactions with
ambient matter and/or photons. However there will be a reduction in the
predicted neutrino flux if cosmic ray sources accelerate not only protons but
also significant number of heavier nuclei, as is indicated by recent air shower
data. We consider plausible extragalactic sources such as active galactic
nuclei, gamma-ray bursts and starburst galaxies and demand consistency with the
observed cosmic ray composition and energy spectrum at Earth after allowing for
propagation through intergalactic radiation fields. This allows us to calculate
the expected neutrino fluxes from the sources, normalised to the observed
cosmic ray spectrum. We find that the likely signals are still within reach of
next generation neutrino telescopes such as IceCube.

colour-magnitude filters are used to build stellar radial density profiles and
mass functions. The results convey compelling evidence that Ly9 and Cz37 are
intermediate-age open clusters, and their fundamental parameters are measured

high background level, its field presents variable absorption in near-IR bands.
We confirm it to be an intermediate-age open cluster. These OCs are located 0.9

Structurally, they are well described by King profiles. In all cases, core and
limiting radii are significantly smaller than those of nearby OCs outside the
Solar circle. We test the effect of background levels on cluster radii
determinations by means of simulations. They indicate that for central
clusters, radii may be underestimated by about 10--20%, which suggests that the
small sizes measured for the present sample reflect as well intrinsic
properties related to dynamical evolution effects. The objects probably have
been suffering important tidal effects that may have accelerated dynamical
evolution, especially in Cz37, the innermost object.

km diameter). A subset of 297 detections of previously known Trojans were used
to design and optimize a selection method based on observed angular velocity
that resulted in the remaining objects. Using a sample of objects with known
orbits, we estimate that the candidate sample contamination is about 3%. The
well-controlled selection effects, the sample size, depth and accurate
five-band UV-IR photometry enabled several new findings and the placement of
older results on a firmer statistical footing. We find that there are
significantly more asteroids in the leading swarm (L4) than in the trailing
swarm (L5): N(L4)/N(L5)=1.6$\pm$0.1, independently of limiting object's size.
The overall counts normalization suggests that there are about as many Jovians
Trojans as there are main-belt asteroids down to the same size limit, in
agreement with earlier estimates. We find that Trojan asteroids have a
remarkably narrow color distribution (root-mean-scatter of only $\sim$0.05 mag)
that is significantly different from the color distribution of the main-belt
asteroids. The color of Trojan asteroids is correlated with their orbital
inclination, in a similar way for both swarms, but appears uncorrelated with
the object's size. We extrapolate the results presented here and estimate that

measure light curves in six photometric bandpasses for about 100,000 Jovian

fractions, f_gas less than 8% in the disk. We addressed the issue of angular
momentum (J) transfer from the gas to the bar and its effect on the bar
evolution. We find that the weakening of the bar, reported in the literature,
is not related to the J-exchange with the gas, but is caused by the vertical
buckling instability in the gas-poor disks and by a steep heating of a stellar
velocity dispersion by the central mass concentration (CMC) in the gas-rich
disks. The gas has a profound effect on the onset of the buckling -- larger
f_gas brings it forth due to the more massive CMCs. The former process leads to
the well-known formation of the peanut-shaped bulges, while the latter results
in the formation of progressively more elliptical bulges, for larger f_gas. The
subsequent (secular) evolution of the bar differs -- the gas-poor models
exhibit a growing bar while gas-rich models show a declining bar whose vertical
swelling is driven by a secular resonance heating. The border line between the
gas-poor and -rich models lies at f_gas ~ 3% in our models, but is
model-dependent and will be affected by additional processes, like star
formation and feedback from stellar evolution. The overall effect of the gas on
the evolution of the bar is not in a direct J transfer to the stars, but in the
loss of J by the gas and its influx to the center that increases the CMC. The
more massive CMC damps the vertical buckling instability and depopulates orbits
responsible for the appearance of peanut-shaped bulges. The action of resonant
and non-resonant processes in gas-poor and gas-rich disks leads to a converging
evolution in the vertical extent of the bar and its stellar dispersion
velocities, and to a diverging evolution in the bulge properties.

continuation of M31's giant southern stream. This discovery was made in the
course of an on-going spectroscopic survey of red giant branch (RGB) stars in
M31 using the DEIMOS instrument on the Keck II 10-m telescope. Stellar
kinematics are investigated in eight fields located 9-30 kpc from M31's center
(in projection). A likelihood method based on photometric and spectroscopic
diagnostics is used to isolate confirmed M31 RGB stars from foreground Milky
Way dwarf stars: for the first time, this is done without using radial velocity
as a selection criterion, allowing an unbiased study of M31's stellar
kinematics. The radial velocity distribution of the 1013 M31 RGB stars shows
evidence for the presence of two components. The broad (hot) component has a
velocity dispersion of 129 km/s and presumably represents M31's virialized
spheroid. A significant fraction (19%) of the population is in a narrow (cold)
component centered near M31's systemic velocity with a velocity dispersion that
decreases with increasing radial distance, from 55.5 km/s at R_proj=12 kpc to
10.6 km/s at R_proj=18 kpc. The spatial and velocity distribution of the cold
component matches that of the ""Southeast shelf"" predicted by the Fardal et al.
(2007) orbital model of the progenitor of the giant southern stream. The
metallicity distribution of the cold component matches that of the giant
southern stream, but is about 0.2 dex more metal rich on average than that of
the hot spheroidal component. We discuss the implications of our discovery on

  Methods: We decompose the spectra into their individual emission components
using a multi-component fitting approach. A complementary decomposition of the
spectra enables us to isolate the macro-lensed fraction of the spectra
independently of any spectral modelling.
  Results: -1. The data support micro-lensing de-amplification of images A and
C. Not only is the continuum emission microlensed in those images but also a
fraction of the Broad Line emitting Region (BLR).-2. Micro-lensing of a very
broad component of MgII emission line suggests that the corresponding emission
occurs in a region more compact than the other components of the emission line.
-3. We find evidence that a large fraction of the FeII emission arises in the
outer parts of the BLR. We also find very compact emitting region in the ranges
3080-3540 A and 4630-4800 A that is likely associated with FeII. -4. The OIII
narrow emission line regions are partly spatially resolved. This enables us to
put a lower limit of 110h^{-1} pc on their intrinsic size. -5. Analysis of MgII
absorption found in the spectra indicates that the absorbing medium is
intrinsic to the quasar, has a covering factor of 20%, and is constituted of
small clouds homogeneously distributed in front of the continuum and BLRs. -6.

galaxies to study the quantitative behavior of the diffuse, warm ionized medium
(WIM) across the range of properties represented by these 109 galaxies. The
mean fraction f_WIM of diffuse ionized gas in this sample is 0.59+/- 0.19,
slightly higher than found in previous samples. Since lower surface-brightness
galaxies tend to have higher f_WIM, we believe that most of this difference is
due to selection effects favoring large, optically-bright, nearby galaxies with
high star-formation rates. As found in previous studies, there is no
appreciable correlation with Hubble type or total star-formation rate. However,
we find that starburst galaxies, defined here by an H-alpha surface brightness
> 2.5x 10^39 erg s^-1 kpc^-2 within the H-alpha half-light radius, do show much
lower fractions of diffuse H-alpha emission. The cause apparently is not
dominated by a lower fraction of field OB stars. However, it is qualitatively
consistent with an expected escape of ionizing radiation above a threshold
star-formation rate, predicted from our model in which the ISM is shredded by
pressure-driven supernova feedback. The HI gas fractions in the starburst
galaxies are also lower, suggesting that the starbursts are consuming and
ionizing all the gas, and thus promoting regions of density-bounded ionization.
If true, these effects imply that some amount of Lyman continuum radiation is
escaping from most starburst galaxies, and that WIM properties and outflows
from mechanical feedback are likely to be pressure-driven. However, in view of
previous studies showing that the escape fraction of ionizing radiation is
generally low, it is likely that other factors also drive the low fractions of
diffuse ionized gas in starbursts.

constant upper-mass limit. These properties result in specific patterns in the
HII region LF and ionization of the diffuse, warm ionized medium. The resulting
SNe generate superbubbles whose size distribution is also described by a simple
power law, and from which a galaxy's porosity parameter is easily derived. A
critical star-formation threshold can then be estimated, above which the escape
of Lyman continuum photons, hot gas, and nucleosynthetic products is predicted.
A first comparison with a large H-alpha sample of galaxies is broadly
consistent with this prediction, and suggests that ionizing photons likely
escapes from starburst galaxies. The superbubble size distribution also offers
a basis for a Simple Inhomogeneous Model for galactic chemical evolution, which
is especially relevant to metal-poor systems and instantaneous metallicity
distributions. This model offers an alternative interpretation of the Galactic
halo metallicity distribution and emphasizes the relative importance of
star-formation intensity, in addition to age, in a system's evolution. The
fraction of zero-metallicity, Population III stars is easily predicted for any
such model. We emphasize that all these phenomena can be modeled in a simple,
analytic framework over an extreme range in scale, offering powerful tools for
understanding the role of massive stars in the cosmos. (Abridged)

spin, the damping of such oscillations is determined by the scaling dimension
of the composite spin operator. For transitions with a spinless order parameter

studied using analytic methods as well as large scale numerical density matrix
renormalization group methods. The entanglement is investigated in terms of the
von Neumann entropy, S=-Tr rho_A log rho_A, for a sub-system A of size r of the
chain. The impurity contribution to the uniform part of the entanglement
entropy, S_{imp}, is defined and analyzed in detail in both the gapless, J_2 <=
J_2^c, as well as the dimerized phase, J_2>J_2^c, of the model. This quantum
impurity model is in the universality class of the single channel Kondo model
and it is shown that in a quite universal way the presence of the impurity in
the gapless phase, J_2 <= J_2^c, gives rise to a large length scale, xi_K,
associated with the screening of the impurity, the size of the Kondo screening
cloud. The universality of Kondo physics then implies scaling of the form
S_{imp}(r/xi_K,r/R) for a system of size R. Numerical results are presented
clearly demonstrating this scaling. At the critical point, J_2^c, an analytic
Fermi liquid picture is developed and analytic results are obtained both at T=0
and T>0. In the dimerized phase an appealing picure of the entanglement is

valence bonds (IVB) and single particle entanglement (SPE) are introduced. The
TS-ansatz permits a variational calculation of the complete entanglement in the
dimerized phase that appears to be exact in the thermodynamic limit at the

critical point J_2^c. In appendices the relation between the finite temperature
entanglement entropy, S(T), and the thermal entropy, S_{th}(T), is discussed

and effective central charge of the spin-1 random Heisenberg model in its
random-singlet phase and also at the critical point at which the Haldane phase
breaks down. The latter is the first entanglement calculation for an
infinite-randomness fixed point that is not in the random-singlet universality

infinite-randomness fixed points. The formalism we use can be generally applied

In the proposed model light excitation heats up the population of carriers,
taking it out of equilibrium with the localized spins. This triggers the

which lasts for the duration of the energy relaxation of the carriers. We
derive the Master equation for the density matrix of a localized spin

as a result of the coupling to the nuclear environment and reaches a saturation
value, which depends on the value of the exchange interaction difference $J=\|

controlled by the competition between the exchange interaction $J$ and the

above and below a critical value of the exchange interaction. It becomes more
symmetric as the external magnetic field increases. The entanglement reaches a
large saturation value, close to unity, when the exchange interaction is far

critical value. Furthermore, we find that the decay rate profile of
entanglement is linear when the exchange interaction is much higher or lower

the spontaneous formation of super-molecular structures (microphases) in
condition of thermodynamic equilibrium. A simple mechanism responsible for this
self-organization or pattern formation is based on the competition between
attractive and repulsive forces with different length scales in the microscopic
potential, typically, a short-range attraction against a longer-range
repulsion.
  We analyse this problem by simulations in 2D fluids. We find that, as the
temperature is lowered, liquid-vapor phase separation is inhibited by the
competition between attraction and repulsion, and replaced by a transition to
non-homogeneous phases. The structure of the fluid shows well defined
signatures of the presence of both intra- and inter-cluster correlations.
  Even when the competition between attraction and repulsion is not so strong
as to cause microphase formation, it still induces large density fluctuations
in a wide region of the temperature-density plane. In this large-fluctuation
regime, pattern formation can be triggered by a weak external modulating field.

situ at several temperatures. It is found that the reaction between E' center
and H_2 requires an activation energy of 0.38eV, and that its kinetics is not
diffusion-limited. The results are compared with previous findings on the other
fundamental paramagnetic point defect in silica, the non bridging oxygen hole
center, which features completely different reaction properties with H_2.
Besides, a comparison is proposed with literature data on the reaction
properties of surface E' centers, of E' centers embedded in silica films, and
with theoretical calculations. In particular, the close agreement with the
reaction properties of surface E' centers with H_2 leads to conclude that the
bulk and surface E' varieties are indistinguishable from their reaction
properties with molecular hydrogen.

one that touches the approximability limit curve $(\gamma_f, 1+2e^{-\gamma_f})$

symmetry. We simulate numerically the dynamics of the collision and illustrate
the transition from the configuration without a hole to the pierced one with
the aid of a phase diagram. The process of perforation is found to depend on
the collisional velocity, and, contrary to our expectation, we observe that
above a critical value of the velocity, the black hole has no chance to
perforate the wall. That is: high energy collisions do not assist piercing. We
also show that, only when the model parameters are fine-tuned so that the
energy scale of the string is very close to that of the domain wall, the
collision of the wall with the black hole has a possibility to provide a
mechanism to erase domain walls, if the hole expands. However, in such cases,
domain walls will form with many holes edged by a string and therefore
disappear eventually. Therefore this mechanism is unlikely to be a solution to

to formulate a nonstandard version of Stochastic Mechanics (avoiding both the

Quantum Mechanics, i.e. the noncommutativity of the observables' algebra, whose
structure is naturally captured in the language of Noncommutative Probability
and Noncommutative Geometry.
  With this respect some preliminary consideration concerning the notion of

notion obtained by the Sinha-Goswami's definition of quantum brownian motion on
a noncommutative riemannian manifold replacing a continuous time interval with
an hyperfinite time interval, is presented.

model operates via repeated local updates of random grouping of agents. While
floater agents do eventually flip their opinion to follow the local majority,
inflexible agents keep their opinion always unchanged. It is a quenched
individual opinion. In the bare model (no inflexibles), a separator at 50%
drives the dynamics towards either one of two pure attractors, each associated
with a full polarization along one of the opinions. The initial majority wins.
The existence of inflexibles for only one of the two opinions is found to shift
the separator at a lower value than 50% in favor of that side. Moreover it
creates an incompressible minority around the inflexibles, one of the pure
attractors becoming a mixed phase attractor. In addition above a threshold of
17% inflexibles make their side sure of winning whatever the initial conditions
are. The inflexible minority wins. An equal presence of inflexibles on both
sides restores the balanced dynamics with again a separator at 50% and now two
mixed phase attractors on each side. Nevertheless, beyond 25% the dynamics is
reversed with a unique attractor at a fifty-fifty stable equilibrium. But a
very small advantage in inflexibles results in a decisive lowering of the
separator at the advantage of the corresponding opinion. A few percent
advantage does guarantee to become majority with one single attractor. The

membranes fluctuations in enthalpy, area, volume and concentration are
enhanced. This results in domain formation, changes of the elastic constants,
changes in permeability and slowing down of relaxation processes. In this study
we used pressure perturbation calorimetry to investigate the relaxation time
scale after a jump into the melting transition regime of artificial lipid
membranes. This time corresponds to the characteristic rate of domain growth.
The studies were performed on single-component large unilamellar and
multilamellar vesicle systems with and without the addition of small molecules
such as general anesthetics, neurotransmitters and antibiotics. These drugs
interact with membranes and affect melting points and profiles. In all systems
we found that heat capacity and relaxation times are related to each other in a
simple manner. The maximum relaxation time depends on the cooperativity of the
heat capacity profile and decreases with a broadening of the transition. For
this reason the influence of a drug on the time scale of domain formation
processes can be understood on the basis of their influence on the heat
capacity profile. This allows estimations of the time scale of domain formation
processes in biological membranes.

function of these elemental rates, the microtubule can grow steadily or its
length can fluctuate wildly. A master equation approach is developed to
characterize these intriguing features. For mu=0, we find exact expressions for
tubule and GTP cap length distributions, as well as a power-law length
distributions of GTP and GDP islands. For mu=oo, we find the average time
between catastrophes, where the microtubule shrinks to zero length, and extend
this approach to also determine the size distribution of avalanches (sequence
of consecutive GDP detachment events). We obtain the phase diagram for general

external source, the response function (mean activity versus stimulus rate)
generally shows a linear saturating shape. This is experimentally verified in
some classes of sensory neurons, which accordingly present a small dynamic
range (defined as the interval of stimulus intensity which can be appropriately
coded by the mean activity of the excitable element), usually about one or two
decades only. The brain, on the other hand, can handle a significantly broader
range of stimulus intensity, and a collective phenomenon involving the
interaction among excitable neurons has been suggested to account for the
enhancement of the dynamic range. Since the role of the pattern of such
interactions is still unclear, here we investigate the performance of a
scale-free (SF) network topology in this dynamic range problem. Specifically,
we study the transfer function of disordered SF networks of excitable
Greenberg-Hastings cellular automata. We observe that the dynamic range is
maximum when the coupling among the elements is critical, corroborating a
general reasoning recently proposed. Although the maximum dynamic range yielded
by general SF networks is slightly worse than that of random networks, for
special SF networks which lack loops the enhancement of the dynamic range can
be dramatic, reaching nearly five decades. In order to understand the role of
loops on the transfer function we propose a simple model in which the density
of loops in the network can be gradually increased, and show that this is
accompanied by a gradual decrease of dynamic range.

  Dynamics","25 pages",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0000434",,"q-bio.PE",,"  Phenotype of biological systems needs to be robust against mutation in order
to sustain themselves between generations. On the other hand, phenotype of an
individual also needs to be robust against fluctuations of both internal and
external origins that are encountered during growth and development. Is there a
relationship between these two types of robustness, one during a single
generation and the other during evolution? Could stochasticity in gene
expression have any relevance to the evolution of these robustness? Robustness
can be defined by the sharpness of the distribution of phenotype; the variance
of phenotype distribution due to genetic variation gives a measure of `genetic
robustness' while that of isogenic individuals gives a measure of
`developmental robustness'. Through simulations of a simple stochastic gene
expression network that undergoes mutation and selection, we show that in order
for the network to acquire both types of robustness, the phenotypic variance
induced by mutations must be smaller than that observed in an isogenic
population. As the latter originates from noise in gene expression, this
signifies that the genetic robustness evolves only when the noise strength in
gene expression is larger than some threshold. In such a case, the two
variances decrease throughout the evolutionary time course, indicating increase
in robustness. The results reveal how noise that cells encounter during growth
and development shapes networks' robustness to stochasticity in gene
expression, which in turn shapes networks' robustness to mutation. The
condition for evolution of robustness as well as relationship between genetic
and developmental robustness is derived through the variance of phenotypic
fluctuations, which are measurable experimentally.

culture media. These techniques present several drawbacks, such as
coprecipitation of salts or poor yields at low protein concentrations. Improved
techniques based on carrier-assisted trichloroacetic acid precipitation are
described and discussed in this paper. These techniques have been used to
analyse the secretome of myeloid cells (macrophages, dendritic cells) and

equation does not drive particle creation from the vacuum. The model requires
the specification of a preferred sequence of space-like hyper-surfaces
