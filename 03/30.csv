power spectrum as it is relevant for forthcoming weak lensing surveys. We
quantify the impact of baryonic physics using a set of three cosmological
numerical simulations. Each simulation has the same initial density field, but
models a different set of physical processes. The first simulation evolves the
density field using gravity alone, the second includes non-radiative
gasdynamics, and the third includes radiative heating and cooling of baryons,
star formation, and supernova feedback. We find that baryonic processes alter
predictions for the matter power spectrum significantly relative to models that
include only gravitational interactions. Our results imply that future weak
lensing experiments such as LSST and SNAP will be very sensitive to the
poorly-understood physics governing the nonlinear evolution of the baryonic
component of the universe. The net effect is significantly larger in the case
of the model with cooling and star formation, in which case our results imply
that contemporary surveys such as the CFHT Wide survey may also be sensitive to
baryonic processes. In particular, this effect could be important for forecasts
of the constraining power of future surveys if information from scales larger
than l ~ 1000 is included in the analysis. We find that deviations are caused
primarily by the rearrangement of matter within individual dark matter halos
relative to the gravity-only case, rather than a large-scale rearrangement of
matter. Consequently, we propose a simple model, based on the phenomenological
halo model of dark matter clustering, for baryonic effects that can be used to
aid in the interpretation of forthcoming weak lensing data.

significance in the merged XRT data from days 1 to 12 after the explosion. If
the X-ray luminosity of (1.8+/-0.4)E39 ergs/s is caused by interaction of the
SN shock with circumstellar material (CSM), deposited by a stellar wind from
the progenitor's companion star, a mass-loss rate of ~E-05 M_sun/yr is
inferred. The mass-loss rate is consistent with the non-detection in the radio
with the VLA on days 2, 9, and 11 after the explosion and characteristic of a
red supergiant progenitor with a mass around 12-15 M_sun prior to the

peak and since type IIP SNe have an extended 'plateau' phase in the optical, we
discuss the scenario that the X-rays might be due to inverse Compton scattering
of photospheric optical photons off relativistic electrons produced in
circumstellar shocks. However, due to the high required value of the Lorentz
factor (~10-100) we conclude that Inverse Compton scattering is an unlikely
explanation for the observed X-ray emission. The fast evolution of the

observed with Swift reveal the onset of metal line-blanketing and cooling of
the expanding photosphere during the first few weeks after the outburst.

stellar isochrone and determine its helium content indirectly. We use a newly
computed set of Padova isochrones which cover a wide range of helium and metal
content. Our theoretical isochrones have been checked against a congruous set
of main sequence binaries with accurately measured masses, to discuss and
validate their range of applicability. We find that the stellar masses deduced
from the isochrones are usually in excellent agreement with empirical
measurements. Good agreement is also found with empirical mass-luminosity
relations. Despite fitting the masses of the stars very well, we find that
anomalously low helium content (lower than primordial helium) is required to
fit the luminosities and temperatures of the metal poor K dwarfs, while more
conventional values of the helium content are derived for the stars around
solar metallicity. We have investigated the effect of diffusion in stellar
models and LTE assumption in deriving metallicities. Neither of these is able
to resolve the low helium problem alone and only marginally if the cumulated
effects are included, unless we assume a mixing-length which is strongly
decreasing with metallicity. Further work in stellar models is urgently needed.
The helium-to-metal enrichment ratio is found to be Delta Y / Delta Z = 2.1 +/-
0.9 around and above solar metallicity, consistent with previous studies,

is present at ~5000 km/s, probably from in-fall of a galaxy group, while the
main intracluster stellar component is centered around ~6500 km/s, ~700 km/s
offset from the nearby cD galaxy NGC 4874. The kinematics and morphology of the
intracluster stars show that the cluster core is in a highly dynamically
evolving state. In combination with galaxy redshift and X-ray data this argues
strongly that the cluster is currently in the midst of a subcluster merger,
where the NGC 4874 subcluster core may still be self-bound, while the NGC 4889
subcluster core has probably dissolved. The NGC 4889 subcluster is likely to

The two inner subcluster cores are presently beyond their first and second
close passage, during which the elongated distribution of diffuse light has
been created. We predict the kinematic signature expected in this scenario, and
argue that the extended western X-ray arc recently discovered traces the arc
shock generated by the collision between the two subcluster gas halos. Any

well known analytic models that evaluate the bias parameter b, the ratio of
galaxy to dark matter (DM) fluctuations. These analytic models are based on the
physical processes involved in the formation of stars and in the formation and
merging of galaxies. The value of b(z) obtained in each model is a function of
the DM growth factor D(z), which, in turn, is a function of the DE. We show
that the equations for b in all three analytic models can be reduced to the
form of a known constant plus the term E[D(z=0)/D(z)]^{\alpha}, where \alpha=1
or 2 and E is a free parameter. Using the value of b obtained by the 2dFGRS
consortium for the \LambdaCDM model, to normalize E, we find that all three
analytic models predict b^2(0)=1\pm 0.1 for all DE models. Numerical
simulations that evaluated b^2(0) for the \LambdaCDM and CDM (\Lambda=0) models
also obtained b^2(0)=1\pm 0.1. Since this value of b^2(0) is indicated by
numerical simulations as well as by all three popular analytic models, which
are normalized by the 2dFGRS consortium result for the \LambdaCDM model, we
suggest the condition that b^2(0)=1\pm 0.1 at z=0 as a new test for the
viability of dark energy models. Thus, for a given observed galaxy fluctuation
spectrum such as that of the 2dFGRS consortium, if the DM fluctuations are
greater or less than the galaxy fluctuations by more than 10%, the DE model can
be discarded.

incorporating constraints from CMB anisotropy data, and use it to derive
constraints on cosmic curvature and dark energy density as a free function of
cosmic time using current data. We show that there are two CMB shift
parameters, R=sqrt{\Omega_m H_0^2} r(z_{CMB}) (scaled distance to
recombination) and l_a=\pi r(z_{CMB})/r_s(z_{CMB})(angular scale of the sound
horizon at recombination), with measured values that are nearly uncorrelated
with each other. Allowing nonzero cosmic curvature, the three-year WMAP data
give R =1.71 +/- 0.03, l_a =302.5 +/- 1.2, and \Omega_b h^2 = 0.02173 +/-
0.00082, independent of the dark energy model. The corresponding bounds for a
flat universe are R =1.70 +/- 0.03, l_a =302.2 +/- 1.2, and \Omega_b h^2 =
0.022 +/- 0.00082. We give the covariance matrix of (R, l_a, \Omega_b h^2) from
the three-year WMAP data. We find that (R, l_a, \Omega_b h^2) provide an
efficient and intuitive summary of CMB data as far as dark energy constraints
are concerned. Using current CMB, SN Ia, and BAO data, we find that dark energy
density is consistent with a constant in cosmic time, with marginal deviations
from a cosmological constant that may reflect current systematic uncertainties
or true evolution in dark energy. A flat universe is allowed by current data:
\Omega_k=-0.006_{-0.012}^{+0.013}_{-0.025}^{+0.025} for w_X(z)=const., and
\Omega_k=-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.018}_{-0.032}^{+0.041} for w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a)(68%

density is allowed to be a free function of cosmic time, and are also dependent
on the assumption about the early time property of dark energy.

H-alpha a faint extension up to ~ -450 km/s can be seen probably arising from a
small fraction of shocked high density clumps. We discuss these observations in
the context of radiative shock models, which are qualitatively consistent with
the observations. A fraction of the high ionization lines may originate in gas
which has yet not had time to cool down, explaining the difference in width
between the low and high ionization lines. The maximum shock velocities seen in

is a group of objects that falls above the main correlation and displays
evidence for prodigious recent star formation activity at optical wavelengths,
along with relatively cool MFIR colours. These results provide evidence that
illumination by the AGN is the primary heating mechanism for the dust emitting
at both 24 and 70 microns, with starbursts dominating the heating of the cool
dust in only 20 -- 30% of objects. This implies that powerful AGN are not
always accompanied by the type of luminous starbursts that are characteristic

suited to study selection effects. The construction of the B, R, and I-selected
photometric catalogues, containing ~9000, ~9000, and ~6000 galaxies,
respectively, is described in detail. The catalogues reach 50% completeness
limits for point sources of B ~ 24.5mag, R ~ 23.5mag, and I ~ 22.5mag and cover
an area of about 0.3 square degrees. Photometric redshifts are derived for all

selection band and environment on the specific star formation rate (SSFR). We
find that K-band selection indeed comes close to selection in stellar mass,
while B-band selection purely selects galaxies in star formation rate. We use a
galaxy group catalogue constructed on the K-band selected MUNICS sample to
study possible differences of the SSFR between the field and the group
environment, finding a marginally lower average SSFR in groups as compared to
the field, especially at lower redshifts. The field-galaxy luminosity function
in the B and R band as derived from the R-selected sample evolves out to z ~ 2
in the sense that the characteristic luminosity increases but the number
density decreases. This effect is smaller at longer rest-frame wavelengths and
gets more pronounced at shorter wavelengths. Parametrising the redshift
evolution of the Schechter parameters as M*(z) = M*(0) + a ln(1+z) and Phi*(z)

by Stanimirovic & Lazarian (2001). The question is whether the power spectrum
is indeed the result of a dynamical turbulence or is merely the result of a
structured static density. In the turbulence interpretation of Goldman (2000)
the turbulence was generated by the tidal effects of the last close passage of
the LMC about 0.2 Gyr ago. The turbulence time-scale was estimated by Goldman
to be 0.4 Gyr, so the turbulence has not decayed yet. Staveley-Smith et al
(1997) observed in the SMC about five hundreds of HI super shells. Their age is
more than an order of magnitude smaller than the turbulence age. Therefore, if
the turbulence explanation holds, their observed radial velocities should
reflect the turbulence in the gas in which they formed. In the present work we
analyze the observed radial velocities of the super shells. We find that the
velocities indeed manifest the statistical spatial correlations expected from
turbulence. The turbulence spectrum is consistent with that obtained by
Goldman(2000).

10% of the surveyed nuclei display stellar populations of intermediate age, 1-2
Gyr old, whereas the remaining targets appear to be evenly split between
objects showing only very old stellar populations and nuclei requiring also an
additional blue featureless component, which we characterise by means of very
young, few-Myr-old stars.
  The small fraction of stellar population of intermediate age seems to argue
against the presence of such a young component, however, since the short
lifetime of O-stars would imply recurrent star-formation episodes and the
build-up over the last 1-2 Gyr of a detectable intermediate-age population.
  Additionally, a correlation between the luminosity of such a blue component
and the emission from highly-ionised species, together with the general absence
of Wolf-Rayet features, further suggests that the featureless continuum arises
from the central engine rather than from star-forming regions.

responsible for stopping cooling flows in clusters of galaxies. AGN are known
to inflate buoyant bubbles that supply mechanical power to the intracluster gas
(ICM). High Reynolds number hydrodynamical simulations show that such bubbles
get entirely disrupted within 100 Myr, as they rise in cluster atmospheres,
which is contrary to observations. This artificial mixing has consequences for
models trying to quantify the amount of heating and star formation in cool core
clusters of galaxies. It has been suggested that magnetic fields can stabilize
bubbles against disruption. We perform MHD simulations of fossil bubbles in the
presence of tangled magnetic fields using the high order PENCIL code. We focus
on the physically-motivated case where thermal pressure dominates over magnetic
pressure and consider randomly oriented fields with and without maximum
helicity and a case where large scale external fields drape the bubble.We find
that helicity has some stabilizing effect. However, unless the coherence length
of magnetic fields exceeds the bubble size, the bubbles are quickly shredded.
As observations of Hydra A suggest that lengthscale of magnetic fields may be
smaller then typical bubble size, this may suggest that other mechanisms, such
as viscosity, may be responsible for stabilizing the bubbles. However, since
Faraday rotation observations of radio lobes do not constrain large scale ICM
fields well if they are aligned with the bubble surface, the draping case may
be a viable alternative solution to the problem. A generic feature found in our
simulations is the formation of magnetic wakes where fields are ordered and
amplified. We suggest that this effect could prevent evaporation by thermal
conduction of cold Halpha filaments observed in the Perseus cluster.

considerable hardware overhead. Biologically-inspired computing by means of
bio-chemical metaphors offers alternative paradigms, which need to be explored

lagrangian, also provides contributions to scattering amplitudes that evade the
equivalence theorem. This `ET evasion' in particular provides the tree-level
(-++) amplitude, which is non-vanishing off shell, or on shell with complex
momenta or in (2,2) signature, and is missing from the MHV (aka CSW) rules. At
one loop there are ET-evading diagrammatic contributions to the amplitudes with
all positive helicities. We supply the necessary regularisation in order to
define these contributions (and quantum MHV methods in general) by starting
from the light-cone Yang-Mills lagrangian in D dimensions and making a
canonical change of variables for all D-2 transverse degrees of freedom of the
gauge field. In this way, we obtain dimensionally regularised three- and
four-point MHV amplitudes. Returning to the one-loop (++++) amplitude, we
demonstrate that its quadruple cut coincides with the known result, and show
how the original light-cone Yang-Mills contributions can in fact be
algebraically recovered from the ET-evading contributions. We conclude that the
canonical MHV lagrangian, supplemented with the extra terms brought to
correlation functions by the non-linear field transformation, provide
contributions which are just a rearrangement of those from light-cone
Yang-Mills and thus coincide with them both on and off shell.

linear functional-differential equations with both advanced and delayed
arguments was posed in early 1970s by T. Kato in connection with the analysis
of the pantograph equation, y'(x)=ay(qx)+by(x). In the present paper, we answer
this question for the balanced generalized pantograph equation of the form -a_2
y''(x)+a_1 y'(x)+y(x)=int_0^infty y(qx) m(dq), where a_1 > or = 0, a_2 > or =
0, a_1^2+a_2^2>0, and m is a probability measure. Namely, setting
K:=int_0^infty ln(q) m(dq), we prove that if K < or = 0 then the equation does
not have nontrivial (i.e., nonconstant) bounded solutions, while if K>0 then
such a solution exists. The result in the critical case, K=0, settles a
long-standing problem. The proof exploits the link with the theory of Markov
processes, in that any solution of the balanced pantograph equation is an
L-harmonic function relative to the generator L of a certain diffusion process

disjoint blocks $B_1,B_2,...c, B_d$ whose union is $[n]$. We choose the
ordering of the blocks so that they satisfy $\min B_1<\min B_2<...b<\min B_d$.
We represent such a set partition by a \emph{canonical sequence}
$\pi_1,\pi_2,...c,\pi_n$, with $\pi_i=j$ if $i\in B_j$. We say that a partition
$\pi$ \emph{contains} a partition $\sigma$ if the canonical sequence of $\pi$
contains a subsequence that is order-isomorphic to the canonical sequence of
$\sigma$. Two partitions $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ are \emph{equivalent}, if there
is a size-preserving bijection between $\sigma$-avoiding and $\sigma'$-avoiding
partitions.
  We determine several infinite families of sets of equivalent patterns; for
instance, we prove that there is a bijection between $k$-noncrossing and
$k$-nonnesting partitions, with a notion of crossing and nesting based on the
canonical sequence. We also provide new combinatorial interpretations of the
Catalan numbers and the Stirling numbers. Using a systematic computer search,
we verify that our results characterize all the pairs of equivalent partitions
of size at most seven.

Ferrers shapes and stack polyominoes. This correspondence allows us to apply
recent results on polyomino fillings in the study of partitions, and
conversely, some of our results on partitions imply new results on polyomino
fillings and ordered graphs.

(artinian) codimension 4 Gorenstein algebras that have at least two independent
relations of degree four. This includes all codimension 4 Gorenstein algebras
whose initial relation is of degree at most 3. Our result shows that those
Hilbert functions are exactly the so-called {\em SI-sequences} starting with
(1,4,h_2,h_3,...), where $h_4 \leq 33$. In particular, these Hilbert functions
are all unimodal.
  We also establish a more general unimodality result, which relies on the
values of the Hilbert function not being too big, but is independent of the
initial degree.

The resulting functional deconvolution model can be viewed as a generalization
of a multitude of inverse problems in mathematical physics where one needs to
recover initial or boundary conditions on the basis of observations from a
noisy solution of a partial differential equation. In the case when it is
observed at a finite number of distinct points, the proposed functional
deconvolution model can also be viewed as a multichannel deconvolution model.
We derive minimax lower bounds for the $L^2$-risk in the proposed functional
deconvolution model when $f(\cdot)$ is assumed to belong to a Besov ball and
the blurring function is assumed to possess some smoothness properties,
including both regular-smooth and super-smooth convolutions. Furthermore, we
propose an adaptive wavelet estimator of $f(\cdot)$ that is asymptotically
optimal (in the minimax sense), or near-optimal within a logarithmic factor, in
a wide range of Besov balls. In addition, we consider a discretization of the
proposed functional deconvolution model and investigate when the availability
of continuous data gives advantages over observations at the asymptotically
large number of points. As an illustration, we discuss particular examples for
both continuous and discrete settings.

models undergo a localization/delocalization transition. There is a large
(bio)-physics literature on the subject since these systems describe, for
instance, the statistics of thermally created loops in DNA double strands and
the interaction between (1+1)-dimensional interfaces and disordered walls. In
these cases the transition corresponds, respectively, to the DNA denaturation
transition and to the wetting transition. More abstractly, one may see these
models as random and inhomogeneous perturbations of renewal processes.
  The last few years have witnessed a great progress in the mathematical
understanding of the equilibrium properties of these systems. In particular,
many rigorous results about the location of the critical point, about critical
exponents and path properties of the polymer in the two thermodynamic phases
(localized and delocalized) are now available.
  Here, we will focus on some aspects of this topic - in particular, on the
non-perturbative effects of disorder. The mathematical tools employed range
from renewal theory to large deviations and, interestingly, show tight
connections with techniques developed recently in the mathematical study of

In fact, it has been shown that proteins like bacteriorhodopsin and azurin,
manifest electrical properties which are promising for the development of
active components in the field of molecular electronics. Here we focus on two
relevant kinds of proteins: The bovine rhodopsin, prototype of GPCR protein,
and the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), whose inhibition is one of the most
qualified treatments of Alzheimer disease. Both these proteins exert their
functioning starting with a conformational change of their native structure.
Our guess is that such a change should be accompanied with a detectable
variation of their electrical properties. To investigate this conjecture, we
present an impedance network model of proteins, able to estimate the different
electrical response associated with the different configurations. The model
resolution of the electrical response is found able to monitor the structure
and the conformational change of the given protein. In this respect, rhodopsin
exhibits a better differential response than AChE. This result gives room to
different interpretations of the degree of conformational change and in
particular supports a recent hypothesis on the existence of a mixed state
already in the native configuration of the protein.

We carry out analysis of phylogeny and codon usage of organisms for which the
complete mitochondrial genome is available, and we determine the most likely
mechanism for codon reassignment in each case. Reassignment events can be
classified according to the gain-loss framework. The gain represents the
appearance of a new tRNA for the reassigned codon or the change of an existing
tRNA such that it gains the ability to pair with the codon. The loss represents
the deletion of a tRNA or the change in a tRNA so that it no longer translates
the codon. One possible mechanism is Codon Disappearance, where the codon
disappears from the genome prior to the gain and loss events. In the
alternative mechanisms the codon does not disappear. In the Unassigned Codon
mechanism, the loss occurs first, whereas in the Ambiguous Intermediate
mechanism, the gain occurs first. Codon usage analysis gives clear evidence of
cases where the codon disappeared at the point of the reassignment and also
cases where it did not disappear. Codon disappearance is the probable
explanation for stop to sense reassignments and a small number of reassignments
of sense codons. However, the majority of sense to sense reassignments cannot
be explained by codon disappearance. In the latter cases, by analysis of the
presence or absence of tRNAs in the genome and of the changes in tRNA
sequences, it is sometimes possible to distinguish between the Unassigned Codon
and Ambiguous Intermediate mechanisms. We emphasize that not all reassignments
follow the same scenario and that it is necessary to consider the details of
each case carefully.

family of mappings `phi' from propositions to truth values. Classically A is a
Boolean algebra, V=Z_2, and the admissible maps phi:A-->Z_2 are {\it
homomorphisms}. If one admits a larger set of maps, one obtains an
anhomomorphic logic that seems better suited to quantal reality (and the needs
of quantum gravity). I explain these ideas and illustrate them with three
simple examples.

correlations, which impose a trade-off on bipartite and multipartite
entanglement at once. For all N-mode Gaussian states under permutation
invariance, we establish exactly a monogamy inequality, stronger than the
traditional one, that by recursion defines a proper measure of genuine
N-partite entanglement. Strong monogamy holds as well for subsystems of
arbitrary size, and the emerging multipartite entanglement measure is found to
be scale invariant. We unveil its operational connection with the optimal
fidelity of continuous variable teleportation networks.
