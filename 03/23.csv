survey, combining data from the CFHTLS-Wide, RCS, VIRMOS-DESCART and GaBoDS
surveys. Spanning ~100 square degrees, with a median source redshift z~0.78,
this combined survey allows us to place tight joint constraints on the matter
density parameter Omega_m, and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum
sigma_8, finding sigma_8*(Omega_m/0.24)^0.59 = 0.84+/-0.05. Tables of the
measured shear correlation function and the calculated covariance matrix for
each survey are included.
  The accuracy of our results is a marked improvement on previous work owing to
three important differences in our analysis; we correctly account for cosmic
variance errors by including a non-Gaussian contribution estimated from
numerical simulations; we correct the measured shear for a calibration bias as
estimated from simulated data; we model the redshift distribution, n(z), of
each survey from the largest deep photometric redshift catalogue currently
available from the CFHTLS-Deep. This catalogue is randomly sampled to reproduce
the magnitude distribution of each survey with the resulting survey dependent
n(z) parametrised using two different models. While our results are consistent
for the n(z) models tested, we find that our cosmological parameter constraints
depend weakly (at the 5% level) on the inclusion or exclusion of galaxies with
low confidence photometric redshift estimates (z>1.5). These high redshift
galaxies are relatively few in number but contribute a significant weak lensing
signal. It will therefore be important for future weak lensing surveys to
obtain near-infra-red data to reliably determine the number of high redshift
galaxies in cosmic shear analyses.

large scales. The corresponding injection velocities are higher than the Alfven
velocity. As a result, the turbulence is approximately isotropic up to the
scale at which the turbulent velocity gets comparable with the Alfven velocity.
Under the hypothesis that turbulence in the ICM is highly super- Alfvenic the
magnetic field is passively advected and the field lines are bended on scales
smaller than that of the classical, unmagnetized, ion-ion mean free path. This
affects ion diffusion and the strength of the effective viscosity. Under these
conditions the bulk of turbulence in hot (5-10 keV temperature) galaxy clusters
is likely to be dissipated at collisionless scales via resonant coupling with
thermal and fast particles. We use collisionless physics to derive the
amplitude of the different components of the energy of the compressible modes,
and review and extend the treatment of plasma damping in the ICM. We calculate
the acceleration of both protons and electrons taking into account both TTD
acceleration and non-resonant acceleration by large scale compressions. We find
that relativistic electrons can be re-accelerated in the ICM up to energies of
several GeV provided that the rms velocity of the compressible turbulent-eddies
is (V_L/c_s)^2~0.15-0.3. We find that under typical conditions ~ 2-5 % of the

neutral gas in a nearby galaxy possibly giving rise to a ``proximity effect'',
analogous to the similar effect observed in the Lya forest. From a sample of
111 PDLAs, we measure the HI frequency distribution f(N), incidence, and gas

that of intervening DLAs, but at z<2.5 and z>3.5 the f(N) distribution is
consistent with the intervening population. We interpret the observed
enhancement of PDLAs around quasars in terms of quasar-galaxy clustering, and
compare the strength of the clustering signal to the expectation from
independent measures of the respective clustering strengths of DLAs and
quasars, as well as a complementary analysis of the clustering of absorbers

place at this time. It is likely that this drop in X-ray luminosity is a
consequence of outflows breaking out of the galactic discs of these systems. In
this work it is also shown that, for the systems close to the point of nuclear
coalescence, Lfir becomes massively enhanced compared to the X-ray luminosity

typical mature elliptical galaxies. However, we do see evidence that these

sensitive to the reionization history. We also investigate the contribution of

In general, stellar evolution models predict weak magnetic fields in the

as evidence that the ultraluminous X-ray source NGC 1313 X-2 harbors an
intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). The temperature of a disk component should
vary with luminosity as $L\propto T^4$. However, upon investigating the
spectral evolution with multiple XMM-Newton observations, we found that the
cool disk component failed to follow this relation with a confidence level of
0.999964. Indeed, the luminosity decreases as the temperature increases, and
the luminosities at high temperatures are more than an order of magnitude less
than expected from the $L\propto T^4$ extrapolation of luminosities at low
temperatures. This places a strong constraint against the validity of modeling
the X-ray spectra of NGC 1313 X-2 as emission from the accretion disk of an
IMBH. The decrease in luminosity with increasing temperature of the soft
component follows the trend suggested by a model in which the soft emission
arises from an outflow from a stellar-mass black hole with super-Eddington
accretion viewed along the symmetry axis. Alternatively, the spectra can be
adequately fitted by a p-free disk model with kT=~2 keV and p=~0.5. The
spectral evolution is consistent with the $L\propto T^4$ relation and appears
to be a high luminosity extension of the L-kT relation of Galactic black holes.

accreting stellar mass black hole.

the period from the neutrino decoupling to the matter-dominant stage.
Incorporating it to the analytic solution of the whole history of expansion of
the universe, the analytic solution of GRWs is obtained, evolving from the
inflation up to the current acceleration. The resulting spectrum of GRWs covers
the whole range of frequency $(10^{-19}\sim 10^{10})$Hz, and improves the
previous results. It is found that the neutrino free-streaming causes a
reduction of the spectral amplitude by $\sim 20%$ in the range $(10^{-16}\sim

This agrees with the earlier numerical calculations. Examination is made on the
difference between the accelerating and non-accelerating models, and our
analysis shows that the ratio of the spectral amplitude in accelerating
$\Lambda$CDM model over that in CDM model is $\sim 0.7$, and within the various
accelerating models of $\Omega_{\Lambda}> \Omega_m $ the spectral amplitude is
proportional to $ \Omega_m/\Omega_{\Lambda}$ for the whole range of frequency.

mapped with sub-arcsecond resolution using multiband observations in the
near-infrared. However, the interpretation of the observed features, and their
transformation into physical quantities, is greatly hampered by the effects
arising from the unknown geometry and the scattering of light by dust
particles. We examine the relation between the observed NIR reddening and the
column density of the dust clouds. In this paper we particularly assess the
feasibility of deriving the mass function of GMCs from NIR color-excess data.
We perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations with 3D models of stellar
radiation and clumpy dust distributions. We include the scattered light in the
models and calculate NIR color maps from the simulated data. We extract clumps
from the color maps and compare the observed mass function to the true mass
function. For the physical configuration chosen in this study, essentially a
face-on geometry, the observed mass function is a non-trivial function of the
true mass function. The dynamical range of the observed mass function is
confined to ~10^3.5... 10^5.5 M_\odot regardless of the dynamical range of the
true mass function. The color maps are more sensitive in detecting the
high-mass end of the mass function, and on average the masses of clouds are
underestimated by a factor of ~10. The simulations show that the cloud mass
function derived from JHK color excess data using simple foreground screening
geometry cannot be regarded as a one-to-one tracer of the underlying mass
function.

debris disks due to collisions is confronted with Spitzer observations of main
sequence A stars. All stars are assumed to have planetesimal belts with a
distribution of initial masses and radii. In the model disk mass is constant
until the largest planetesimals reach collisional equilibrium whereupon the
mass falls off oc 1/t. We find that the detection statistics and trends seen at
both 24 and 70um can be fitted well by the model. While there is no need to
invoke stochastic evolution or delayed stirring to explain the statistics, a
moderate rate of stochastic events is not ruled out. Potentially anomalous
systems are identified by a high dust luminosity compared with the maximum
permissible in the model (HD3003, HD38678, HD115892, HD172555). Their
planetesimals may have unusual properties (high strength or low eccentricity)
or this dust could be transient. While transient phenomena are also favored for
a few systems in the literature, the overall success of our model, which
assumes planetesimals in all belts have the same strength, eccentricity and
maximum size, suggests a large degree of uniformity in the outcome of planet
formation. The distribution of planetesimal belt radii, once corrected for
detection bias, follows N(r) oc r^{-0.8+-0.3} for 3-120AU. Since the inner edge
is often attributed to an unseen planet, this provides a unique constraint on
the planetary systems of A stars. It is also shown that P-R drag may sculpt the
inner edges of A star disks close to the Spitzer detection threshold (HD2262,
HD19356, HD106591, HD115892). This model can be readily applied to the
interpretation of future surveys, and predictions are made for the upcoming
SCUBA-2 survey, including that >17% of A stars should be detectable at 850um.

melting, the critical force curve of our random-sequence model is very
different from that of the homogeneous version of our model. For both sequence
models, the critical force falls to zero at the melting temperature with a
power law having exponent alpha. For the homogeneous model, alpha is 1/2 almost
exactly, while for the random model, alpha is about 0.9. The shape of the
critical force determines how the helix fraction falls to zero at melting, and
thus classifies the melting transition as a type of phase transition.

reorientation rates due to low expectancy. An important quantity to distinguish
between adiabatic dipoles behaving classically and ones reorientating by means
of quantum-mechanical tunneling is Christov's characteristic temperature which
is found to relate to the barrier height and crossover splitting. ITC data on
impurity-vacancy dipoles in Eu-doped alkali halides are reanalyzed.

to infer the exchange-coupling constants from the Q dependence of the INS
transitions within the spin ground state. The potential of this strategy is
explored for the M = +-10 -> +- 9 transition within the S = 10 multiplet of the

elastomeric thin films have recently been obtained by C. Tardivat and L.
L\'{e}ger (J. Adhesion Sci. Technol. 15 1055-1078 (2001)) by the so-called JKR

that on substrates coated with thin films the adhesion and effective elastic
modulus of the sphere depend upon the film thickness. In keeping with the
experimental conditions, we try to interpret these data using a simple model
(E. Barthel and A. Perriot, J. Phys. D 40, 1059-1067 (2007)) in the thin film

Although the film does impact the local crack tip stress field, we show that no
effect on the macroscopic contact variables is expected for the adhesion to
coated substrates in such confined geometries. The deviations from the
experimental results are ascribed to the idealized contact boundary conditions
assumed in the model.

fragments of modern imperative languages like C, C++, Java and Python is a
challenging problem. In this paper, we consider a core imperative language that
has several features found in mainstream languages such as those including
recursive functions, run-time system and user-defined exceptions, and a
realistic data and memory model. For this language we provide a concrete
semantics --characterizing both finite and infinite computations-- and a
generic abstract semantics that we prove sound with respect to the concrete
one. We say the abstract semantics is generic since it is designed to be
completely parametric on the analysis domains: in particular, it provides
support for \emph{relational} domains (i.e., abstract domains that can capture
the relationships between different data objects). We also sketch how the
proposed methodology can be extended to accommodate a larger language that
includes pointers, compound data objects and non-structured control flow
mechanisms. The approach, which is based on structured, big-step
$\mathrm{G}^\infty\mathrm{SOS}$ operational semantics and on abstract
interpretation, is modular in that the overall static analyzer is naturally
partitioned into components with clearly identified responsibilities and
interfaces, something that greatly simplifies both the proof of correctness and
the implementation.

To regulate the short distance singularities in the brane core, we resolve the
thin brane by a cylindrical 4-brane, with the geometry of 4D Minkowski $\times$
a circle, which has an axion flux to cancel the vacuum pressure in the compact
direction. We discover a large diversity of possible solutions controlled by
the axion flux, as governed by its boundary conditions. Hence brane induced
gravity models really give rise to a {\it landscape} of vacua, at least
semiclassically. For sub-critical tensions, the crossover scale, below which
gravity may look 4D, and the effective 4D gravitational coupling are sensitive
to vacuum energy. This shows how the vacuum energy problem manifests in brane
induced gravity: instead of tuning the 4D curvature, generically one must tune
the crossover scale. On the other hand, in the near-critical limit, branes live
inside very deep throats which efficiently compactify the angular dimension. In
there, 4D gravity first changes to $5D$, and only later to $6D$. The crossover
scale saturates at the gravitational see-saw scale, independent of the tension.
Using the fields of static loops on a wrapped brane, we check the perturbative
description of long range gravity below the crossover scale. In sub-critical
cases the scalars are strongly coupled already at the crossover scale even in
the vacuum, because the brane bending is turned on by the axion flux. Near the
critical limit, linearized perturbation theory remains under control below the
crossover scale, and we find that linearized gravity around the vacuum looks
like a scalar-tensor theory.

limit in matrix models. As an example, we study a solvable hermitian one-matrix
model with the double-well potential, which has been identified recently as a
dual description of noncritical string theory with worldsheet supersymmetry.
This identification utilizes the nonperturbatively stable vacuum unlike its
bosonic counterparts, and therefore it provides a complete constructive
formulation of string theory. Our data with the matrix size ranging from 8 to
512 show a clear scaling behavior, which enables us to extract the double
scaling limit accurately. The ``specific heat'' obtained in this way agrees
nicely with the known result obtained by solving the Painleve-II equation with
appropriate boundary conditions.

string compactifications. Using these we describe a novel way to derive the
fermionic matter content of the Standard Model from the heterotic string. For
this we compactify on an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefold X with two
sections, the B-fibration, a variant of the ordinary Weierstrass fibration,
which allows X to carry a free involution. We construct rank five vector
bundles, invariant under this involution, such that turning on a Wilson line we
obtain the Standard Model gauge group and find various three generation models.
This rank five bundle is derived from a stable rank four bundle that arises as
an extension of bundles pulled-back from the base and twisted by suitable line
bundles. We also give an account of various previous results and put the
present construction into perspective.

by reinterpreting a charged twisted state as a second non-universal localized

resolved by suitable field redefinitions. The anomaly of the field

$B_t=((B_t^{(1)},...,B_t^{(d)}),t\in\mathbb{R})$ with Hurst exponent $\alpha$,

with covariance ${\mathbb{E}}[B_s^{(i)}B

long-standing problem of defining a stochastic integration with respect to FBM
(and the related problem of solving stochastic differential equations driven by
FBM) has been addressed successfully by several different methods, although in
each case with a restriction on the range of either $d$ or $\alpha$. The case
$\alpha={1/2}$ corresponds to the usual stochastic integration with respect to
Brownian motion, while most computations become singular when $\alpha$ gets
under various threshhold values, due to the growing irregularity of the
trajectories as $\alpha\to0$. We provide here a new method valid for any $d$
and for $\alpha>{1/4}$ by constructing an approximation
$\Gamma(\varepsilon)_t$, $\varepsilon\to0$, of FBM which allows to define
iterated integrals, and then applying the geometric rough path theory. The
approximation relies on the definition of an analytic process $\Gamma_z$ on the
cut plane $z\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\mathbb{R}$ of which FBM appears to be a
boundary value, and allows to understand very precisely the well-known (see
\citeCQ02) but as yet a little mysterious divergence of L\'evy's area for
$\alpha\to{1/4}$.

spectra at 200AGeV Au-Au Collisions at RHIC, by utilizing a full
three-dimensional hydrodynamical calculation. The hydrodynamical code SPheRIO
we employed is based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamic algorithm. In order
to describe the spectra of strange hadrons, the code has been further improved
by explicitly incorporating the strangeness conservation and a chemical
freeze-out mechanism. In our model, strange hadrons such as Lambda, Xi, Omega
and phi undergo the chemical freeze-out immediately after the hadronization,
and their multiplicities are fixed thereafter. At a lower temperature the
thermal freeze-out takes place for all the particles. It is shown that the
present model provides a reasonably good description for the spectra of
identified particles, in particular, considerable improvement is observed for
those of strange hadrons.

  Bormio 2007",,,,"nucl-th",,"  One important question in relativistic heavy ion collisions is if hadrons,
specifically anti-hyperons, are in equilibrium before thermal freezeout because
strangeness enhancement has long been pointed to as a signature for Quark Gluon
Plasma. Because anti-baryons have long equilibration times in the hadron gas
phase it has been suggested that they are ""born"" into equilibrium. However,
Hagedorn states, massive resonances, which are thought to appear near the
critical temperature, contribute to fast chemical equilibration times for a
hadron gas by providing extra degrees of freedom. Here we use master equations
to describe the interplay between Hagedorn resonances, pions, and baryon
anti-baryon pairs as they equilibrate over time and observe if the baryons and
anti-baryons are fully equilibrated within the fireball.

  2303",,,,"physics.plasm-ph",,"  This thesis presents the results of fibre Z-pinch experiments carried out on
the Z-150 device at the CTU in Prague. The generator that was used to drive the
experiments consisted of one capacitor of 3e-6 F capacitance. In the case of 20
kV charging voltage, the current was peaking at 80 kA with a 850 ns quarter
period. The Z-pinch was formed from carbon fibres of 15 micrometer diameter and
1 cm length. The discharge was observed by a large number of diagnostic tools.
This comprehensive set of diagnostics enabled us to describe the gross dynamics
of the Z-pinch. It was found out that after the breakdown a low density coronal
plasma was formed while the fibre diameter remained almost unchanged. This low
density corona was carrying almost all the current of the order of 10 kA. When
the current had built up, the implosion of the corona onto the central fibre
occurred. The implosion velocity approached the value of 2e5 m/s. When the
imploded corona had reached the fibre, the dip in dI/dt, voltage peak up to 10
kV, and XUV pulse of a 10-30 ns width were observed. XUV radiation was emitted
from several bright spots which corresponded to the interaction of m=0
instability necks with the dense core. The electron temperature and density
were approximately 80 eV and 10e25 per cubic meter, respectively. Although the
presence of a fibre did not significantly suppress MHD instabilities, they were
not disruptive. After the fibre ablation, i.e. after 500 ns, material
evaporated from electrodes started to play a dominant role. The observed plasma
column seemed to be MHD unstable and when m=0 instabilities had developed,
X-ray pulses were emitted from several hot spots, particularly near the anode.
At that time the voltage peak of up to 30 kV was detected.

three-spin entangled systems subjected to all possible combinations of local
and collective pure dephasing noise combinations. In all cases, the bipartite
entanglement decay rate is found to be greater than or equal to the
dephasing-decoherence rates and often significantly greater. This sharpens
previous results for two-spin systems [T. Yu and J. H. Eberly Phys. Rev. B 68,

  (LIRMM)","Semi-classical theory of quiet lasers. Short version","Submitted to European Journal of Physics",,,,"quant-ph",,"  This article is the shorten version of quant-phys/0610106 with a supplemented
theory and new results concerning a single-electron laser driven by a
constant-potentiel battery. ""Quiet (or sub-Poissonian) oscillators generate a
number of dissipation events whose variance is less than the mean. It was shown
in 1984 by Golubev and Sokolov that lasers driven by regular pumps are quiet in
that sense. We consider in the present paper two oscillators that should
exhibit in principle the same property. First, a reflex klystron, a vacuum tube
operating in the microwave range of frequency. Second a laser involving a
single electron permanently interacting with the field. It is unnecessary to
quantize the optical field, that is, the theory is semi-classical, yet exact.
As an example, the battery-driven one-electron laser delivers a detected noise
of 7/8 of the shot-noise level, and is therefore sub-Poissonian. Our
calculations are related to resonance-fluorescence treatments but with a
different physical interpretation. Previous theories considering excited-state
atoms regularly-injected in low-loss resonators, on the other hand, do require
light quantization. The theory presented here is restricted to above-threshold
stationary single-mode oscillators. The paper is written in such a way that
readers should be able to follow it without having to refer to quantum-optics
texts.""

state-controlled by unitary transformations generated by Lie algebras
isomorphic to sp(N) of dimension N(N+1)/2. These Lie algebras are smaller than
the respective su(N) with dimension N^2-1. We show that this reduction
constrains the Hamiltonian to have symmetric energy levels. An example of such
a system is an n-qubit system. Using a geometric representation for the quantum
wave function of a finite system, we present an explicit example that shows a
two-qubit system can be controlled by the elements of the Lie algebra sp(4)
(isomorphic to spin(5) and so(5)) with dimension ten rather than su(4) with
dimension fifteen. These results enable one to envision more efficient
algorithms for the design of fields for quantum-state engineering, and they

to a resonant cavity mode. The cavity field substantially modifies the particle
dynamics in the lattice, and for strong particle-field coupling leads to a
quantum phase with only every second site occupied. We study the growth of this
new order out of a homogeneous initial distribution for few particles as the
microscopic physics underlying a quantum phase transition. Simulations reveal
that the growth dynamics crucially depends on the initial quantum many-body
state of the particles and can be monitored via the cavity fluorescence.
Studying the relaxation time of the ordering reveals inhibited tunnelling,
which indicates that the effective mass of the particles is increased by the
interaction with the cavity field. However, the relaxation becomes very quick
for large coupling.

quite naturally to violations of Bayes' rule when considering the probability
of the conjunction of two events. Thus we suggest that in cognitive science the

regime}, the bounded-rationality regime, where the cognitive heuristics are
valid.
