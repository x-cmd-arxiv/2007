The spectra are used to construct position-velocity (PV) diagrams at several
ranges of heights above the midplane. Azimuthal velocities are directly
extracted from the PV diagrams using the envelope tracing method, and indicate
an extremely steep dropoff in rotational velocity with increasing height, with
magnitude ~30 km/s/kpc. We find evidence for a radial variation in the velocity
gradient on the receding side. We have also performed artificial observations
of galaxy models in an attempt to match the PV diagrams. The results of a
statistical analysis also favor a gradient of ~30 km/s/kpc. We compare these
results with an entirely ballistic model of disk-halo flow, and find a strong
dichotomy between the observed kinematics and those predicted by the model. The
disagreement is worse than we have found for other galaxies in previous
studies. The conclusions of this paper are compared to results from two other
galaxies, NGC 5775 and NGC 891. We find that the vertical gradient in rotation
speed, per unit EDIG scale height, for all three galaxies is consistent with a
constant magnitude (within the errors) of approximately 15-25 km/s/scaleheight,
independent of radius. This relationship is also true within the galaxy NGC

techniques still rely to a large extent on a-priori assumptions about the

flexible and unbiased approach we pursue a rigorous statistical description of
the underlying atmosphere. Based on a Markov random field model the atmospheric
structures are characterized in terms of probability densities and spatial
correlations. This approach allows us to derive a stochastic transport equation
for polarized light valid in a regime with an arbitrary fluctuating magnetic
field on finite scales. One of the key ingredients of the derived stochastic
transfer equation is the correlation length which provides an additional degree
of freedom to the transport equation and can be used as a diagnostic parameter
to estimate the characteristic length scale of the underlying magnetic field.
  It is shown that the stochastic transfer equation represents a natural
extension of the (polarized) line formation under the micro- and macroturbulent
assumption and contains both approaches as limiting cases. In particular, we
show how in an inhomogeneous atmosphere asymmetric Stokes profiles develop and
that the correlation length directly controls the degree of asymmetry and net
circular polarization (NCP). In a number of simple numerical model calculations
we demonstrate the importance of a finite correlation length for the polarized
line formation and its impact on the resulting Stokes line profiles.

(2) coronal heating from Alfven waves that have been partially reflected, then
damped by anisotropic turbulent cascade, and (3) solar wind acceleration from
gradients of gas pressure, acoustic wave pressure, and Alfven wave pressure.
The only input parameters are the photospheric lower boundary conditions for
the waves and the radial dependence of the background magnetic field along the
flux tube. For a single choice for the photospheric wave properties, our models
produce a realistic range of slow and fast solar wind conditions by varying
only the coronal magnetic field. Specifically, a 2D model of coronal holes and
streamers at solar minimum reproduces the latitudinal bifurcation of slow and
fast streams seen by Ulysses. The radial gradient of the Alfven speed affects
where the waves are reflected and damped, and thus whether energy is deposited
below or above the Parker critical point. As predicted by earlier studies, a
larger coronal ``expansion factor'' gives rise to a slower and denser wind,
higher temperature at the coronal base, less intense Alfven waves at 1 AU, and
correlative trends for commonly measured ratios of ion charge states and
FIP-sensitive abundances that are in general agreement with observations. These
models offer supporting evidence for the idea that coronal heating and solar
wind acceleration (in open magnetic flux tubes) can occur as a result of wave
dissipation and turbulent cascade. (abridged abstract)

morphology varies but all the tails are extended well beyond the optical radii
on one side. These galaxies are found in intermediate-low density regions
(0.6-1 Mpc in projection from M87). The tails are all pointing roughly away
from M87, suggesting that these tails may have been created by a global cluster
mechanism. While the tidal effects of the cluster potential are too small, a
rough estimate suggests that simple ram-pressure stripping indeed could have
formed the tails in all but two cases. At least three systems show HI
truncation to within the stellar disk, providing evidence for a gas-gas
interaction. Although most of these galaxies do not appear disturbed optically,
some have close neighbors, suggesting that tidal interactions may have moved
gas outwards making it more susceptible to the ICM ram-pressure or viscosity.
Indeed, a simulation study of one of the tail galaxies, NGC 4654, suggests that
the galaxy is most likely affected by the combined effect of a gravitational
interaction and ram-pressure stripping. We conclude that these one-sided HI
tail galaxies have recently arrived in the cluster, falling in on highly radial
orbits. It appears that galaxies begin to lose their gas already at
intermediate distances from the cluster center through ram-pressure or
turbulent viscous stripping and tidal interactions with neighbours, or a
combination of both.

existence of the low-mass, helium-enriched PG1159 stars. We assess the
overstability of pulsation g-modes of stellar models as evolution proceeds
along the PG1159 domain. Stellar models are extracted from the full evolution
of a 1 Mo model star that experiences its first thermal pulse as a late thermal
pulse (LTP) after leaving the AGB. The evolutionary stages corresponding to the
born-again episode and the subsequent helium sub-flashes are taken into account
in detail. Under reasonable mass-loss rate assumptions, the evolutionary
scenario reproduces the high helium abundances observed in some PG1159 stars.
We find that, despite the high helium abundance in the driving layers, there
exists a narrow region in the log g-log Teff diagram for which the
helium-enriched PG1159 sequence exhibits unstable pulsation modes with periods
in the range 500 to 1600 s. In particular, the nonpulsating helium-enriched
PG1159 star, MCT 0130-1937, is located outside the theoretical instability
domain. Our results suggest that MCT 0130-1937 is a real non-pulsating star and
that the lack of pulsations should not be attributed to unfavorable geometry.
Our study hints at a consistent picture between the evolutionary scenario that
could explain the existence of helium-enriched PG1159 stars and the nonvariable
nature of MCT 0130-1937. We also present theoretical support for the unusually
high helium abundance observed in the nonpulsating PG1159 star HS 1517+7403. We
suggest that HS 1517+7403 could be a transition object linking the low-mass
helium-rich O(He) stars with the helium-enriched PG1159 stars via the
evolutionary connection K1-27-->HS 1517+7403-->MCT 0130-1937.

as a function of q and theta. However, there is evidence for a shallow U-shaped

larger scales (s=7 and 10 h-1 Mpc), the U-shaped anisotropy in Qz (with theta)
is more clearly detected. We compare this shape-dependence in Qz(s,q,theta)

observed number density of LRGs, the (redshift-space) two-point correlation
function and Qz provides a strong constraint on the allowed HOD parameters
(M_min, M_1, alpha) and breaks key degeneracies between these parameters. For
example, our observed Qz disfavors mock catalogues that overpopulate massive

The mean number of visits in the the case of the Levy flights in 1D was

physical explanation in the relativistic Larmor gyro-radius which is energy
dependent. The mathematical solution of the diffusion equation in 1D with

The concentration of cosmic rays is a function of the distance from the nearest

dip in the broad-band light curve. Before the dip the variability can be
described as arising from changes in shape and normalisation of the spectral
components. Only changes in normalisation are manifested after the dip. The
change in the mode of behaviour occurs on dynamically short timescales in I Zw
1. The data suggest that the accretion-disc corona in I Zw 1 could have two
components that are co-existing. The first, a uniform, physically diffuse
plasma responsible for the ""typical'' long-term (e.g. years) behaviour; and a
second compact, centrally located component causing the rapid flux and spectral
changes. This compact component could be the base of a short or aborted jet as
sometimes proposed for radio-quiet active galaxies. Modelling of the average

identification of the thickness of the Knudsen layer is established: a rapid
deterioration in Navier-Stokes-order prediction of the heat flux is found to
occur in the Knudsen layer. For (experimental) systems in which heat flux
measurements are not easily obtained, a rule-of-thumb for estimating the
Knudsen layer thickness follows, namely that such effects are evident within
2.5 (local) mean free paths of a given boundary. Second, comparisons of
simulation and experimental data with Navier-Stokes order theory are used to
provide a measure as to when Knudsen layer effects become non-negligible.
Specifically, predictions that do not account for the presence of a Knudsen
layer appear reliable for Knudsen layers collectively composing up to 20% of
the domain, whereas deterioration of such predictions becomes apparent when the
domain is fully comprised of the Knudsen layer.

shift of basal closed packed planes and appearance of the long-range magnetic
order. Competition between these two factors from one side and lattice
compression below $T_{\alpha\beta}$ from another produces non monotonic
temperature dependence of lattice parameter $b$ (along monoclinic axis). Steep
decrease of the sound velocities in the vicinity of $T_{\alpha\beta}$ can be
explained by the softening of the lattice with respect to shift of the

point. We anticipate an analogous softening of sound velocities in the vicinity

parallel to the direction of magnetization and which have a detrimental effect
on the trapped field. These effects may lead to a long-term decay of the
magnetization of the bulk sample. In the present work, we analyze both
experimentally and numerically the remagnetization process of a melt-processed
YBCO single domain that has been partially demagnetized by a magnetic field
applied orthogonal to the initial direction of trapped flux. Magnetic torque
measurements are used as a tool to probe changes in the remanent magnetization
during various sequences of applied field. The application of a small magnetic
field between the transverse cycles parallel to the direction of original
magnetization results in partial remagnetization of the sample. Rotating the
applied field, however, is found to be much more efficient at remagnetizing the
bulk material than applying a magnetizing field pulse of the same amplitude.
The principal features of the experimental data can be reproduced qualitatively
using a two-dimensional finite-element numerical model based on an E-J power
law. Finally, the remagnetization process is shown to result from the complex
modification of current distribution within the cross-section of the bulk

hydrogen atom and the graphene temperature. The dependence can be explained by
the following mechanisms: (1) The hydrogen atom receives repulsive force by

the graphene transforms its structure to the ``overhang'' configuration such as

a unique kind of action for a covariant gravity theory. In other words, it is
shown to exist a one-to-one correspondence between the three classes of

Einstein-Palatini, and Holst actions. Furthermore, it arises naturally, from
Lounesto spinor field classification, that any other class of spinor field
(Weyl, Majorana, flagpole, or flag-dipole spinor fields) yields a trivial
(zero) QSL, up to a boundary term. To investigate this boundary term we do not
impose any constraint on the Dirac spinor field, and consequently we obtain new
terms in the boundary component of the QSL. In the particular case of a
teleparallel connection, an axial torsion 1-form current density is obtained.
New terms are also obtained in the corresponding Hamiltonian formalism. We then
discuss how these new terms could shed new light on more general

effective $\phi$-Lagrangian $p(\phi,X)$ depends quadratically upon the kinetic
term $X$. Hence TMT represents an explicit example of the effective k-essence
resulting from first principles without any exotic term in the underlying
action intended for obtaining this result. Depending of the choice of regions
in the parameter space (but without fine tuning), TMT exhibits interesting
outputs for cosmological dynamics, for example: a) Absence of initial
singularity of the curvature while its time derivative is singular. This is a
sort of ""sudden"" singularities studied by Barrow on purely kinematic grounds.
b) Power law inflation in the subsequent stage of evolution which ends with a
graceful exit into the state with zero cosmological constant (CC). c)
Possibility of resolution of the old CC problem. From the point of view of TMT,
it becomes clear why the old CC problem cannot be solved (without fine tuning)

accompanied by some subtleties if done in a proper mathematical manner.
Although the model seems to be almost trivial, is shows many interesting
features which are useful for the understanding of the convergence behavior of
perturbation theory in general. Some important facts in connection with the
basic principles of quantum field theory and distribution theory are
highlighted, and a remark is made on possible generalizations of the
distribution spaces used in local quantum field theory. A short discussion how
one can view the spontaneous breakdown of gauge symmetry in massive gauge
theories within a massless framework is presented.

  The situation changes when we assume that the polynomials have all their
zeroes in the convex body K. This problem of lower bound for Markov factors was
first investigated by Tur\'an in 1939. Tur\'an showed ||p'|| \ge n/2 ||p|| for
the unit disk D and ||p'|| > c \sqrt{n} ||p|| for the unit interval I:=[-1,1].
Soon after that, J. Er\H od published a long article, discussing various
extensions of the results and methods of Tur\'an.
  For decades, Er\H od's paper was quoted only for the explicit calculation of
the exact constant of the interval case. However, in recent years Levenberg and

of work we realized the role of the ``generalized Minkowski functional'', to
which we devoted a throughout survey. Resulting from this, infinite dimensional
extensions of Chebyshev's extremal problems were tackled successfully.
Investigating Bernstein-Markov constants for homogeneous polynomials of real

first unexpected connections of polarization constants of R^2 and C^2 to
Chebyshev constants of S^2 and S^3, respectively. In the study of polarization
constants, a further application of potential theory occurred. This led us to
realize that the theory of rendezvous numbers can be much better explained by
potential theory, too. Our methods for obtaining Bernstein type pointwise
gradient estimates for polynomials were compared in a recent case study to the
yields of pluripotential theoretic methods. The findings were that the two
rather different methods give exactly the same results, but the two currently

cokernel (in the abelian category of cyclic modules) of the ``restriction map''
defined by the inclusion of the ideles class group of a global field in the
noncommutative adeles class space. Weil's explicit formula can then be
formulated as a Lefschetz trace formula for the induced action of the ideles
class group on this cohomology. In this formulation the Riemann hypothesis
becomes equivalent to the positivity of the relevant trace pairing. This result
suggests a possible dictionary between the steps in the Weil proof and
corresponding notions involving the noncommutative geometry of the adeles class
space, with good working notions of correspondences, degree and codegree etc.

  systems","18 Pages, 7 figures",,,,"math.DS",,"  This paper is in the form of an essay. It defines fractal tops and code space
structures associated with set-attractors of hyperbolic iterated function
systems (IFSs). The fractal top of an IFS is associated with a certain shift
invariant subspace of code space, whence the entropy of the IFS, and of its
set-attractor, may be defined. Given any ordered pair of hyperbolic IFSs, each
with the same number of maps, there is a natural transformation, constructed
with the aid of fractal tops, whose domain is the attractor A of the first IFS
and whose range is contained in the attractor B of the second IFS. This
transformation is continuous when the code space structure of the IFS is
""contained in"" the code space structure of the second IFS, and is a
homeomorphism between A and B when the code space structures are the same.
Conversely, if two IFS are homeomorphic then they possess the same code space
structure. Hence we obtain that two IFS attractors are homeomorphic then they
have the same entropy. Several examples of fractal transformations and fractal
homeomphisms are given.

`subordination branches'. Using orthogonal independence, we derive
decompositions of subordination branches and related decompositions of s-free

Schr\""{o}dinger equations are studied. It is first shown that these
interactions exhibit similar fractal dependence on initial conditions for
different nonlinearities. Then by using the Karpman-Solov'ev method, a
universal system of dynamical equations is derived for the velocities,
amplitudes, positions and phases of interacting solitary waves. These dynamical
equations contain a single parameter, which accounts for the different forms of
nonlinearity. When this parameter is zero, these dynamical equations are
integrable, and the exact analytical solutions are derived. When this parameter
is non-zero, the dynamical equations exhibit fractal structures which match
those in the original wave equations both qualitatively and quantitatively.
Thus the universal nature of fractal structures in the weak interaction of
solitary waves is analytically established. The origin of these fractal
structures is also explored. It is shown that these structures bifurcate from
the initial conditions where the solutions of the integrable dynamical
equations develop finite-time singularities. Based on this observation, an
analytical criterion for the existence and locations of fractal structures is
obtained. Lastly, these analytical results are applied to the generalized
nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equations with various nonlinearities such as the
saturable nonlinearity, and predictions on their weak interactions of solitary
waves are made.

states in light nuclei. We clarify that the monopole excitation to cluster
states is in general strong as to be comparable with the single particle
strength and shares an appreciable portion of the sum rule value in spite of
large difference of the structure between the cluster state and the
shell-model-like ground state. We argue that the essential reasons of the large
strength are twofold. One is the fact that the clustering degree of freedom is
possessed even by simple shell model wave functions. The detailed feature of
this fact is described by the so-called Bayman-Bohr theorem which tells us that
SU(3) shell model wave function is equivalent to cluster model wave function.
The other is the ground state correlation induced by the activation of the
cluster degrees of freedom described by the Bayman-Bohr theorem. We
demonstrate, by deriving analytical expressions of monopole matrix elements,
that the order of magnitude of the monopole strength is governed by the first
reason, while the second reason plays a sufficient role in reproducing the data
up to the factor of magnitude of the monopole strength. Our explanation is made
by analysing three examples which are the monopole excitations to the $0^+_2$
and $0^+_3$ states in $^{16}$O and the one to the $0^+_2$ state in $^{12}$C.
The present results imply that the measurement of strong monopole transitions
or excitations is in general very useful for the study of cluster states.

  validation",,,"10.1109/TAP.2007.912959",,"physics.optics",,"  Practical design parameters of resonant metamaterials, such as loss tangent,
are derived in terms of the quality factor $Q$ of the resonant effective medium
permeability or permittivity. Through electromagnetic simulations of loop-based
resonant particles, it is also shown that the $Q$ of the effective medium
response is essentially equal to the $Q$ of an individual resonant particle.
Thus, by measuring the $Q$ of a single fabricated metamaterial particle, the
effective permeability or permittivity of a metamaterial can be calculated
simply and accurately without requiring complex simulations, fabrication, or
measurements. Experimental validation shows that the complex permeability
analytically estimated from the measured $Q$ of a single fabricated
self-resonant loop agrees with the complex permeability extracted from $S$
parameter measurements of a metamaterial slab to better than 20%. This $Q$
equivalence reduces the design of a metamaterial to meet a given loss
constraint to the simpler problem of the design of a resonant particle to meet
a specific $Q$ constraint. This analysis also yields simple analytical
expressions for estimating the loss tangent of a planar loop magnetic
metamaterial due to ohmic losses. It is shown that $\tan \delta \approx 0.001$
is a strong lower bound for magnetic loss tangents for frequencies not too far
from 1 GHz. The ohmic loss of the metamaterial varies inversely with the
electrical size of the metamaterial particle, indicating that there is a loss
penalty for reducing the particle size at a fixed frequency.

arbitrary length against decoherence. We introduce two new families of quantum
convolutional codes. Our construction is based on an algebraic method which
allows to construct classical convolutional codes from block codes, in
particular BCH codes. These codes have the property that they contain their
Euclidean, respectively Hermitian, dual codes. Hence, they can be used to
define quantum convolutional codes by the stabilizer code construction. We
compute BCH-like bounds on the free distances which can be controlled as in the
case of block codes, and establish that the codes have non-catastrophic
encoders.

and quantum state transfer of a quantized probe light in an ensemble of
$\Lambda $-type atoms. The medium is modeled as uniformly distributed two-level
atoms with same energy level spacing, coupling to a probe light. This coupled
system can be simplified to a collection of two-mode polaritons which couple to
one transition of the $\Lambda$-type atoms. We show that, when the other
transition of $\Lambda$-type atoms is controlled by a classical light, the
electromagnetically induced transparency can also occur for the polaritons. In
this case the coherent storage and quantum transfer for photon states are
achievable through the novel dark states with respect to the polaritons. By
calculating the corresponding dispersion relation, we find the ensemble of the
three-level atoms with $\Lambda$-type transitions may serve as quantum memory
for it slows or even stops the light propagation through the mechanism of
electromagnetically induced transparency. the corresponding dispersion

cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and linear optics, in which each atom is

Our scheme is robust to imperfect factors such as dissipation, photon loss, and

states encoded in pairs of photon polarizations using only linear optics.
However, hyperentanglement, the simultaneous entanglement in more than one
degree of freedom, has been shown to assist the complete Bell analysis of the
four Bell states (given a fixed state of the other degrees of freedom). Yet
introducing other degrees of freedom also enlarges the total number of
Bell-like states. We investigate the limits for unambiguously distinguishing
these Bell-like states. In particular, when the additional degree of freedom is
qubit-like, we find that the optimal one-shot discrimination schemes are to
group the 16 states into 7 distinguishable classes, and that an unambiguous
discrimination is possible with two identical copies.

quantum theoretical setting. In this model, the state and dynamics of a movable
wall that has the double slits in it, as well as the state of a particle
incoming to the double slits, are described by quantum mechanics. Using this
model, we analyzed complementarity between exhibiting the interference pattern
and distinguishing the particle path. Comparing the Kennard-Robertson type and
the Ozawa-type uncertainty relations, we conclude that the uncertainty relation
involved in the double-slit experiment is not the Ozawa-type uncertainty
relation but the Kennard-type uncertainty relation of the position and the
momentum of the double-slit wall. A possible experiment to test the
complementarity relation is suggested. It is also argued that various phenomena
which occur at the interface of a quantum system and a classical system,
including distinguishability, interference, decoherence, quantum eraser, and
weak value, can be understood as aspects of entanglement.

  Components","8 pages, 2 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.76.023803",,"quant-ph gr-qc",,"  We present an algorithmic approach to calculate the quantum-noise spectral
density of photocurrents generated by optical fields with arbitrary discrete
classical spectrum in coherent or squeezed states. The measurement scheme may
include an arbitrary number of demodulations of the photocurrent. Thereby, our
method is applicable to the general heterodyne detection scheme which is
implemented in many experiments. For some of these experiments, e.g. in
laser-interferometric gravitational-wave detectors, a reliable prediction of
the quantum noise of fields in coherent and squeezed states plays a decisive
role in the design phase and detector characterization. Still, our
investigation is limited in two ways. First, we only consider coherent and
squeezed states of the field and second, we demand that the photocurrent
depends linearly on the field's vacuum amplitudes which means that at least one
of the classical components is comparatively strong.

Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm (EPRB) experiment when time-coincidence is used to
decide which detection events should count in the analysis, and furthermore
that this suggests that it is possible to construct local realistic models that
can reproduce the quantum mechanical expectation values. In this letter we show
that these conclusions cannot be upheld since their model exploits the
so-called coincidence-time loophole. When this is properly taken into account
no startling conclusions can be drawn about local realist modelling of quantum
mechanics.
