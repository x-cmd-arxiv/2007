appearance of QSOs at high redshift. For this reason, we examine the
detectability of such structures at substantial redshift with the Atacama Large

lensed SMGs will yield excellent spatial resolution, allowing even to resolve
their massive tori at higher redshift. We discuss further the detectability of

10 micron and 18 micron in a large fraction of the sample. The analysis of the
10 micron band, along with a direct comparison with several astronomical
sources, reveals that silicate dust in symbiotic stars shows features between
the characteristic circumstellar environments and the interstellar medium. This
indicates an increasing reprocessing of grains in relation to specific
symbiotic behavior of the objects. A correlation between the central wavelength
of the 10 and 18 micron dust bands is found. By the modeling of IR spectral
lines we investigate also dust grains conditions within the shocked nebulae.
Both the unusual depletion values and the high sputtering efficiency might be
explained by the formation of SiO moleculae, which are known to be a very
reliable shock tracer. We conclude that the signature of dust chemical
disturbance due to symbiotic activity should be looked for in the outer,
circumbinary, expanding shells where the environmental conditions for grain
processing might be achieved. Symbiotic stars are thus attractive targets for
new mid-infrared and mm observations.

optical solar physics needs the substantially larger telescope apertures that
became useful with the advent of adaptive optics and viable through the DOT's

(MSSM) by an additional Abelian gauge factor U(1)' in order to solve the mu
problem do generically suffer from anomalies disrupting the gauge coupling
unification found in the MSSM. The anomalies are absent if the minimal matter
content necessitated by the mu problem is augmented with exotic matter species
having appropriate quantum numbers. Recently, it has been shown that anomaly
cancellation can also be accomplished by introducing family non-universal U(1)'
charges and non-holomoprhic soft-breaking terms. We discuss collider signatures
of anomaly-free family non-universal U(1)' model by analyzing dilepton
production in future colliders. We find that, both at LHC and NLC, one can
establish existence/absence of such a Z' boson by simply comparing the number
of dilepton production events for electron, muon and tau lepton. The signal is
free of the SM background.

deviate from carbon data. The data are in good agreement with the results of
recent calculations in the framework of the BUU model, with careful treatment
of final state interaction effects but without an explicit in-medium
modification of scalar, iso-scalar pion pairs. This means that for Ca most of

also referred to as the question of the compatibility of local spectra, has
several applications in quantum information theory. Here, we introduce the
analogue of this statement for Gaussian states for any number of modes, and
solve it in generality, for pure and mixed states, both concerning necessary
and sufficient conditions. Formally, our result can be viewed as an analogue of
the Sing-Thompson Theorem (respectively Horn's Lemma), characterizing the
relationship between main diagonal elements and singular values of a complex
matrix: We find necessary and sufficient conditions for vectors (d1, ..., dn)

elements of a strictly positive real matrix, respectively. More physically
speaking, this result determines what local temperatures or entropies are
consistent with a pure or mixed Gaussian state of several modes. We find that
this result implies a solution to the problem of sharing of entanglement in
pure Gaussian states and allows for estimating the global entropy of
non-Gaussian states based on local measurements. Implications to the actual
preparation of multi-mode continuous-variable entangled states are discussed.
We compare the findings with the marginal problem for qubits, the solution of
which for pure states has a strikingly similar and in fact simple form.
