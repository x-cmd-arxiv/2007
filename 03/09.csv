have inferred the velocity dispersion (sigma), the peak intensity (Ipeak), and
the central wavelength (lambda_c). The analysis shows that the sigma vs Ipeak

regions. They all present a supersonic narrow horizontal band that extends
across all the range of intensities and that result from the massive nuclear
star-forming regions of every galaxy. The sigma vs Ipeak diagrams present also
several inclined bands of lower intensity and an even larger sigma, arising
from the large galactic volumes that surround the main central emitting knots.
Here we also show that the sigma vs lambda_c and lambda_c vs Ipeak diagrams,
are powerful tools able to unveil the presence of high and low mass stellar
clusters, and thus allow for the possibility of inferring the star formation
activity of distant galaxies, even if these are not spatially resolved.

sphericity is strongest near the centre and decreases outwards; typical axial
ratios for the innermost parts are of the order of 0.8. The halo shape is
prolate-like in the inner parts up to a certain radius and then turns to
oblate-like. I call this inner halo structure the `halo bar' and analyse here
in depth its structure and kinematics in a representative model. It is always
considerably shorter than the disc bar. It lags the disc bar by only a few
degrees at all radii and the difference between the two bar phases increases
with distance from the centre. The two bars turn with roughly the same pattern
speed. This means that the halo bar is a slow bar, since its corotation radius
is much larger than its length. The bisymmetric component in the halo continues
well outside the halo bar in the form of an open spiral, trailing behind the
disc bar. The inner parts of the halo display some mean rotation in the same
sense as the disc rotation. This is more important for particles nearer to the
equatorial plane and decreases with increasing distance from it, but is always
much smaller than the disc rotation.

interstellar medium cannot be explained by gas-phase chemistry. In fact, the
only possible synthesis of this species appears to be production on the
surfaces of dust grains followed by desorption into the gas. Yet, evaporation
is inefficient for heavy molecules such as methanol at the typical temperature
of 10 K. It is necessary then to consider non-thermal mechanisms for
desorption. But, if such mechanisms are considered for the production of
methanol, they must be considered for all surface species. Methods: Our
gas-grain network of reactions has been altered by the inclusion of a
non-thermal desorption mechanism in which the exothermicity of surface addition
reactions is utilized to break the bond between the product species and the
surface. Our estimated rate for this process derives from a simple version of
classical unimolecular rate theory with a variable parameter only loosely
contrained by theoretical work. Results: Our results show that the chemistry of
dark clouds is altered slightly at times up to 10^6 yr, mainly by the
enhancement in the gas-phase abundances of hydrogen-rich species such as
methanol that are formed on grain surfaces. At later times, however, there is a
rather strong change. Instead of the continuing accretion of most gas-phase
species onto dust particles, a steady-state is reached for both gas-phase and
grain-surface species, with significant abundances for the former.
Nevertheless, most of the carbon is contained in an undetermined assortment of
heavy surface hydrocarbons. Conclusions: The desorption mechanism discussed
here will be better constrained by observational data on pre-stellar cores,
where a significant accretion of species such as CO has already occurred.

this involves computation of the Bayesian evidence. In this paper, we
generalise the Fisher matrix approach from the context of parameter fitting to

the same simplifying assumption of a gaussian likelihood as the Fisher matrix
approach for parameter estimation. With this `Laplace approximation' all that
is needed to compute the expected evidence is the Fisher matrix itself. We
illustrate the method with a study of how well upcoming and planned experiments
should perform at distinguishing between Dark Energy models and modified

for which planned and proposed wide-field multi-band imaging surveys will
provide suitable data, and probes of the expansion history of the Universe,

average, higher spins than relaxed systems, suggesting that the virialization
process leads to a net decrease in the value of the spin parameter. We find
that this decrease is driven by the internal redistribution of mass and angular
momentum that occurs during virialization, a process that is especially
efficient during major mergers, when high angular momentum material is pushed
beyond the virial radius of the remnant. Since such redistribution likely
affects the angular momentum of baryons and dark matter unevenly, our findings
question the common practice of identifying the specific angular momentum

the Clouds using the new velocities and a LCDM-motivated MW model with virial
mass Mvir = 1e12 Msun (e.g. Klypin et al 2002). We conclude that the Clouds are
either currently on their first passage about the MW or, if the MW can be
accurately modeled by an isothermal sphere to distances >200 kpc (i.e., Mvir >
2e12 Msun), that their orbital period and apogalacticon distance must be a
factor of two larger than previously estimated, increasing to 3 Gyr and 200
kpc, respectively. A first passage scenario is consistent with the fact that
the LMC and SMC appear to be outliers when compared to other satellite galaxies
of the MW: they are irregular in appearance and are moving faster. We discuss
the implications of this orbital analysis for our understanding of the star
formation history, the nature of the warp in the MW disk and the origin of the
Magellanic Stream (MS), a band of HI gas trailing the LMC and SMC that extends

nontrivial response of the fluid intracluster medium to the collisionless CDM
motions. We have carried out two-dimensional simulations of gas dynamics in
cluster collisions. We analyze the relative motion of the clusters, the bow
shock wave, and the contact discontinuity and relate these to X-ray data. We
focus on the ""bullet cluster,"" 1E 0657-56, a near head-on collision of
unequal-mass clusters, for which the gas density and temperature jumps across
the prominent bow shock imply a high shock velocity 4,700 km/s. The velocity of
the fluid shock has been widely interpreted as the relative velocity of the CDM
components. This need not be the case, however. An illustrative simulation
finds that the present relative velocity of the CDM halos is 16% lower than
that of the shock. While this conclusion is sensitive to the detailed initial
mass and gas density profile of the colliding clusters, such a decrease of the
inferred halo relative velocity would increase the likelihood of finding 1E

a mountain of accreted material accumulates at the magnetic poles of the star,
and that, as the mountain spreads equatorward, it is confined by, and
compresses, the equatorial magnetic field. Here, we extend previous,
axisymmetric, Grad-Shafranov calculations of the hydromagnetic structure of a
magnetic mountain up to accreted masses as high as $\Ma = 6\times
10^{-4}\Msun$, by importing the output from previous calculations (which were
limited by numerical problems and the formation of closed bubbles to $\Ma <

and loading additional mass onto the star dynamically. The rise of buoyant
magnetic bubbles through the accreted layer is observed in these experiments.
We also investigate the stability of the resulting hydromagnetic equilibria by
perturbing them in ZEUS-3D. Surprisingly, it is observed that the equilibria
are marginally stable for all $\Ma\leq 6\times 10^{-4}\Msun$; the mountain
oscillates persistently when perturbed, in a combination of Alfv\'en and
acoustic modes, without appreciable damping or growth, and is therefore not
disrupted (apart from a transient Parker instability initially, which expels $<
1 %$ of the mass and magnetic flux).

fundamental aspect of these studies is presented here: the new publicly
available software tool TiRiFiC
(http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~gjozsa/tirific.html) enables a direct fit of a
``tilted-ring model'' to spectroscopic data cubes. The algorithm generates
model data cubes from the tilted-ring parametrisation of a rotating disk, which
are automatically adjusted to reach an optimum fit via a chi-squared
minimisation method to an observed data cube. The structure of the new
software, the shortcomings of the previously available programs to produce a
tilted-ring model, and the performance of TiRiFiC are discussed. Our method is
less affected by the well-known problem of beam smearing that occurs when
fitting to the velocity field. Since with our method we fit many data points in
a data cube simultaneously, TiRiFiC is sensitive to very faint structures and
can hence be used to derive tilted-ring models significantly extending in
radius beyond those derived from a velocity field. The software is able to
parametrise HI disks of galaxies that are intersected by the line-of-sight
twice or more, i.e. if the disks are heavily warped, and/or with a significant
shift of the projected centre of rotation, and/or if seen edge-on. Furthermore,
our method delivers the surface-brightness profile of the examined galaxy in
addition to the orientational parameters and the rotation curve. In order to
derive kinematic and morphological models of disk galaxies, especially reliable
rotation curves, a direct-fit method as implemented in our code should be the
tool of choice.

similar to synchrotron-generated ones, but with some important differences. We
compare the predictions of the two emission mechanisms. By fitting

on the average an extensive number of balls, its occupation can oscillate in a

interest is the rate of decay of the expected mean squared error with the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), called the distortion SNR exponent. We first show
that using a broadcast strategy of Gunduz and Erkip, but with a different power
and rate allocation policy, the optimal distortion SNR exponent can be achieved

cases where there are additional sterile species mixed with the active
neutrinos. The effect of turbulence is taken into account and it is found that
the effect of the shock waves, while modifed, remain significant and
measurable. Supernova neutrino signals in water detectors can therefore give
unambiguous proof for the existence of sterile neutrinos, the sensitivity
extending beyond that for terrestial neutrino experiments. In addition the time
dependent modulations in the signal due to shock waves can be used to trace the
evolution of the shock wave inside the supernova.

violation find a natural explanation when new heavy Majorana neutrinos exist.
These new neutrinos appear in models with new right-handed singlets, in new
doublets of some grand unified theories and left-right symmetrical models. It
is expected that signals of new particles can be found at the CERN high-energy
hadron collider (LHC). We present signatures and distributions that can
indicate the theoretical origin of these new particles. The single and pair
production of heavy Majorana neutrinos are calculated and the model dependence
is discussed. Same-sign dileptons in the final state provide a clear signal for
the Majorana nature of heavy neutrinos, since there is lepton number violation.

estimated for three different LHC luminosities.

the annihilation of bino-like neutralino pairs to top-antitop quark pairs

ensuring that the thermal relic dark matter density is not too large, with only
a small role played by coannihilations. The lightest superpartner mass must

top quark. These conditions have important implications for collider searches.

quantum-stabilized AdS vacua as near-horizon regions of new kinds of quantum
extremal black objects in the higher-dimensional space--near critical black
strings in 4D, near-critical black holes in 3D. The violation of the
null-energy condition by the Casimir energy is crucial for these horizons to
exist, as has already been realized for analogous non-extremal 3D black holes
by Emparan, Fabbri and Kaloper. The new extremal 3D black holes are
particularly interesting--they are (meta)stable with an entropy independent of

non-supersymmetric twistor Yang-Mills theory at loop level using the background
field method. For an appropriate partial quantum field gauge choice it is shown
the calculation of the effective action is equivalent to (the twistor lift of)
the calculation in ordinary Yang-Mills theory in the Chalmers and Siegel

the twistor version of Yang-Mills theory is just as renormalizable in this

calculate S-matrix elements at loop level are presented. In principle the
technique described in this paper generates consistent quantum completions of

in a conformal field theoretic approach, leading to nonanticommutative
structures. In contrast to several discussions, in which boundary conditions
are taken as Dirac constraints, we first obtain the mode algebra by using the
newly proposed normal ordering, which satisfies both equations of motion and
boundary conditions. Using these the anticommutator among the fermionic string
coordinates is obtained. Interestingly, in contrast to the bosonic case, this
new normal ordering plays an important role in uncovering the underlying
nonanticommutative structure between the fermionic string coordinates. We feel
that our approach is more transparent than the previous ones and the results we

interest is the study of lattice models coming from statistical physics. The
Fourier transform of noise-sensitive lattice models is concentrated on high
eigenvalues and is described by ""large"" stochastic geometric objects. Noise
sensitivity occurs quite surprisingly in various models like critical
percolation, and is forced by certain symmetry conditions.
  It appears that basic models from high-energy physics are noise stable; This
is the impression from the basic mathematical frameworks used for describing
them, and also from the description in terms of particles and interactions
involving a small number of particles.
  More general stochastic models with noise-sensitive components will not make
a difference in measurements involving particles and their interactions, but
may provide additional modeling power to proceed where current models are

theory. A standard axiom of quantum mechanics requires that H be Hermitian
because Hermiticity guarantees that the energy spectrum is real and that time
evolution is unitary (probability-preserving). This paper describes an
alternative formulation of quantum mechanics in which the mathematical axiom of
Hermiticity (transpose + complex conjugate) is replaced by the physically
transparent condition of space-time reflection (PT) symmetry. If H has an
unbroken PT symmetry, then the spectrum is real. Examples of PT-symmetric
non-Hermitian quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians are H=p^2+ix^3 and H=p^2-x^4.
Amazingly, the energy levels of these Hamiltonians are all real and positive!
In general, if H has an unbroken PT symmetry, then it has another symmetry
represented by a linear operator C. Using C, one can construct a
time-independent inner product with a positive-definite norm. Thus,
PT-symmetric Hamiltonians describe a new class of complex quantum theories
having positive probabilities and unitary time evolution. The Lee Model is an
example of a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. The renormalized Lee-model Hamiltonian
has a negative-norm ""ghost"" state because renormalization causes the
Hamiltonian to become non-Hermitian. For the past 50 years there have been many
attempts to find a physical interpretation for the ghost, but all such attempts
failed. Our interpretation of the ghost is simply that the non-Hermitian Lee
Model Hamiltonian is PT-symmetric. The C operator for the Lee Model is
calculated exactly and in closed form and the ghost is shown to be a physical
state having a positive norm. The ideas of PT symmetry are illustrated by using
many quantum-mechanical and quantum-field-theoretic models.

closedness of the 2-form on the base implies the closedness on the moduli
space, which provides a stock of symplectic structures on moduli spaces (Mukai,
Kobayashi, O'Grady, Tyurin, Huybrechts--Lehn). A parallel theory was developed
for bivector fields and Poisson structures (Bottacin).
  However, there exist symplectic moduli spaces of sheaves over bases that have
no holomorphic forms at all. A well-known example (Beauville--Donagi) is the
family of lines on the cubic 4-fold Y, which can be thought of as the moduli
space parameterizing the structure sheaves of lines in Y.
  The paper produces a general construction of closed 2-forms on the moduli
spaces of sheaves, using the Atiyah class of the sheaves, and proves that this
construction provides symplectic structures in 2 examples: the first one is the
family of lines on Y, and the second one is the moduli space of sheaves which
are supported on the hyperplane sections of Y and are cokernels of the Pfaffian
representations of those hyperplane sections.

gas-fluid coupling based on the point-force approximation. Added mass, drag,
lift, and gravity are taken into account in the modeling of the motion of the
individual bubble. We find that very dilute suspensions of small non-deformable
bubbles (volume void fraction below 1%, zero Weber number and bubble Reynolds
number <10) induce a robust statistically steady drag reduction (up to 20%) in
the so called wavy vortex flow regime (Re = 600-2500). The Reynolds number
dependence of the normalized torque (the so-called Torque Reduction Ratio (TRR)
which corresponds to the drag reduction) is consistent with a recent series of
experimental measurements performed by Murai et al. (J. Phys. 14, 143 (2005)).
Our analysis suggests that the physical mechanism for the torque reduction in
this regime is due to the local axial forcing, induced by rising bubbles, that
is able to break the highly dissipative Taylor wavy vortices in the system. We
finally show that the lift force acting on the bubble is crucial in this
process. When neglecting it, the bubbles preferentially accumulate near the
inner cylinder and the bulk flow is less efficiently modified.

electromagnetic fields is considered. Using two over-simplified examples (the
Dirac-Coulomb and Dirac-oscillator fields), we report energy-levels crossing as
a spectral property or as an effect of the hidden supersymmetric quantum
mechanical language and/or quasi-parity signatures. Under different settings of
the related interactions' way-of-coupling into Dirac equation, it is observed
that the two ultimate/effective descendents, Dirac-Coulomb and
Dirac-oscillator, exhibit different conditions on the energy-levels crossings.
