the cluster is observed shortly after the first core-passage of a massive
infalling subcluster, which is preceded by a prominent bow shock with Mach
number M~3. The inferred shock velocity of ~4700 km/s has been commonly
interpreted as the velocity of the `bullet' subcluster itself. This velocity is
unexpectedly high in the LCDM cosmology, which may require non-trivial
modifications in the dark sector to be accommodated if taken at face value.
Here we present explicit hydrodynamical toy models of galaxy cluster mergers
which very well reproduce the observed dynamical state of 1E0657-56 and the
mass models inferred from gravitational lensing observations. However, despite
a shock speed of 4500 km/s, the subcluster's mass centroid is moving only with
2600 km/s in the rest frame of the system. The difference arises in part due to
a gravitationally induced inflow velocity of the gas ahead of the shock, which
amounts to ~1100 km/s for our assumed 10:1 mass ratio of the merger. A second
effect is that the shock front moves faster than the subcluster itself. A
generic LCDM collision model, where a bullet subcluster with concentration
c=7.2 merges with a parent cluster with concentration c=3 on a zero-energy
orbit, reproduces all the main observational features seen in 1E0657-56 with
good accuracy, suggesting that 1E0657-56 is well in line with expectations from
standard cosmological models. In theories with an additional 5th-force in the
dark sector, the subcluster can be accelerated beyond the velocity reached in
LCDM, and the spatial offset between the X-ray peak and the mass centroid of
the subcluster can be significantly enlarged. (abridged)

tentative classification of explosive phenomena according to the value of the
average local magnetic field affecting the burning and the type of stellar
system in which this conversion is taking place is presented. As a general
result, we conclude that ""short"" conversion timescales are always favored,
since the burning falls in either the turbulent Rayleigh-Taylor (or even the
distributed) regime, or perhaps in the detonation one. In both cases the
velocity is several orders of magnitude larger than $v_{lam}$, and therefore
the latter is irrelevant in practice for this problem. Interesting perspectives

spectral line observations. The 13CO and 1.2 mm emission reveals the presence
of a dense core located behind the bright rim of the cloud which is
approximately coincident with that of the IRAS point source. From an analysis
of the IRAS and 1.2mm fluxes we derive a dust temperature of ~30 K, a
luminosity of 1.6x10^4 L\odot and estimate the core mass to be ~570 M\odot. The
higher resolution ammonia observations resolve the 1.2mm core into two distinct
cores, one directly behind the cloud's rim (Core A) and the second located
slightly farther back (Core B). Comparing the morphology of Core A with that of
the photon-dominated region and ionised boundary layer leaves little doubt that
it is being strongly affected by the ionisation front. 2MASS and GLIMPSE
archive data which reveal a small cluster of three deeply embedded high- and
intermediate-mass young stellar objects towards Core A leads us to conclude
that the star formation found towards this core has been triggered. In stark
contrast, Core B appears to have a much simpler, almost spherical, morphology.
No stars are found towards Core B. The scenario that emerges from our analysis
is one where the two ammonia cores pre-date the arrival of the ionisation
front. Since its arrival the over-pressure of the ionised gas at the surface of
the cloud has driven shocks into the surface layers of the cloud. The
propagation of these shocks through Core A have triggered the formation of a
small cluster of massive stars, however, the shock front has not yet propagated
deeply enough into the cloud to have affected the evolution of Core B.

are presented for the approaching jet from DG Tau, CW Tau, HH 30 and the
bipolar jet from TH 28. Systematic asymmetries in Doppler shift were detected
across the jet, within 100 AU from the star. At optical wavelengths, radial
velocity differences were typically 10 to 25 (+/-5) km/s, while differences in
the NUV range were consistently lower at typically 10 (+/-5) km/s. Results are
interpreted as possible rotation signatures. Importantly, there is agreement
between the optical and NUV results for DG Tau. Under the assumption of steady
magnetocentrifugal acceleration, the survey results lead to estimates for the
distance of the jet footpoint from the star, and give values consistent with
earlier studies. In the case of DG Tau, for example, we see that the higher
velocity component appears to be launched from a distance of 0.2 to 0.5 AU from
the star along the disk plane, while the lower velocity component appears to
trace a wider part of the jet launched from as far as 1.9 AU. The results for
the other targets are similar. Therefore, if indeed the detected Doppler
gradients trace rotation within the jet then, under the assumption of steady
MHD ejection, the derived footpoint radii support the existence of magnetized
disk winds. However, since we do not resolved the innermost layers of the flow,
we cannot exclude the possibility that there also exists an X-wind or stellar

around a super-massive black hole. Assuming that the
magneto-rotational-instability (MRI) responsible for generating the turbulent
stresses inside the disc is also the source for a magnetically dominated
corona, a fraction of the power released when the disc matter accretes is
transported to and dissipated in the corona. This has major effect on the
structure of the disc and its gravitational (in)stability according to our
analytical and self-consistent solutions. We determine the radius where the
disc crosses the inner radius of gravitational instability and forms the first
stars. Not only the location of this radius which may extend to very large
distances from the central black hole, but also the mass of the first stars
highly depends on the input parameters, notably the viscous coefficient, mass
of the central object and the accretion rate. For accretion discs around
quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and the Galactic center, we determine the
self-gravitating radius and the mass of the first clumps. Comparing the cases
with a corona and without a corona for typical discs around QSOs or the
Galactic center, when the viscosity coefficient is around 0.3, we show that the
self-gravitating radius decreases by a factor of approximately 2, but the mass
of the fragments increases with more or less the same factor. Existence of a
corona implies a more gravitationally unstable disc according to our results.
The effect of a corona on the instability of the disc is more effective when
the viscosity coefficient increases.

this survey is to make a census of the HI-rich galaxies and high-velocity
clouds (HVCs) within these groups and compare these populations with those in
the Local Group. The Parkes observations covered the entire volume of each
group with a rms M(HI) sensitivity of 4-10x10^5 M(sun) per 3.3 km/s channel.
All potential sources detected in the Parkes data were confirmed with ATCA
observations at ~2' resolution and the same M(sun) sensitivity. All the
confirmed sources have associated stellar counterparts; no starless HI
clouds--HVC analogs--were found in the six groups. In this paper, we present a
description of the survey parameters, its sensitivity and completeness. Using
the population of compact HVCs (CHVCs) around the Milky Way as a template
coupled with the detailed knowledge of our survey parameters, we infer that our
non-detection of CHVC analogs implies that, if similar populations exist in the
six groups studied, the CHVCs must be clustered within 90 kpc of group
galaxies, with average M(HI) < 4x10^5 M(sun) at the 95% confidence level. The
corollary is that the same must apply to Milky Way CHVCs. This is consistent
with our previous results from a smaller sample of groups, and in accordance
with recent observational and theoretical constraints from other authors. These
results confirm that there is very little neutral matter around galaxies, and
that any substantial reservoir of baryons must be in other phases.

the blue sequence to the red sequence. We propose a simple technique for
constraining this mass flux using the volume corrected number density in the

indexes H-delta-a and D_n(4000), and a simple prescription for spectral
evolution using a quenched star formation history. We exploit the excellent
separation of red and blue sequences in the NUV-r band color-magnitude diagram.
The final value we measure, 0.033 M_sun yr^-1 Mpc^-3, is strictly speaking an
upper limit due to the possible contributions of bursting, composite, and
extincted galaxies. However, it compares favorably with estimates of the
average mass flux that we make based on the red luminosity function evolution
derived from the DEEPII and COMBO-17 surveys (Bell et al 2004; Faber et al.

average on-going star formation of 0.037$ M_sun yr^-1 Mpc^-3 over 0<z<1 is
balanced by mass flux off the blue sequence. We explore the nature of the
galaxies in the transition zone with particular attention to the frequency and
impact of AGNs. The AGN fraction peaks in the transition zone. We find

order to provide robust empirical evidence for this, the researcher must
understand all possible biases affecting the derivation of the stellar mass

out to be highly non-trivial relying on an exact understanding of how stars
evolve, and how stellar populations in galaxies are assembled dynamically and
how individual star clusters and associations evolve. N-body modelling is
therefore an unavoidable tool in this game: the case can be made that without
complete dynamical modelling of star clusters and associations any statements
about the variation of the IMF with physical conditions are most probably
wrong. The calculations that do exist demonstrate time and again that the IMF
is invariant: There exists no statistically meaningful evidence for a variation
of the IMF from metal-poor to metal-rich populations. This means that currently
existing star-formation theory fails to describe the stellar outcome. Indirect
evidence, based on chemical evolution calculations, however indicate that
extreme star-bursts that assembled bulges and elliptical galaxies may have had
a top-heavy IMF.

sample the range 5140-5180 Angstroms, which includes the prominent magnesium

time. Grism spectroscopy is a powerful tool for efficiently identifying
interesting low luminosity, moderate redshift emission-line field galaxies. The
sources found here have a median i band flux 1.5 mag fainter than the
spectroscopic redshift catalog of Cohen et al. They have redshift z <= 1.42,
high equivalent widths (typically EW > 100{\AA}), and are usually less luminous
than the characteristic luminosity at the same redshift. The chief obstacle in
interpreting the results is line identification, since the majority of sources
have a single emission line and the spectral resolution is low. Photometric
redshifts are useful for providing a first guess redshift. However, even at the
depth of the state-of-the-art data used here, photometric errors can result in
uncertainties in line identifications, especially for sources with i > ~24.5
ABmag. Reliable line identification for the faintest emission-line galaxies
requires additional ground-based spectroscopy for confirmation. Of particular
concern are the faint high EW [OII] emitters which could represent a strongly
evolving galaxy population if the possibility that they are mis-identified

extended envelopes and their radii are larger than those in the thermal

evolution of these collision products by a one dimensional stellar evolution
code. After an initial contraction on the Kelvin-Helmholtz (thermal adjustment)
timescale (~1000-10000 yr), the evolution of the merged stars traces that of
single homogeneous stars with corresponding masses and abundances, while the
initial contraction phase shows variations which depend on the mass ratio of

rate. If most SNe took place inside galaxies, then the IGM could have been
enriched with their metals by galactic winds and jets that swept most of the
galactic gas with the SNe ejecta into the IGM. A significant fraction of the
early SNe, however, could have taken place outside galaxies or within dwarf
galaxies, which were later disrupted by tidal interactions, and/or mass loss
through fast winds, SN ejecta and jets. Little is known about such
intergalactic SNe at high red-shifts. They could have occurred primarily in
highly obscured environments, avoiding detection. Supporting evidence for
intergalactic SNe is provided by SNe associated with gamma ray bursts (GRBs)
without a host galaxy and from the ratio of well localized GRBs with and
without a host galaxy. A direct test of whether a significant contribution to

waves in accretion disks. Using the shearing box approximation, we derive the
form of these waves using a semi-analytic approach and go on to study their
stability. The results are compared to those of numerical simulations performed
using finite difference approaches such as employed by ZEUS as well as Godunov
methods. When the wave frequency is between Omega and two Omega (where Omega is
the disk orbital angular velocity), it can couple resonantly with a pair of
linear inertial waves and thus undergo a parametric instability. Neglecting the
disk vertical stratification, we derive an expression for the growth rate when
the amplitude of the background wave is small. Good agreement is found with the
results of numerical simulations performed both with finite difference and
Godunov codes. During the nonlinear phase of the instability, the flow remains
well organised if the amplitude of the background wave is small. However,
strongly nonlinear waves break down into turbulence. In both cases, the
background wave is damped and the disk eventually returns to a stationary
state. Finally, we demonstrate that the instability also develops when density
stratification is taken into account and so is robust. This destabilisation of
freely propagating nonlinear sound waves may be important for understanding the
complicated behaviour of density waves in disks that are unstable through the
effects of self-gravity or magnetic fields and is likely to affect the
propagation of waves that are tidally excited by objects such as a protoplanet
or companion perturbing a protoplanetary disk. The nonlinear wave solutions
described here as well as their stability properties were also found to be
useful for testing and comparing the performance of different numerical codes.

becoming the first definitive extrasolar planet imaged directly. We present a
multi-epoch deep differential imaging survey performed with NACO-SDI at the VLT
with the aim of finding the planet. The results are combined with recent
astrometry in an attempt to further constrain the detection limits. No
convincing candidate is found among the many coherent structures that
constitute the residual speckle noise, which is the dominant noise at small
angular scales. We present our detection limits, compare them with the
estimated brightness of $\epsilon$ Eri b, and analyze how the limits can be
improved further. It is found that integration time remains a very important
parameter for achieving good results, even in the speckle-dominated regimes.
The results yield new, improved upper 3$\sigma$ limits on the absolute H-band
(1.6 $\mu$m) brightness of the 1.55 $M_{\rm jup}$ companion of 19.1 to 19.5
mag, depending on the specific age of the system.

in both the stationary and the dynamic regimes. The stationary flow, set up as
a dynamical system, has been shown to be greatly unstable to even the minutest
possible deviation in the boundary condition for transonicity. With the help of
a simple analytical model, and some numerical modelling, it has then been
argued that the flow indeed becomes transonic and stable, when the evolution of
the flow is followed through time. The time-dependent approach also shows that
there is a remarkable closeness between an equation of motion for a

Eggleton et al. (2006) have proposed that a molecular weight inversion created
by the 3He(3He,2p)4He reaction may be at the origin of this mixing, and relate
it to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In the present work we argue that one is
actually dealing with a double diffusive instability referred to as
thermohaline convection and we discuss its influence on the red giant branch.
We compute stellar models of various initial metallicities using the
prescription by Ulrich (1972) (extended to the case of a non-perfect gas) for
the turbulent diffusivity produced by the thermohaline instability in stellar
radiation zones. Thermohaline mixing simultaneously accounts for the observed
behaviour of the carbon isotopic ratio and of the abundances of Li, C and N on
the upper part of the red giant branch. It reduces significantly the 3He
production with respect to canonical evolution models as required by
measurements of 3He/H in galactic HII regions. Thermohaline mixing is a
fundamental physical process that must be included in stellar evolution
modeling.

the mean free path of ionizing photons our measurements of the photoionization
rate can be turned into an estimate of the ionizing emissivity. In comoving
units the inferred ionizing emissivity is nearly constant over the redshift

detected in the radio and in H-alpha. Due to the special geometry of the
galaxy, the jets emerge from the nuclear region through the galactic disk. Also
the distribution of molecular gas looks different from that in other spiral
galaxies: [12]CO(1-0)emission has only been detected in the center and along
the jets and only up to distances of about 50 arcsec (1.8 kpc) from the
nucleus. The reason for the CO concentration along the inner jets in NGC 4258
was not understood and is the motivation for the observations presented here.
Using the IRAM interferometer, we mapped the [12]CO(1-0) emission of the
central part of NGC 4258 along the nuclear jet direction in the inner 3 kpc. We
detected two parallel CO ridges along a position angle of -25 degr with a total
length of about 80 arcsec (2.8 kpc), separated by a CO-depleted funnel with a
width of about 5 arcsec (175 pc). The H-alpha emission is more extended and
broader than the CO emission with its maximum just in between the two CO
ridges. In CO we see a peculiar velocity distribution in the iso-velocity map
and p-v diagrams. We discuss different scenarios for an interpretation and
present a model which can explain the observational results consistently. We
propose here that the concentration of CO along the ridges is due to
interaction of the rotating gas clouds with the jet's magnetic field by
ambipolar diffusion. This magnetic interaction is thought to increase the time
the molecular clouds reside near the jet thus leading to the quasi-static CO
ridge.

half-light radii, with stable star clusters always being smaller than
$\sim30$pc, while stable galaxies are always larger than $\sim120$pc. We extend
the previously known observational relationships and interpret them in terms of
a more fundamental pair of intrinsic properties of dark matter itself: dark
matter forms cored mass distributions, with a core scale length of greater than
about 100pc, and always has a maximum central massdensity with a narrow range.
The dark matter in dSph galaxies appears to be clustered such that there is a
mean volume mass density within the stellar distribution which has the very low
value of about 0.1$\Msun$ pc$^{-3}$ (about 5GeV/c$^2$ cm$^{-3}$). All dSphs
have velocity dispersions equivalent to circular velocities at the edge of
their light distributions of $\sim 15$km s$^{-1}$. In two dSphs there is
evidence that the density profile is shallow (cored) in the inner regions, and
so far none of the dSphs display kinematics which require the presence of an
inner cusp. The maximum central dark matter density derived is model dependent,
but is likely to have a mean value (averaged over a volume of radius 10pc) of
$\sim0.1\Msun$ pc$^{-3}$ (about 5GeV/c$^2$ cm$^{-3}$) for our proposed cored
dark mass distributions (where it is similar to the mean value), or
$\sim60\Msun$ pc$^{-3}$ (about 2TeV/c$^2$ cm$^{-3}$) if the dark matter density
distribution is cusped. Galaxies are embedded in dark matter halos with these
properties; smaller systems containing dark matter are not observed.

version of the SDSS/SEGUE Spectroscopic Parameter Pipeline (SSPP). In the
second case we directly model the mapping between synthetic spectra (derived
from Kurucz model atmospheres) and the atmospheric parameters, independently of
any intermediate estimates. After training, we apply our models to various
samples of SDSS spectra to derive atmospheric parameters, and compare our
results with those obtained previously by the SSPP for the same samples. We
obtain consistency between the two approaches, with RMS deviations of 150K in
Teff, 0.35dex in logg, and 0.22dex in [Fe/H]. The models are applied to
pre-processed spectra, either via Principal Components Analysis or a Wavelength
Range Selection method, which employs a subset of the full 3850-9000A spectral
range. This is both for computational reasons, and because it delivers higher
accuracy. From an analysis of cluster candidates with available SDSS
spectroscopy (M15, M13, M2, and NGC2420), we find evidence for small systematic
offsets in Teff and/or logg for the atmospheric parameter estimates from the
model trained on real data with the SSPP. Thus, this model turns out to derive
more precise, but less accurate, atmospheric parameters than the model trained
on synthetic data.

of the object, along with its ionising properties, lead to different solutions
for the ages and characteristics of the ionising stellar populations.The found
solutions are compatible with either a composite population of two ionising
clusters or a continuous star formation. In the first case, a young cluster,

and the effect that this modified circumstellar medium has on the evolution of
the ensuing supernova remnant. We compare our simulations with the

boson excitations residing on ""Bose surfaces"" in momentum space, and exhibits
power law correlations with continuously variable exponents. While the DBL can
be constructed for bosons in the 2d continuum, the state only respects the
point group symmetries of the square lattice. On the lattice the DBL respects
all symmetries and does not require a particular filling. But lattice effects
allow a second distinct phase, a quasi-local variant which we call a D-wave
Local Bose Liquid (DLBL). Remarkably, the DLBL has short-range boson
correlations and hence no Bose surfaces, despite sharing gapless excitations
and other critical signatures with the DBL. Moreover, both phases are metals
with a resistance that vanishes as a power of the temperature. We establish
these results by constructing a class of many-particle wavefunctions for the
DBL, which are time reversal invariant analogs of Laughlin's quantum Hall
wavefunction for bosons at $\nu=1/2$. A gauge theory formulation leads to a
simple mean field theory, and an N-flavor generalization enables incorporation
of gauge field fluctuations to deduce the properties of the DBL/DLBL; various
equal time correlation functions are in qualitative accord with the properties
inferred from the wavefunctions. We also identify a promising Hamiltonian which
might manifest the DBL or DLBL, and perform a variational study comparing to
other competing phases. We suggest how the DBL wavefunction can be generalized
to describe an itinerant non-Fermi liquid phase of electrons on the square

potentials optimized for Al-Ga binary alloys in a series of MD simulations of
an Al bicrystal (with a $\Sigma 5 36.9 ^{\circ} /[010]$ symmetric tilt
boundary) in contact with liquid Ga with and without an applied stress. Our
simulations clarify the mechanism of LME and how it is affected by applied
stresses. The interplay of stress and penetrating Ga atoms leads to the
nucleation of a train of dislocations on the grain boundary below the liquid
groove root which climbs down the grain boundary at a nearly constant rate. The
dislocation climb mechanism and the Ga penetration are coupled. While the
dislocations do relax part of the applied stress, the residual stresses keep
the grain boundary open, thereby allowing more, fast Ga transport to the
penetration front (i.e., Ga layer thickening process). The coupled Ga transport
and ``dislocation climb'' is the key to the anomalously fast, time-independent
penetration of Ga along grain boundaries in Al. The simulations explain a wide

equivalent 1PI effective action that depends not only on the classical atom

applying it to the many-body behavior of bosonic atoms with large scattering
length at zero temperature using an approximation in which the 2-atom amplitude

state is larger than temperature, we conclude that the single-particle picture
of the edge state in not appropriate when the electron-phonon interaction is
taken into account. The longitudinal acoustic phonon mode contributes to the
matrix element through the on-site deformation potential because the
wavefunction of the edge state has an amplitude only on one of the two
sublattices. The on-site deformation potentials for the longitudinal and
in-plane tangential optical phonon modes are enhanced at the boundary. The
results of local density of states are compared with the recent experimental
data of scanning tunneling spectroscopy.

parallel to their shortest direction (i.e. the c-axis) and then subjected to
several cycles of the application of a transverse magnetic field parallel to

Magneto-Optical Imaging (MOI). We show that all principal features of the

the suppression of the magnetic moment under the action of a transverse field
can be predicted successfully by ignoring the existence of flux-free
configurations or flux-cutting effects. These investigations show that the
observed decay in magnetization results from the intricate modification of
current distribution within the sample cross-section. It is also shown that the
model does not predict any saturation of the magnetic induction, even after a
large number (~ 100) of transverse field cycles. These features are shown to be
consistent with the experimental data.

break junctions reveal strong dependence of the conductance on the
magnetization direction, an effect known as tunneling anisotropic
magnetoresistance (TAMR). The origin of this phenomenon stems from resonant
states localized in the electrodes near the junction break. The energy and
broadening of these states is strongly affected by the magnetization
orientation due to spin-orbit coupling, causing TAMR to be sensitive to bias
voltage on a scale of a few mV. Our results bear a resemblance to recent
experimental data and suggest that TAMR driven by resonant states is a general
phenomenon typical for magnetic broken contacts and other experimental
geometries where a magnetic tip is used to probe electron transport.

applied to huge trees, e.g. in the game of go (Gelly et al., 2006). The UCT
algorithm (Kocsis and Szepesvari, 2006), a tree search method based on Upper
Confidence Bounds (UCB) (Auer et al., 2002), is believed to adapt locally to
the effective smoothness of the tree. However, we show that UCT is too
``optimistic'' in some cases, leading to a regret O(exp(exp(D))) where D is the
depth of the tree. We propose alternative bandit algorithms for tree search.
First, a modification of UCT using a confidence sequence that scales
exponentially with the horizon depth is proven to have a regret O(2^D
\sqrt{n}), but does not adapt to possible smoothness in the tree. We then
analyze Flat-UCB performed on the leaves and provide a finite regret bound with
high probability. Then, we introduce a UCB-based Bandit Algorithm for Smooth
Trees which takes into account actual smoothness of the rewards for performing
efficient ``cuts'' of sub-optimal branches with high confidence. Finally, we
present an incremental tree search version which applies when the full tree is
too big (possibly infinite) to be entirely represented and show that with high

confirmed in \cite{cond-mat/0504070/prl} \cite{cond-mat/0506053}. There it is
proved that the overlap distribution of random $k$-SAT, $k\geq 9$, has

approach in Mora et al. works in all nontrivial cases). 2. For any constraint
density value $c<1$, the set of solutions of a random instance of 2-SAT form,
w.h.p., a single cluster. Also, for and any $q\in (0,1]$ such an instance has
w.h.p. two satisfying assignment of overlap $\sim q$. Thus, as expected from

can be formulated as a free massive Klein-Gordon equation; and the

quantum constraint of density weight two which is polynomial in the basic
conjugate variables is also demonstrated to correspond to a precise simple
ordering of the operators, and may thus help to resolve the factor ordering
ambiguity in the extrapolation from classical to quantum gravity. Alternative
expression of a density weight one quantum constraint which may be more useful
in the spin network context is also discussed, but this constraint is
non-polynomial and is not motivated by factor ordering. The article also
highlights the fact that while the volume operator has become a preeminient

$K_L$ decays has been discovered in 2001 in $B_d \to \psi K_S$, followed by
$B_d \to \pi^+\pi^-$, $\eta^{\prime}K_S$ and $B \to K^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$
establishing direct CP violation also in the beauty sector. Counterintuitive,
yet central features of quantum mechanics like meson-antimeson oscillations and
EPR correlations have been crucial in making such effects observable.

insensitive and sensitive $B$, $K$ and $D$ transitions that is impressively
consistent even on the quantitative level. We know now that at least the lion's

successes do not invalidate the theoretical arguments for it being incomplete.

oscillations, the observed baryon number of the Universe, dark matter and dark

shed any light on the SM's mysteries of flavour, detailed and comprehensive
studies of heavy flavour transitions will be essential in diagnosing salient

equivariant localization. It is shown that the Faddeev-Popov procedure amounts
to a construction of a symplectic manifold with a Hamiltonian group action. The
BRST cohomology is shown to be equivalent to the equivariant cohomology based
on this symplectic manifold with Hamiltonian group action. The ghost operator
is interpreted as a (pre)symplectic form and the gauge condition as the moment
map corresponding to the Hamiltonian group action. This results in the
identification of the gauge fixing action as a closed equivariant form, the sum
of an equivariant symplectic form and a certain closed equivariant 4-form which
ensures convergence. An almost complex structure compatible with the symplectic
form is constructed. The equivariant localization principle is used to localize
the path integrals onto the gauge slice. The Gribov problem is also discussed
in the context of equivariant localization principle. As a simple illustration
of the methods developed in the paper, the partition function of N=2

with the observed anomalous electron scattering in H_2S and HCl, whose dipole
moments are smaller than the critical value D_0. We also show that for a polar

consider Schur-type inequalities for the classes of complex algebraic
polynomials having no zeroes within the unit disk D.
  The class of polynomials with no zeroes in D - also known as Bernstein- or
Lorentz-class - was studied in detail earlier. For real polynomials utilizing
the Bernstein-Lorentz representation as convex combinations of fundamental
polynomials (1-x)^k(1+x)^{n-k}, G. Lorentz, T. Erd\'elyi and J. Szabados proved
a number of improved versions of Schur- (and also Bernstein- and Markov-) type
inequalities.
  Here we investigate the similar questions for complex polynomials. For
complex polynomials the above convex representation is not available. Even
worse, the set of complex polynomials, having no zeroes in the unit disk, does
not form a convex set. Therefore, a possible proof must go along different
lines. In fact such a direct argument was asked for by Erd\'elyi and Szabados
already for the real case.
  The sharp forms of the Bernstein- and Markov- type inequalities are known,
and the right factors are worse for complex coefficients than for real ones.
However, here it turns out that Schur-type inequalities hold unchanged even for
complex polynomials and for all monotonic, continuous weight functions. As a
consequence, it becomes possible to deduce the corresponding Markov inequality
from the known Bernstein inequality and the new Schur type inequality with
logarithmic weight.

boundary points or singularities, the tangent cone need not be a linear space
and limiting distributions other than chi-square distributions may arise. While
boundary points often lead to mixtures of chi-square distributions,
singularities give rise to nonstandard limits. We demonstrate that minima of
chi-square random variables are important for locally identifiable models, and
in a study of the factor analysis model with one factor, we reveal connections
to eigenvalues of Wishart matrices.

holomorphic dynamical systems that arise as coverings over disconnected Riemann

this, $v_2$ fluctuations can be used to estimate the Knudsen number of the
system produced at RHIC. To illustrate this quantitatively, we apply the UrQMD
model, with scaled cross sections, to show that collisions at RHIC have a
Knudsen number at least one order of magnitude above the expected value for an
interacting hadron gas. Furthermore, we argue that the Knudsen number is also
bound from above by the $v_2$ fluctuation data, because too large a Knudsen
number would break the observed scaling of $v_2$ fluctuations due to the onset
of turbulent flow. We propose, therefore that $v_2$ fluctuation measurements,
together with an understanding of the turbulent regime for relativistic
hydrodynamics, will provide an upper as well as a lower limit for the Knudsen
number.

ratio in the nuclear level density is presented, using the assumption of
Poisson distributed independent quasi particles combined with BCS occupation
numbers. It is found that it is crucial to employ a sufficiently large model
space to allow excitations both from low-lying shells and to higher shells
beyond a single major shell. Parity ratios are only found to equilibrate above
at least 5-10 MeV of excitation energy. Furthermore, an overshooting effect
close to major shells is found where the parity opposite to the ground state
parity may dominate across a range of several MeV before the parity ratio
finally equilibrates. The method is suited for large-scale calculations as
needed, for example, in astrophysical applications. Parity distributions were
computed for all nuclei from the proton dripline to the neutron dripline and
from Ne up to Bi. These results were then used to recalculate astrophysical
reaction rates in a Hauser-Feshbach statistical model. Although certain
transitions can be considerably enhanced or suppressed, the impact on
astrophysically relevant reactions remains limited, mainly due to the thermal
population of target states in stellar reaction rates.

are quark stars -not yet confirmed by observation- and the extremely dense
cores of compact stars, many of which have very large magnetic fields. To
reliably predict astrophysical signatures of color superconductivity, a better
understanding of the role of the star's magnetic field in the color
superconducting phase that realizes in the core is required. This paper is an
initial step in that direction. The field scales at which the different
magnetic phases of a color superconductor with three quark flavors can be
realized are investigated. Coming from weak to strong fields, the system
undergoes first a symmetry transmutation from a Color-Flavor-Locked (CFL) phase
to a Magnetic-CFL (MCFL) phase, and then a phase transition from the MCFL phase
to the Paramagnetic-CFL (PCFL) phase. The low-energy effective theory for the
excitations of the diquark condensate in the presence of a magnetic field is
derived using a covariant representation that takes into account all the
Lorentz structures contributing at low energy. The field-induced masses of the
charged mesons and the threshold field at which the CFL $\to$ MCFL symmetry
transmutation occurs are obtained in the framework of this low-energy effective
theory. The relevance of the different magnetic phases for the physics of
compact stars is discussed.

when the concentrations of the relevant molecules in a cell are large and
fluctuations are negligible. However, when some of the proteins in the circuit
appear in low copy numbers, fluctuations become important and the rate
equations fail. In this case stochastic methods, such as direct numerical

focus in particular on a micromaser which is pumped with a dilute beam of
excited atoms crossing the laser cavity. In the weak-coupling regime, an
expansion in the coupling strength is developed that preserves the Lindblad
form of the master equation, securing the positivity of the density matrix.
This expansion breaks rapidly down above threshold. This can be improved with
an alternative approach, not restricted to weak coupling: the Lindblad
operators are expanded in orthogonal polynomials adapted to the probability
distribution for the atom-laser interaction time. Results for the photon
statistics and the laser linewidth illustrate the theory.

irrespectively of their implementation. To illustrate the idea we introduce the
concept of entanglement-swapping boxes, i.e. we consider any quantum operations
which perform entanglement swapping, not necessarily via simple quantum
teleportation. We ask a question about the properties of such boxes., i.e. what
local operations and how much classical communication are needed to perform
them. We also ask if any box which performs entanglement swapping can be used
to establish classical communication. We show that each box needs at least two
bits of classical communication to perform it. It is also shown that each box
can be used for classical communication and, most importantly, that there exist
boxes which allow to communicate at most one bit. Surprisingly we find basic
irreversibility in the process of entanglement swapping with respect to its
communication properties.

vanishes on at least one product vector. Interestingly, the witness can always
be chosen to be decomposable. Our result changes the conceptual aspect of the

of a black-boxed biased coin flip, if it satisfies some fidelity conditions.
Although such a QCF satisfies the security conditions of a biased coin flip, it
does not realize the ideal functionality, and therefore, does not fulfill the
demands for universally composable security. Moreover, through a comparison
within a small restricted bias range, we show that an arbitrary QCF is
distinguishable from a black-boxed coin flip unless it is unbiased on both
sides of parties against insensitive cheating. We also point out the difficulty
in developing cheat-sensitive quantum bit commitment in terms of the
uncomposability of a QCF.

Bohr-Sommerfeld rules and yield all the correct quantum numbers. The geometry

  non-relativistic multispinor systems in arbitrary dimensions","62 pages",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.77.012105",,"quant-ph",,"  Two kinds of Bell-states diagonal (BSD) entanglement witnesses (EW) are
constructed by using the algebra of Dirac $\gamma$ matrices in the space-time
of arbitrary dimension $d$, where the first kind can detect some BSD
relativistic and non-relativistic $m$-partite multispinor bound entangled
states in Hilbert space of dimension $2^{m\lfloor d/2\rfloor}$, including the
bipartite Bell-type and iso-concurrence type states in the four-dimensional
space-time ($d=4$). By using the connection between Hilbert-Schmidt measure and
the optimal EWs associated with states, it is shown that as far as the spin
quantum correlations is concerned, the amount of entanglement is not a
relativistic scalar and has no invariant meaning. The introduced EWs are
manipulated via the linear programming (LP) which can be solved exactly by
using simplex method. The decomposability or non-decomposability of these EWs
is investigated, where the region of non-decomposable EWs of the first kind is
partially determined and it is shown that, all of the EWs of the second kind
are decomposable. These EWs have the preference that in the bipartite systems,
they can determine the region of separable states, i.e., bipartite
non-detectable density matrices of the same type as the EWs of the first kind
are necessarily separable. Also, multispinor EWs with non-polygon feasible
regions are provided, where the problem is solved by approximate LP, and in
contrary to the exactly manipulatable EWs, both the first and second kind of
the optimal approximate EWs can detect some bound entangled states.
