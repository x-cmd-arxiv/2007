a distance ~1 kpc (GSC 3656-1328) brightened achromatically by a factor of
nearly 40 over the span of several days and then decayed in an apparently
symmetrical way. We present a light curve of the event based on optical
photometry from the Center for Backyard Astrophysics and the All Sky Automated

are consistent with the microlensing interpretation. We discuss and reject
alternative explanations for this variability. The lens star is probably a
low-mass star or brown dwarf, with a relatively high proper motion of >20
mas/yr, and may be visible using precise optical/infrared imaging taken several
years from now. A modest, all-sky survey telescope could detect ~10 such events
per year, which would enable searches for very low-mass planetary companions to
relatively nearby stars.

process of structure in the universe. Numerical simulations of cosmic structure
formation in a hierarchical, dark matter dominated universe suggest that galaxy
cluster concentrations, which are a measure of a halo's central density,
decrease gradually with virial mass. However, cluster observations have yet to
confirm this correlation. The slopes of the run of measured concentrations with
virial mass are often either steeper or flatter than predicted by simulations.
In this work, we present the most complete sample of observed cluster
concentrations and masses yet assembled, including new measurements for 10
strong lensing clusters, thereby more than doubling the existing number of
strong lensing concentration estimates. We fit a power law to the observed
concentrations as a function of virial mass, and find that the slope is
consistent with the slopes found in simulations, though our normalization
factor is higher. Observed lensing concentrations appear to be systematically
larger than X-ray concentrations, a more pronounced effect than found in
simulations. We also find that at fixed mass, the bulk of observed cluster
concentrations are distributed log-normally, with the exception of a few
anomalously high concentration clusters. We examine the physical processes
likely responsible for the discrepancy between lensing and X-ray
concentrations, and for the anomalously high concentrations in particular. The
forthcoming Millennium simulation results will offer the most comprehensive
comparison set to our findings of an observed concentration-mass power law
relation.

that two different progenitor systems lead to similar physical processes and
that the prompt and afterglow observations of short-hard GRBs (SHBs) can be
examined using models of long GRBs. Here, I discuss three conclusions that can
be drawn from SHB observations. I show that the lower limit on the Lorentz
factor of SHBs is typically ``only'' 10-50, significantly lower than that of
long GRBs. SHBs with observed X-ray afterglow after 1 day are found to be
roughly as efficient as long GRBs in converting the outflow energy into prompt

protoplanetary disc, using a new numerical scheme that allows us to take into
consideration the global evolution of the disc, down to an arbitrarily small
inner physical radius. We find that Jovian planets do not open cavities in the
inner part of the disc (i.e. interior to their orbits) unless (a) the inner
physical edge of the disc is close to the planet's location or (b) the planet
is much more massive than the disc. In all other cases the planet simply opens
a gap in the gas density distribution, whose global profile is essentially
unchanged relative to the one that it would have if the planet were absent. We
recognize, though, that the dust distribution can be significantly different
from the gas distribution and that dust cavities might be opened in some
situations, even if the gas is still present in the inner part of the disc.
  Concerning the migration of the planet, we find that classical Type-II
migration (with speed proportional to the viscosity of the disc) occurs only if
the gap opened by the planet is deep and clean. If there is still a significant
amount of gas in the gap, the migration of the planet is generally slower than
the theoretical Type-II migration rate. In some situations, migration can be
stopped or even reversed. We develop a simple model that reproduces
satisfactorily the migration rate observed in the simulations, for a wide range
of disc viscosities and planet masses and locations relative to the inner disc
edge. Our results are relevant for extra-solar planetary systems, as they
explain (a) why some hot Jupiters did not migrate all the way down to their
parent stars and (b) why the outermost of a pair of resonant planets is

the environment in which most of the cluster members form. Here, we take
initial steps in quantifying the global properties of the protostellar
turbulence through 3D MHD simulations. We find that collimated outflows are
more efficient in driving turbulence than spherical outflows that carry the
same amounts of momentum. Gravity plays an important role in shaping the
turbulence, generating infall motions in the cluster forming region that
balance the outward motions driven by outflows. The resulting quasi-equilibrium
state is maintained through a slow rate of star formation, with a fraction of
the total mass converted into stars per free fall time as low as a few percent.
Magnetic fields are dynamically important even in magnetically supercritical
clumps, provided that their initial strengths are not far below the critical
value for static cloud support. We find that the mass weighted PDF of the
volume density is often, although not always, approximately lognormal. The PDFs
of the column density deviate more strongly from lognormal distributions. There
is a prominent break in the velocity power spectrum of the protostellar

obtained. Using the 38 confirmed redshifts, we were able to resolve, for the
first time at z > 1, kinematic structure. The velocity distribution, which is
not Gaussian at the 95% confidence level, is consistent with two groups that
are also responsible for the projected east-west elongation of the cluster. The
groups are composed of 26 and 12 galaxies with velocity dispersions of
486^{+47}_{-85} km/s and 426^{+57}_{-105} km/s, respectively. The elongation is
also seen in the intracluster gas and the dark matter distribution. This leads
us to conclude that RDCS J1252.9-2927 has not yet reached a final virial state.

Comparison with previous observations suggests that most of the jet knots
consist of persisting structures. Also, we corroborate that the HH 30-N knots
correspond to the head of the HH 30 jet. The overall HH 30 jet structure can be
well described by a wiggling ballistic jet, arising either by the orbital
motion of the jet source around a primary or by precession of the jet axis
because of the tidal effects of a companion. In the first scenario, the orbital
period would be 53 yr and the total mass 0.25-2 solar masses. In the precession
scenario, the mass of the jet source would be 0.1-1 solar masses, the orbital
period <1 yr, and the mass of the companion less than a few times 0.01 solar
masses, thus being a substellar object or a giant exoplanet. In both scenarios
a binary system with a separation <18 AU (<0.13 arcsec) is required. Since the
radius of the flared disk observed with the HST is about 250 AU, we conclude
that this disk appears to be circumbinary rather than circumstellar, suggesting
that the search for the collimating agent of the HH 30 jet should be carried
out at much smaller scales.

well with the observed eccentricity distribution for e > 0.2, but predicts too

Further, the two-planet scattering model predicts a maximum eccentricity of
about 0.8, independent of the distribution of planet mass ratios, provided that
both planets are initially place on nearly circular orbits. This compares
favorably with current observations and will be tested by future planet
discoveries. The combination of planet--planet scattering and tidal
circularization may be able to explain the existence of some giant planets with
very short period orbits. Orbital migration due to planet scattering could play
an important role in explaining the increased rate of giant planets with very
short period orbits. We also re-examine and discuss various possible
correlations between eccentricities and other properties of observed extrasolar
planets. We demonstrate that the observed distribution of planet masses,
orbital periods, and eccentricities can provide constraints for models of
planet formation and evolution.

the triaxiality parameters of gas and dark matter differ only by a few percent

prevent eccentricity growth and suppress instabilities from becoming manifest.
However, once the disk dissipates, eccentricities can grow rapidly, leading to
close encounters between planets. Strong planet--planet gravitational
scattering could produce both high eccentricities and, after tidal
circularization, very short-period planets, as observed in the exoplanet
population. We present new results for this scenario based on extensive
dynamical integrations of systems containing three giant planets, both with and
without residual gas disks. We assign the initial planetary masses and orbits

We show that, with realistic initial conditions, planet--planet scattering can
reproduce quite well the observed eccentricity distribution. Our results also
make testable predictions for the orbital inclinations of short-period giant

gas. Due to its low velocity dispersion the gas is concentrated closer to the
galactic mid-plane than the stars, and hence it strongly affects the vertical
stellar distribution even though its contribution to the total surface density
is small. We apply a three-component galactic disk model consisting of
gravitationally coupled stars and the HI and H_2 gas, embedded in the dark

steeper than the sech^2 function, and lies between the sech and an exponential

a barotropic equation of state, which is intended to capture (i) the scaling of

of the cusp. Possibly, the mass of the stars makes up only about 50% of the

clumps are detected that are concentrated at projected distances of $R=3''$ and
$R=7''$ from Sgr A*.(e) There appears to exist an under-density of horizontal

due to asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation. Recent numerical
relativity simulations suggest that the recoil velocity can be as high as a few
thousands kilometers per second for particular configurations. We consider here
the effect of a worst case scenario for orbital and phase configurations on the
hierarchical evolution of the massive black hole (MBH) population. The orbital
configuration and spin orientation in the plane is chosen to be the one
yielding the highest possible kick. Masses and spin magnitudes are instead
derived self-consistently from the MBH evolutionary models. If seeds form
early, e.g. as remnants of the first stars, almost the totality of the first
few generation of binaries are ejected. The fraction of lost binaries decreases
at later times due to a combination of the binary mass ratio distribution
becoming shallower, and the deepening of the hosts potential wells. If seeds
form at later times, in more massive halos, the retention rate is much higher.
We show that the gravitational recoil does not pose a threat to the evolution
of the MBH population that we observe locally in either case, although high
mass seeds seem to be favored. The gravitational recoil is instead a real
hazard for (i) MBHs in biased halos at high-redshift, where mergers are more
common, and the potential wells still relatively shallow. Similarly, it is very
challenging to retain (ii) MBHs merging in star clusters.

detect deeply modulated, double-peaked X-ray pulses at the period of PSR
J0737-3039A, similar in appearance to the observed radio pulses. The pulsed
fraction is ~70%. Purely non-thermal emission from pulsar A plausibly accounts
for our observations. However, the X-ray pulse morphology of A, in combination

existence of both non-thermal magnetospheric emission and a broad sinusoidal
thermal emission component from the neutron star surface. No pulsations are
detected from pulsar B, and there is no evidence for orbital modulation or
extended nebular structure. The absence of orbital modulation is consistent
with theoretical expectations of a Poynting-dominated relativistic wind at the

software which generates the low-level design of the pipeline processor and
communication software for FPGA-based computing engines (FBCEs). An FBCE
typically consists of one or multiple FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)
chips and local memory. Here, the term ""Field-Programmable"" means that one can
rewrite the logic implemented to the chip after the hardware is completed, and
therefore a single FBCE can be used for calculation of various functions, for
example pipeline processors for gravity, SPH interaction, or image processing.
The main problem with FBCEs is that the user need to develop the detailed
hardware design for the processor to be implemented to FPGA chips. In addition,
she or he has to write the control logic for the processor, communication and
data conversion library on the host processor, and application program which
uses the developed processor. These require detailed knowledge of hardware
design, a hardware description language such as VHDL, the operating system and
the application, and amount of human work is huge. A relatively simple design
would require 1 person-year or more. The PGPG software generates all necessary
design descriptions, except for the application software itself, from a
high-level design description of the pipeline processor in the PGPG language.
The PGPG language is a simple language, specialized to the description of
pipeline processors. Thus, the design of pipeline processor in PGPG language is
much easier than the traditional design. For real applications such as the
pipeline for gravitational interaction, the pipeline processor generated by
PGPG achieved the performance similar to that of hand-written code. In this
paper we present a detailed description of PGPG version 1.0.

Homogeneously Precessing Domain which we interpret as Bose condensation of spin

the language of relativistic quantum fields it is caused by interaction between
the charged and neutral fields, where the neutral field provides the potential
for the charged one. In the process of self-localization the charged field
modifies locally the neutral field so that the potential well is formed in
which the charge is condensed.

between particles by taking into account both the viscoelastic and plastic

Use of this model of restitution coefficient leads to new unexpected behaviors.
When the number of particles N is large, a loose cluster appears near the fixed
wall, opposite the vibrating wall. The pressure exerted on the walls becomes
independent of N, and linear in the vibration velocity V, quite as the granular
temperature. The collision frequency at the vibrating wall becomes independent
of both N and V, whereas at the fixed wall, it is linear in both N and V. These
behaviors arise because the velocity-dependent restitution coefficient
introduces a new time scale related to the collision velocity near the cross
over from viscoelastic to plastic deformation.

is that the distribution function of the random interaction under consideration

local energy, which is opposite to ferromagnetic systems where the Griffiths
inequality holds. Another inequality is proved for asymmetrically distributed

  Bose-Einstein Condensates","9 pages. Submitted to Physics Review A",,,,"cond-mat.other",,"  It is hypothesized that, within Bose-Einstein condensates, contaminants will
form a potential that effects the energy state of a condensate. While assuming
a system governed by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, contaminants are modelled
as boundary conditions for the wave function of the condensate. It is then
found that the energy of the system depends directly upon the distance between
contaminants. Energy is minimized as two particles either come together or move
apart depending on the nature of the condensate. This is due to the presence of
induced standing waves in the condensate between two contaminants, similar to
the attractive effect caused by standing electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, the
Casimir effect. Quantum calculations are also done to determine the expected
strength of the ""contaminant in condensate"" effect.

Dynamic Time Warping, Longest Common Subsequence or Edit Distance with Real

kind of stiffness of the elastic measure along the time axis. We show that the
similarity provided by TWED is a metric potentially useful in time series
retrieval applications since it could benefit from the triangular inequality
property to speed up the retrieval process while tuning the parameters of the

harmonics, characterized by angular indices (l,m). We find that the
Post-Newtonian equations predict remarkably well the relation between the wave
amplitude and the orbital frequency for each (l,m), and that the convergence of
the Post-Newtonian series to the numerical results is non-monotonic. To leading
order the total energy emitted in the merger phase scales like eta^2 and the
spin of the final black hole scales like eta, where eta=q/(1+q)^2 is the
symmetric mass ratio. We study the multipolar distribution of the radiation,
finding that odd-l multipoles are suppressed in the equal mass limit. Higher
multipoles carry a larger fraction of the total energy as q increases. We
introduce and compare three different definitions for the ringdown starting
time. Applying linear estimation methods (the so-called Prony methods) to the
ringdown phase, we find resolution-dependent time variations in the fitted
parameters of the final black hole. By cross-correlating information from
different multipoles we show that ringdown fits can be used to obtain precise
estimates of the mass and spin of the final black hole, which are in remarkable
agreement with energy and angular momentum balance calculations.

the CKM angle alpha it is shown that the use of uniform priors for the observed

frequentist construction resulting from a change of variables, and thus relies
neither on prior PDFs nor on Bayes' theorem. This procedure provides in this
particular case results that are similar to the Confidence Level approach, but
the treatment of mirror solutions remains incorrect and it is far from being

exact degeneracy that is expected from the remaining symmetries of the problem

reducing inference to the 68% or 95% credible interval is a misconception of

is controlled by a global phase parameter. In a large region of the parameter

pronounced. In addition, we show that in certain cases one may even have enough

the scalar field. We find that the gauge invariant effective action involves,
beyond the expected noncommutative version of the pure Yang-Mills action,
additional terms that may be interpreted as the gauge theory counterpart of the
harmonic oscillator term, which for the noncommutative $\phi^4$-theory on Moyal
space ensures renormalisability. The expression of a possible candidate for a
renormalisable action for a gauge theory defined on Moyal space is conjectured
and discussed.

based on an attractive effect between contaminants in a Bose-Einstein
Condensate rather than on particle exchange. In the ``contaminant in condensate
effect,"" contaminants cause a potential in an otherwise uniform condensate,
forcing the condensate between two contaminants to a higher energy state. The
energy of the system decreases as the contaminants come closer together,
causing an attractive force between contaminants. It is proposed that
mass-energy may have a similar effect on Einstein's space-time field, and
gravity is quantized by the same method by which the contaminant in condensate
effect is quantized. The resulting theory is finite and, if a physical
condensate is assumed to underly the system, predictive. However, the proposed
theory has several flaws at high energies and is thus limited to low energies.
Falsifiable predictions are given for the case that the Higgs condensate is
assumed to be the condensate underlying gravity.

singularities, and in particular in the study of the Milnor fibration and the
motivic zeta function. We introduce the so-called analytic Milnor fiber
associated to the germ of a morphism f from a smooth complex algebraic variety
X to the affine line. This analytic Milnor fiber is a smooth rigid variety over
the field of Laurent series C((t)). Its etale cohomology coincides with the
singular cohomology of the classical topological Milnor fiber of f; the
monodromy transformation is given by the Galois action. Moreover, the points on
the analytic Milnor fiber are closely related to the motivic zeta function of
f, and the arc space of X.
  We show how the motivic zeta function can be recovered as some kind of Weil
zeta function of the formal completion of X along the special fiber of f, and
we establish a corresponding Grothendieck trace formula, which relates, in
particular, the rational points on the analytic Milnor fiber over finite
extensions of C((t)), to the Galois action on its etale cohomology.
  The general observation is that the arithmetic properties of the analytic
Milnor fiber reflect the structure of the singularity of the germ f.

errors for multiple hypothesis testing, especially when the underlying goal is
to attain one or more discoveries. Control of pFDR critically depends on how
much evidence is available from data to distinguish between false and true
nulls. Oftentimes, as many aspects of the data distributions are unknown, one
may not be able to obtain strong enough evidence from the data for pFDR
control. This raises the question as to how much data are needed to attain a
target pFDR level. We study the asymptotics of the minimum number of
observations per null for the pFDR control associated with multiple Studentized
tests and $F$ tests, especially when the differences between false nulls and
true nulls are small. For Studentized tests, we consider tests on shifts or
other parameters associated with normal and general distributions. For $F$
tests, we also take into account the effect of the number of covariates in
linear regression. The results show that in determining the minimum sample size
per null for pFDR control, higher order statistical properties of data are
important, and the number of covariates is important in tests to detect
regression effects.

is that the distribution crowds at the maximum entropy, if the upper bound is

that, for any physical quantity A, there is an arrow
$\breve{\delta}^o(A):\Sig\map\SR$, where $\SR$ is the quantity-value object for
this theory. The construction of $\breve{\delta}^o(A)$ is an extension of the
daseinisation of projection operators that was discussed in paper II. The
object $\SR$ is a monoid-object only in the topos, $\tau_\phi$, of the theory,
and to enhance the applicability of the formalism, we apply to $\SR$ a topos
analogue of the Grothendieck extension of a monoid to a group. The resulting
object, $\kSR$, is an abelian group-object in $\tau_\phi$. We also discuss
another candidate, $\PR{\mathR}$, for the quantity-value object. In this

non-relativistic Schroedinger theory. It applies the general ideas of part I
and tries to give a description of one-particle states on q-deformed quantum
spaces like the braided line or the q-deformed Euclidean space in three
dimensions. Hamiltonian operators for the free q-deformed particle in one as
well as three dimensions are introduced. Plane waves as solutions to the
corresponding Schroedinger equations are considered. Their completeness and
orthonormality relations are written down. Expectation values of position and
momentum observables are taken with respect to one-particle states and their
time-dependence is discussed. A potential is added to the free-particle
Hamiltonians and q-analogs of the Ehrenfest theorem are derived from the
Heisenberg equations of motion. The conservation of probability is proved.

  Scattering theory","42 pages, 2 figures, Latex",,,,"quant-ph",,"  This is the third part of a paper about non-relativistic Schroedinger theory
on q-deformed quantum spaces like the braided line or the three-dimensional
q-deformed Euclidean space. Propagators for the free q-deformed particle are
derived and their basic properties are discussed. A time-dependent formulation
of scattering is proposed. In this respect, q-analogs of the Lippmann-Schwinger
equation are given. Expressions for their iterative solutions are written down.
It is shown how to calculate S-matrices and transition probabilities.
Furthermore, attention is focused on the question what becomes of unitarity of
S-matrices in a q-deformed setting. The examinations are concluded by a
discussion of the interaction picture and its relation to scattering processes.
