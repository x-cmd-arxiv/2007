  is identical to version 1",,"10.1086/518214",,"astro-ph",,"  The globular cluster (GC) systems of many galaxies reveal bimodal optical
color distributions. Based on stellar evolutionary models and the bimodal
colors and metallicities of Galactic GCs this is thought to reflect an
underlying bimodal metallicity distribution. However, stars at many different
phases of stellar evolution contribute to optical light. The I-H color is a
much cleaner tracer of metallicity because it primarily samples the metallicity
sensitive giant branch. Therefore, we use deep HST-NICMOS H, and WFPC2 optical
observations, of M87 GCs to study their metallicity distribution. The M87
clusters are bimodal in I-H, for which there is no known physical explanation
other than a bimodal metallicity distribution. Moreover, the two modes defined
by the B-I and I-H colors are comprised of roughly the same two sets of
objects, confirming that optical colors also primarily trace the metallicity.
This is inconsistent with a recent suggestion based on one model of metallicity
effects on the horizontal branch that bimodality arises from an underlying
unimodal metallicity distribution due to a specific color-metallicity relation.
We also find no discernable variation in the peak colors of the M87 GCs out to
roughly 75 kpc due to the declining ratio of red-to-blue GCs, as implied by
this model. Similarly, there is no evidence that the bimodal peaks are bluer
for systems with large blue-to-red GC ratio. Our observations confirm that the
primary cause of bimodality in cluster systems is an underlying bimodal
metallicity distribution, and not the specific color-metallicity relationship
defined by this horizontal branch model.

The non-conservative gravitational potential of barred galaxies, or of
any other non-axisymmetric structure, produces a loss of energy in infalling
particles of the intergalactic medium into the galaxy, which are trapped in its
potential. This dynamical friction can contribute towards increasing the total
mass of barred galaxies.
  METHODS. Analytical calculations of the energy loss are carried out using the
orbits of the particles derived numerically. Theoretical predictions are
compared with observations through the statistical analysis of the rotation
curves of barred and non-barred galaxies, either in cluster or field galaxies.
  RESULTS. There is a net effect of accretion, but it is normally very low in
relative terms. It is only significant (>10% of the total mass of the dark
matter halo in the life of the galaxy) if the density of the intergalactic
medium is higher than ~3e13 Msun/Mpc^3 (or considerably lower in cases of
motions of the galaxies close to the IGM average motion, or perpendicular to
the plane of the galaxy, or when the halo mass is low).
  Data on rotation curves do not show clear trends towards higher halo mass for
barred galaxies, only slight trends for early-type spiral galaxies. In any
case, the statistical uncertainties are limited to the detection of differences
in masses >~20%, so the effect of bar-driven injection of intergalactic matter
into galactic halos might be present with relative contributions to the average
mass of these barred galaxies lower than 20%.

and what information about the thermal structure of the external layers can be
obtained from amplitude ratios and phase lags in Str\""omgren photometric bands.
We derive non-adiabatic parameters for delta Scuti stars by using, for the
first time, stellar models with the same treatment of convection in the
interior and in the atmosphere. We compute classical non-gray mixing length
models, and as well non-gray ``Full Spectrum of Turbulence'' models.
Furthermore, we compute the photometric amplitudes and phases of pulsation by
using the colors and the limb-darkening coefficents as derived from the same
atmosphere models used in the stellar modeling. We show that the non-adiabatic

- CW Tau, DG Tau, DO Tau, HV Tau C and RW Aur - were previously known to drive
only ""micro-jets"" or small-scale outflows of < 1' or 0.04 pc at the distance of
the Taurus-Auriga Cloud. We found that they drive outflows of 0.5pc - 1pc,
based on the morphology and alignment of newly discovered and previously known
HH objects with these sources and their ""micro-jets"". Here, we use a
cross-correlation method to determine the proper motions of the HH objects in
these five outflows (HH 220, HH 229, HH 702, HH 705 and HH 826 - HH 835) which
in turn allows us to confirm their driving sources. Moreover, the tangential
velocities of HH objects at large distances from their origin are currently
poorly known so these proper motions will allow us to determine how velocities
evolve with distance from their source. We find tangential velocities of
typically 200 kms^-1 for the more distant objects in these outflows.
Surprisingly, we find similar tangential velocities for the ""micro-jets"" that
are currently being ejected from these sources. This leads us to suggest that
either the outflow velocity was much higher 10^3 years ago when the more
distant objects were ejected and that these objects have decelerated to their
current velocity or that the outflow velocity at the source has remained
approximately constant and the more distant objects have not undergone
significant deceleration due to interactions with the ambient medium. Numerical
simulations are needed before we can decide between these scenarios.

maximum rotational velocity for the galaxy of v~212km/s corresponding to a mass
of 1.14x10^11 M_solar within 11 kpc from the center. By fitting single-age
spectral synthesis models to the stellar continuum, we derive a very young age
for the GRB site, confirmed by photometric and Halpha line measurements, of
around 6 Myr which corresponds to the lifetime of a 32 M_solar star. The
metallicity derived from several emission line measurements is lowest at the
GRB site with 1/5 Z_solar but roughly solar in the rest of the galaxy. Using
the 2dF galaxy redshift survey we can locate the host galaxy in its large scale

overdensity extending south west from the galaxy cluster Abell 3837 at

determining the systematic offset of each line relative to the average

Dec. 6, 2006 - Dec. 16, 2006. Using RF signals broadcast from: a) an englacial
discone, submerged to a depth of 100 meters and broadcasting to a surface dual
polarization horn receiver, and b) a dual-polarization horn antenna on the
surface transmitting signals which reflect off the underlying bed and back up
to the surface receiver, we have made time-domain estimates of both the real

complex ice dielectric constant. We have also measured the uniformity of ice
response along two orthogonal axes in the horizontal plane. We observe a
wavespeed asymmetry of order 0.1%, projected onto the vertical propagation
axis, consistent with some previous measurements, but somewhat lower than
others.

phi -> -phi symmetry of the inflaton potentials both for new and for chaotic
inflation.(ii)Trinomial new inflation naturally satisfies this requirement and
provides an excellent fit to the data.(iii)Trinomial chaotic inflation produces
the best fit in a very narrow corner of the parameter space.(iv) The chaotic
symmetric trinomial potential is almost certainly ruled out(at 95% CL).In tri-
nomial chaotic inflation the MCMC runs go towards a potential in the boundary
of the parameter space and which ressembles a spontaneously symmetry broken
potential of new inflation. (v) The above results and further physical analysis
here lead us to conclude that new inflation gives the best description of the
data.(vi) We find a lower bound for r within trinomial new inflation potentials
r > 0.016 (95% CL) and r > 0.049 (68% CL). (vii) The preferred new inflation

have anomalously large radii. It has been suggested that these planets are in a
resonance involving persistent misalignment and synchronous precession of their
spin and orbital angular momenta, a Cassini state, and that the attendant tidal
heating inflates the planet. We argue against this. Using explicit tidal
integrations, we show that although an oblique Cassini state can dissipate many
times the rotational energy of the planet, the rate of dissipation must be much
less than hypothesized. Dissipation causes the planetary spin to lie at an
angle to the plane containing the orbital and total angular momenta. If
dissipation is too rapid, this angle becomes so large that Cassini equilibrium
is lost. A separate consideration limits the total energy that can be extracted
from the orbit. The source of the torque on the orbit, either an oblique parent
star or an inclined third body, aligns with the orbit as it absorbs the angular
momentum shed by the planet. Alignment removes the orbital precession required
by the Cassini state. In combination with observational bounds on the mass and
semimajor axis of a possible second planet and with bounds on the stellar
rotation and obliquity, these constraints make it very unlikely that obliquity
tides can be the explanation for inflated hot Jupiters, especially HD 209458b.

Oscillations (QPOs) in the 30 - 2000 Hz frequency range, most of which
coincides with the bandwidth of the LIGO detectors. These QPOs, with
well-characterized frequencies, can plausibly be attributed to seismic modes of
the neutron star which could emit GWs. Our search targeted potential
quasi-monochromatic GWs lasting for tens of seconds and emitted at the QPO
frequencies. We have observed no candidate signals above a pre-determined
threshold and our lowest upper limit was set by the 92.5 Hz QPO observed in the
interval from 150 s to 260 s after the start of the flare. This bound
corresponds to a (90% confidence) root-sum-squared amplitude h_rssdet^90% =

in GW emission that we would expect to be able to detect. The above result
corresponds to 7.7e46 erg (= 4.3e-8 M_sun c^2), which is of the same order as
the total (isotropic) energy emitted in the electromagnetic spectrum. This

abundance in stars is not an easy task, relying mainly on high excitation lines
with non-negligible deviations from LTE. The 1082 nm sulphur forbidden
transition is less sensitive to departures from LTE and is less dependent on
temperature uncertainties than other sulphur lines usually employed as
abundance indicators. Therefore it should provide a more robust abundance
diagnostics. aims: To derive the solar photospheric abundance of sulphur from
the 1082 nm [SI] line and to investigate 3D effects present in G- and F-type
atmospheres at solar and lower metallicity. method: High-resolution, high
signal-to-noise solar intensity and flux spectra were used to measure the

results: The solar sulphur abundance is derived to be 7.15+- (0.01)stat +-
(0.05)sys, where the statistical uncertainty represents the scatter in the
determination using four different solar spectra and the systematic uncertainty
is due to the modelling of the blending lines. Sulphur abundances obtained from

  Age Distribution of Terrestrial Planets in the Universe","Submitted to ApJ",,"10.1086/522197",,"astro-ph",,"  The energy densities of matter and the vacuum are currently observed to be of
the same order of magnitude: $(\Omega_{m 0} \approx 0.3) \sim (\Omega_{\Lambda
0} \approx 0.7)$. The cosmological window of time during which this occurs is
relatively narrow. Thus, we are presented with the cosmological coincidence
problem: Why, just now, do these energy densities happen to be of the same
order? Here we show that this apparent coincidence can be explained as a
temporal selection effect produced by the age distribution of terrestrial
planets in the Universe. We find a large ($\sim 68 %$) probability that
observations made from terrestrial planets will result in finding $\Omega_m$ at
least as close to $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ as we observe today. Hence, we, and any
observers in the Universe who have evolved on terrestrial planets, should not
be surprised to find $\Omega_m \sim \Omega_{\Lambda}$. This result is
relatively robust if the time it takes an observer to evolve on a terrestrial
planet is less than $\sim 10$ Gyr.

two-component model of Compton up-scattering with a soft photon electron
temperature of about 0.4 keV, plus an Iron K-line. The results show a strong
correlation between spectral power law index and kHz QPOs. Because Sco X-1
radiates near the Eddington limit, one can infer that the geometrical
configuration of the Compton cloud (CC) is quasi-spherical because of high
radiation pressure in the CC. Thus, we conclude that the high Thomson optical
depth of the Compton cloud, in the range of ~5-6 from the best-fit model
parameters, is consistent with the neutron star's surface being obscured by
material. Moreover, a spin frequency of Sco X-1 is likely suppressed due to
photon scattering off CC electrons. Additionally, we demonstrate how the power
spectrum evolves when Sco X-1 transitions from the horizontal branch to the
normal branch.

matter haloes, subject to the development of virial shocks. We find that a
uniform cosmological accretion turns into a rapidly varying disc buildup rate.
The generic sequence of events (Shocked-Accretion Massive Burst & Shutdown:
SAMBA) consists of four distinct phases: a) continuous cold accretion while the
halo is below a threshold mass Msh~10^12Mo, b) tentative quenching of gas
supply for ~2Gyr, starting once the halo is ~Msh and growing a rapidly
expanding shock, c) a massive burst due to the big crunch of ~10^11Mo gas in
\~0.5Gyr, when the heated gas cools and joins new infalling gas, and d) a
long-term shutdown, enhanced by a temporary shock instability in late SAMBAs,
those that quench at z~2, burst at z~1 and end up quenched in 10^12-13Mo haloes
today. These events occur at all redshifts in galaxies of baryonic mass
\~10^11Mo and involve a substantial fraction of this mass. They arise from
rather smooth accretion, or minor mergers, which, unlike major mergers, may
leave the disc intact while being built in a rapid pace. The early bursts match
observed maximum starbursting discs at z>~2, predicted to reside in <~10^13Mo
haloes. The late bursts resemble discy LIRGs at z<~1. The tentative quenching
gives rise to a substantial population of ~10^11Mo galaxies with a strongly
suppressed star-formation rate at z~1-3. The predicted long-term shutdown leads
to red & dead galaxies in groups. A complete shutdown in more massive clusters
requires an additional quenching mechanism, as may be provided by clumpy
accretion. Alternatively, the SAMBA bursts may trigger the AGN activity that
couples to the hot gas above Msh and helps the required quenching. The SAMBA
phenomenon is yet to be investigated using cosmological simulations.

stars close to the centres of a large fraction of these shells in recent
observations of the SMC. Using Fabry-Perot scanned Halpha emission line mapping
of nearby galaxy discs we have detected, in all the HII regions where the
observations yield sufficient angular resolution and S:N ratio, dominant Halpha
shells with radii a few tens of pc, expanding at velocities of 50-100kms-1. We
have applied a simple dynamically consistent framework in which we can
extrapolate the properties of the observed Halpha shells to a few 10^7yr after
the formation of the OB stars. The framework includes the dynamical inputs of
both winds and SNe on the surrounding ISM. The results give quantitative
statistical support to the hypothesis that the Halpha emitting shells are
generic progenitors of the HI shells. During the time taken for an expanding
shell to reach the size of a typical HI shell, the OB association may well lose
its most luminous stars so the absence of such stars near the centres of many
of the HI shells is well explained in this scenario.

scattering problem for line transfer is solved via means of an operator

long-characteristics method. The approximate $\Lambda$ operator is constructed
considering nearest neighbors {\em exactly}. The code is parallelized over both
wavelength and solid angle using the MPI library. We present the results of
several test cases with different values of the thermalization parameter and
two choices for the temperature structure. The results are directly compared to
1D spherical tests. With our current grid setup the interior resolution is much
lower in 3D than in 1D, nevertheless the 3D results agree very well with the
well-tested 1D calculations. We show that with relatively simple
parallelization that the code scales to very large number of processors which
is mandatory for practical applications. Advances in modern computers will make

measurements of individual element abundances for a subsample of 86
slightly-absorbed and bright X-ray sources, using low resolution X-ray spectra
obtained from the Chandra ACIS instrument. The X-ray emission originates from a
plasma with temperatures and elemental abundances very similar to those of
active coronae in older stars. A clear pattern of abundances vs. First
Ionization Potential (FIP) is evident if solar photospheric abundances are
assumed as reference. The results are validated by extensive simulations. The
observed abundance distributions are compatible with a single pattern of
abundances for all stars, although a weak dependence on flare loop size may be
present. The abundance of calcium is the only one which appears to vary
substantially between stars, but this quantity is affected by relatively large
uncertainties. The ensemble properties of the X-ray bright COUP sources confirm
that the iron in the emitting plasma is underabundant with respect to both the
solar composition and to the average stellar photospheric values. Comparison of
the present plasma abundances with those of the stellar photospheres and those
of the gaseous component of the nebula, indicates a good agreement for all the

simulation to investigate the dependence of halo properties on the environment
at $z=0$. The study is carried out using samples of haloes at different
distances from their nearest massive {\em cluster} halo. We find that the
fraction of haloes with substructure typically increases in high density
regions. The halo mean axial ratio $<c/a>$ also increases in overdense regions,
a fact which is true for the whole range of halo mass studied. This can be
explained as a reflection of an earlier halo formation time in high-density
regions, which gives haloes more time to evolve and become more spherical.
Moreover, this interpretation is supported by the fact that, at a given
halo-cluster distance, haloes with substructure are more elongated than their
equal mass counterparts with no substructure, reflecting that the virialization
(and thus sphericalization) process is interrupted by merger events. The
velocity dispersion of low mass haloes with strong substructure shows a
significant increase near massive clusters with respect to equal mass haloes
with low-levels of substructure or with haloes found in low-density
environments. The alignment signal between the shape and the velocity ellipsoid
principal axes decreases going from lower to higher density regions, while such
an alignment is stronger for haloes without substructure. We also find, in
agreement with other studies, a tendency of halo major axes to be aligned and
of minor axes to lie roughly perpendicular with the orientation of the filament
within which the halo is embedded, an effect which is stronger in the proximity
of the massive clusters.

Hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRB) are strongly correlated. In particular, it has
been shown that low frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) frequency -
photon index correlation curves have a specific pattern. In a number of sources
the shape of the index-low frequency QPO correlations are self-similar with a
position offset in the QPO frequency-Gamma plane. Titarchuk & Fiorito presented
strong theoretical and observational arguments that the QPO frequency values in
this QPO frequency-Gamma correlation should be inversely proportional to
M_{BH}. A simple translation of the correlation for a given source along the
frequency axis leads to the observed correlation for another source. As a
result of this translation one can obtain a scaling factor which is simply a BH
mass ratio for these particular sources. This property of the correlations
offers a fundamentally new method for BH mass determination in XRBs. Here we
use the observed QPO-index correlations observed in three BH sources: GRO
J1655-40, GRS 1915+105 and Cyg X-1. The BH mass of (6.3 +/- 0.5) M_Sun in GRO
J1655-40 is obtained using optical observations. RXTE observations during the
recent 2005 outburst yielded sufficient data to establish the correlation
pattern during both rise and decay of the event. We use GRO J1655-40 as a
standard reference source to measure the BH mass in Cyg X-1. We also revisit
the GRS 1915+105 data as a further test of our scaling method. We infer the
value of BH mass of (15.6 +/- 1.5) M_Sun in this source which is consistent
with the previous BH mass estimate in GRS 1915 of (13.3 +/- 4) M_Sun. We obtain
the BH mass in Cyg X-1 in the range (8.7 +/- 0.8) M_Sun.

Radio-engineering and Electronics of RAS (V.A. Volkov, S.A. Mikhailov, 1992),
studied experimentally in the papers of foreign investigations and called
inter-edge magnetoplasmons (IEMP). When the two-dimensional system is finite
and has the half-plane shape, the internal boundary becomes external and these
plasmons go over into the well-known edge magnetoplasmons. The existing theory
of edge and inter-edge magnetoplasmons is built with the neglect of spatial
dispersion of the conductivity. Here we attempt to derive and analyze the IEMP
dispersion equation involving spatial dispersion of conductivity. The inner
boundary is assumed to be a straight line at which the electron concentration
changes weakly but stepwise. The jump of the diagonal conductivity is
considered small compared with that of the Hall magnetoconductivity. The IEMP
frequency is small compared with the cyclotron frequency. The IEMP frequency as
a function of wavevector oscillates with the period determined by a ratio of
electron cyclotron radius to the plasmon wavelength. For long wavelengths, the
IEMP dispersion curve coincides with the known result.

of the spin-orbit, Zeeman, and electron-phonon interactions. The
singlet-triplet relaxation rates exhibit strong variations as a function of the
singlet-triplet splitting. We show that the Coulomb interaction between the
electrons has two competing effects on the singlet-triplet spin relaxation. One
effect is to enhance the relative strength of spin-orbit coupling in the
quantum dot, resulting in larger spin-orbit splittings and thus in a stronger
coupling of spin to charge. The other effect is to make the charge density
profiles of the singlet and triplet look similar to each other, thus
diminishing the ability of charge environments to discriminate between singlet
and triplet states. We thus find essentially different channels of
singlet-triplet relaxation for the case of strong and weak Coulomb interaction.
Finally, for the linear in momentum Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit
interactions, we calculate the singlet-triplet relaxation rates to leading

the finite temperature critical line and a quantum critical line running on the
zero temperature plane. The MQCP offers a marked contrast with the Ising
universality and the gas-liquid-type criticality satisfied for conventional
metamagnetic transitions. At the MQCP, the inverse magnetic susceptibility
chi^-1 has diverging slope as a function of the magnetization m (namely, | d
chi^-1/d m | -> infty) in one side of the transition, which should not occur in
any conventional quantum critical phenomena. The exponent of the divergence can
be estimated even at finite temperatures. We propose that such an

infinite sequences $S$ over a finite alphabet $\Sigma_m$ satisfying some given
condition $P$ on the asymptotic frequencies with which various symbols from
$\Sigma_m$ appear in $S$. When the condition $P$ completely specifies an
empirical probability distribution $\pi$ over $\Sigma_m$, i.e., a limiting
frequency of occurrence for {\em every} symbol in $\Sigma_m$, it has been known
since 1949 that the Hausdorff dimension of $X$ is precisely $\CH(\pi)$, the
Shannon entropy of $\pi$, and the finite-state dimension was proven to have
this same value in 2001.
  The saturated sets were studied by Volkmann and Cajar decades ago. It got
attention again only with the recent developments in multifractal analysis by
Barreira, Saussol, Schmeling, and separately Olsen. However, the powerful
methods they used -- ergodic theory and multifractal analysis -- do not yield a
value for the finite-state (or even computable) dimension in an obvious manner.
  We give a pointwise characterization of finite-state dimensions of saturated
sets. Simultaneously, we also show that their finite-state dimension and strong
dimension coincide with their Hausdorff and packing dimension respectively,
though the techniques we use are completely elementary. Our results
automatically extend to less restrictive effective settings (e.g.,
constructive, computable, and polynomial-time dimensions).

by a sum of a direct (or triplet) mass term and the conventional (type I)
see-saw term. Both versions of the see-saw mechanism explain naturally small
neutrino masses, but the type II scenario offers interesting additional
possibilities to explain large or almost maximal or vanishing mixings which are
discussed in this paper. We first introduce ``type II enhancement'' of neutrino
mixing, where moderate cancellations between the two terms can lead to large
neutrino mixing even if all individual mass matrices and terms generate small
mixing. However, nearly maximal or vanishing mixings are not naturally
explained in this way, unless there is a certain initial structure (symmetry)
which enforces certain elements of the matrices to be identical or related in a
special way. We therefore assume that the leading structure of the neutrino
mass matrix is the triplet term and corresponds to zero U_{e3} and maximal
theta_{23}. Small but necessary corrections are generated by the conventional
see-saw term. Then we assume that one of the two terms corresponds to an
extreme mixing scenario, such as bimaximal or tri-bimaximal mixing. Deviations
from this scheme are introduced by the second term. One can mimic Quark-Lepton
Complementarity in this way. Finally, we note that the neutrino mass matrix for
tri-bimaximal mixing can be -- depending on the mass hierarchy -- written as a
sum of two terms with simple structure. Their origin could be the two terms of
type II see-saw.

order of magnitude on the luminosity needed to achieve a given precision on the
Higgs mass, as compared to what can be obtained at \sqrt s=350 GeV, by running
near threshold. Since the recoil mass resolution near threshold is independent
of the Higgs mass, one can also access the Higgs width for masses above 170
GeV. This strategy of running just above threshold is also optimal to measure
or set upper limits on the Higgs invisible branching ratio. Two MSSM scenarios
are presented to illustrate the potential interest of an optimized recoil mass
resolution. A simplified description of the various experimental mechanisms
affecting this type of measurement is presented: detector resolution for
leptons and jets, luminosity and beamstrahlung energy dependence, initial and

particle physics is a long-standing puzzle. The recent discoveries from
neutrino physics suggests that the mixing in the lepton sector is large
compared to the quark mixings. To understand this asymmetry between the quark
and lepton mixings is an important aim for particle physics. In this regard,
two promising approaches from the theoretical side are grand unified theories
and family symmetries. In this note we try to understand certain general
features of grand unified theories with Abelian family symmetries by taking the
simplest SU(5) grand unified theory as a prototype. We construct an SU(5) toy
model with $U(1)_F \otimes Z'_2\otimes Z''_2 \otimes Z'''_2$ family symmetry
that, in a natural way, duplicates the observed mass hierarchy and mixing
matrices to lowest approximation. The system for generating the mass hierarchy
is through a Froggatt-Nielsen type mechanism. One idea that we use in the model
is that the quark and charged lepton sectors are hierarchical with small mixing
angles while the light neutrino sector is democratic with larger mixing angles.
We also discuss some of the difficulties in incorporating finer details into
the model without making further assumptions or adding a large scalar sector.

finite dimensional (unitary) $G$-representations and (unitary) isomorphisms.
Block sums provide this category with a permutative structure, and the
associated $K$-theory spectrum is Carlsson's deformation $K$-theory of G. The
goal of this paper is to examine the behavior of this functor on free products.
Our main theorem shows the square of spectra associated to $G*H$ (considered as
an amalgamated product over the trivial group) is homotopy cartesian. The proof
uses a general result regarding group completions of homotopy commutative
topological monoids, which may be of some independent interest.

First, Delaunay-like hypersurfaces, consisting roughly of a chain of
hyperspheres winding multiple times around an equator, are shown to exist for
all values of the mean curvature. Second, a hypersurface is constructed which
consists of two chains of spheres winding around a pair of orthogonal equators,
showing that Delaunay-like hypersurfaces can be fused together in a symmetric
manner. Third, a Delaunay-like handle can be attached to a generalized Clifford
torus of the same mean curvature. Finally, two generalized Clifford tori of
equal but opposite mean curvature of any magnitude can be attached to each

periodic media are determined both analytically and numerically in the context
of a two-dimensional nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation with a periodic
potential. Using multi-scale perturbation methods, envelope equations of
solitary waves near Bloch bands are analytically derived. These envelope
equations reveal that solitary waves can bifurcate from edges of Bloch bands
under either focusing or defocusing nonlinearity, depending on the signs of
second-order dispersion coefficients at the edge points. Interestingly, at edge
points with two linearly independent Bloch modes, the envelope equations lead
to a host of solitary wave structures including reduced-symmetry solitons,
dipole-array solitons, vortex-cell solitons, and so on -- many of which have
never been reported before. It is also shown analytically that the centers of
envelope solutions can only be positioned at four possible locations at or
between potential peaks. Numerically, families of these solitary waves are
directly computed both near and far away from band edges. Near the band edges,
the numerical solutions spread over many lattice sites, and they fully agree
with the analytical solutions obtained from envelope equations. Far away from
the band edges, solitary waves are strongly localized with intensity and phase
profiles characteristic of individual families.

by entropy and mutual information, depending on the number of outdegrees and
types of Boolean functions for the hub. With a large number of outdegrees, the
path length from the hub reduces as well as the effects of Boolean function on
the hub are more prominent. These results indicate that the hubs play important
roles in networks' dynamics and structural properties. By comparing the effect
of the skewness of the two different power-law rank distributions, we found
that networks with more uniform distribution exhibit shorter average path
length and higher event probability of coherence but lower degree of coherence.
Networks with more skewed rank distribution have complementary properties.
These results indicate that highly connected hubs provide an effective route
for propagating their signals to the entire network.

filaments show much slower evolution, and their morphology features multiple
connected drops. Measurements of filament thickness show two main temporal
regimes: flow- and capillary-driven. At early times both polymeric and
Newtonian fluids are flow-driven, and filament thinning is exponential. At
later times, Newtonian filament thinning crosses over to a capillary-driven

crosses over to a second type of flow-driven behavior, in which viscoelastic
stresses inside the filament become important and the decay is again
exponential. Finally, the polymeric filament becomes capillary-driven at late

polarization in cavity QED. It is observed that the quantum-state swapping
between a single-photon pulse and a $ \Lambda $-type atom can be made via
scattering in an optical cavity [T. W. Chen, C. K. Law, P. T. Leung, Phys. Rev.
A {\bf 69} (2004) 063810]. This swapping operates limitedly in the strong
coupling regime for $ \Lambda $-type atoms with equal dipole couplings. We
extend this scheme in cavity QED to present a more feasible and efficient
method for quantum memory combined with projective measurement. This method
works without requiring such a condition on the dipole couplings. The fidelity
is significantly higher than that of the swapping, and even in the moderate
coupling regime it reaches almost unity by narrowing sufficiently the
photon-pulse spectrum. This high performance is rather unaffected by the atomic
loss, cavity leakage or detunings, while a trade-off is paid in the success
probability for projective measurement.

We focus on such a BEC whose interatomic interaction strength is modulated

In the (classical) mean-field approximation it provides a rich mixed phase
space dynamics with regular and chaotic regions. By increasing the
kick-strength a bifurcation leads to the appearance of self-trapping states
localized on regular islands. This self-trapping is also found for the many
particle system, however in general suppressed by coherent many particle
tunneling oscillations. The tunneling time can be calculated from the
quasi-energy splitting of the corresponding Floquet states. By varying the
kick-strength these quasi-energy levels undergo both avoided and even actual
crossings. Therefore stimulation or complete destruction of tunneling can be
observed for this many particle system.

results are presented and from this a quantum version of the Strict Bounded
Real Lemma is derived. This enables a quantum version of the two Riccati
solution to the H-infinity control problem to be presented. This result leads
to controllers which may be realized using purely quantum, purely classical or
a mixture of quantum and classical elements. This issue of physical
realizability of the controller is examined in detail, and necessary and
sufficient conditions are given. Our results are constructive in the sense that
we provide explicit formulas for the Hamiltonian function and coupling operator

with system size (i.e., number of spins/qubits), which might limit the

(i. e., N p-level quantum systems), and the structure of their maximal sets of
commuting bases, follow a nice graph theoretical/geometrical pattern. One may
identify vertices/points with the operators so that edges/lines join commuting
pairs of them to form the so-called Pauli graph P_{p^N} . As per two-qubits (p
= 2, N = 2) all basic properties and partitionings of this graph are embodied
in the geometry of the symplectic generalized quadrangle of order two, W(2).
The structure of the two-qutrit (p = 3, N = 2) graph is more involved; here it
turns out more convenient to deal with its dual in order to see all the
parallels with the two-qubit case and its surmised relation with the geometry
of generalized quadrangle Q(4, 3), the dual of W(3). Finally, the generalized
adjacency graph for multiple (N > 3) qubits/qutrits is shown to follow from
symplectic polar spaces of order two/three. The relevance of these mathematical
concepts to mutually unbiased bases and to quantum entanglement is also
highlighted in some detail.
